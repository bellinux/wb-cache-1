25|$|The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{is adapted}} from the Inclusion of Others in the Self (IOS) Scale by Aron et al. (1992). The Allo-Inclusive Scale {{contains}} seven pairs of Venn diagrams that range in how far apart the circles are. In the first pair, there is no overlap <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> get to the second, or third pair, the circles begin to overlap more and more. In the last pair (the seventh pair) the circles completely overlap. Participants respond to eight items by choosing the pair of circles that best denotes their connection with that particular item. A sample item is “The connection between you and a wild animal (such as a squirrel, deer, or wolf).” There are also eight other items to this scale that assess how connected participants feel to people. This scale shows acceptable reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.75) and validity (correlations with concern for environment). This scale is not contaminated with social desirability biases. The NR scale, the Allo-Inclusive scale, and the CN scale are highly correlated with one another suggesting they {{are all part of}} the nature connectedness construct.|$|E

2500|$|AMM is a British free {{improvisation}} {{group that}} was founded in London, England, in 1965. The group was initially composed of Keith Rowe on guitar, Lou Gare on saxophone and Eddie Prévost on drums. The three men shared a common interest in exploring music {{beyond the boundaries of}} conventional jazz, {{as part of a larger}} movement that helped spawn European free jazz and free improvisation. AMM have never been well known to the general public, but have been influential on the field of improvised music. Most of their recordings have been released on Matchless Recordings, which was run by founding member and percussionist Eddie Prévost. In a 2001 interview, founding member Keith Rowe was asked if [...] "AMM" [...] was an abbreviation; he replied, [...] "The letters AMM stand for something, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> probably know it's a secret!" ...|$|E
2500|$|At age 81 Parks {{was robbed}} and {{assaulted}} {{in her home}} in central Detroit on August 30, 1994. The assailant, Joseph Skipper, broke down the door but claimed he had chased away an intruder. He requested a reward and when Parks paid him, he demanded more. Parks refused and he attacked her. Hurt and badly shaken, Parks called a friend, who called the police. A neighborhood manhunt led to Skipper's capture and reported beating. Parks was treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital for facial injuries and swelling {{on the right side}} of her face. Parks said about the attack on her by the African-American man, [...] "Many gains have been made ... <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can see, at this time we still have a long way to go." [...] Skipper was sentenced to 8 to 15 years and was transferred to prison in another state for his own safety.|$|E

2500|$|However, Peniston herself {{seemed to}} be not worried about losing her audience, when interviewed {{at the time of}} I'm Movin' On release by Billboard: [...] "When you're first coming out as an artist, many times label {{executives}} have their own vision for you. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> move forward, it's only fair that you begin determining your own direction. People will make the change with you as long as you’re honest about your craft and display a comfort for what it is that you’re doing," [...] two years later Peniston actually confirmed her doubts, after being questioned by the magazine: [...] "I can speak about this firsthand, believe me. Sometimes doing what you feel isn’t always accepted by the public. You’ve got to choose {{where you want to go}} and be consistent," [...] (said by the artist at the 5th annual Billboard Dance Music Summit that urged members of the dance music community to work together toward greater credibility, visibility and sales for the genre, held July 8–10 in 1998).|$|E
2500|$|To {{signify the}} character's 8 years living in America, Johnson was {{required}} to use an American accent while playing Vicki. She was given a voice coach and a sheet of American phrases to practice weekly. She commented, [...] "It is hard work, but it's becoming second nature now. As soon as I know that I'm Vicki, the accent just comes with it." [...] After 6 months in the role, Vicki dropped the American accent. Johnson explained {{the reason for the}} change in 2004: [...] "The producers knew that I had to have an American accent when I came into the show because my character had been living in America but it's not the kind of accent that you'd want to have for a long time on a show like EastEnders. It's not something that's going to fit in {{for a long period of}} time. What would have been perfect would have been to have it gradually fade out, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> film 8 episodes at a time, this would be nigh on impossible. The decision was made that in the story Vicki was coming to terms with the fact that she wanted to live in London so therefore she was going to make a conscious effort to fit in with everyone around her and blend in with London life." ...|$|E
2500|$|The soundtrack also {{received}} positive critical responses. The Hindu {{commented on the}} album that [...] "With its blend of melody, trance and rhythm, Enthiran – The Robot sounds like a winner". Chennai online stated that [...] "The entire album gives an upbeat electro sense and wings to our imaginations. The music is convinced to grow on you, if not an instant hit." [...] A review by Music Aloud said, [...] "While the soundtrack of Enthiran has enough fodder to delight a connoisseur, {{it remains to be}} seen how much its sophistication will appeal to the masses, who are after all Rajinikanth's primary target." [...] Behindwoods reviewed the music saying, [...] "Yes, it exasperates you when you listen for the first time. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> listen again, you realize that though Rahman gives this album a crisp metallic touch in keeping with the theme of the story, he still remains faithful to his Carnatic roots in a touching way. Watch how cleverly he varies the feel of the normal duets and robo-based duets. The lyrics are interesting too. If the listener shakes off his conditioned thinking while listening to this album, he is in for a treat." [...] Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff commented that, [...] "Enthiran is, in fact, a perfect superstar album. Where the collection does manage to veer from the usual, Rahman has managed to add his own quirky, creative notes to the songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Josephus {{wrote that}} [...] "Moses {{went up to}} a {{mountain}} that lay between Egypt and Arabia, which was called Sinai." [...] Josephus says that Sinai is [...] "the highest of all the mountains thereabout," [...] and is [...] "the highest of all the mountains that are in that country, and is not only very difficult to be ascended by men, on account of its vast altitude {{but because of the}} sharpness of its precipices". The traditional Mount Sinai, located in the Sinai Peninsula, is actually the name of a collection of peaks, sometimes referred to as the Holy Mountain peaks [...] which consist of Jebel Musa, Mount Catherine and Ras Sufsafeh. Etheria (circa 4th century CE) wrote, [...] "The whole mountain group looks {{as if it were a}} single peak, <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> enter the group, [...] there are more than one." [...] The highest mountain peak is Mount Catherine, rising [...] above the sea and its sister peak, Jebel Musa (...) , is not much further behind in height, but is more conspicuous because of the open plain called er Rachah ("the wide"). Mount Catherine and Jebel Musa are both much higher than any mountains in the Sinaitic desert, or in all of Midian. The highest tops in the Tih desert to the north are not much over [...] Those in Midian, East of Elath, rise only to [...] Even Jebel Serbal, [...] west of Sinai, is at its highest only [...] above the sea.|$|E

2500|$|The Los Angeles Times, The Atlantic, Slate, and Time all {{published}} opinion columns {{where the}} writer thought {{the incident was}} not getting as much media coverage as it deserved. Megan McArdle explains that she didn't cover it because it made her ill, but also how being pro-choice influenced writers saying [...] "most of us {{tend to be less}} interested in sick-making stories if the sick-making was done by 'our side,'" [...] saying, [...] "this story should have been covered much more than it was — covered as a national policy issue, not a 'local crime story.'" [...] Martin Baron, The Post’s executive editor, claims he wasn’t aware of the story until Thursday, 11 April, when readers began emailing him about it, saying “I wish I could be conscious of all stories everywhere, but I can’t be". [...] They ultimately decided that, in fact, the story warranted attention because of [...] "the seriousness and scope of the alleged crimes and because this was a case that resonated in policy arguments and national politics", adding “In retrospect, we regret not having staffed the trial sooner. <b>But,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> know, we don’t have unlimited resources, and [...] {{there is a lot of}} competition for our staff’s attention". He insisted that “we never decide what to cover for ideological reasons, no matter what critics might claim. [...] Accusations of ideological motives are easy to make, even if they’re not supported by the facts". The New York Times also acknowledged the lack of coverage and reported on the online campaign and subsequent increase in coverage of the case. While Powers' piece clearly sparked debate among journalists, Katherine Bindley also highlights contrasting views, as does Paul Farhi. [...] A column on Salon.com questioned whether the Gosnell case was an example of liberal media bias, saying that conservative media and politicians had also given little attention to the story until April 2013.|$|E
