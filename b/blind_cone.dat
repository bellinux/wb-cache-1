5000|$|Note: An {{example of}} an antenna <b>blind</b> <b>cone</b> is that of an Air Route Surveillance Radar (ARSR). The {{horizontal}} radiation pattern of an ARSR antenna is very narrow. The vertical radiation pattern is fan-shaped, reaching approximately 70° of elevation above the horizontal plane. As the fan antenna is rotated about a vertical axis, it can illuminate targets {{only if they are}} 70° or less from the horizontal plane. Above that elevation, they are in the antenna <b>blind</b> <b>cone.</b>|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, antenna <b>blind</b> <b>cone</b> (sometimes {{called a}} {{cone of silence}} or antenna blind spot) is the volume of space, usually {{approximately}} conical with its vertex at the antenna, that cannot be scanned by an antenna because of limitations of the antenna radiation pattern and mount.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} {{omnidirectional}} antennas {{is the very}} common vertical antenna or whip antenna consisting of a metal rod (often, but not always, {{a quarter of a}} wavelength long). A dipole antenna is similar but consists of two such conductors extending in opposite directions, with a total length that is often, but not always, a half of a wavelength long. Dipoles are typically oriented horizontally in which case they are weakly directional: signals are reasonably well radiated toward or received from all directions {{with the exception of the}} direction along the conductor itself; this region is called the antenna <b>blind</b> <b>cone</b> or null.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that T. europaea does have {{photopic}} vision, {{contrary to popular belief}} that all moles are <b>blind.</b> Two <b>cone</b> opsins have been found in the eyes of T. europaea but their function is still under investigation. In a study of the mole eyes it was found that Talpa withdraws when exposed to a flashlight and it can also perform light/dark discrimination tasks. The cone cells in the eye are unlikely to provide high-resolution vision but they could allow a detection of movement and some hue discrimination. It is suggested that in subterranean mammals vision is used to detect predators that have broken into the tunnels.|$|R
40|$|Sharks are apex predators, {{and their}} {{evolutionary}} success {{is in part}} due to an impressive array of sensory systems, including vision. The eyes of sharks are well developed and function over a wide range of light levels. However, whilst close relatives of the sharks—the rays and chimaeras—are known to have the potential for colour vision, an evolutionary trait thought to provide distinct survival advantages, evidence for colour vision in sharks remains equivocal. Using single-receptor microspectrophotometry, we measured the absorbance spectra of visual pigments located in the retinal photoreceptors of 17 species of shark. We show that, while the spectral tuning of the rod (wavelength of maximum absorbance, λmax 484 – 518 nm) and cone (λmax 532 – 561 nm) visual pigments varies between species, each shark has only a single long-wavelength-sensitive cone type. This suggests that sharks may be cone monochromats and, therefore, potentially colour <b>blind.</b> Whilst <b>cone</b> monochromacy on land is rare, it may be a common strategy in the marine environment: many aquatic mammals (whales, dolphins and seals) also possess only a single, green-sensitive cone type. It appears that both sharks and marine mammals may have arrived at the same visual design by convergent evolution. The spectral tuning of the rod and cone pigments of sharks is also discussed in relation to their visual ecology. 9 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|The antenna <b>blind</b> <b>cone</b> is also {{referred}} to as the cone of silence, especially in America. This term is also used for weather radars. NEXRAD radars make two-dimensional scans at varying angles ranging from 0.5° above level to 19.5° above level (during a significant weather event). These levels become much closer to the ground, and closer to each other, as they get closer to the radar site, rendering them of little use for the three-dimensional profiling such multi-level scanning is meant to provide. Thus, a weather event located very close to and/or directly overhead of the radar site will be mostly situated in the [...] "cone of silence." [...] This {{is part of the reason}} why most U.S. weather radars partially overlap each other's territories.|$|E
