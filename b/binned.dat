5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was <b>binned.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following {{a dispute}} between the English clubs and European Cup organisers there was no English {{involvement}} in the 1998-99 Heineken Cup; this led to an expanded Premiership of 14 clubs and 28 games. Tigers started the new season well with a 49-15 win against Harlequins and wins against London Scottish, Northampton and Bedford to see Tigers top {{the table at the}} end of September. Losses against Saracens and London Irish in rounds 5 & 7 saw Tigers slip to 3rd in October; Leicester regained the lead in the table after victories against Richmond and West Hartlepool and were never to lose it despite a loss to Wasps two weeks later. Dreams of the double were dashed by Richmond in the quarter finals of the cup, Johnson received a white card (at the time signifying 10 minutes in the sin bin) and during his absence the Londoners scored their two tries in a 15-13 win. The next week Johnson was sin <b>binned</b> again, this time in a league match against closest challengers Northampton, but even with Pat Howard also sin <b>binned</b> and Leicester down to 13 men for a period so outstanding was Johnson's play they won 22-15. Mathematically Leicester's third English championship title was sealed in the penultimate match of the season away to Newcastle Falcons.

Processors are usually <b>binned</b> and selected to become a mobile processor by their ability run a given processor speed while supplied with a lower (than desktop) voltage. This results in lower power consumption, longer battery life, and reduced heat over using a normal desktop part.

25|$|A {{challenge}} {{most critical}} to analog IC design involves {{the variability of}} the individual devices built on the semiconductor chip. Unlike board-level circuit design which permits the designer to select devices that have each been tested and <b>binned</b> according to value, the device values on an IC can vary widely which are uncontrollable by the designer. For example, some IC resistors can vary ±20% and β of an integrated BJT can vary from 20 to 100. In the latest CMOS processes, β of vertical PNP transistors can even go below 1. To add to the design challenge, device properties often vary between each processed semiconductor wafer. Device properties can even vary significantly across each individual IC due to doping gradients. The underlying cause of this variability is that many semiconductor devices are highly sensitive to uncontrollable random variances in the process. Slight changes {{to the amount of}} diffusion time, uneven doping levels, etc. can have large effects on device properties.|$|E
25|$|Using several {{data sets}} (including {{breeding}} bird surveys from New York and Pennsylvania and moth collections from Maine, Alberta and Saskatchewan) Frank W. Preston (1948) argued that species abundances (when <b>binned</b> logarithmically in a Preston plot) follow a Normal (Gaussian) distribution, {{partly as a}} result of the Central Limit Theorem (Figure 4). This means that the abundance distribution is Lognormal. According to his argument, the right-skew observed in species abundance frequency histograms (including those described by Fisher et al. (1943)) was, in fact, a sampling artifact. Given that species toward the left side of the x-axis are increasingly rare, they may be missed in a random species sample. As the sample size increases however, the likelihood of collecting rare species in a way that accurately represents their abundance also increases, and more of the normal distribution becomes visible. The point at which rare species cease to be sampled has been termed Preston's veil line. As the sample size increases Preston's veil is pushed farther to the left and more of the normal curve becomes visible(Figure 6). Interestingly, Williams' moth data, originally used by Fisher to develop the logseries distribution, became increasingly lognormal as more years of sampling were completed.|$|E

500|$|Gene {{annotations}} {{provide the}} [...] "what", while measurements of species diversity provide the [...] "who". In order to connect community composition and function in metagenomes, sequences must be <b>binned.</b> Binning {{is the process}} of associating a particular sequence with an organism. In similarity-based binning, methods such as BLAST are used to rapidly search for phylogenetic markers or otherwise similar sequences in existing public databases. This approach is implemented in MEGAN. Another tool, PhymmBL, uses interpolated Markov models to assign reads. [...] and AMPHORA are methods based on unique clade-specific markers for estimating organismal relative abundances with improved computational performances. Recent methods, such as , use read coverage landscape of individual reference genomes to minimize false-positive hits and get reliable relative abundances. [...] In composition based binning, methods use intrinsic features of the sequence, such as oligonucleotide frequencies or codon usage bias. Once sequences are <b>binned,</b> it is possible to carry out comparative analysis of diversity and richness.|$|E

A few minutes later the Kangaroos had made their way deep into England's half when, on the last tackle, the ball was moved through the hands and eventually flicked passed back from Johns as he was being tackled to the feet of Brasher who kicked it ahead to the try-line. Both fullbacks then scrambled to get to the ball and the referee ruled that Brasher had grounded it, awarding Australia a try. Johns converted the try so Australia lead 8 – 16 with just over ten minutes remaining. England forward Karl Harrison then had to come off the field with an injured arm. A few minutes from full-time Australian forward Mark Carroll was sent to the sin-bin for an infringement in the ruck. The remainder of the match extended into additional injury time but was played with no further points so Australia retained the World Cup with an 8 – 16 victory and their fifth consecutive world title.|$|E
