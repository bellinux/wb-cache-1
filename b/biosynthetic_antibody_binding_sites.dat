This variable region fragment (Fv) analogue comprised the 26 - 10 heavy- and light-chain variable regions (VH and VL) connected by a 15 -amino acid linker to form a single-chain Fv (sFv). The sFv {{was designed as a}} prolyl-VH-(linker) -VL sequence of 248 amino acids. A 744 -base-pair DNA sequence corresponding to this sFv protein was derived by using an E. coli codon preference, and the sFv gene was assembled starting from synthetic oligonucleotides. The sFv polypeptide was expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli, using a leader derived from the trp LE sequence. The sFv protein was obtained by acid cleavage of the unique Asp-Pro peptide bond engineered at the junction of leader and sFv in the fusion protein [(leader) -Asp-Pro-VH-(linker) -VL]. After isolation and renaturation, folded sFv displayed specificity for digoxin and related cardiac glycosides similar to that of natural 26 - 10 Fab fragments. Binding between affinity-purified sFv and digoxin exhibited an association constant [Ka = (3. 2 +/- 0. 9) x 10 (7) M- 1] that was about a factor of 6 smaller than that found for 26 - 10 Fab fragments [Ka = (1. 9 +/- 0. 2) x 10 (8) M- 1] under the same buffer conditions, consisting of 0. 01 M sodium acetate, pH 5. 5 / 0. 25 M urea...|$|R

Con-siderable <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> activity by the group-specific determinant (a) was preserved after combined SDS and trypsin treatment but {{was released from the}} bulk of the radiolabelled protein; gel filtration indicated an approximate mol. wt. of 5 too to 15 ooo for the released <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> material. This material was precipitated by concanavalin A, suggesting the presence of carbohydrate. Its serological activity was remarkably resistant to boiling and to proteolytic digestion, but was partially sensitive to treatment with o-oi M-periodate orwith mixed carbohydrases and neuraminidase, and was greatly reduced by treatment with reducing agent. These data suggest that the stability of the a determinant is due to the structure of the <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> itself, rather than to involvement in the quaternary structure of the particle, and that intact disulphide bonds and carbohydrate, closely related to the <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site,</b> are necessary for the full expression of serological activity...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{modeling}} {{studies on}} antibody Fv regions have been pursued {{to design a}} second antigen-binding site (chi-site) in a chimeric single-chain Fv (chi sFv) species of about 30 kDa. This analysis has uncovered an architectural basis common to many Fv regions that permits grafting a chi-site onto the Fv surface that diametrically opposes the normal combining site. By using molecular graphics analysis, chimeric complementarity-determining regions (chi CDRs) were defined that comprised most of the CDRs from an <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> of interest. The chain directionality of chi CDRs was consistent with that of specific bottom loops of the sFv, which allowed for grafting of chi CDRs with an overall geometry approximating CDRs in the parent combining site. Analysis of 10 different Fv crystal structures indicates that the positions for inserting chi CDRs are very highly conserved, as are the corresponding chi CDR boundaries in the parent <b>binding</b> <b>site.</b> The results of this investigation suggest {{that it should be}} possible to generally apply this approach to the development of chimeric bispecific <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site</b> (chi BABS) proteins...|$|R

40|$|Sol-gel-derived {{mesoporous}} biomaterials {{were used}} {{for the first time in}} the flow-injection fluorescence immunoassay system. Anti-gentamicin antibody was immobilized in a mesoporous sol-gel material using tetramethoxysilane as a precursor and poly(ethylene glycol) as a template. The sol-gel glass was used to develop an immumoaffinity column for the flow-injection immunoassay of gentamicin. Little unspecific adsorption of gentamicin on the sol-gel and no antibody leaching under harsh elution conditions were found. The immunoassay is based on the competition between gentamicin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled gentamicin for a limited number of encapsulated <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites.</b> NaOH solution of 5 x 10 (- 3) mol/L is used for the regeneration of encapsulated <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> after each measurement, which allows the immunoreactor to be used for up to 20 times without any loss of reactivity. Sample preconcentration is not needed and a single assay can be performed within 10 min. The calibration for gentamicin has a working range of 250 - 5000 ng/mL with a detection limit of 200 ng/mL, which is close to that of the fluorescence immunoassay and fluorescence polarization immunoassay using the same reactants. Comparison of the results from this method with that obtained from HPLC showed an excellent correlation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|Pepsin is {{commonly}} used {{in the preparation of}} F(ab')2 fragments from antibodies. In some assays, it is preferable to use only the antigen-binding (Fab) portion of the antibody. For these applications, antibodies may be enzymatically digested to produce either an Fab or an F(ab')2 fragment of the antibody. To produce an F(ab')2 fragment, IgG is digested with pepsin, which cleaves the heavy chains near the hinge region. One or more of the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains in the hinge region are preserved, so the two Fab regions of the antibody remain joined together, yielding a divalent molecule (containing two <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites),</b> hence the designation F(ab')2. The light chains remain intact and attached to the heavy chain. The Fc fragment is digested into small peptides. Fab fragments are generated by cleavage of IgG with papain instead of pepsin. Papain cleaves IgG above the hinge region containing the disulfide bonds that join the heavy chains, but below the site of the disulfide bond between the light chain and heavy chain. This generates two separate monovalent (containing a single <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site)</b> Fab fragments and an intact Fc fragment. The fragments can be purified by gel filtration, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} surface {{structures}} of Ureaplasma urealyticum recognized by antibodies of patients during infection is the MB antigen. Previously, we showed by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis that {{any one of the}} anti-MB monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) 3 B 1. 5, 5 B 1. 1, and 10 C 6. 6 could block the <b>binding</b> of patient <b>antibodies</b> to MB. Subsequent DNA sequencing revealed that a unique six-amino-acid direct tandem repeat region composed the carboxy two-thirds of this antigen. In the present study, using antibody-reactive peptide scanning of this repeat region, we demonstrated that the amino acids defining the epitopes for MAbs 3 B 1. 5 5 B 1. 1 and 10 C 6. 6 are EQP, GK, and KEQPA, respectively. Peptide scanning analysis of an infected patient's serum antibody response showed that the dominant epitope was defined by the sequence PAGK. Mapping of these continuous epitopes revealed overlap between all MAb and patient polyclonal <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites,</b> thus explaining the ability of a single MAb to apparently block all polyclonal <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites.</b> We also show that a single amino acid difference in the sequence of the repeats of serovars 3 and 14 accounts for the lack of reactivity with serovar 14 of two of the serovar 3 -specific MAbs.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the expression of CD 38 on CD 8 + T lymphocytes of patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) caused by Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). CD 38 quantification technique chosen for this study was based on the enumeration of CD 38 <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> in comparison to the quantification standards rather than determining relative fluorescence, which is difficult to standardize. The study enrolled 19 patients with typical clinical and laboratory parameters compatible with EBV-induced IM as well as 10 patients with atypical clinical presentation of this disease. Furthermore, CD 38 expression was analysed in a group of 13 patients with IM caused by CMV infection. CD 38 quantification was performed within 6 days of the presentation of symptoms. All three groups of IM patients showed a statistically significant increase in the number of anti-CD 38 <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> (which correspond to the number of CD 38 molecules) on bright CD 8 + T lymphocytes compared to healthy controls. The numbers of CD 38 molecules expressed on CD 8 + T lymphocytes did not differ significantly between IM patients with typical and atypical clinical presentation of the disease. Patients with CMV-induced IM had significantly lower numbers of CD 38 molecules expressed on CD 8 + T lymphocytes. Therefore, we conclude that CD 38 quantification could be helpful in differential diagnostics of IM cases with atypical clinical presentation...|$|R

The antibody was incubated with VLB at a molar ratio (MR) of 1 : 1, and administered i. v. to rabbits. Control animals received either the MAb alone, or the MAb with VLB covalently linked (MR 1 : 1), or the parental anti-CEA with equimolar amount of VLB. Seven days later, the rabbit anti-mouse Ig primary response was measured, and found to be almost 55 % reduced in the animals that received the VLB 'loaded' MAb. In vivo kinetics and stability experiments revealed that the T 1 / 2 of the MAb was 68 +/- 5 h, whereas free VLB disappeared within minutes. It was concluded {{that as soon as}} the drug dissociates from the <b>antibody's</b> <b>binding</b> <b>site,</b> it is rapidly removed.

40|$|Carbohydrate-antibody {{interactions}} mediate many cellular {{processes and}} immune responses. Carbohydrates expressed {{on the surface}} of cells serve as recognition elements for particular cell types, for example, in the ABO(H) blood group system. Antibodies that recognize host-incompatible ABO(H) system antigens exist in the bloodstream of all individuals (except AB individuals), preventing blood transfusion and organ transplantation between incompatible donors and recipients. A similar barrier exists for cross-species transplantation (xenotransplantation), in particular for pig-to-human transplantation. All humans express antibodies against the major carbohydrate xenoantigen, Galα(1, 3) Gal (αGal), preventing successful xenotransplantation. Although <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> are precisely organized so as to selectively bind a specific antigen, many antibodies recognize molecules other than their native antigen. A range of peptides have been identified that can mimic carbohydrates and inhibit anti-αGal antibodies. However, the structural basis of how the peptides achieved this was not known. Previously, we developed an in silico method which we used to investigate carbohydrate recognition by a panel of anti-αGal antibodies. The method involves molecular docking of carbohydrates to antibodies and uses the docked carbohydrate poses to generate maps of the <b>antibody</b> <b>binding</b> <b>sites</b> in terms of prevalent hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions. We have applied this method to investigate peptide recognition by the anti-αGal antibodies.
