25|$|The {{reason why}} Disney wanted to merge Tokyo (which {{is where the}} comic book version takes place) with San Francisco was partly because San Francisco had not been used by Marvel before, partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> city's iconic aspects, and partly because they felt its {{aesthetics}} would blend well with Tokyo. The filmmakers' idea was that San Fransokyo {{is based on an}} alternate history in which San Francisco was largely rebuilt by Japanese immigrants {{in the aftermath of the}} 1906 earthquake, although this premise is never stated in the film.|$|E
25|$|The Argentine justice system, needing new leads <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{pressure}} that put {{on them to}} solve both bombings, ordered SIDE to find Mokhtari and bring her back to Argentina for interrogation.

25|$|Following the {{tradition}} of many pharaohs, the masterpiece of Hatshepsut's building projects was a mortuary temple. She built hers in a complex at Deir el-Bahri. It was designed and implemented by Senenmut at a site on the West Bank of the Nile River {{near the entrance to}} what now is called the Valley of the Kings <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> pharaohs who later chose to associate their complexes with the grandeur of hers.

25|$|Mireille {{spent all}} of 1966 and 1967 touring. It was then, during a car ride to another concert, that Stark advised Mireille that she was finally debt free, and worth {{more than a million}} francs ($200k USD in 1967). She had always prayed that she could get her family out of poverty, but the touring and singing were much more {{important}} at the time. In her autobiography, she stated her first major purchases were a vehicle for her father's business and a large home for her parents and siblings. Most importantly, she had a telephone installed for the family, so her parents no longer {{had to go to the}} pharmacy to talk to her while she was in Paris. Her one regret, was that she was unable to see her grandmother Germaine in the hospital before she died <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> tour contracts.|$|E
25|$|Philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677), who {{regularly}} cited De la Court's works, described in his unfinished Tractatus Politicus (1677) how the ideal state, a democratic republic, should function. According to Spinoza, kings {{have a natural}} tendency to pursue their own personal interests, and entrust large portions of power to confidants (who lack any official mandate, but often de facto run the country if the king is a weakling). These confidants are often noblemen, making it an aristocracy instead of a monarchy in practice. The best monarchy is a quasi-monarchy, a crowned republic in which princes have as little power as possible. Spinoza proposes a council of state, elected by citizens, to take the most important decisions, and replace the murderous and pillaging royal mercenary armies by an unpaid draft army of citizens that defends its own country for self-preservation. If this council of state is large and representative enough, {{there will never be}} a majority in favour of war, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> suffering, destruction and high taxes it will cause.|$|E
25|$|Although all-electronic {{color was}} {{introduced}} in the U.S. in 1953, high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) occurred on January 1, 1954, but over the next dozen years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. In 1956 NBC's The Perry Como Show became the first live network television series to present a majority of episodes in color. CBS's The Big Record, starring pop vocalist Patti Page, was the first television show broadcast in color for the entire 1957-1958 season; its production costs were greater than most movies were at the time not only <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> stars featured on the hour-long extravaganza but the extremely high-intensity lighting and electronics required for the new RCA TK-41 cameras. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, {{due in part to the}} color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that autumn. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.|$|E

Murray continued, [...] "Ordinarily I'd be griping that this episode was yet another mythology-free time-waster, with a plot that—two-foot-long parasites aside—could be passed along to any other procedural show currently on the air.

500|$|Although South Dakota {{does not}} have a state dog breed, it does list the coyote—a canine species related to the dog—as its state {{wildlife}} animals. In Minnesota, legislation has been proposed on six different occasions to adopt the eastern timber wolf as the state animal. In 2013, Colorado listed rescue dogs and cats as the state pet. California also recently named the [...] "shelter pet" [...] as its state animal, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> abandoned shelter pets each year.

500|$|Fear of a Black Planets {{success with}} critics and {{consumers}} {{was viewed as}} a significant factor to hip hop's mainstream emergence in 1990, which Billboard editor Paul Grein said was [...] "the year that rap exploded". In a July 1990 article, Kot compared Public Enemy's influence on hip hop with the album {{at the start of the}} 1990s to the impact of Bob Dylan, George Clinton, and Bob Marley on each of their respective genres and eras, having [...] "given it legitimacy and authority far beyond its core following". Chuck D later said of the album in retrospect, [...] "If It Takes a Nation was our 'nation' record, Fear of a Black Planet was our 'world' record". With respect to hip hop, the album was important in the field of sampling, as copyright lawyers took notice of The Bomb Squad's production and such a sample-heavy work would not be cost effective in the future. Chuck D later said of its sampling issues, [...] "We got sued for everything. We knew that the door on sampling was gonna close". Subsequent use of sampled material, particularly the use of whole songs on top of a beat, by other hip hop artists prompted stricter sampling laws. Fear of a Black Planet was the group's commercial apex, with sales dropping off for their subsequent albums. Chuck D said it was their most successful record, [...] "not <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> hype and hysteria. It was a world record. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> different feels and the different textures and the flow it had".|$|E
