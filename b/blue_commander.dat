A leader robo from each team goes inside their team's respective commander and all three commanders combine into Machine Commander, which is launched from the slinger catapult {{at the back of}} the base. If necessary, the launch of Machine Commander, including operation of the slinger catapult, can be done manually, as shown in episode 32. This is very tiring for those operating the catapult. If needed, Machine Commander Robo can into his rRobo Mode while it has a leader robo loaded in each commander. The command for this is [...] "Machine Commander! Leader Gattai Hajime!" [...] (lit. [...] "Machine Commander! Leader Combine begin!"). Machine Commander Robo can release the leaders it contains, although it is unknown how many can be released at one time. Machine Commander Robo can combine with V-Stealth Robo to become Machine Commander Robo V. His special attacks are Mighty Flash as Machine Commander Robo and Sprinkler Shield and Dual Tornado as Machine Commander Robo V.|$|E

40|$|Soviet Naval Force Control is {{the process}} that the Soviets use to control naval forces during {{execution}} of assigned missions, as well as create and maintain combat readiness and fighting efficiency. It is the underlying basis of the Red naval C 3 system; it provides control throughout a system composed of command posts, intelligence sensors, naval forces and weapons, and an interconnecting communications network. The concept of Soviet Naval Force Control and its support of the Red naval C 3 system is discussed in this thesis. Emphasis is placed on how the <b>Blue</b> <b>commander</b> can use this information to enhance his decision making process concerning the utilization of his own C 3 system. Major concepts examined in the thesis include Marxist-Leninist theory, Soviet military thought, cybernetics, and the Naval Force Control process. The assumption is made by the author that a <b>Blue</b> <b>commander</b> who is aware of and conversant with the major concepts presented in this thesis {{will have a better}} understanding of the Soviet approach to the C 3 process and how it affects Soviet actions. In turn, this understanding will increase his ability to control his own C 3 system and successfully achieve his goal in battle outcome. Theses. (fr) [URL]...|$|E
