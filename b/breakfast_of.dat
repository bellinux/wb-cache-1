The most popular Khuzestani dish is Ghalyeh Mahi, a fish dish that is prepared with heavy spices, onions and cilantro. The fish used in the dish is locally known as mahi soboor (shad fish), a species of fish found in the Persian Gulf. Other provincial specialties include Ghalyeh Meygu ("shrimp casserole"), ashe-mohshala (a Khorramshahri breakfast stew), sær shir (a Dezfuli <b>breakfast</b> <b>of</b> heavy cream), hælim (a Shushtari <b>breakfast</b> <b>of</b> wheatmeal with shredded lamb), and kohbbeh (a deep-fried rice cake with ground beef filling and other spices of Arabic origin, a variant on Levantine kibbeh).

25|$|Eventually Edmund, Lucy, Eustace, and Reepicheep {{the mouse}} reach the world's end, where Aslan {{appears as a}} lamb before {{transforming}} into a lion (a scene that refers to John 21:12, where Jesus appears after his resurrection and makes a <b>breakfast</b> <b>of</b> fish for his disciples). He shows Reepicheep {{the way to his}} country and helps the children return home. He tells Edmund and Lucy that, like Peter and Susan, they have become too old to return to Narnia, and that they must instead come to know him in their world—a relatively direct reference to the Christian theme of the series. He does not say whether Eustace will return to Narnia.|$|E
25|$|In exchange, two new free uses were {{included}} in the law in 1973. The first was a very broad free use permission allowing newspapers to reproduce any published report or scientific, artistic, literary, or oral work; either in the original or as a translation. This broad permission was exploited by some publications such as Literaturnaya Gazeta, which published on October 24, 1973 long translated excerpts of Marilyn, Norman Mailer's biography of Marilyn Monroe, and again on January 1, 1974 a large translated excerpt from <b>Breakfast</b> <b>of</b> Champions by Kurt Vonnegut. This practice caused sufficient negative publicity for the USSR in the West that Soviet publishers purchased the publication rights in Russian language on these works shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Paratha - A flat, layered bread {{made with}} ghee and {{generally}} cooked on a 'tava'. However, a 'tandoor' based version is also common in rural areas. Parathas {{are very similar}} to pastry dough. Parathas most likely originated in the Punjab, where a heavy <b>breakfast</b> <b>of</b> parathas with freshly churned butter and buttermilk was commonly consumed by the farmers to prepare themselves for the hard day of work ahead. However, parathas are now a common breakfast element across the country. Along with the plain layered version, many stuffed versions, such as 'Aloo ka Paratha' (Potato stuffed paratha), 'Mooli ka Paratha' (Radish stuffed paratha), and 'Qeemah ka Paratha' (Ground meat stuffed paratha) are popular.|$|E

He indulged in some bitter lamentations over modern <b>breakfasts</b> <b>of</b> tea-and-toast, which he censured {{as among the}} causes of modern effeminacy and weak nerves, {{and the decline of}} old English heartiness; and though he admitted them to his table to suit the palates of his guests, yet there was a brave display of cold meats, wine, and ale, on the sideboard.|$|R
25|$|Bells were vitally {{important}} to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, {{to call the}} Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells. The daily routine began with sunrise Mass and morning prayers, followed by instruction of the natives in {{the teachings of the}} Roman Catholic faith. After a generous (by era standards) <b>breakfast</b> <b>of</b> atole, the able-bodied men and women were assigned their tasks for the day. The women were committed to dressmaking, knitting, weaving, embroidering, laundering, and cooking, while some of the stronger girls ground flour or carried adobe bricks (weighing 55 lb, or 25kg each) to the men engaged in building. The men worked a variety of jobs, having learned from the missionaries how to plow, sow, irrigate, cultivate, reap, thresh, and glean. In addition, they were taught to build adobe houses, tan leather hides, shear sheep, weave rugs and clothing from wool, make ropes, soap, paint, and other useful duties.|$|E
500|$|Vonnegut's {{difficulties}} materialized {{in numerous}} ways; most distinctly though, was the painfully slow progress {{he was making}} on his next novel, the darkly comical <b>Breakfast</b> <b>of</b> Champions. In 1971, Vonnegut stopped writing the novel altogether. When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak's book American Literature on Stage and Screen, <b>Breakfast</b> <b>of</b> Champions was called [...] "funny and outlandish", but reviewers noted that it [...] "lacks substance {{and seems to be}} an exercise in literary playfulness." [...] Vonnegut's 1976 novel Slapstick, which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In The New York Timess review of Slapstick, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said Vonnegut [...] "seems to be putting less effort into [...] than ever before", and that [...] "it still seems as if he has given up storytelling after all." [...] At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors' complaints.|$|E
500|$|Le petit déjeuner (breakfast) is {{traditionally}} a quick meal consisting of tartines (slices) of French bread {{with butter and}} honey or jam (sometimes brioche), along with café au lait (also called [...] "café crème"), or black coffee, or tea and rarely hot chicory. Children often drink hot chocolate in bowls or cups along with their breakfasts. Croissants, pain aux raisins or pain au chocolat (also named chocolatine {{in the south of}} France) are mostly included as a weekend treat. <b>Breakfast</b> <b>of</b> some kind is always served in cafés opening early in the day.|$|E

However, Belknap, escorted by Interior Secretary Zachariah Chandler, rushed to the White House and met with Grant before his meeting with Representative Bass. Belknap appeared visibly upset or ill, mumbling something about protecting his wives' honor and beseeching Grant to accept his resignation [...] "at once." [...] Grant, {{in a hurry to}} get to a photography studio for a formal portrait, regretfully agreed and accepted Belknap's resignation without reservation.|$|E
500|$|In 1836 the Poor Law Commission {{distributed}} six diets for workhouse inmates, one {{of which}} was to be chosen by each Poor Law Union depending on its local circumstances. [...] Although dreary, the food was generally nutritionally adequate, and according to contemporary records was prepared with great care. [...] Issues such as training staff to serve and weigh portions were well understood. [...] The diets included general guidance, as well as schedules for each class of inmate. [...] They were laid out on a weekly rotation, the various meals selected on a daily basis, from a list of foodstuffs. [...] For instance, a <b>breakfast</b> <b>of</b> bread and gruel was followed by dinner, which might consist of cooked meats, pickled pork or bacon with vegetables, potatoes, yeast dumpling, soup and suet, or rice pudding. [...] Supper was normally bread, cheese and broth, and sometimes butter or potatoes.|$|E
500|$|In 1994, {{he had a}} {{supporting}} role as Butch Coolidge in Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed Pulp Fiction, which gave a new boost to his career. In 1996, he was the executive producer and star of the cartoon Bruno the Kid which featured a CGI representation of himself. That same year, he starred in Mike Judges's animated film Beavis and Butt-head Do America with his then-wife Demi Moore. In the movie, he plays a drunken criminal named [...] "Muddy Grimes", who mistakenly sends Judge's titular characters to kill his wife, Dallas (voiced by Moore). He went on to play the lead roles in 12 Monkeys (1995) and The Fifth Element (1997). However, {{by the end of}} the 1990s his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like The Jackal, Mercury Rising, and <b>Breakfast</b> <b>of</b> Champions, saved only by the success of the Michael Bay-directed Armageddon which was the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide. The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the PlayStation video game Apocalypse. In 1999, Willis then went on to the starring role in M. Night Shyamalan's film, The Sixth Sense. The film was both a commercial and critical success and helped to increase interest in his acting career.|$|E

500|$|Vonnegut was a vocal {{critic of}} the society in which he lived, and this was {{reflected}} in his writings. Several key social themes recur in Vonnegut's works, such as wealth, the lack of it, and its unequal distribution among a society. In The Sirens of Titan, the novel's protagonist, Malachi Constant, is exiled to one of Saturn's moons, Titan, {{as a result of}} his vast wealth, which has made him arrogant and wayward. In God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, readers may find it difficult to determine whether the rich or the poor are in worse circumstances as the lives of both groups' members are ruled by their wealth or their poverty. Further, in Hocus Pocus, the protagonist is named Eugene Debs Hartke, a homage to the famed socialist Eugene V. Debs and Vonnegut's socialist views. In Kurt Vonnegut: A Critical Companion, Thomas F. Marvin states: [...] "Vonnegut points out that, left unchecked, capitalism will erode the democratic foundations of the United States." [...] Marvin suggests that Vonnegut's works demonstrate what happens when a [...] "hereditary aristocracy" [...] develops, where wealth is inherited along familial lines: the ability of poor Americans to overcome their situations is greatly or completely diminished. Vonnegut also often laments social Darwinism, and a [...] "survival of the fittest" [...] view of society. He points out that social Darwinism leads to a society that condemns its poor for their own misfortune, and fails to help them out of their poverty because [...] "they deserve their fate". Vonnegut also confronts the idea of free will in a number of his pieces. In Slaughterhouse-Five and Timequake the characters have no choice in what they do; in <b>Breakfast</b> <b>of</b> Champions, characters are very obviously stripped of their free will and even receive it as a gift; and in Cat's Cradle, Bokononism views free will as heretical.|$|E
