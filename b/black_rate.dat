In 1880, for example, the white illiteracy rate was about 25% in Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama, South Carolina, and Georgia; and as high as 33% in North Carolina. This compares with the 9% national rate, and a <b>black</b> <b>rate</b> of illiteracy that was over 70% in the South.

5000|$|There is {{evidence}} that shows that racial inequalities affect various economic aspects of people's lives. In {{a study conducted by}} the Urban Institute, [...] "black homebuyers encountered discrimination in 22 percent of their searches for rental units and 17 percent in their efforts to purchase homes. For Hispanics, the figures were 26 and 20 percent." [...] African Americans and Hispanic people receive [...] "inferior health care" [...] compared to Caucasians when dealing with major health problems. This is why a study conducted in 1995, showed that the infant mortality rate was higher for black babies than it was for white babies. The <b>black</b> <b>rate</b> was 14.3 for every 1000 babies as opposed to the 6.3 for every 1000 white babies. Some research has shown that it is easier for white people to find employment than black people despite the white person having a felony.|$|E

Between 1980 and 2012, the total juvenile arrest rate decreased 59% for Asians, 55% for American Indians, 44% for whites, and 21% for black juveniles. In 2012, there were 3,362 arrests of white juveniles for every 100,000 white persons ages 10-17 in the population. In comparison, the Asian juvenile rate was about one-third (30%) the white rate, the American Indian rate was about 10% below the white rate and the <b>black</b> <b>rate</b> was {{more than double the}} white rate.

50|$|According to the US Department of Education, status {{dropout rates}} measure the {{percentage}} of individuals who are not enrolled {{in high school and}} who lack a high school credential, independent of when they dropped out. Status rates are higher than event rates because they include all dropouts in this age range, regardless of when they last attended school or whether or not they ever entered the US education system. In October 2001, about 3.8 million 16- through 24-year-olds were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high school. These individuals accounted for 10.7% of the 35.2 million 16- through 24-year-olds in the United States in 2001. In 1972, the white status dropout rate was 40% and the black status dropout rate was 49%. Because the <b>black</b> <b>rate</b> declined more steeply than the white rate, there has been a narrowing of the gap between the dropout rates for blacks and whites. However, this narrowing occurred in the 1980s, and the gap between whites and blacks has remained fairly constant since 1990. The percentage of Hispanics who were status dropouts has remained higher than that of blacks and whites in every year since 1970. Even though Hispanics represented approximately the same percentage of the young adult population as did blacks, Hispanics were disproportionately represented among status dropouts in 2001. Also in 2001, the status dropout rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders ages 16-24 was lower than for any other 16- through 24-year-olds. Specifically, the status rate for Asians/Pacific Islanders was 3.6%, compared with 27.0% for Hispanics, 10.9% for blacks, and 7.3% for whites.|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of October 2011, Argentina saw {{the emergence of a}} <b>black</b> market exchange <b>rate</b> for U. S. dollars. This <b>black</b> market exchange <b>rate</b> is known locally as the Dólar Blue. The importance of the Dólar Blue has become so public that it even has its own websites and social media accounts to inform its users of its daily rates as well as how and where to locate the human intermediary aspect of the black market known as the arbolitos. As a whole, <b>black</b> market exchange <b>rates</b> better reflect people’s expectations about the true purchasing power of their currency and the corresponding <b>rate</b> of inflation. <b>Black</b> market exchange <b>rates</b> also provide people with a source of dollars that allow them to avoid inflation taxes levied on domestic currency.

40|$|The {{etiology}} of chronic liver disease (CLD) and recent trends in CLD death in New Mexico and the U. S. were described in Part 1 {{of this report}} 1. As reported there, during the period 1981 - 2004 Hepatitis C (HCV) emerged as an important cause of chronic liver disease death, while excessive alcohol consumption remained {{the leading cause of}} CLD death in both New Mexico and the United States. Furthermore while total and alcohol-related CLD death rates declined significantly in the United States, New Mexico’s total and alcoholrelated CLD death rates increased significantly during this period. Marked demographic disparities in CLD death rates are an important aspect of the epidemiology of CLD. As reported by the NIAAA 2, U. S. CLD death rates declined from their peak age-adjusted death rate of 18. 1 per 100, 000 in 1973 to a rate of 9. 2 per 100, 000 in 2005. This 49 % decrease in the general population rate was exceeded by an even more dramatic decrease among Blacks (72 % among Black males, 77 % among Black females). As a result, Black rates that were twice White rates in 1973 are now less than White rates. The NIAAA doesn’t report American Indian rates and has reported Hispanic rates only since 1991. The NCHS began reporting American Indian rates in 1980 and Hispanic rates in 1985. During the period 1985 - 2005, U. S. CLD rates as reported by NCHS decreased by 27 % overall; but the American Indian rate decrease (19 %) was considerably less than the declines for Blacks (60 %), Asian/Pacific Islanders (39 %), and Hispanics (32 %). In 2005, the American Indian/ Alaskan Native rate (22. 6) remained the highest among U.
