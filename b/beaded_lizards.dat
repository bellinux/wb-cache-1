50|$|Varanoidea is a {{superfamily}} of lizards, {{including the}} well-known family Varanidae (the monitors or goanna). Also {{included in the}} Varanoidea are such extinct marine and semi-aquatic forms as mosasaurs and dolichosaurus, the venomous helodermatids (Gila monsters and <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards),</b> the Lanthanotidae (earless monitor lizards), and the extinct Necrosauridae.|$|E
5000|$|The Guatemalan <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (Heloderma charlesbogerti), {{also called}} the Motagua Valley <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard,</b> is a highly {{endangered}} species of <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard,</b> a venomous lizard endemic to the dry forests of the Motagua Valley in southeastern Guatemala, [...] an ecoregion known as the Motagua Valley thornscrub. It is the only allopatric <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> species, separated from the nearest population (H. alvarezi) by 250 km of unsuitable habitat. The Guatemalan <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is the rarest and most endangered species of <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> and {{it is believed that}} fewer than 200 of these animals exist in the wild, {{making it one of the}} most endangered lizards in the world. In 2007, it was transferred from Appendix II to Appendix I of CITES due to its critical conservation status.|$|R
50|$|Helothermine is a toxin {{found in}} the venom (salivary secretion) of the Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> Heloderma horridum horridum, {{one of the four}} {{subspecies}} of the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard.</b> Besides helothermine the venom of the Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> also contains at least three other toxins and several enzymes.|$|R
50|$|The Mexican <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> H. horridum {{is found}} in Mexico, from Sonora to Oaxaca. The Rio Fuerte <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (H. exasperatum) is found from {{southern}} Sonora to northern Sinaloa. The Chiapan <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (H. alvarezi) {{is found in}} the northern Chiapas and the depression of the Río Lagartero in Huehuetenango to northwestern Guatemala. The ranges of these three species overlap, making them sympatric. The Guatemalan <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> (H. charlesbogerti) is the only allopatric one, separated from the nearest population (H. alvarezi) by 250 km of unsuitable habitat. The Guatemalan <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is the most endangered of the species, if not of all lizards; it is found only in the dry valley of the Río Motagua in northeastern Guatemala; less than 200 are believed to exist in the wild.|$|R
50|$|Helodermatids (or <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards)</b> are large, stocky, slow-moving {{reptiles}} that prefer semiarid habitats. Their tails {{are short}} {{and used as}} fat storage organs. They are covered with small, nonoverlapping, bead-like scales, with osteoderms on the undersides of their bodies. Both species are dark in color, with yellowish or pinkish markings.|$|E
50|$|Although {{generally}} docile and inactive when handled, {{males are}} usually {{more aggressive than}} females when caught, and in one case a scientist received a deep bite in his finger. Unlike their relatives (<b>beaded</b> <b>lizards,</b> gila monster and some monitor lizards), there were no indication of venom in the bite, supporting earlier dissection studies where no venom glands or grooves in the teeth were found.|$|E
50|$|<b>Beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> {{are found}} in the Pacific drainages from {{southern}} Sonora to southwestern Guatemala and two Atlantic drainages, from central Chiapas to southeastern Guatemala. Their habitats are primarily in the desert, tropical deciduous forests and thorn scrub forests, but {{are found in}} pine-oak forests, with elevations from sea level to 1500 m. In the wild, the lizards are only active from April to mid-November, spending about an hour per day above the ground.|$|E

50|$|Lizard bites, unlike venomous snake bites, are not fatal. The Komodo dragon {{has been}} known to kill people due to its size, and recent studies show it may have a passive {{envenomation}} system. Recent studies also show that the close relatives of the Komodo, the monitor lizards, all have a similar envenomation system, but the toxicity of the bites is relatively low to humans. The Gila monster and <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> of North and Central America are venomous, but not deadly to humans.|$|E
50|$|The tongue can be {{extended}} outside the mouth, and is often long. In the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards,</b> whiptails and monitor lizards, the tongue is forked and used mainly or exclusively to sense the environment, continually flicking out to sample the environment, and back to transfer molecules to the vomeronasal organ responsible for chemosensation, analogous to but different from smell or taste. In geckos, the tongue is used to lick the eyes clean: they have no eyelids. Chameleons have very long sticky tongues which can {{be extended}} rapidly to catch their insect prey.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> {{have one}} close living relative, the Gila monster (H. suspectum), {{as well as}} many extinct {{relatives}} in the Helodermatidae, whose genetic history may {{be traced back to the}} Cretaceous period. The genus Heloderma has existed since the Miocene, when H. texana ranged over most of North America. [...] Because the helodermatids have remained relatively unchanged morphologically, they are occasionally regarded as living fossils. Although the beaded lizard appears closely related to the monitor lizards (varanids) of Africa, Asia, and Australia, the wide geographical separation and unique features not found in the varanids indicate the beaded lizard is better placed in a separate family.|$|E

50|$|Larger species, such as monitor lizards, {{can feed}} on larger prey {{including}} fish, frogs, birds, mammals and other reptiles. Prey may be swallowed whole and torn into smaller pieces. Both bird and reptile eggs {{may also be}} consumed as well. Gila monsters and <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> climb trees to reach both the eggs and young of birds. Despite being venomous, these species rely on their strong jaws to kill prey. Mammalian prey typically consists of rodents and leporids; the Komodo dragon can kill prey as large as water buffalo. Dragons are prolific scavengers, and a single decaying carcass can attract several from 2 km away. A 50 kg dragon is capable of consuming a 31 kg carcass in 17 minutes.|$|E
50|$|The Mexican {{beaded lizard}} (Heloderma horridum) {{is the most}} famous of the four species of venomous <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> found principally in Mexico and {{southern}} Guatemala. They and their congener (member of the same genus) the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) are the only lizards known to have evolved an overt venom delivery system. The Mexican beaded lizard is larger than the Gila monster, with duller coloration, black with yellowish bands. As it is a specialized predator that feeds primarily upon eggs, the primary use of its venom is still a source of debate among scientists. However, this venom has been found to contain several enzymes useful for manufacturing drugs in the treatment of diabetes, and research on the pharmacological use of its venom is ongoing.|$|E
50|$|While {{invertebrates}} {{are essentially}} {{immune to the}} effects of this venom, effects on vertebrates are more severe and varied. In mammals such as rats, major effects include a rapid reduction in carotid blood flow followed by a marked fall in blood pressure, respiratory irregularities, tachycardia, and other cardiac anomalies, as well as hypothermia, edema, and internal hemorrhage in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, eyes, liver, and kidneys. In humans, the effects of bites are associated with excruciating pain that may extend well beyond the area bitten and persist up to 24 hours. Other common effects of bites on humans include local edema (swelling), weakness, sweating, and a rapid fall in blood pressure. <b>Beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> are immune {{to the effects of}} their own venom.|$|E

50|$|Adult <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> {{range from}} 57 to 91 cm in length. They are {{substantially}} {{larger than the}} Gila monster, which only reaches lengths of 30 to 56 cm. The snout-to-vent length of a beaded lizard averages 33 to 48 cm. The average body mass of an adult beaded lizard is 800 g, about 45% heavier than the average mass of a gila monster, with large specimens exceeding 2000 g. Maximum weight known is 4000 g Although males are slightly larger than females, the lizards are not sexually dimorphic. Both males and females are stocky with broad heads, although the males' tend to be broader. The beaded lizard's scales are small, beadlike, and not overlapping. Except for the lizard's underside, {{the majority of its}} scales are underlaid with bony osteoderms.|$|E
5000|$|The earless monitor lizard was {{described}} in 1878 by Franz Steindachner. The genus name Lanthanotus means [...] "hidden ear" [...] and the species name borneensis refers to its home island of Borneo. The uniqueness of the species was recognized from the start and Steindachner placed it in its own family, Lanthanotidae. In 1899 George Albert Boulenger relegated it to the family Helodermatidae, together with the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> and gila monster. Further studies were conduced in the 1950s where {{it was found that}} although it is related to Helodermatidae, this relationship is relatively distant, the similarity is in part the result of convergent evolution and they should be recognized as separate families. Both are part of a broader Anguimorpha, but the relationship among the various families has been a matter of dispute. Several earlier studies have placed the earless monitor lizard together with Helodermatidae and Varanidae (true monitor lizards) in Varanoidea. More recent genetic evidence has found that the nearest relative of the earless monitor lizard is Varanidae. Most authorities continue to recognize them as separate families as the divergence between them is deep, but some have suggested that the earless monitor lizard should be included as a subfamily, Lanthanotinae, of the Varanidae. Together they form a clade and its sister group is Shinisauridae; at a higher level the sister groups of these three are Helodermatidae and others families in Anguimorpha. The most recent common ancestor diverged in the mid-Cretaceous.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{factors affecting}} shelter {{use by the}} Mexican Beaded Lizard, Heloderma horridum in a tropical dry forest of costal Jalisco, Mexico. Our study aimed to understand 1) how shelter (burrow) availability varies over the landscape, 2) if <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> choose to inhabit areas that have a high frequency of potential burrows, and 3) how the extreme seasonality of a tropical dry forest might influence microhabitat selection. We hypothesized {{that there would be}} a higher frequency of potential shelters in areas that had known beaded lizard use. To test our hypothesis, we ran transects near 10 known burrow sites (5 wet season and 5 dry season) and 5 areas with no known Heloderma horridum activity, recording all potential burrows within a meter of each transect line. We found that <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> tended to choose burrows with sediment roofs and floors, with the remaining potential shelters having tree root or rock components as well. Significantly more potential burrows were found in areas of known use (3. 0 shelters/ 80 m transect) than in non-site areas (1. 4 shelters/ 80 m transect). A chi-squared analysis showed that <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> also prefer burrows with a west-facing entrance, most notably for dry season sites. Our results suggest that shelters (burrows) may be a limiting habitat feature for <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> and that these lizards are selective in their choice of shelter sites, a result that may also apply to other species that inhabit tropical dry forests...|$|E

50|$|The venom glands of the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> are {{modified}} {{salivary glands}} {{located in the}} reptile's lower jaw. Each gland has a separate duct leading {{to the base of}} its grooved teeth. When biting, the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> hangs on its victim and chews to get its venomous saliva into the wound. Although its jaw grip is strong, its unsocketed teeth are easily broken off at their bases. The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard's</b> venom is a weak hemotoxin, and although human deaths are rare, it can cause respiratory failure. It consists of a number of components, including L-amino acid oxidase, hyaluronidase, phospholipase A, serotonin, and highly active kallikreins that release vasoactive kinins. The venom contains no enzymes that significantly affect coagulation. Almost all documented human bites (eight in the past century) have resulted from prodding captive lizards with a finger or bare foot.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard</b> is a {{specialized}} vertebrate nest predator, feeding primarily on bird and reptile eggs. A semi-arboreal species, {{it is found}} climbing deciduous trees in search of prey when encountered above ground. [...] It occasionally preys upon small birds, mammals, frogs, lizards, and insects. Steve Angeli and Robert Applegate, noted captive breeders of the <b>beaded</b> <b>lizard,</b> have remarked that captive specimens do best on a diet of small vertebrates primarily mice and rats. Confiscated wild-caught specimens {{can be made to}} feed by using egg on the prey item.|$|R
40|$|By {{shuttling}} between {{cool and}} warm patches in their habitat, reptiles can maintain stable {{as well as}} suitable body temperatures� 2 ̆ 2 {{this is known as}} active thermoregulation. Nevertheless, active thermoregulation is physically challenging and behaviorally expensive for medium to large reptiles (3 ̆e 500 g). We contrasted Mexican Beaded lizard body temperature management between the wet and dry seasons, in a tropical deciduous forest, near Chamela, Jalisco, Mexico. Animals were tracked using radiotelemetry and monitored for habitat use patterns and behavior. Implanted Thermocron ibuttonTM temperature dataloggers were used to record body temperatures at 15 minute intervals (n = 6 lizards). Body temperatures of active <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> were found to correlate strongly with concurrent ambient temperature, in both the dry and wet seasons, indicating a conformist strategy to thermal management. Yet, shelters occupied by <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> showed ambient temperatures close to this species preferred body temperature. Thermal selectivity in refuge choice, as well as temporal patterns of refuge use, enabled <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> to regulate body temperature tightly. For instance, 54. 4 percent of dry-season and 30. 4 percent of wet-season body temperatures fell between 27. 1 and 29. 9 ˚C, which agrees with this species preferred body temperature� 2 ̆ 2 27. 5 to 31. 25 ˚C (n= 5 lizards). Rather than actively thermoregulate, <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> seem to manage body temperature through careful refuge selection and activity scheduling. Furthermore, homeothermy achieved using this strategy can be held for many days, a level of thermal stability that is impossible to maintain through active behavioral thermoregulation...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal {{resource}} scarcity {{in the tropical}} deciduous forest (TDF) forces many animals, including <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards,</b> to take refuge in the soil for extended periods of time. To investigate which characteristics may be ideal when resources are less abundant, we measured soil characteristics in habitats used by Mexican Beaded Lizard’s (Heloderma horridum) in the TDF of Jalisco, Mexico. Utilizing a Brownian Bridge Kernel Density Estimation to identify activity centers in both wet and dry season sites, fourteen soil samples were collected in areas where <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> have been observed or had a high probability of being observed. The soil characteristics measured include soil permeability, percent water content, sediment size distribution, and color. Measured habitat characteristics include percent canopy cover, slope, and height of primary vegetation. All samples were collected and measured in the dry season, March 2014. Results indicate that dry and wet season soils differ in sediment size, slope, percent water, and color indicating that soil used in the dry season is different from soil used in the wet. Another notable observation was that all dry season sites had oxidized soil (determined by red color), whereas the wet season sites showed no pattern with respect to soil color...|$|E
40|$|A {{diverse group}} of {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates insulate themselves in subterranean refuges from variability and extremes found in above ground environments. However, {{little is known about}} the design of these burrows or the geological characteristics of the sediments into which they are excavated. Geological and design characteristics of Mexican beaded lizard wet and dry season burrows were compared at a field site near Chamela, Jalisco, Mexico. We assessed two hypotheses: 1) Ectothermic vertebrates are selective when choosing refuge sites; and 2) Ectothermic vertebrates choose particular burrow designs depending on season. At 10 sites previously used by <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> we collected sediment samples at the surface, 20 cm, and 75 cm depths. At 8 of these sites the previously or currently occupied burrow was located and excavated to examine the design of the burrow and to sample the chamber sediment. Sediment samples were analyzed for grain-size distribution, current soil moisture, and water-retention capacity. Burrow site selection was found to be systematic. Percent sediment moisture content was found to be higher at burrow sites as compared with two systematically placed transects. Dry-season burrows were longer, deeper and had a smaller diameter relative to wet-season burrows. Wet-season burrow sediments retained more water and had lower percent gravel content relative to dry-season burrows. These results emphasize the importance of certain burrow characteristics to the seasonal survival of <b>beaded</b> <b>lizards</b> and possibly other ectothermic vertebrate...|$|E
