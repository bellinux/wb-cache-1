25|$|The {{evolution}} of early reproductive proteins and enzymes is attributed in modern models of evolutionary theory to ultraviolet radiation. UVB causes thymine base pairs {{next to each}} other in genetic sequences to <b>bond</b> <b>together</b> into thymine dimers, a disruption in the strand that reproductive enzymes cannot copy. This leads to frameshifting during genetic replication and protein synthesis, usually killing the cell. Before formation of the UV-blocking ozone layer, when early prokaryotes approached the surface of the ocean, they almost invariably died out. The few that survived had developed enzymes that monitored the genetic material and removed thymine dimers by nucleotide excision repair enzymes. Many enzymes and proteins involved in modern mitosis and meiosis are similar to repair enzymes, and are believed to be evolved modifications of the enzymes originally used to overcome DNA damages caused by UV.|$|E

5000|$|Allotropy or allotropism (...) is the {{property}} of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical state, known as allotropes of these elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element; the atoms of the element are <b>bonded</b> <b>together</b> in a different manner. For example, the allotropes of carbon include diamond (where the carbon atoms are <b>bonded</b> <b>together</b> in a tetrahedral lattice arrangement), graphite (where the carbon atoms are <b>bonded</b> <b>together</b> in sheets of a hexagonal lattice), graphene (single sheets of graphite), and fullerenes (where the carbon atoms are <b>bonded</b> <b>together</b> in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The term allotropy is used for elements only, not for compounds. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is polymorphism. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same phase (i.e. different solid, liquid or gas forms); these different states are not, themselves, considered to be examples of allotropy.|$|R
25|$|Crushers {{may be used}} {{to reduce}} the size, or change the form, of waste {{materials}} so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or {{to reduce the size of}} a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated. Crushing is the process of transferring a force amplified by mechanical advantage through a material made of molecules that <b>bond</b> <b>together</b> more strongly, and resist deformation more, than those in the material being crushed do. Crushing devices hold material between two parallel or tangent solid surfaces, and apply sufficient force to bring the surfaces together to generate enough energy within the material being crushed so that its molecules separate from (fracturing), or change alignment in relation to (deformation), each other. The earliest crushers were hand-held stones, where the weight of the stone provided a boost to muscle power, used against a stone anvil. Querns and mortars are types of these crushing devices.|$|E
500|$|The {{atoms of}} carbon can <b>bond</b> <b>together</b> in {{different}} ways, termed allotropes of carbon. The best known are graphite, diamond, and amorphous carbon. The physical properties of carbon vary widely with the allotropic form. For example, graphite is opaque and black while diamond is highly transparent. Graphite is soft enough {{to form a}} streak on paper (hence its name, from the Greek verb [...] "γράφειν" [...] which means [...] "to write"), while diamond is the hardest naturally occurring material known. Graphite is a good electrical conductor while diamond has a low electrical conductivity. Under normal conditions, diamond, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have the highest thermal conductivities of all known materials. All carbon allotropes are solids under normal conditions, with graphite being the most thermodynamically stable form. They are chemically resistant and require high temperature to react even with oxygen.|$|E

2500|$|In 1985, Yes entered {{plans for}} their next studio album with Horn {{resuming}} his role as producer. Rabin felt nervous and pressured when their record label, Atco Records, informed him that they wished for another hit single like [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart" [...] was, but he wished {{to move from the}} band's past and do something different regardless of its success. At Rabin's suggestion, the band agreed to relocate to Lark Recording Studios, a facility situated by Castello di Carimate, a castle in Carimate, Italy. He thought that such a location would help the band <b>bond</b> <b>together</b> and bring some new ideas to the music which would create a better album as a result. Rabin first spoke of the friction between Anderson and Squire during this time three years after the album's release, which suited him as it [...] "created a great vacuum for me to work in". Squire maintained that Rabin made the choice to record there as a step to save money and for tax purposes, and called it the wrong move, a view that Rabin denied years later and clarified that [...] "It was never the intention to save money, although I don't want to waste money." [...] Squire recalled more time being spent on what recording equipment to use than the music itself during the entire project, which also affected the tense situation.|$|E

60|$|Lady Chiltern was {{probably}} right when she declared {{that her husband}} must {{have been made to}} be a Master of Hounds,--presuming it to be granted that somebody must be Master of Hounds. Such necessity certainly does exist in this, the present condition of England. Hunting prevails; hunting men increase in numbers; foxes are preserved; farmers do not rebel; owners of coverts, even when they are not hunting men themselves, acknowledge the fact, and do not dare to maintain their pheasants {{at the expense of the}} much better-loved four-footed animal. Hounds are bred, and horses are trained specially to the work. A master of fox hounds is a necessity of the period. Allowing so much, we cannot but allow also that Lord Chiltern must have been made to fill the situation. He understood hunting, and, perhaps, there was nothing else requiring acute intelligence that he did understand. And he understood hunting, not only as a huntsman understands it,--in that branch of the science which refers simply to the judicious pursuit of the fox, being probably inferior to his own huntsman in that respect,--but he knew exactly what men should do, and what they should not. In regard to all those various interests with which he was brought in contact, he knew when to hold fast to his own claims, and when to make no claims at all. He was afraid of no one, but he was possessed of a sense of justice which induced him to acknowledge the rights of those around him. When he found that the earths were not stopped in Trumpeton Wood,--from which he judged that the keeper would complain that the hounds would not or could not kill any of the cubs found there,--he wrote in very round terms to the Duke who owned it. If His Grace did not want to have the wood drawn, let him say so. If he did, let him have the earths stopped. But when that great question came up as to the Gartlow coverts--when that uncommonly disagreeable gentleman, Mr. Smith, of Gartlow, gave notice that the hounds should not be admitted into his place at all,--Lord Chiltern soon put the whole matter straight by taking part with the disagreeable gentleman. The disagreeable gentleman had been ill used. Men had ridden among his young laurels. If gentlemen who did hunt,--so said Lord Chiltern to his own supporters,--did not know how to conduct themselves in a matter of hunting, how was it to be expected that a gentleman who did not hunt should do so? On this occasion Lord Chiltern rated his own hunt so roundly that Mr. Smith and he were quite in a <b>bond</b> <b>together,</b> and the Gartlow coverts were re-opened. Now all the world knows that the Gartlow coverts, though small, are material as being in the very centre of the Brake country.|$|E

40|$|The optical {{method of}} caustics, {{as it has}} been {{developed}} by the author, was used {{for the study of the}} stress singularity at the singular corner of a bimaterial composite consisting of two materially dissimilar wedges <b>bonded</b> <b>together</b> along either one or two of their interfaces and submitted to any type of loading. The equations of the caustics were derived by putting the complex stress functions of the Muskhelishvili formulation of the plane stress problem in their asymptotic forms, which are valid at the close vicinity of the corner. By comparing the theoretically defined caustics to those obtained by the experiments the order of the elastic stress singularity in the particular cases studied was calculated. The following special cases were considered: (i) a homogeneous wedge with various values of its angle; (ii) Two dissimilar wedges <b>bonded</b> <b>together</b> along one interface to form any part of a plane; (iii) Two dissimilar wedges <b>bonded</b> <b>together</b> along both their interfaces to form a full plane; and (iv) Two dissimilar half-planes <b>bonded</b> <b>together</b> along their interface while an oblique crack is traversing either of the half-planes and terminating at the interface. The values of the elastic stress singularities, as they have been defined experimentally, corroborate the theoretical results. © 1975 Birkhäuser-Verlag...|$|R
