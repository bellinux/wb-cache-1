40|$|A dynamic scene and, therefore, its visual {{observations}} are invariably {{determined by the}} laws of physics. We demonstrate an illustrative case where physical explanation, as a vision prior, is not a commodity but a necessity. By considering the problem of ball motion estimation we show how physics-based simulation in conjunction with visual processes can lead to the reduction of the visual input required to infer physical attributes of the observed world. Even further, we show that the proposed methodology manages to reveal certain physical attributes of the observed scene that are difficult or even impossible to extract by other means. A series of experiments on synthetic data as well as experiments with image sequences of an actual <b>ball,</b> <b>support</b> the validity of the proposed approach. The use of generic tools and the top-down nature of the proposed approach make it general enough to be a likely candidate for handling even more complex problems in larger contexts. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ceramic balls {{have become}} an {{important}} component in advanced bearings, and the sphericity of balls is a key qualification focused in lapping process. An investigation {{on the effect of}} dynamic behavior of <b>ball</b> <b>support</b> system on the performance of ball lapping in rotated dual-plates lapping method is carried out. Sinusoidal waveform in terms of Fourier analysis is employed to express the shape error of the ball surface, and a dynamic model for support is setup. It is found with numerical calculation that the variation of lapping load lags behind the variation of the shape error for the damping of support. A lower natural frequency of the support system, higher spin speed of balls and a larger value of spin angle in RDP lapping are better to rectify the shape error of balls and reduce the lagged effect. It is concluded that dynamics of lapping system must be taken into consideration in order to understand comprehensively the spherical surface generation mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitive}} and quantitative measurement method {{will be important}} to evaluate the lubrication condition and to predict the remaining bearing life-time. Observations of the size and number of damage or wear particle, and the fluctuation of the ball load are useful for the quantitatively evaluation of operation abnormalities in a ball bearing. The vibration and AE (Acoustic Emission) method are usually used as the effective diagnostic technique. However, it is difficult to detect those items individually by these methods. Then, the ultrasonic technique was attempted to use as a semi-quantitative measuring method for sensing these quantities. Ultrasonic wave pulses are entered into a bearing housing from an ultrasonic probe attached to the outside of the housing. Those pulses are partially reflected from the interface between the housing and the outer ring of the bearing. Because of the different acoustic impedance between the solid-to-solid contact and the contact with an intervening gas or liquid layer, the height of the reflected echo depends on the real contact area or on the local contact pressure at the interface. In a normal condition, the height of the filtered echo pulses produces smooth, nearly sinusoidal peaks corresponding to passages of the balls. Semi-quantitative evaluation of abnormality becomes possible {{on the basis of the}} observation of magnitude and frequency of the echo height fluctuation. Diagnosis of bearing abnormality was performed as a standard of evaluation in size, fluctuation velocity and mode of echo height fluctuation. Then algorithms for the judgment of those abnormalities were added in diagnostic software, and abnormal width or fluctuation rate of <b>ball</b> <b>support</b> load were evaluated semiautomatically. As a result, the measurement of model indentation with 0. 3 mm width added to inner ring and the quantitative evaluation of growth of an indentation were enabled. 1...|$|E

50|$|The Coandă {{effect can}} be {{demonstrated}} by directing a small jet of air upwards at an angle over a ping pong ball.
