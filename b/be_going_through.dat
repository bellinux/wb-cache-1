5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> the living room wall.|$|E
500|$|Josephson {{was known}} at Cambridge as a brilliant, but shy, student. Physicist John Waldram {{recalled}} overhearing Nicholas Kurti, an examiner from Oxford, discuss Josephson's exam results with David Shoenberg, the reader in physics at Cambridge, and asking: [...] "Who is this chap Josephson? He seems to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> the theory {{like a knife}} through butter." [...] While still an undergraduate, he published a paper on the Mössbauer effect, pointing out a crucial issue other researchers had overlooked. According to one eminent physicist speaking to Physics World, Josephson wrote several papers important enough to assure him {{a place in the}} history of physics even without his discovery of the Josephson effect.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes began a {{relationship}} with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace). He proposed marriage to her, but she refused. Mercedes has sex with a stranger; Metcalfe remarked, [...] "Sex usually makes her forget about everything else that's going on. But afterwards she still can't stop thinking about Malachy, so she decides {{to go and see}} him to work out how she feels". Mercedes subsequently accepted Malachy's proposal and they marry. Mercedes found that she did not contract HIV from Malachy, but a Hollyoaks source described the news as [...] "bitter sweet" [...] because it was possible that her husband could die and leave her on her own. The source expanded on this, saying that if Mercedes had contracted HIV then the pair [...] "would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> everything together".|$|E

500|$|On December 7, while Hendrix and Levine were {{travelling}} by limousine to a New York {{airport for}} their flight to Toronto, Levine noticed that Hendrix was putting some personal items into his guitar case. Levine then {{reminded him that}} they would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> customs {{and that they had}} better not bring anything inappropriate. He reassured Levine, but as they approached their destination Levine confronted him: [...] "Jimi, I know you have something in that guitar case. I don't know what it is, and it's not normally my business to interfere, but I know we will be searched at customs." [...] Hendrix insisted that he had nothing to worry about, stating: [...] "Trust me, Bob, {{no one is going to}} recognize me", to which he replied: [...] "Recognize you? They will be waiting at customs for you." [...] Soon after their arrival at the Toronto airport, Hendrix was arrested by customs agents who found a capsule of an unknown substance in his guitar case. He spent the night in jail, waiting for it to be tested. Later that day, the Toronto police department dropped the charges when the pill was determined to be a legal medication.|$|E
500|$|Giuliani {{continued}} to ponder his senate race decision; {{when he had}} dinner with Nathan on May 12, they were trailed by a flock of photographers. [...] Giuliani canceled campaigning and fundraising trips to upstate New York and California on May 13, suggesting he would not run, but then resumed fundraising and suggested he was inclined towards running on May 15. [...] Two Republican county chairmen became upset at the indecision, saying, [...] "Like Waiting for Godot, we have Waiting for Rudy", and, [...] "We need a decision. Like tomorrow would be nice. Because this is getting ridiculous." [...] A top state Republican said, [...] "He seem to like the attention. He seems to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> some sort of catharsis in public. And we're like psychiatrists watching it. I can't quite figure it out. I don't think anybody can." [...] Clinton, meanwhile, said {{as little as possible}} about the situation, preferring to let Giuliani's drama play out on its own; on May 17, as he huddled with his doctors over whether to choose surgery or radiation as his treatment while facing conflicting political advice from his aides, she won the unanimous approval of delegates to the Democratic Party state convention at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, giving a constrained acceptance speech because she did not know her general election opponent.|$|E

2500|$|In September 1992, Speed was pivotal in Leeds' European Cup first-round tie against VfB Stuttgart.

Speed helped Leeds to a 4–1 victory at Elland Road, scoring one of them with a [...] "superb left-foot volley" [...] which he later {{described}} as his best ever goal.

2500|$|One {{night on}} tour in 1945, Tallchief was doing her barre when Balanchine remarked [...] "if only you {{would learn to}} do battement tendu {{properly}} you wouldn't have to learn anything else." [...] It {{was his way of}} saying she needed to start all over– battement tendu is the most basic ballet exercise there is. [...] "I wanted to die", she recalled. [...] "But I had seen the difference between Mary Ellen's [...] dancing and mine. I knew he was right." [...] Under the tutelage of Balanchine, Tallchief lost ten pounds and elongated her legs and neck. She learned how to hold her chest high, keep her back straight, and keep her feet arched. [...] "My body seemed to <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> a metamorphosis", she recalled. Tallchief relearned the basic exercises the way Balanchine wanted and transformed her greatest weakness–turnout–into a strength. Danilova devoted a lot of her time to instructing Tallchief in the ballerina's art, helping her transform from a teenage girl into a young woman.|$|E

2500|$|The public's {{reaction}} {{towards the}} documentary has been positive. MTV asked various fans in New York and Los Angeles, California {{what they thought}} about the film, a fan quoted, [...] "It made me love her even more," [...] Shanna Birnbaum, 23, told MTV News. [...] "I think she was very honest. She really let her true self shine through. It showed people and young girls you can get through anything." [...] Stacey Medura, agreed, adding that [...] "For the Record" [...] humanized the pop star. [...] "It's easier to understand how she feels," [...] Medura said. [...] "Her opinion matters most. I think she covered a lot [...]" [...] Some said this look into Britney's life was inspiring. [...] "I really have gained {{a lot of respect}} for her now," [...] Derek wrote. [...] "I felt like this was the first time since she burst onto the scene a decade ago that she has spoken from the heart. ...

2500|$|Following Jen & Parker's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Democracy" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, the couples were given the option of two punishments or prizes for the house, and had to attempt to answer in the majority; {{answering}} in the majority would give the couple a point, though the answer selected would impact the house. Chelsia and James were the winners. Shortly afterwards, James {{made a promise to}} Matt {{that he would not be}} nominated that week. On Day 15, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "What a Catch!" [...] food competition. For this competition, the couples split into two teams of three; one half of each couple held nets into the air, while the opposing team attempted to fill up their nets with dead fish. The last team remaining would be the winners, while the losers were on slop for the week. The team of Adam & Sheila, Alex & Amanda, and Chelsia & James were the losers, thus were on slop for the week. Later that day, Chelsia & James chose to nominate Alex & Amanda and Matt & Natalie for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Joshuah & Sharon were the couple selected to compete; Adam was selected to host. On Day 16, HouseGuests competed in the [...] "Communication Breakdown" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, the couples were required to find cables in a storage area packed among thousands of peanuts found in barrels; they then had to get the correct sized cables to connect their four electrical poles to their individual generator, and the first couple to finish were the winners. Joshuah & Sharon were the winners of the Power of Veto, and also earned the house information from outside the house. That night, Allison had an allergic reaction, while Amanda fainted and had a seizure due to low blood sugar. Both were medically evacuated from the house for the night, and returned the following morning. On Day 18, Joshuah & Sharon chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. Despite the house planning to evict Alex & Amanda, Allison later began convincing Joshuah & Sharon to evict Matt & Natalie from the house, feeling they were the stronger couple. Despite this being the plan, Allison informed Joshuah & Sharon minutes before the eviction that she and Ryan would not <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>through</b> with the plan. On Day 21, Alex & Amanda became the third couple to be evicted from the house in a unanimous vote of three to zero.|$|E
