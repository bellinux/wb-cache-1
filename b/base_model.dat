5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The <b>base</b> <b>model</b> AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a three-spoke steering wheel. The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} the {{feasibility}} of using visual and infrared imaging sensors {{to aid in the}} location of the aircraft position during operations such as landing in bad weather. The choice of the airport model used is crucial to algorithms which are used for position estimation based on pattern recognition. In this paper we describe the effects the choice of a model has on the behaviour of such matching algorithms. Three basic models are chosen: a line segment <b>based</b> <b>model,</b> an area <b>based</b> <b>model</b> and a texture <b>based</b> <b>model.</b> It is seen that a sparse line segment <b>based</b> <b>model</b> is not adequate to identify the runway since it matches a number of false artifacts in the image. An enhanced line segment <b>based</b> <b>model</b> containing a large number of features compares favourably with the area <b>based</b> <b>model.</b> The texture <b>based</b> <b>model</b> is seen to need a number of camera and weather dependent parameters and the performance of such a scheme is not seen to be substantially better.

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether European investment analysts prefer cash flow <b>based</b> valuation <b>models</b> over accrual <b>based</b> <b>models,</b> how accurate valuation models are {{and whether the}} use of cash flow <b>based</b> <b>models</b> (with or without accrual <b>based</b> <b>models)</b> improve forecast accuracy. We conduct a comprehensive content analysis of equity research reports {{for most of the}} firms on the components list of the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index. We find that earnings multiples and the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation models are the two most popular valuation models and the use of accrual based multiple alongside a cash flow <b>based</b> <b>model</b> improves the forecast error and this is in line with the intuition that accruals add value relevant information to cash flows. However, we also find that neither cash flow nor earnings multiples are superior to book value and return on equity (ROE) <b>based</b> <b>models</b> in terms of forecast error. Our results provide support for the use of book value and ROE <b>based</b> <b>models</b> which provide more precise forecasts and this, in turn, supports the use of accounting <b>based</b> <b>models,</b> i. e., a residual income model...|$|R
5|$|Later, Brown {{revised the}} {{phylogeny}} of Corythosaurus, {{and found that}} it was closely related, and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus. The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae, and the proportions of the limbs. During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately, and that birds, based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians. He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a <b>base</b> <b>model</b> to analyze which theory is more likely true. He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians, it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus. However, even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians, birds are now thought to have descended from the latter.|$|E
5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the <b>base</b> <b>model,</b> with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches, and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of the original Mortal Kombat and its initial sequels were created using digitized sprites mostly based on filmed actors, as opposed to drawn graphics. Early Mortal Kombat games were known for their extensive use of palette swap, a practice of re-coloring certain sprites to appear as different characters which {{was used for the}} ninja characters. In fact, many of the most popular characters have originated as simple palette swaps. In the very first game, the male ninja fighters were essentially the same character; only the colors of their attire, fighting stance, and special techniques indicated the difference. Later games added other ninjas based on the same model, as well as several female ninja color swap characters initially also using just one <b>base</b> <b>model</b> (beginning with Kitana in Mortal Kombat II). All of them gradually became very different characters in the following installments of the series.|$|E
40|$|Signal Integrity {{engineers}} are typically simulating systems using simulation models and measuring signals in systems using instruments. Often, during the design process, simulated models are replaced with measurement <b>based</b> <b>models</b> – those typically generated using a VNA or TDR. There is often confusion {{during this process}} for two reasons. First, the measurement <b>based</b> <b>models</b> often look different than the simulation models. Second, the measurement <b>based</b> <b>models</b> and simulation <b>based</b> <b>models</b> produce different waveform results in simulation. This {{is compounded by the}} fact that systems nowadays are usually differential. Engineers need some insight to validate measurement <b>based</b> <b>models.</b> This paper provides basic information on how to interpret s-parameter <b>based</b> <b>models</b> and how to create reasonable expectations on the measurement methods and on the models performance. It also provides methods to tie simulation and measurement together to validate models through time-domain co-simulation – the process of mixing real measurements and simulation techniques...|$|R

Agent <b>Based</b> <b>Modeling</b> {{has been studied}} in various academic disciplines. Areas such as sociology, psychology and public policy all have utilized this methodology. In actuarial science, researchers and practitioners have recognized {{the value of the}} method but still struggle with formulating a research problem where this approach can be used and implemented. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, agent <b>based</b> <b>modeling</b> lacks a sound theoretical formulation.

40|$|In general, {{time series}} is modeled as {{summation}} of known information i. e. historical information components, and unknown information i. e. random component.

40|$|Agent <b>based</b> <b>modelling</b> is a {{tool that}} has been {{successful}} in developing theories {{in a wide range of}} fields, but its application to social psychology is still in its infancy. This body of work applies the agent <b>based</b> <b>modelling</b> method to areas of social psychology including contact theory, group dynamics, altruistic behaviour and social identity theory. In each of these areas an agent <b>based</b> <b>model</b> is introduced that furthers the relevant theories and taken together these models demonstrate the effectiveness of some of the techniques outlined in existing research as well as producing a unique recommendation for the applications of agent <b>based</b> <b>modelling</b> in social psychology. In the fourth and fifth chapters three existing agent <b>based</b> <b>models</b> are extended in line with multiple identity theory and doing so produces novel results that improve upon the explanations of the original models. Therefore it is concluded that for agent <b>based</b> <b>modelling</b> in social psychology it is important to always consider the impact of multiple identities upon our modelling efforts rather than always simulating the minimum group identities necessary to test a hypothesis...|$|R
