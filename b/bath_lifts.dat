50|$|The ILAI Fund selects {{beneficiaries}} {{according to}} referrals {{from the social}} services. It provides children {{with a wide range}} of medical equipment such as wheelchairs, walkers, <b>bath</b> <b>lifts,</b> orthopedic shoes, splints and braces, diapers, eyeglasses, specialized computers, and hospital transportation costs. The fund also supplies special nutritional food, vitamins or medication that healthcare programs may not cover. The fund also arranges for physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and psychotherapy where needed. In addition, ILAI provides one-on-one caregivers and teachers. The ILAI Fund gives the children a chance to experience events that regular children take for granted, such as birthday celebrations, family outings, visits to zoos, parks and other recreational fun days. All these arrangements are possible with the help from the supporting donors.|$|E

40|$|Using the patch-clamp technique, we {{determined}} that beta-scorpion toxin 2 from Centruroides noxius Hoffmann decreased whole-cell n-type K+ currents in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, {{with a half}} blocking concentration of approx. 5 microM. Toxin- 2 -accelerated inactivation, however, did not influence the kinetics of activation of the K+ conductance. The percentage increase in K+ channel inactivation rate {{and the degree of}} drug-induced block was independent of membrane potential. K+ channel block by Toxin 2 was instantaneous, not removable by washing with drug free extracellular solution. However, 10 mg/ml BSA in the <b>bath</b> <b>lifted</b> the toxin-induced block almost instantaneously and completely. Flow cytometric membrane potential measurements with the oxonol dye showed that Toxin 2 depolarizes human lymphocytes in concert with its K+ channel blocking effectújratöltve - BIBFORM 00492...|$|R

50|$|Vitruvius {{described}} the many innovations made in building design {{to improve the}} living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost {{among them is the}} development of the hypocaust, a type of central heating where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of public baths and villas. He gave explicit instructions on how to design such buildings so fuel efficiency is maximized; for example, the caldarium is next to the tepidarium followed by the frigidarium. He also advised using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture, which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he did not suggest it himself, his dewatering devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel likely were used in the larger <b>baths</b> to <b>lift</b> water to header tanks {{at the top of the}} larger thermae, such as the Baths of Diocletian and the Baths of Caracalla.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{investigate}} {{the risk factors}} for low back pain in hospital nurses, with particular emphasis {{on the role of}} specific nursing activities. METHODS [...] A cross sectional survey of 2405 nurses employed by a group of teaching hospitals was carried out. Self administered questionnaires were used to collect information about occupational activities, non-occupational risk factors for back symptoms, and history of low back pain. RESULTS [...] The overall response rate was 69 %. Among 1616 women, the lifetime prevalence of back pain was 60 % and the one year period prevalence 45 %. 10 % had been absent from work because of back pain for a cumulative period exceeding four weeks. Rates in men were generally similar to those in women. In women back pain during the previous 12 months was weakly associated with height, and was significantly more common in those who reported frequent non-musculoskeletal symptoms such as headache and low mood. After adjustment for height and non-musculoskeletal symptoms, significant associations were found with frequency of manually moving patients around on the bed, manually transferring patients between bed and chair, and manually lifting patients from the floor. In contrast, no clear increase in risk was found in relation to transfer of patients with canvas and poles, manually lifting patients {{in and out of the}} <b>bath,</b> or <b>lifting</b> patients with mechanical aids. Confirmation of these findings is now being sought in a prospective study of the same population. CONCLUSIONS [...] This study confirms that low back pain is highly prevalent among nurses and is associated with a high level of sickness absence. People who often report non-musculoskeletal symptoms were significantly more likely to report low back pain. Specific manual handling tasks were associated with an increased risk of back pain; however, no such association was found with mechanised patient transfers...|$|R
