30|$|Biodiesel is {{renewable}} and environmental-friendly, {{and it is}} {{an ideal}} substitute for petroleum diesel. It was postulated that the world biodiesel market would reach 37 billon gallons by 2016 (Anand and Saxena 2011). Crude glycerol is the main by-product of biodiesel, and it will generate about 10 % (w/w) glycerol in the process of biodiesel production (Vivek et al. 2017). With the significant increase of biodiesel production, the price of crude glycerol decreased dramatically. Glycerol has higher reduced state comparing to sugars; in addition, the amount of cheap crude glycerol is abundant. Therefore, a series of sustainable processes were developed to convert glycerol to higher value products. Varieties of chemicals, such as 1, 3 -propanediol, citric acid, hydrogen, poly (hydroxyalkanoates), lipids, succinic acid, etc., can be produced from crude glycerol via <b>biological</b> <b>conversions</b> (Li et al. 2016, 2017 b; Wu et al. 2014; Vivek et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2012).|$|R

Chemoautotrophs, organisms that obtain carbon through chemosynthesis, are phylogenetically diverse, but also groups that include conspicuous or biogeochemically-important taxa include the sulfur-oxidizing gamma and epsilon proteobacteria, the aquificaeles, the methanogenic archaea and the neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria.|$|E

This process occurs via G-protein coupled receptors called opsins which contain the chromophore 11-cis retinal. 11-cis retinal is covalently {{linked to the}} opsin receptor via Schiff base forming retinylidene protein. When struck by a photon, 11-cis retinal undergoes photoisomerization to all-trans retinal which changes the conformation of the opsin GPCR leading to signal transduction cascades which causes closure of cyclic GMP-gated cation channel, and hyperpolarization of the photoreceptor cell.|$|E
30|$|Conventional secondary-treated {{municipal}} wastewater usually contains appreciable {{amounts of}} oxidized nitrogen and other nutrients, which pose {{a risk of}} eutrophication to receiving waters. Also, elevated nitrate concentrations were proved to have both lethal and non-lethal effects {{on a number of}} commercially relevant aquatic species (Hamlin et al. 2008). Denitrifying biological filter (DNBF) is extensively considered as an effective, economical, stable and feasible technology to control oxidized nitrogen from secondary effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants (Jeong et al. 2006). A DNBF performs the denitrifying function through <b>biological</b> <b>conversions</b> of organics and oxidized nitrogen in absence of oxygen by the biofilms attached on granular media, meanwhile achieves a physical removal of suspended particles by the media filtration. Denitrifying bacteria in the biofilm {{play an important role in}} transforming nitrate to nitrogen gas, while organic carbon as the denitrifying electron donor is a significant factor to perform a complete denitrification process.|$|R

To achieve this insight, in the trace metal dynamics in anaerobic granular sludge bed reactors is required.

40|$|Significant methane {{formation}} in sewers {{has been reported}} recently, which may contribute significantly to the overall greenhouse gas emission from wastewater systems. The understanding of the <b>biological</b> <b>conversions</b> occurring in sewers, particularly the competition between methanogenic and sulfate-reducing populations for electron donors, is an essential step for minimising methane emissions from sewers. This work proposes an extensionto the current state-of-the-art models characterising biological and physicochemical processes in sewers. This extended model includes the competitive interactions of sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogenic archaea in sewers for various substrates available. The most relevant parameters of the model were calibrated with lab-scale experimental data. The calibrated model described field data reasonably well. The model was then used to investigate the effect of several key sewer design and operational parameters on methane formation. The simulation results showed that methane production was highly correlated with the hydraulic residence time (HRT) and pipe area to volume (A/V) ratio showing higher methane concentrations at a long HRT or a larger A/V ratio. ª 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|Because HBCD has 16 {{possible}} stereo-isomers {{with different}} biological activities, the substance poses a difficult problem for manufacture and regulation.The HBCD commercial mixture {{is composed of}} three main diastereomers denoted as alpha (α-HBCD), beta (β-HBCD) and gamma (γ-HBCD) with traces of others. A series of four published in vivo mice studies were conducted between several federal and academic institutions to characterize the toxicokinetic profiles of individual HBCD stereoisomers. The predominant diastereomer in the HBCD mixture, γ-HBCD, undergoes rapid hepatic metabolism, fecal and urinary elimination, and <b>biological</b> <b>conversion</b> to other diastereomers with a short biological half-life of 1-4 days. After oral exposure to the γ-HBCD diastereomer, β-HBCD was detected in the liver and brain, and α-HBCD and β-HBCD was detected in the fat and feces [...] with multiple novel metabolites identified - monohydroxy-pentabromocyclododecane, monohydroxy-pentabromocyclododecene, dihydroxy-pentabromocyclododecene, and dihydroxy-pentabromocyclododecadiene. In contrast, α-HBCD is more biologically persistent, resistant to metabolism, bioaccumulates in lipid-rich tissues after a 10-day repeated exposure study, and has a longer biological half-life of up to 21 days; only α-HBCD was detected in the liver, brain, fat and feces with no stereoisomerization to γ-HBCD or β-HBCD and low trace levels of four different hydroxylated metabolites were identified. Developing mice had higher HBCD tissue levels than adult mice after exposure to either α-HBCD or γ-HBCD indicating the potential for increased susceptibility of the developing young to HBCD effects. The reported toxicokinetic differences of individual HBCD diastereoisomers {{have important implications for}} the extrapolation of toxicological studies of the commercial HBCD mixture to the assessment of human risk.|$|E
50|$|In {{situations}} lacking oxygen (a.k.a., anoxia), many cryptobionts (such as M. tardigradum) take {{in water}} and become turgid and immobile, but can still survive for prolonged periods of time just as with other cryptobiological processes. While survival rate studies of organisms during supposed anoxybiosis in anoxia have historically given some conflicting results, the current consensus is that certain ectothermic vertebrates and some invertebrates (for example, brine shrimp (Clegg et al. 1999), copepods (Marcus et al., 1994), nematodes (Crowe and Cooper, 1971), and sponge gemmules (Reiswig and Miller, 1998)) are capable of successfully surviving in a seemingly inactive state during anoxic conditions for periods of time ranging from months to decades. Studies of the metabolic activity of these idling organisms during anoxia have been mostly inconclusive, primarily due to the technical difficulty of measuring very small degrees of metabolic activity with enough reliability to conclusively prove a cryptobiotic state is occurring rather than just an extreme case of the metabolic rate depression (MRD) phenomenon exhibited by all aerobic organisms to some degree (typically 1-10% of aerobic levels) when exposed to anoxia. Thus, anoxybiosis is not considered a legitimate form of naturally occurring cryptobiosis by some comparative biologists because of these inconclusive and conflicting experimental results regarding whether a truly complete metabolic standstill actually occurs in cryptobionts during anoxic conditions, or if the metabolism is merely such {{a tiny fraction of}} the aerobic metabolic rate that it falls below the limits of detection. Also, many experts are skeptical of the biological feasibility of anoxybiosis, because any preservation of biological structures during anoxic conditions would imply that a seemingly impossible situation is occurring, wherein the organism is managing to prevent damage to its cellular structures from the environmental negative free energy despite being both surrounded by plenty of water and thermal energy and, most remarkably, it does so without using any free energy of its own. However (as summarized by Professor James Clegg of the UC Davis Bodega Marine laboratory in a 2001 review article), while many studies have failed to find measurable quantities of metabolic activity in potential anoxybiotic organisms, and there is also some evidence that the stress-induced protein p26 may act as a protein chaperone that requires no energy in cystic Artemia franciscana embryos, more recent data suggest that most likely an extremely specialized and slow guanine polynucleotide pathway continues to provide metabolic free energy to the Artemia franciscana embryos during anoxic conditions. Although it is inherently difficult to prove that not a single organism in existence anywhere is capable of entering a truly anoxybiotic state, it seems to clearly be the case that most likely at least A. franciscana (a.k.a. sea monkeys, a well-known and commonly studied cryptobiont) is only capable of approaching, but not reaching, the above-mentioned implied violation of the usual <b>biological</b> <b>conversion</b> of environmental negative free energy into the negative entropy of cellular structures via metabolic processes.|$|E
30|$|Indeed, {{lignocellulosic}} biomass can {{be transformed}} into energy and fuels {{through a variety of}} chemical, thermo-chemical and <b>biological</b> <b>conversion</b> processes.

40|$|Environmental {{and health}} issues coupled with {{increasingly}} stringent nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission standards indicates {{a need for}} the development of alternative low-cost technologies for the removal of NOx from gas streams. <b>Biological</b> NOx <b>conversion</b> offers promise as a novel treatment method. Thermophilic denitrifying bacteria indigenous to composts and soils are capable of converting NOx to environmentally benign nitrogen via a dissimilatory reductive pathway. The present study compares the performance of three bioreactor packing materials (compost, perlite, and biofoam) for the removal of nitric oxide (NO) from a simulated wet-scrubbed combustion gas. Although all three materials performed well (> 85 % NO removal) at residence times of 70 - 80 seconds, the compost performed better than the other materials at shorter residence times (13 - 44 seconds). The perlite and biofoam materials, however, both offer long-term thermal stability and lower pressure drop compared with compost. The feasibility of <b>biological</b> NOx <b>conversion</b> processes will depend on the combined factors of NOx removal ability and pressure drop. The results presented here suggest that the compost, perlite and biofoam systems, subject to further optimization, offer potential for the biological removal of NOx from gas streams...|$|R

Closing the water cycles in this industry, therefore, promises large benefits for the environment and has the potential of huge cost savings for the industry. Closing the water cycle on the other hand also introduces problems with process water quality, quality of the end-product and scaling, owing to increased water contamination. An inline treatment system is discussed in which anaerobic-aerobic bio-reactors perform a central role for removing both organic and inorganic pollutants from the process water cycle. In the proposed set-up, the organic compounds are converted to methane gas and reused for energy supply, while sulphur compounds are stripped from the process cycle and calcium carbonate is removed by precipitation.

These objectives are difficult to attain in a typical water treatment plant, as a result, most water treatment technologies employed in America have not been out of scope of physical-chemical treatment.
