40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{purpose of}} this {{exploratory}} research study was to understand how museum professionals experience being a visitor in museums and how their experiences {{may or may not}} influence their museum practice. Findings from this study were intended to start conversations about how professionals conceive the museum experience and the assumptions they bring to it based on their personal museum-going experiences. As a qualifier to participate in this research study, participants needed to have a leisurely museum visit scheduled, be a current museum employee and have at least five years paid experience working in museums. Data were collected through a two-part web-based reflective questionnaire administered to 25 individuals. Findings revealed that participating museum professionals are a unique visitor group which had a hard time separating leisurely visits to museums from their professional practice; experiences in both environments were continually contributing to and shaping the way the other was understood. Participants were not fully aware of the bias they brought to their practice from their leisurely visits. Further, affirmative experiences during leisurely visits and through subsequent conversations regarding the leisurely visit appeared to be of great personal value to the sample in regards to their professional confidence. Participating museum professionals thought deeply and critically about their leisurely museum visits, and took these experiences with them into their practice. This analysis on how museum professionals leisurely visit museums, how <b>their</b> practice <b>is</b> <b>impacting</b> <b>their</b> visits and how <b>their</b> visits <b>are</b> <b>impacting</b> <b>their</b> work serves as a foundation for further conversations surrounding this phenomenon...|$|R

Traditional probabilistic approaches for defining risk, reliability and return periods under stationary hydrologic conditions assume that extreme events are serially independent with a probability distribution whose moments and associated parameters are fixed. However, when non-stationary conditions lead to trends in the moments and parameters of extreme value processes, new methods for understanding the impacts of such changes on traditional design metrics are needed to insure sensible planning and design efforts. We document the general behavior of various metrics of return period, risk, and reliability assuming extreme events follow a nonstationary lognormal distribution. Our results provide guidance on the value, application and caveats associated with such metrics for water resources planning in a nonstationary world...|$|R

Results: 182 questionnaires were returned (140 medical and 42 general students). More similarities than differences were noted between the freshmen student groups whereas the senior medical students had developed a better grasp of collaborative learning and group study. Conclusions: The main findings of this study are that (1) freshmen medical students may be more conservative than other freshmen university students in study habits and preferences, and (2) senior medical students’ study habits were mostly positively influenced by their experience with group learning and there was a strong indication of improved social communication skills...|$|R

40|$|With the {{millions}} of students currently enrolled in higher education, a substantial opportunity arises for college personnel to impact the health and wellness of our future U. S. adult population. Most health scholars agree that wellness is a multidimensional construct. Despite disagreement regarding the optimal number of dimensions - ranging from three to twelve - {{there is a general}} consensus around the following: (1) physical, (2) social, (3) spiritual, (4) intellectual, (5) emotional, and (6) occupational. With regard to these six dimensions of wellness, {{the purpose of this study}} was to conduct a naturalistic inquiry among graduating health education majors to evaluate which particular dimension of wellness was most influenced or <b>impacted,</b> by <b>their</b> college life experience. Participants were recruited via email and in-class-visits. Of the 173 students who were eligible to participate in this study at the time of recruitment, 58 indicated interest and a final sample size of 30 students were interviewed. When determining which specific dimension of wellness <b>was</b> most <b>impacted</b> or influenced by the college life experience, two narratives of an unplanned pregnancy and alcoholism immediately came to mind. However, when trying to compile all 30 narratives to identify which dimension <b>was</b> most <b>impacted,</b> collectively, I concluded that all dimensions <b>were</b> <b>impacted,</b> and, due to the dimensions' interconnectedness, no one particular dimension could be singled out as most impacted. The six dimensions of wellness interact continually and synergistically. For example, the need for stress management and stress reduction is linked mostly obviously with emotional wellness; however, should one practice yoga for stress relief, he/she <b>is</b> <b>impacting</b> <b>their</b> physical, social, and spiritual health as well. Segmenting students' narratives about their college life experiences into discrete domains represented a challenge - one that reflects how activities that support wellness cannot easily be segmented into discrete domains, either...|$|R
