5000|$|According to {{contemporary}} newspaper reports, {{the building of}} the church was mainly due to the Bishop of Brisbane (Edward Wyndham Tufnell) who chose Leyburn to be the <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> <b>moneys</b> sent by a number of students of the College of St Augustine in England which were to be expended in the erection of a church in Queensland. The site chosen on the main Warwick Road near the Court House was purchased in 1870 for £4. Tenders for fencing in the English Church ground were accepted soon after; tenders for the erection of the new church were called by architect RG Suter in September. Built of 12" [...] pit-sawn timber with shingled roof, the contractor was John Baillie, the church of St Augustine of Canterbury was dedicated in September 1871 by Bishop Tufnell.|$|R

Each year a new group of charities are chosen as the <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> all <b>money</b> raised by Prosh. In recent years, over 115,000 papers are sold on the day, with proceeds often breaking the $100,000 barrier. In 2010, all 130,000 papers had been distributed to students by 7:00am.|$|R

The real <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> paid out was the Austrian Alfons Mensdorff-Pouilly, a longtime agent for BAE and a relative of Landon through Landon's wife Katalina Esterhazy de Galantha. Mensdorff-Pouilly received secret commission contract of at least 81 million Swedish crowns for the final deal in 2003 when the Czech Republic leased Gripen jetfighter.|$|R

50|$|Beyond the {{comparative}} {{ease with which}} inhabitants of Amguema can reach the outside world, the village {{has also been a}} major <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> spent on the region by the former governor, Roman Abramovich. The village has a boarding school for all ages, which is a rarity in the region, and the village serves as an educational hub for the surrounding villages whose schools do not cover all age groups. As well as the school, Abramovich funded the construction of 46 new homes, at a cost of nearly $2.5 million, with hot water and indoor facilities, as well as a guesthouse, barbers and banya. There is also a food store, a post-office, a daycare center and a bakery. The school in Amguema is a boarding school and is used to educate not only the children from village but also other children from Nutepelmen and Vankarem, who are sent there when they are seven or eight.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the day of}} Charlotte's departure, {{she goes}} for a final swim in the ocean. However she is pulled under by a rip and is rescued by {{lifeguard}} Josh West (Daniel Collopy). During her last few seconds of consciousness, Charlotte sees a vision of Jude underwater. She is then resuscitated and hospitalised. After being admitted, Charlotte begins asking for Jude. Jude returns from Melbourne almost immediately and spends time with Charlotte who soon dies after suffering complications. Charlotte's death {{has an effect on}} several other people; Josh who blames himself for not putting up the right flags and resigns as a lifeguard, and Jade Sutherland (Kate Garven) who decides to [...] "live for the moment". Following Charlotte's memorial service, Jude discovers she has not updated her will, leaving him as the sole <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> her <b>money.</b> Jude decides to invest the money in the orphanage as he feels it is what Charlotte would have wanted.|$|R
50|$|Life {{insurance}} (or life assurance, {{especially in}} the Commonwealth of Nations), is a contract between an insurance policy holder and an insurer or assurer, where the insurer promises to pay a designated <b>beneficiary</b> a sum <b>of</b> <b>money</b> (the benefit) {{in exchange for a}} premium, upon the death of an insured person (often the policy holder). Depending on the contract, other events such as terminal illness or critical illness can also trigger payment. The policy holder typically pays a premium, either regularly or as one lump sum. Other expenses (such as funeral expenses) can also be included in the benefits.|$|R
5000|$|Park Chan-wook {{draws on}} a {{disaster}} {{that took place}} in South Korea to ironically criticize the greed of rampant capitalism. In 1995, in Seoul, a huge shopping centre, the Sampung department Store collapsed, killing about 500 people and injuring many others. This tragedy was caused by human negligence. Half a million dollars were offered in indemnity to the victims' relatives, and this triggered a merciless looting made by unscrupulous people. In a morgue where the lifeless body of a girl lies, waiting to be identified, a man and a woman, who introduce themselves as the parents of the victim, are distraught over the loss of the young girl. However, after a moment's hesitation, a morgue employee claims the body of the girl. The grotesque controversy about who is the real [...] "owner" [...] of the corpse and the legitimate <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> starts here. Between turn of events and paradoxical punishments of fate, the ending leads to a tragic and ironic conclusion. In black and white, the whole story is set in the cold morgue, where the characters' absurd and pathetic dialogues take place, like a journalist and a police detective who keep on squabbling. Halfway between Hitchcock and Polanski, Judgement reveals all Park's irony about a shabby, ignorant and greedy humanity, that does not hesitate to come to vile compromises for money.|$|R
40|$|The {{sources and}} {{governance}} of climate finance {{have been widely}} debated since the 2009 climate change summit in Copenhagen, when rich countries promised to provide US$ 30 billion in additional climate finance by 2012 and to mobilize US$ 100 billion a year by 2020 to address the mitigation and adaptation needs of developing countries. Have developed countries respected their financial commitments? Which countries have been the main <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> international climate <b>money?</b> As simple as these questions may seem, answers to them {{have proved to be}} highly controversial and have contributed to a continuous erosion of trust between Parties in international climate negotiations. This article explores the controversies around international climate finance figures. It examines how the lack of internationally agreed modalities to account for climate finance has given rise to a plethora of accounting and reporting practices that leads to widely contrasting statements on climate finance. We show that, despite some gaps, the Paris Agreement’s “enhanced transparency framework” could lead to marked improvements in the way climate finance is accounted and reported. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the Medicare compensation system for physi-cian services, {{it is necessary}} to understand how the relative values ofmedical services are translated into fee schedule payment amounts. Basically, the relative value of a proceduremultiplied by the number of dollars per Relative Value Unit (RVU) is the fee paid by Medicare for the procedure (RVUW physician work, RVUPE practice expense, RVUMPmalpractice). The Conver-sion Factor (CF) is the number of dollars assigned to an RVU. It is calculated by use of a complex formula (Fig 1) that takes into account the overall state of the economy of the United States, the number <b>of</b> Medicare <b>beneficiaries,</b> the amount <b>of</b> <b>money</b> spent in prior years, and changes in the regulations governing covered services. Medicare fees are set according to a relative value scale rather than a free market, payments are made by third parties rather than consumers, and the labor market for physicians is illiquid, so the pricing mechanisms that regulate markets in othe...|$|R

I utilize this {{particular}} survey because it allows us to distinguish individuals’ electoral participation patterns and statuses as remittance recipients and CCT <b>beneficiaries.</b> <b>Of</b> all the Americas Barometer waves available since 2008, I only use those for 2012 – 2016. In previous waves of this survey, Mexican participants had only been asked whether themselves or their family members had received any monthly assistance from the state in the form <b>of</b> <b>money</b> or goods. From this question alone, it is difficult to identify what type of social assistance was received (whether it was in cash or kind), whether it was delivered with conditions or without conditions, to whom (who the beneficiaries are), and from what government level (municipal, state, or federal). Since 2012, however, Mexican respondents have been explicitly asked whether they are <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>of</b> the Oportunidades (Prospera) program or not.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to record the}} {{development}} of the legal regulations focused on the fight against the legalisation of the proceeds of crime with particular emphasis on the regulation within the European Union. I have chosen this topic because of the recency <b>of</b> <b>money</b> laundering phenomenon and the missing comprehensive outline of {{the development of the}} legal regulations in this area. Money laundering may be loosely defined as all actions and procedures intended to conceal or disguise the source, nature, ownership or real <b>beneficiary</b> <b>of</b> the illicitly gained funds in order to create the impression that the proceeds have a legitimate source. If this process is successfull, illicitly generated funds will seem to be absolutely legal and become easily available for the criminal. The thesis is composed of six chapters. Chapter One is introductory and contains the basic information related to money laundering and illustrates the aims of my paper. Chapter Two consists of two parts which characterises the very concept <b>of</b> <b>money</b> laundering. Part One contains various definitions <b>of</b> <b>money</b> laundering which can be found in law. Part Two describes the three stages <b>of</b> <b>money</b> laundering - placement, layering and integration and shortly demonstrates the methods usually used for money laundering (e. g. smurfing, money [...] ...|$|R
