5|$|Banksia spinulosa {{was named}} by James Edward Smith in England in 1793, after being {{collected}} by John White, most likely in 1792. He {{gave it the}} common name prickly-leaved banksia, though this has fallen out of use. With four currently recognised varieties, the species has had a complicated taxonomic history, with two varieties initially described as separate species in the early 19th century. A fourth, from the New England region, has only recently been described. However, there has been disagreement whether one, var.cunninghamii, is distinct enough to once again have specific status. The pre-eminent authority on Banksia, Alex George, concedes there is still more work to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Banksia spinulosa complex.|$|E
5|$|Her {{armament}} {{arrived in}} Philadelphia missing electrical cables and with incomplete documentation, which required Cramp's electricians to piece things together themselves, for which Cramp charged an extra $50,000. She was launched on 23 October 1900 and ran her acceptance trials in October 1901. The trials were successful but revealed incomplete work that Cramp had to finish before {{he received his}} last payment. More work needed to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> armament, {{but it had to}} wait until she arrived in Russia. Retvizan was accepted on 23 March 1902, under the command of Captain Eduard Schensnovich who commanded her throughout her Russian service.|$|E
5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} two squares {{from its}} starting position {{and there is}} an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant (in passing), and move to the square the pawn passed over. This can only <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> very next move, otherwise the right to do so is forfeit. For example, in the animated diagram, the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5, and the white pawn on f5 can take it via en passant on g6 (but only on White's next move).|$|E

5|$|Harvey Littleton (June 14, 1922 – December 13, 2013) was an American {{glass artist}} and educator. Born in Corning, New York, {{he grew up}} in the shadow of Corning Glass Works, where his father headed Research and Development during the 1930s. Expected by his father to enter the field of physics, Littleton instead chose a career in art, gaining {{recognition}} first as a ceramist and later as a glassblower and sculptor in glass. In the latter capacity he was very influential, organizing the first glassblowing seminar aimed at the studio artist in 1962, {{on the grounds of the}} Toledo Museum of Art. Imbued with the prevailing view at the time that glassblowing could only <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> factory floor, separated from the designer at his desk, Littleton aimed to put it within the reach of the individual studio artist.|$|E
5|$|The {{place where}} Ahalya is held to have practised her penance and was {{redeemed}} has been celebrated in scriptures as a sacred {{place called the}} Ahalya-tirtha. A tirtha is a sacred place with a body of water, where pilgrims generally bathe to purify themselves. The location of the Ahalya-tirtha is disputed: according to some scriptures, {{it is on the}} river Godavari, others place it on the river Narmada. Two sites are widely held to be the Ahalya-tirtha. One is located near Ahalyeshvara Temple in Bhalod, {{on the banks of the}} Narmada; another is located in Darbhanga district, Bihar. The Ahilya Asthan temple in Ahalya-gram ("Ahalya's village") in the same district is dedicated to Ahalya. For those seeking to attract women and be handsome like the love-god Kamadeva, the Matsya Purana and the Kurma Purana prescribe the worship of Ahalya at the Ahalya-tirtha. This is to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day of Kamadeva, in the Hindu month of Chaitra. According to the texts, he who bathes in the tirtha will enjoy pleasure with the celestial nymphs.|$|E

There are opposing views on this subject, and more research needs to <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> effects of low-frequency noise on humans.|$|E

25|$|I {{went to see}} Professor Douglas Hartree, who {{had built}} the first {{differential}} analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else.

25|$|Lake Jean {{historically}} had a low pH due to impairment by atmospheric deposition. The lake {{has become}} less acidic, but continues to be impaired by mercury. Its watershed has an area of , including the lake itself. The majority of the watershed is forested, though {{there are a few}} other land uses. The lake was named by Colonel R. Bruce Ricketts in 1905 after Jean Holberton Ricketts, his eldest daughter. A new dam was created for it in the 1950s. In 2015, the lake was partially drained so that repair work could <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> control tower of the Lake Jean Dam.|$|E
25|$|Divers {{will usually}} enter {{the water with}} {{positive}} buoyancy, as this allows them to make final surface checks, signal to the boat that they are OK and co-ordinate descent with a buddy, but there are occasions when negative buoyancy entries are chosen to avoid excessive drift in a strong current, in which case all pre-dive checks must <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> boat, the buoyancy compensator, and where applicable, the dry-suit emptied of gas, and the breathing apparatus function thoroughly checked before entering the water. The risk of injury {{if there is an}} equipment problem is greater for negative entry, particularly with breathing gas failures.|$|E

25|$|There is {{evidence}} that Alexander was preparing to crown his second wife as tsarina-consort, much as Peter the Great had done with his wife Marta Helena Skowrońska, who became Catherine I. Indeed, the tsar ordered research <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject in order to evaluate how Catherine's coronation might be achieved. The tsarevich was so upset by these plans that he threatened to leave for Denmark with his family, but he chose to stay after the tsar threatened to replace him as heir by his half-brother. Another rumour suggested the tsar might abdicate, {{at the urging of}} his wife, and go to live with her and their children in France.|$|E
25|$|Adult seals {{more than}} one year old must be shot in the head with {{expanding}} bullets, and cannot be clubbed to death. The hakapik shall be used to ensure the animal is dead. This is done by crushing the skull of the shot adult seal with the short end of the hakapik, before the long spike is thrust deep into the animal's brain. The seal is then bled by making an incision from its jaw to the end of its sternum. The killing and bleeding must <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice, and live animals may never be brought on board the ship. Young seals may be killed using just the hakapik, but only in the aforementioned manner, i.e., they need not be shot.|$|E
25|$|During {{the budget}} {{session of the}} Indian Railways 2008–09 the then Railway Minister, Lalu Prasad Yadav, rolled out a design to turn the over 200-year-old Secunderabad railway station into a grander facility, {{at a cost of}} Rs. 40billion (USD$1 billions). Later in the maiden budget of 2009-10, Ms.Mamata Banerjee listed 50 {{stations}} to be upgraded into world-class facilities which included the Secunderabad station. The idea was to transform the station into an ultra-modern train hub with added facilities. According to the Ministry, the upgradation will <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lines of Rome's central railway station, Roma Termini (Stazione Termini). The Late Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy directed the proposal for developing the old Gandhi Hospital land adjoining Secunderabad Railway Station on the lines of Toronto railway station, which was developed into a major terminus for commuters, a commercial hub and a parking facility.|$|E
