Two studies (N = 1851) in six European countries show that subjective ambivalence increases the explained variance beyond vested exploratory variables: emotions and variables {{of the theory of}} planned behaviour. This finding implies that the intention to purchase <b>bio-based</b> <b>products</b> is based on more than cognitive deliberations or emotions; it is also associated with an aversive feeling of subjective ambivalence. Additionally, this article divides attitudes into risks and benefits associated with <b>bio-based</b> <b>products</b> and thereby shows that subjective ambivalence strengthens the association between risks and intentions and not that between benefits and intentions. Highly ambivalent consumers are more sensitive to risks than less ambivalent consumers, whereas for the sensitivity to benefits there are no differences between individuals with high and low ambivalence.

Three focus group discussions were organized in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Italy, and The Netherlands (with 89 participants in total) in which projective techniques were applied. Results of these group discussions indicate that participants are unfamiliar with 'bio-based' as a concept. 'Bio-based' is most often associated with positive environmental issues as "naturalness" and "environmental friendly" but also with negative environmental associations and to a lesser extent with technological and health issues. Associations with 'bio-based' as a general concept and with particular <b>bio-based</b> <b>products</b> can be simultaneously {{positive and negative}}, which caused uncertainty and mixed feelings by the respondents. This idea highlights both the complexity of and a lack of familiarity with the concept of 'bio-based'.

This paper studies the production of glucose from corn starch, an important feedstock {{for a wide range of}} <b>bio-based</b> <b>products</b> (e. g. ethanol, bio-based monomers), in a European corn wet mill (CWM). Following the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) principles, non-renewable energy use (NREU) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are assessed for the system cradle-to-factory gate. The allocation problem that the analysis is faced with is addressed by applying seven different approaches: namely sub-division (two variants), partitioning based on physical causalities and on economic relationships and the principles of system expansion (three variants). Depending on the approach, the NREU for glucose production ranges from 6. 8 to 9. 3 MJ/kg glucose dry solids (ds) and the GHG emissions from 0. 7 to 1. 1 kg CO 2 eq. /kg glucose ds. The results for NREU per tonne of glucose are robust while for GHG, large deviation from the average is found for system expansion and for the approach main process. The influence of each calculation should be kept in mind when assessing <b>bio-based</b> <b>products</b> from glucose produced in a CWM.

40|$|Background: Biomass {{refining}} into multiple products {{has gained}} considerable momentum {{due to its}} potential benefits for economic and environmental sustainability. However, the recalcitrance of biomass is a major challenge in <b>bio-based</b> <b>product</b> production. Multilevel composition fractionation processes should be beneficial in overcoming biomass recalcitrance and achieving effective conversion of multiple compositions of biomass. The present study concerns the fractionation of wheat straw using steam explosion, coupled with ethanol extraction, and that this facilitates the establishment of sugars and lignin platform and enables the production of regenerated cellulose films. Results: The {{results showed that the}} hemicellulose fractionation yield was 73 % under steam explosion at 1. 6 MPa for 5. 2 minutes, while the lignin fractionation yield was 90 % by ethanol extraction at 160 degrees C for 2 hours and with 60 % ethanol (v/v). The cellulose yield reached up to 93 % after steam explosion coupled with ethanol extraction. Therefore, cellulose sugar, hemicellulose sugar, and lignin platform were established effectively in the present study. Long fibers (retained by a 40 -mesh screening) accounted for 90 % of the total cellulose fibers, and the glucan conversion of short fibers was 90 % at 9. 0 hours with a cellulase loading of 25 filter paper units/g cellulose in enzymatic hydrolysis. Regenerated cellulose film was prepared from long fibers using [bmim]CI, and the tensile strength and breaking elongation was 120 MPa and 4. 8 %, respectively. The cross-section of regenerated cellulose film prepared by [bmim]CI displayed homogeneous structure, which indicated a dense architecture and a better mechanical performance. Conclusions: Multilevel composition fractionation process using steam explosion followed by ethanol extraction was shown to be an effective process by which wheat straw could be fractionated into different polymeric fractions with high yields. High-value utilization of wheat straw cellulose was achieved by preparing regenerated cellulose film using [bmim]CI.

40|$|The {{bioeconomy}} concept {{refers to}} the sustainable exploitation of renewable biological resources {{for the production of}} energy, food&feed and <b>bio-based</b> <b>products.</b> It is a cross-sectorial concept which offers opportunities for investment in several sectors, including: agriculture, forestry, fisheries and biochemical industries. The European Commission announced its strategic interest on bioeconomy through the communication: “Innovating for Sustainable Growth: A Bioeconomy for Europe” COM(2012) 60, highlighting the unique opportunity to accomplish economic growth while guarantying resource security and efficiency through strategic and sustainable use of renewable biological resources. The growing interest in bioeconomy has boosted the development of new value chains and technologies for the conversion of biomass into food, feed, energy and <b>bio-based</b> <b>products,</b> as well as increased the efficiency of well-established conventional value chains. A comprehensive sustainability assessment of bioeconomy is a key issue to direct investments towards the most sustainable value chains and to determine the impacts of shifting from the current petrol-based economy to a more bio-based one. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a broadly accepted method {{that can be used to}} quantify the impacts along bioeconomy value chains (i. e. from cradle to grave) [1]. The objective of this work was to perform a review analysis of publicly available LCA studies for the three pillars of bioeconomy: food, bioenergy and <b>bio-based</b> <b>products.</b> This analysis encompassed 7 bioenergy value chains, 10 <b>bio-based</b> <b>products</b> and 6 food products. A gap analysis of the published data revealed that apart from few products (such as liquid biofuels, some biopolymers and food crops) the environmental assessment of bioeconomy value chains is still in its infancy and its scope is often limited to very few impact indicators (i. e. GWP and energy efficiency). The analysis also showed that uncertainty over LCA results is significant. Among the several factors that contribute to this uncertainty, perhaps the most important ones are those related to energy efficiency, system boundaries and allocation. Comparisons with the fossil-based alternative value chains were performed for the bioenergy and <b>bio-based</b> <b>products,</b> which revealed benefits and tradeoffs of the bio-based value chains considered.

These experiments were designed to genetically evaluate: 1) the role of each apparently redundant PHA polymerase in determining PHA productivity; 2) identify the key gene(s) within the pha biosynthetic operon that determines PHA productivity; and 3) the role of phaJ to support PHA productivity. The result of overexpressing each PHA polymerase-encoding gene indicates that phaC 1 and phaC 2 are significant contributors to PHA productivity, whereas phaC 3 has little effect. Similarly, over-expressing individually or in combination the three PHA biosynthesis genes located in the pha operon indicates that phaB is the key determinant of PHA productivity. Finally, analogous experiments indicate that phaJ does not contribute significantly to PHA productivity. These bioengineering strains achieved PHA productivity of up to 30 % of dry biomass, which is approximately 2. 5 -fold higher than the non-engineered control strain, indicating the feasibility of using this approach to produce value added bio-based products...|$|E
