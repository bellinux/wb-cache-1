5|$|As planned, Mayweather boards Horizon and {{receives}} {{a warm welcome}} {{from most of the}} crew, including his mother Rianna. He also finds out that his brother, Paul, has been named acting captain, but he doesn't seem to be coping well with his new responsibilities. Mayweather offers to make a few repairs and upgrades to systems on the ship, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> tells him to stop, making him feel uneasy and out of place. Soon afterwards, the ship suddenly comes under attack, and a homing device is placed on the hull. Mayweather then recommends a boost in the ship's fighting capability, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> insists that the safest course is to flee to the nearest port and yield the cargo as needed.|$|E
5|$|Beth and Jack reach Will's {{workshop}} {{and find the}} CFR, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> corners Beth and shoots her when she refuses to co-operate. The CFR is accidentally activated, causing a chronon burst; the exposure throws Jack forward to 2016 again, and causes Paul's chronon syndrome. Beth shuts off the CFR, but is executed by Paul while Jack can only watch through time.|$|E
5|$|By Paul's estimate, about 50 or 60 {{doctors were}} {{certified}} by the NBO. The NBO was incorporated in 1999, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> allowed it to be dissolved in 2000 {{when he did not}} file the required paperwork with the Kentucky Secretary of State's office. He later recreated the board in 2005, but it was again dissolved in 2011.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the release}} of Rough Diamonds, Bad Company disbanded. Mick Ralphs said, [...] "Paul wanted a break and truthfully we all needed to stop. Bad Company had become bigger than us all and to {{continue}} would have destroyed someone or something. From a business standpoint, {{it was the wrong}} thing to do, <b>but</b> <b>Paul's</b> instinct was absolutely right".|$|R

5000|$|<b>But</b> <b>Paul's</b> massive {{success was}} short-lived. The {{follow-up}} single - [...] "Am I Black Enough for You?" [...] - {{failed to reach}} the heights of [...] "Mrs. Jones", with the song's Black Power political message proving too much for mainstream radio's taste. There was {{and continues to be}} much controversy surrounding the choice to release this track as the follow-up to a cross-over smash hit.|$|R
5|$|In December, von Heimburg was {{replaced}} as UB-14s commander by Kapitänleutnant Albrecht von Dewitz, but in early February 1916, von Heimburg resumed command.

5|$|Most restorations of ceratopsians {{show them}} with erect hindlimbs but semi-sprawling forelimbs, which {{suggest that they}} were not fast movers. <b>But</b> <b>Paul</b> and Christiansen (2000) argued that at least the later ceratopsians had upright forelimbs and the larger species may have been as fast as rhinos, which can run at up to 56km or 35 miles per hour.|$|E

Two Dwight Yorke goals gave United a 2–0 win {{in their first}} leg at Old Trafford, while Bayern beat Kaiserslautern by the same {{scoreline}} at the Olympiastadion through goals from Élber and Effenberg. In the second leg, Nicola Ventola pulled a goal back for Inter, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> Scholes secured United's passage to the semi-finals with a late away goal. Meanwhile, Bayern won convincingly at Kaiserslautern, as goals from Effenberg, Carsten Jancker, Mario Basler and an own goal from Uwe Rösler gave them a 4–0 win, 6–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing a}} Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Undertaker {{did not appear}} in the WWF for several months. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal. The WWF foreshadowed his return by airing videos of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Eventually, DiBiase, who {{introduced}} The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990, claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF. <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> Bearer informed him that DiBiase’s Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker. This led to a match at SummerSlam pitting The Undertaker against The Undertaker. In the buildup to the match, Leslie Nielsen perform short segments trying to solve the mystery of how two Undertakers could exist in a spinoff of his roles on Police Squad! and The Naked Gun films.|$|E
5|$|The Raptors {{entered the}} All-Star break with a 28–24 record, and DeRozan was also {{selected}} {{to play in}} the All-Star game, being only the fourth ever Raptor to do so. On March 28, 2014, the Raptors clinched a playoff berth {{for the first time since}} 2008 after beating the Boston Celtics, 105–103. On April 11, 2014, the Raptors lost to the New York Knicks, 108–100, but since the division rival Brooklyn Nets lost to the Atlanta Hawks the same night, the Raptors became Atlantic Division champions for the first time since 2007. They finished the regular season with a franchise-high 48 wins (.585), going 42–22 (.656) after the Gay trade, the third-best record in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors faced the Nets in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2007, when the Nets were located in New Jersey. Toronto nearly advanced to the next round, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> Pierce blocked a potential game-winner by Lowry in Game 7.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{the band}} {{recorded}} the album Marvel in 2001, Paul Cotton left {{the group to}} pursue a teaching career. He did, however, have some input on the writing {{of some of the}} songs on that album.

5000|$|At a party, Paul {{meets the}} hostess Helen Wright (Joan Crawford), a patroness in a loveless {{marriage}} with an ineffectual aging husband Victor (Paul Cavanagh), her third.

He told Paul [...] "make us want to stay." [...] They even asked for a one dollar raise, <b>but</b> <b>Paul's</b> mindset was [...] "you stay here cause you want to stay here." [...] Feeling that Paul wasn't {{prepared}} to make them even a token offer, they jumped to WWF in August 1999.|$|R
5|$|The Undertaker did {{not appear}} in the WWF for several months after his loss to Yokozuna. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal. During his absence, the WWF {{promoted}} his return by showing video clips of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Ted DiBiase claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> Bearer informed him that DiBiase's Undertaker was an impostor. Paul Bearer claimed to have located the true Undertaker, which led to a match at SummerSlam 1994 between DiBiase's Undertaker (portrayed by Brian Lee) and Paul Bearer's original Undertaker. After defeating the false Undertaker, Bearer's Undertaker got revenge against Yokozuna by winning a Casket match at Survivor Series 1994. To help prevent outside interference, Chuck Norris was brought in as a guest referee.|$|E
5|$|After {{the guests}} take their seats, Scott starts {{to worry that}} Charlene will not show up, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> and Mike assure him {{that she will be}} there.

Scott and Charlene exchange vows and Reverend Sampson pronounces them man and wife. At the reception, Jim tells Scott that he is proud of him and welcomes Charlene to the family. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) finds Madge crying in the kitchen and he comforts her. They are interrupted by Mrs. Mangel (Vivean Gray) who informs them that the telegrams from Max and Maria, Clive and Rosemary, who all are unable to attend, are being read out.

Everyone gathers in the street to wave the couple off. Mrs. Mangel catches Charlene's bouquet, as the couple drive out of Ramsay Street.|$|E
5|$|Diana {{discovers that}} Paul {{has written a}} story about her in his {{newspaper}} and she confronts him. Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys from his pocket and she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it.

Andrew confronts Diana at her hotel and Mark arrives to arrest her for conspiracy to commit murder. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives some emails telling her that Diana did not push Paul and she goes to see her. Diana tells Susan that she has been formally charged, but insists that she is innocent. She realises that Susan believes her and she begs Susan to help. Diana is later released.|$|E
5|$|Baxter's brigade {{was worn}} {{down and out}} of ammunition. At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson {{replaced}} it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul. Rodes then committed his two reserve brigades: Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel and Dodson Ramseur. Ramseur attacked first, <b>but</b> <b>Paul's</b> brigade held its crucial position. Paul had a bullet go in one temple and out the other, blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle). Before {{the end of the}} day, three other commanders of that brigade were wounded.|$|R
60|$|Paul thanked Mr Feeder {{for these}} hints, and {{pocketing}} his invitation, {{sat down on}} a stool by the side of Mr Toots, as usual. <b>But</b> <b>Paul's</b> head, which had long been ailing more or less, and was sometimes very heavy and painful, felt so uneasy that night, that he was obliged to support it on his hand. And yet it dropped so, that by little and little it sunk on Mr Toots's knee, and rested there, as if it had no care to be ever lifted up again.|$|R

5|$|Felicia Tilman (Harriet Sansom Harris), Martha’s sister, soon {{arrives on}} Wisteria Lane {{to find out}} what {{happened}} to her sister. While inside Paul and Mary Alice’s house, she recognizes a picture of Mary Alice and claims her to be Angela, a nurse she worked with years prior in Utah, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> is adamant that she is mistaken. Felicia, however, knows that Mary Alice was in fact Angela and later tells Zach that she knew him when he was a baby, and that his original name was so lovely: Dana. In the first season finale, the mystery behind Mary Alice’s suicide is revealed in full. In March 1990, Todd and Angela Forrest could not conceive and one night a woman named Deirdre Taylor (Jolie Jenkins), a heroin addict whom Angela had treated at the rehabilitation hospital where she worked as a nurse, came to their house looking for money and offered to sell her son to them, to which they eventually agreed. When Deirdre returned to the hospital as a patient soon after and suspicion arose as to where her child was, Angela knew they had to leave town. They moved to Fairview and bought a house on Wisteria Lane, changing their names to Paul, Mary Alice and Zach Young. In 1993, however, Deirdre came to their home, seemingly sober, demanding that she reclaim her son. After a verbal fight, Deirdre went to take her child, when Mary Alice stabbed and killed her. Zach woke up and saw the body, which led to years of his parents brushing off his memories of that night as nothing. Paul and Mary Alice dismembered Deirdre’s body, put it in a toy chest and buried it under their pool. Years later, Martha recognized Mary Alice in a group photo in Felicia’s house, leading to Felicia to tell Martha about how Angela and Todd possibly disappeared with Deirdre’s child and hopefully gave Dana a proper home. Martha then blackmailed Mary Alice and she, in desperation, committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1792, a 10,000-man {{division}} under Jacques Bernard d'Anselme {{crossed the}} Var River and occupied Nice, then {{part of the}} Kingdom of Sardinia. This force {{was part of the}} Army of the Midi which was split on 1 October 1792, with the troops on the Alpine front becoming the Army of the Alps. On 7 November d'Anselme's division became the Army of Italy, which included the 70th Regiment. At about this time Sérurier was arrested for harboring royalist sentiments, <b>but</b> <b>Paul</b> Barras got his rank restored. On 19 May 1793, the new army commander Gaspard Jean-Baptiste Brunet sent him with a column to occupy Saint-Sauveur-sur-Tinée. Sérurier moved north up the Tinée River and captured Isola on the 21st. With 3,000 troops, he attacked the Col de Raus west of Belvédère but was repulsed on 8 June. During the First Battle of Saorgio he led a major attack on the Massif de l'Authion on 12 June, but it was defeated with losses of 280 dead and 1,252 wounded. At the end of July Brunet made another assault on Massif de l'Authion while Sérurier attacked the Col de Raus again but both efforts failed. The representatives on mission were pleased with Sérurier's performance and nominated him general of brigade on 25 June; the promotion was confirmed on 22 August 1793. Meanwhile, Brunet was arrested and executed on 15 November 1793.|$|E

Baron Harkonnen himself is {{poisoned}} with a gom jabbar by Paul's young sister Alia Atreides, his own granddaughter, and dies {{at the age of}} 83, with the latter also revealing her direct lineage to him just beforehand. Paul then kills Feyd in ritual combat. House Harkonnen's virtual extermination removes it as a galactic power, <b>but</b> <b>Paul's</b> ascension to the Imperial throne in Shaddam's place guarantees that Vladimir's descendants will long reign as the Imperial House Atreides.|$|R
25|$|When Saira and Raj {{left to go}} back to the house, Rachel went to {{see them}} off, leaving Matthew and Paul alone {{together}} in the boardroom reception.

He started as a middle guard on defense but was soon switched to an offensive guard, where he excelled. The Associated Press named him a first-team All-Ohio guard in 1938.|$|E
