40|$|This is {{the first}} report {{of the results of}} the series of {{experiments}} which have been carried on by the authors from December 1978 to February 1979. This series of experiments, named Experiments 6, aimed to determine the threshold values of NaCl concentrations in concrete for <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> rusting. A method of electrical potential difference measurements of spots of concrete specimen surfaces over Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell, having been developed by California Division of Highways and having been widely used to detect the rusting spots of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete, are also performed in this series of experiments. We planned to examine the method, if it can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture to detect rusting spots. The following results about <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion are obtained by and at six months after embedding <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete. 1. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 033 % of NaCl have not corroded yet without adding any amount of corrosion inhibitors. 2. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 067 % of NaCl do not also corrode yet, if adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors are added to the concrete. 3. In case of the concrete contained 0. 100 % of NaCl by weight, there have been <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> corroded some, but their areas of corrosion were small. Some of the <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> have no corrosion spots where adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors had added to the concrete. 4. All <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 133 % of NaCl by weight except A_ 4 D_ 2 C_ 2 O_ 1 specimens have been observed some corrosion. And as the time has passed, the areas of corrosion on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> surfaces are becoming larger. 5. There have not been any significant differences in the effects of types of corrosion inhibitors on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion. 6. The effects of water-cement ratio on corrosion of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> are not obvious. 7. The beneficial effects of doubled dosage of corrosion inhibitors into concrete are observed on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion. The results of electrical potential measurments on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell are as follows. 1. It has not been decided yet that the standards of California Division of Highways on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion in concrete can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture. 2. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete need not be connected by metalic means each other when half cell potential measurment method is applied. 3. Rusting spots on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> surfaces have high potentials, and the electrical circuit directly contained a rusting spot exhibit high potentials in the sense of absolute value. 4. Almost rusting places have occured in the underside of <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> and the underside of the specimen has considerable larger cover depth over <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> than the upperside. The electrical potentials measured on the underside of a specimen were always higher than on upperside. 5. Moisture condition of the specimen concrete has strong effect on measured potential values. 6. There have been no corrosion on the <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the specimens which exhibit 0. 2 volt or less of electrical potential. 7. There have been very few specimens which exhibit the electrical potential value of 0. 3 volt or higher. 8.

40|$|Due {{to violent}} {{fluctuation}} of raw material {{prices in the}} international market, the domestic <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> index reached its peak in June 2008. As <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> are massive materials required for constructional engineering, {{it has become an}} urgent potential issue in the research of construction management by considering how to minimize their consumption and waste. In engineering practice, the experienced <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> engineer of the subcontractor is usually assigned to prepare the construction drawing and the material selection list. Taking account of the easier cutting of <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> convenient workability and material management, it is frequently required that the length of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> should be processed into a number that is a multiple of 5 cm or 10 cm so as to minimize the diversity of sizes; sometimes, the required length of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> is also lengthened to match the size of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> with a larger quantity in the Material Selection List. Along with the expansion of construction scale, the type of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> size is also becoming more complicated. It is frequently seen that shorter bars are wrongly replaced by longer ones due to the confusion of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> sizes during <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> erection, overlapping and binding, this has lead to waste of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> material. Since relevant literature relating to <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> material expenditure and control only deal with the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> cutting issues at the initial construction stage, but lacks the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement required by practical construction, the aforesaid waste during field construction has not been effectively improved until now. For this reason, the floor deck <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement of the building construction will be selected as the example for this Research. By adjusting the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> splicing position, the size of originally required <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> will be changed. Further, the âK-means Clustering Algorithmâ is also used to configure the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> clustering mode so as to reduce the diversified sizes of <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> As a further step, the Linear Programming Method will be employed to acquire the optimal clustering result without increasing the original cost. In this Research, a physical building case will be selected as the example. The said case belongs to an RC structure in which the foundation area size is 65. 4 m (L) x 59. 7 m (W) and is constructed into 4 underground levels and 7 above-ground floors, and each floor is provided with a maximum of 14 horizontal or longitudinal spans. The material selection result indicates that the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> samples having the same number and shape is 694 pieces and this has been divided into 41 groups by length. According to the program-based clustering computation written for this Research, the result indicates that the steel group count will be reduced to 16 groups and the workability will be significantly enhanced accordingly. With the above information, {{it can be seen that}} the statement of this Research is justified and can really be implemented in the practical construction field to achieve the purpose of reducing the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> length types,minimizing construction error and alleviating the work accessibility. è¿å¹´ä¾ç±æ¼åééåç©æå¹æ ¼æ³¢ååçï¼è³ 97 å¹´ 6 æä»½æï¼åå§é¼ç­ææ¸éå°é«å³°ï¼èé¼ç­å°æ¼çå»ºå·¥ç¨ä¾èªªå±¬æ¼å¤§å®ææï¼å æ­¤æèå¦ä½æ¸ä½å¶èæèæµªè²»ï¼å·²è®ææ¯çå»ºç®¡çç ç©¶ä¸æ¥µå·æ½åçä¸åèª²é¡ã ä¸è¬å¨å·¥ç¨å¯¦åä¸ï¼é¼ç­å·¥ç¨æ¼ç¼åå¾ï¼æéç¹ªè£½é¼ç­æ½å·¥åä»¥åææå®ä¹å·¥ä½ï¼å¤åäº¤ç±é¼ç­ååå» åä¸­å·¥ç¨ç¶é©è¼çºè±å¯ä¹é¼ç­å¸«åèçï¼å¶å¾å¾çºäºé¼ç­ä¾¿æ¼è£åãèæ®æ½å·¥æ§åææç®¡çæ¹ä¾¿ï¼å¸¸å¼·å¶éæ±é¼ç­é·åº¦æçºå°¾æ¸çº 5 æ 10 cmçåæ¸ï¼èä»¥éä½å°ºå¯¸ä¹å¤æ¨£æ§ï¼çè³æ¯çºäºéåææå®ä¸­éæ±æ¸éè¼å¤ä¹é¼ç­å°ºå¯¸ï¼å°éæ±é¼ç­é·åº¦å å¤§ãå¦å¤é¨èå·¥ç¨è¦æ¨¡å¢å ï¼éæ±é¼ç­å°ºå¯¸ç¨®é¡ä¹è¶å ç¹è¤ï¼æä»¥å¨é¼ç­æ½å·¥åæ­æ¥ç¶ç´®æï¼å é¼ç­å°ºå¯¸æ··æ·ï¼é¯ä»¥é·åº¦è¼é·ä¹é¼ç­ï¼åä»£åæé·åº¦è¼ç­é¼ç­ä¹æå½¢ï¼å±¢è¦ä¸é®®ï¼ä¹å æ­¤é æé¼ç­ææç¡è¬ä¹æµªè²»ãç¶èåé¡§ä»¥å¾å°æ¼é¼ç­æææ¯åºæ§å¶çç¸éæç»ï¼åä»¥å·¥ç¨åæçé¼ç­è£ååé¡ä½çºç ç©¶ç¯çï¼ç¼ºä¹éå°å·¥ç¨å¯¦éé¼ç­éç­çéæ±åé¡ä½æ¢è¨ï¼æä¸è¿°æ¼å¯¦ä½ææç¢çæææµªè²»ä¹æå½¢ï¼è¿ä»ä»æªç²å¾ææä¹æ¹åã å æ­¤ï¼æ¬ç ç©¶ä»¥å»ºç¯å·¥ç¨æ¨çéç­çºä¾ï¼å©ç¨é¼ç­æ­æ¥ä½ç½®çèª¿æ´ï¼æ¹è®åæéæ±é¼ç­å°ºå¯¸ï¼ä¸¦æ¡ç¨k-meansåç¾¤æ¼ç®æ³ï¼å»ºæ§é¼ç­åç¾¤æ¨¡å¼ï¼æ¸å°é¼ç­ç¹éç¾å¤çå°ºå¯¸ï¼åéç¨ç·æ§è¦åæ¹å¼ï¼æ±è§£å¨ä¸å¢å åæææ¬ç®æ¨ä¸ä¹æä½³åç¾¤çµæã å¨æ¬ç ç©¶ä¸­ï¼ä»¥ä¸çå¯¦å»ºç¯åæ¡ä½çºç¯ä¾ï¼è©²æ¡ä¾çºä¸RCæ§é å»ºç¯ç©ï¼åºå°é¢ç©é·ç´ 65. 4 å¬å°ºï¼å¯¬ç´ 59. 7 å¬å°ºï¼å»ºç¯è¦æ¨¡çºå°ä¸ 4 å±¤ãå°ä¸ 7 å±¤ï¼èæ¯å±¤æ¨çä¹æ©«åæç¸±åè·¨åº¦æå¤åçº 14 åï¼ç¶ææçµæï¼åæç¸åèæ¸ãå½¢çä¹éæ±é¼ç­æ¨£æ¬æ¸çº 694 åï¼ä»¥é·åº¦åé¡ï¼å¯åçº 41 åç¾¤çµï¼ç¶æ¬ç ç©¶ææ°å¯«ç¨å¼åç¾¤æ¼ç®çµæï¼é¼ç­ç¾¤çµæ¸éä½çº 16 çµï¼å¤§å¤§å¢é²å¶å·¥ä½æ§ï¼è­ææ¬ç ç©¶ä¹è«è¿°ï¼ç¢ºå¯¦å¯ä»¥éç¨æ¼å·¥ç¨å¯¦åä¸ï¼éå°éä½é¼ç­é·åº¦æ¨£æãæ¸å°æ½å·¥é¯èª¤ãæææ½å·¥ä¾¿å©æ§ä¹ç®çãæè¦	 i Abstract	 ii ç®é	 iv è¡¨ç®é	 v åç®é	 vi ç¬¬ä¸ç« 	ç·è«	 1 1. 1 ç ç©¶åæ©åç®ç	 1 1. 2 ç ç©¶æ¹æ³	 4 ç¬¬äºç« 	åé¡æè¿°èå®ç¾©	 6 2. 1 é¼ç­å·¥ç¨æ½å·¥æµç¨	 6 2. 2 çå»ºå·¥ç¨è²»ç¨çµæ§	 9 2. 3 å½±é¿é¼ç­å·¥ç¨ææ¬å ç´ 	 10 2. 4 é¼ç­éç­åç¾¤åé¡	 11 2. 4. 1 èæ¯æè¿°	 11 2. 4. 2 åé¡å®ç¾©	 12 ç¬¬ä¸ç« 	æç»åé¡§	 13 3. 1 é¼ç­éç­åé¡	 13 3. 2 K-meansåç¾¤æ¼ç®æ³	 28 3. 3 ç·æ§è¦å	 34 ç¬¬åç« 	æ¸å­¸å»ºæ¨¡	 35 4. 1 ç¬¦èå®ç¾©	 35 4. 1. 1 æ±ºç­è®æ¸	 35 4. 1. 2 éçæ¢ä»¶	 36 4. 2 æ¨¡å¼å»ºæ§èæ±è§£æ­¥é©	 36 ç¬¬äºç« 	ç¯ä¾å¯¦è­	 40 5. 1 æ¡ä¾èªªæ	 40 5. 2 æ±è§£åæ	 47 ç¬¬å­ç« 	çµè«èå¾çºç ç©¶	 52 6. 1 çµè«	 52 6. 2 å¾çºç ç©¶	 53 åèæç»	 54 ééA çéç­æææç´°	 A- 1 ééB ç¨å¼è³æç·¨ç¢¼	 B- 1 ééC é¼ç­åç¾¤æ±è§£è¼¸åº	 C-...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} an experimental study on the flexural behaviour of a composite beam, which is reinforced with longitudinal tensile <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> as well as glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) pultruded I-beam encased in concrete. Five beam specimens, including one traditional reinforced concrete (RC) beam and four composite beams, were cast and tested under four-point bending. The variables involved in the composite beams include the type of longitudinal tensile <b>bars</b> (<b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> and GFRP bars) {{and the location of}} the I-beam in the cross-section (middle and a shift of 30 mm towards the tension region). The test results presented in this study show that the proposed composite beams have a very ductile response due to the existence of the tensile <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> and the yield point of the composite beam is controlled by the tensile <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> The ultimate load of the proposed composite beam in this study is higher than the traditional RC beam in this study, and the ultimate load is governed by the encased I-beam. When GFRP bars were used to replace the tensile <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> to reinforce the composite beams, the brittle failure of GFRP bars caused lack of ductility of the beam members, and both the stiffness and ultimate load were reduced significantly. Compared with <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> the slip between the concrete and the I-beam was also increased when GFRP bars were used. The different location of the I-beam has little effect on the flexural response...|$|R
50|$|Both {{coupled axles}} {{as well as}} the {{carrying}} axle were fixed rigidly into the frame. The wheel spokes were made of forged <b>bar</b> <b>steel.</b> Later cast wheel spokes were fitted. Because it had an inside drive the second axle had to be designed as a crank axle, which is remarkable, bearing in mind the manufacturing technology of that time. A technical innovation was the trailing axle which had been intended by Schubert mainly to improve the locomotive's riding qualities.It was subsequently determined to be superfluous and was removed in 1840. From 1842, however, the operation of twin-axled locomotives was banned on safety grounds, so the trailing axle had to be refitted.The brake was initially a screw-operated band brake which acted on the two driven wheels from the top. Because this did not prove suitable due to high wear and tear, it was later removed.|$|E

Others include Triple Chick, Alamitos Bar, Bar Depth, Royal Bar, Josie's Bar, and Galobar. His grandson Doc Bar {{became one of the}} most influential sires of cutting horses ever known. Another grandson, Tonto Bars Hank, sired all around horses. Jewel's Leo Bars (Freckles), an outstanding cutting horse and sire of cutting horses, was another grandson of Three Bars (TB). Impressive, a triple descendant of Three Bars, became the most prepotent sire of Quarter Horse halter horses from the 1970s through the 1990s. His offspring Rocket Bar (TB), Sugar Bars, Lena's Bar (TB), Lightning Bar and Zippo Pat Bars were all inducted into the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame. Of his grandget, Doc Bar, Zippo Pine Bar, Easy Jet, Kaweah Bar, Zan Parr Bar, and The Invester were inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame.

40|$|A {{new process}} concept, "quenching and partitioning" (Q&P) has been {{proposed}} recently for creating steel microstructures with retained austenite. The process involves quenching austenite below the martensite-start temperature, followed by a partitioning treatment to enrich the remaining austenite with carbon, thereby stabilizing it to room temperature. The process concept is reviewed here, along with the thermodynamic basis for the partitioning treatment, and a model for designing some of the relevant processing temperatures. These concepts are applied to silicon-containing steels that are currently being examined for low-carbon TRIP sheet steel applications, and medium-carbon <b>bar</b> <b>steel</b> applications, along with a silicon-containing ductile cast iron. Highlights of recent experimental studies on these materials are also presented, that indicate unique and attractive microstructure/property combinations may be obtained via Q&P. This work is being carried out through a collaborative arrangement sponsored by the NSF in the USA, CNPq in Brazil, and the EPSRC in the United Kingdom...|$|E
