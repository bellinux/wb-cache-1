40|$|This is {{the first}} report {{of the results of}} the series of {{experiments}} which have been carried on by the authors from December 1978 to February 1979. This series of experiments, named Experiments 6, aimed to determine the threshold values of NaCl concentrations in concrete for <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> rusting. A method of electrical potential difference measurements of spots of concrete specimen surfaces over Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell, having been developed by California Division of Highways and having been widely used to detect the rusting spots of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete, are also performed in this series of experiments. We planned to examine the method, if it can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture to detect rusting spots. The following results about <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion are obtained by and at six months after embedding <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete. 1. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 033 % of NaCl have not corroded yet without adding any amount of corrosion inhibitors. 2. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 067 % of NaCl do not also corrode yet, if adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors are added to the concrete. 3. In case of the concrete contained 0. 100 % of NaCl by weight, there have been <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> corroded some, but their areas of corrosion were small. Some of the <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> have no corrosion spots where adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors had added to the concrete. 4. All <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> in the concrete contained 0. 133 % of NaCl by weight except A_ 4 D_ 2 C_ 2 O_ 1 specimens have been observed some corrosion. And as the time has passed, the areas of corrosion on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> surfaces are becoming larger. 5. There have not been any significant differences in the effects of types of corrosion inhibitors on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion. 6. The effects of water-cement ratio on corrosion of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> are not obvious. 7. The beneficial effects of doubled dosage of corrosion inhibitors into concrete are observed on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion. The results of electrical potential measurments on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell are as follows. 1. It has not been decided yet that the standards of California Division of Highways on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> corrosion in concrete can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture. 2. <b>Steel</b> <b>bars</b> in concrete need not be connected by metalic means each other when half cell potential measurment method is applied. 3. Rusting spots on <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> surfaces have high potentials, and the electrical circuit directly contained a rusting spot exhibit high potentials in the sense of absolute value. 4. Almost rusting places have occured in the underside of <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> and the underside of the specimen has considerable larger cover depth over <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> than the upperside.

40|$|Due {{to violent}} {{fluctuation}} of raw material {{prices in the}} international market, the domestic <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> index reached its peak in June 2008. As <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> are massive materials required for constructional engineering, {{it has become an}} urgent potential issue in the research of construction management by considering how to minimize their consumption and waste. In engineering practice, the experienced <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> engineer of the subcontractor is usually assigned to prepare the construction drawing and the material selection list. Taking account of the easier cutting of <b>steel</b> <b>bars,</b> convenient workability and material management, it is frequently required that the length of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> should be processed into a number that is a multiple of 5 cm or 10 cm so as to minimize the diversity of sizes; sometimes, the required length of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> is also lengthened to match the size of <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> with a larger quantity in the Material Selection List. Along with the expansion of construction scale, the type of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> size is also becoming more complicated. It is frequently seen that shorter bars are wrongly replaced by longer ones due to the confusion of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> sizes during <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> erection, overlapping and binding, this has lead to waste of <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> material. Since relevant literature relating to <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> material expenditure and control only deal with the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> cutting issues at the initial construction stage, but lacks the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement required by practical construction, the aforesaid waste during field construction has not been effectively improved until now. For this reason, the floor deck <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> arrangement of the building construction will be selected as the example for this Research. By adjusting the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> splicing position, the size of originally required <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> will be changed. Further, the “K-means Clustering Algorithm” is also used to configure the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> clustering mode so as to reduce the diversified sizes of <b>steel</b> <b>bars.</b> As a further step, the Linear Programming Method will be employed to acquire the optimal clustering result without increasing the original cost. In this Research, a physical building case will be selected as the example. The said case belongs to an RC structure in which the foundation area size is 65. 4 m (L) x 59. 7 m (W) and is constructed into 4 underground levels and 7 above-ground floors, and each floor is provided with a maximum of 14 horizontal or longitudinal spans. The material selection result indicates that the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> samples having the same number and shape is 694 pieces and this has been divided into 41 groups by length. According to the program-based clustering computation written for this Research, the result indicates that the steel group count will be reduced to 16 groups and the workability will be significantly enhanced accordingly. With the above information, {{it can be seen that}} the statement of this Research is justified and can really be implemented in the practical construction field to achieve the purpose of reducing the <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> length types,minimizing construction error and alleviating the work accessibility. 近年來由於國際間原物料價格波動劇烈，至 97 年 6 月份時，國內鋼筋指數達到高峰，而鋼筋對於營建工程來說屬於大宗材料，因此思考如何減低其耗損與浪費，已變成是營建管理研究上極具潛力的一個課題。 一般在工程實務上，鋼筋工程於發包後，有關繪製鋼筋施工圖以及揀料單之工作，多半交由鋼筋分包廠商中工程經驗較為豐富之鋼筋師傅處理，其往往為了鋼筋便於裁切、考慮施工性及材料管理方便，常強制需求鋼筋長度成為尾數為 5 或 10 cm的倍數，藉以降低尺寸之多樣性，甚至是為了配合揀料單中需求數量較多之鋼筋尺寸，將需求鋼筋長度加大。另外隨著工程規模增加，需求鋼筋尺寸種類也越加繁複，所以在鋼筋施工及搭接綁紮時，因鋼筋尺寸混淆，錯以長度較長之鋼筋，取代原有長度較短鋼筋之情形，屢見不鮮，也因此造成鋼筋材料無謂之浪費。然而回顧以往對於鋼筋材料支出控制的相關文獻，僅以工程初期的鋼筋裁切問題作為研究範疇，缺乏針對工程實際鋼筋配筋的需求問題作探討，故上述於實作時所產生材料浪費之情形，迄今仍未獲得有效之改善。 因此，本研究以建築工程樓版配筋為例，利用鋼筋搭接位置的調整，改變原有需求鋼筋尺寸，並採用k-means分群演算法，建構鋼筋分群模式，減少鋼筋繁雜眾多的尺寸，再運用線性規劃方式，求解在不增加原有成本目標下之最佳分群結果。 在本研究中，以一真實建築個案作為範例，該案例為一RC構造建築物，基地面積長約 65. 4 公尺，寬約 59. 7 公尺，建築規模為地下 4 層、地上 7 層，而每層樓版之橫向或縱向跨度最多均為 14 個，經揀料結果，原有相同號數、形狀之需求鋼筋樣本數為 694 個，以長度分類，可分為 41 個群組；經本研究所撰寫程式分群演算結果，鋼筋群組數降低為 16 組，大大增進其工作性，證明本研究之論述，確實可以運用於工程實務上，達到降低鋼筋長度樣態、減少施工錯誤、提昇施工便利性之目的。摘要	 i Abstract	 ii 目錄	 iv 表目錄	 v 圖目錄	 vi 第一章	緒論	 1 1. 1 研究動機及目的	 1 1. 2 研究方法	 4 第二章	問題描述與定義	 6 2. 1 鋼筋工程施工流程	 6 2. 2 營建工程費用結構	 9 2. 3 影響鋼筋工程成本因素	 10 2. 4 鋼筋配筋分群問題	 11 2. 4. 1 背景描述	 11 2. 4. 2 問題定義	 12 第三章	文獻回顧	 13 3. 1 鋼筋配筋問題	 13 3. 2 K-means分群演算法	 28 3. 3 線性規劃	 34 第四章	數學建模	 35 4. 1 符號定義	 35 4. 1. 1 決策變數	 35 4. 1. 2 邊界條件	 36 4. 2 模式建構與求解步驟	 36 第五章	範例實證	 40 5. 1 案例說明	 40 5. 2 求解分析	 47 第六章	結論與後續研究	 52 6. 1 結論	 52 6. 2 後續研究	 53 參考文獻	 54 附錄A 版配筋揀料明細	 A- 1 附錄B 程式資料編碼	 B- 1 附錄C 鋼筋分群求解輸出	 C-...|$|R

When GFRP bars were used to replace the tensile <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> to reinforce the composite beams, the brittle failure of GFRP bars caused lack of ductility of the beam members, and both the stiffness and ultimate load were reduced significantly.
