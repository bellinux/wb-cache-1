It can also hire employees, such as a manager or a caretaker, to deal with specific things that volunteers may prefer not to do or may not <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> doing, such as electrical maintenance. However, as many housing cooperatives strive to run self-sufficiently, as much work as possible is completed by its members.|$|E
25|$|DeNeve (1999) {{argued that}} there are three trends in the {{relationship}} between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies (emotional stability, positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. trust, affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an optimistic fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.|$|E
25|$|There are two centres in a rugby team, inside centre (number 12) {{and outside}} centre (number 13). The inside centre usually stands {{close to the}} fly-half or at first {{receiver}} {{on the other side}} of the scrum or breakdown. Like the fly-half, they generally possess a good kicking game and are good at reading the play and directing the attack. The outside centre is positioned outside the inside centre and is generally the faster of the two. The centres' main role is to provide space for the players outside them. They need to run good lines (run into spaces or at 90 degrees to their opposition), be able to side step and swerve, and have good passing skills. When the ball is moved along the opposition backline, the centres are the first players to make the tackle. They need to be aggressive tacklers to knock their opponent down and seize the ball and <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> organising the defensive lines. Outside centres generally have more room to move than inside centres. Centres also provide support at the breakdowns and can run as decoys to confuse the defence.|$|E

[...] He was given little classroom education, though he did spend some time at a local school in nearby Bucks County, {{as well as at}} Germantown Academy and the University of Pennsylvania. [...] For the most part, his education was informal, as was usual in the Peale family, with the student given the means to study what interested him, or what he appeared to <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>at.</b> [...] In Franklin Peale's case, he made toys as a boy, and surveyed his father's farm near Germantown. Although he lacked the artistic talent of some of his brothers, such as Titian Peale, he proved mechanically inclined.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Times of India, Karan Johar explained that he harboured intentions of remaking the original Agneepath ever since the film released in 1990. Though the film had received critical acclaim over the years, its commercial failure had devastated his father, producer Yash Johar. The idea of a possible remake materialised on the sets of Johar's directorial My Name Is Khan, in which Karan Malhotra was an assistant director. Johar told Malhotra of his desire to remake the original film {{and asked him to}} revisit it again. On not directing the film himself, Johar commented, [...] "I am happy directing films on love, romance and drama. That's what I do best. I don't think I will <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> an action film. So I am not taking the reins of the film in my hand".|$|E

Evans later trained and competed for the school swimming team in summer {{as well as the}} field hockey team. Evans enjoyed success in all four strokes at school level, but was most proficient at breaststroke and chose to specialise in it, commenting that [...] "I'd rather <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> one stroke than mediocre in four". Thereafter, he was undefeated in breaststroke at school level. Evans learned the [...] "whip kick" [...] from Ian Dickson, brother of Olympic freestyle swimming medallist David Dickson.

500|$|Romanek {{described}} {{working with}} child actors and [...] "knowing {{that the first}} act of the film {{was going to have}} to be carried by 12-year-olds" [...] as probably the most difficult aspect of making the film. He said that most of the rehearsal schedule was devoted to ensuring that the first act would <b>be</b> <b>good.</b> <b>At</b> rehearsals, the film-maker would have the younger actors observe the older actors practise the first-act scenes. This had a double purpose: the older actors would have a memory of having played those scenes, while the child actors would get a better idea of how a more skilled actor would play their part. Romanek would then mix and match the actors (for example, Mulligan would do a scene with the child playing the younger Tommy). He also had them spend time together doing things like playing and talking. He took them to the school location and let them play games together so they could get a better idea of the layout of the place.|$|E

Park credits Usher as his idol and as one of his biggest influences, who he started listening to in the 6th grade. He also cites Michael Jackson as his role model, as [...] "he is the best". He cites both Usher and Michael Jackson as singers and dancers who influence him vocally and in dance, as he attempts to mimic them, looking at their music videos. Park also cites Chris Brown as an inspiration, and wants [...] "to be a singer who can <b>be</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> both singing and rapping like [...] ". Park began listening to hip hop music when he was in second grade, after one of his cousins let him listen to Warren G's [...] "Regulate".

2500|$|Their central {{position}} {{enables them}} to have an all-round view of the match. [...] Since most of the action takes place in and around their area of the pitch, midfielders often exert the greatest degree of control over how a match is played. It is often said that a match is won or lost in midfield, meaning that whichever team dominates the middle area of the pitch is able to dictate the game. A central midfielder {{is expected to have}} good vision, be adept at long and short passing and have great stamina because of the ground they cover in a game.
