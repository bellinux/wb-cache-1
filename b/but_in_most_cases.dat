5|$|As the {{lifeboats}} {{were brought}} alongside Carpathia, the survivors came aboard the ship by various means. Some were {{strong enough to}} climb up rope ladders; others were hoisted up in slings, {{and the children were}} hoisted in mail sacks. The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No.12, with 74people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on Carpathia by 09:00. There were some scenes of joy as some families and friends were reunited, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> hopes died as loved ones failed to reappear.|$|E
5|$|Other {{countries}} and languages followed soon. The first German translations appeared in 1954, {{and in the}} 1960s Bessy {{and to a lesser}} extent Jerom were an enormous success, with combined over a 1000 weekly comics with a circulation of some 200,000 copies. Later in the 1950s followed publications in Chile and Portugal, and Spain followed in the 1960s. In the following years, Vandersteen's comics and especially Suske en Wiske were published in dozens of languages, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> only one or a few albums are translated. More 9 albums were published in the United States, and in Sweden 69 albums were published, accompanied by merchandising. The Finnish series experienced success as well.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{construction}} {{did not end}} {{once the}} original plan was complete; pharaohs often rebuilt or replaced decayed temple structures or made additions to those still standing. In the course of these additions, they frequently dismantled old temple buildings to use as fill for the interiors of new structures. On rare occasions {{this may have been}} because the old structures or their builders had become anathema, as with Akhenaten's temples, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> the reason seems to have been convenience. Such expansion and dismantling could considerably distort the original temple plan, as happened at the enormous Precinct of Amun-Re at Karnak, which developed two intersecting axes and several satellite temples.|$|E
40|$|Bronchogenic cysts {{arise from}} an {{abnormal}} budding of the ventral diverticulum of the foregut or the thracheobronchial tree during embryogenesis. An intrapericardial location {{is an extremely}} rare finding. Symptoms are related to cardiac structure compression, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>case</b> they remain asymptomatic. We present a case of intrapericardial bronchogenic cyst in a young patient, resected entirely with repair of right lateral proximal ascending aorta with PTFE graft...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{presents}} results which {{demonstrate that}} radiated emissions from heatsinks are reduced by an amount that {{depends upon the}} distribution and impedance of the grounding structure. Results are also presented which show the effect on radiated emissions {{of the presence of}} conductors (e. g. PCB tracks) passing under the heatsink. The presence of conductors reduces the effectiveness of the heatsink grounding <b>but,</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>case,</b> emissions at high frequencies do not exceed those without conductors attached...|$|R
2500|$|Traditionally has {{accordion}} {{been the}} major instrument in iskelmä music {{and it is}} still played, <b>but</b> has <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> been replaced by [...] guitar, electric piano and synthesizer. These, with drums, electric bass and occasional use of saxophone form the basic instrumentation of iskelmä.|$|R
5|$|The {{practice}} {{became more}} common in the 4th century BC and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as Delphi and Dodona. They primarily date to the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the 1st century AD. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the 2nd century BC in the island of Thasos. It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> the documentation deals with a voluntary act {{on the part of the}} master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).|$|E
5|$|On April 17, 2014, Stanislaus National Forest {{issued an}} order closing the {{majority}} of the burn area to the public through November 18, 2014, citing safety issues from potential falls of heavily burned trees, rock falls, and uneven ground. The decision was met with disappointment by morel mushroom hunters who had looked forward to extensive post-fire fruiting of this highly sought-after mushroom. The safety rationale was questioned, as Yosemite National Park, which largely prohibits mushroom collecting, had opened up the burn areas within its boundaries to the public earlier in the month. Some mushroom hunters stated that {{they would be willing to}} sign liability waivers in order to enter the area, but the Forest Service rejected this idea, stating they were ultimately responsible for the safety of those entering the area. Extensive harvesting of morels in the Rim Fire area nevertheless took place in May 2014, in a few cases legally by special permit, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> through illegal harvesting. The closure of the burn area was also criticized by the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors for, among other reasons, causing the cancellation of grazing allotments by local ranchers.|$|E
25|$|This {{combination}} of factors limits roads carrying only automobile commuters to a maximum observed capacity of about 3,000 passengers per hour per lane. The problem can be mitigated by introducing high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and ride-sharing programs, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> the solution adopted has been to add more lanes to the roads.|$|E
50|$|A {{range is}} not so easily defined, <b>but</b> is <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> what exists {{when there is no}} {{discernible}} trend. It is defined by its floor and its ceiling, which are always subject to debate. A range can also be referred to as a horizontal channel.|$|R

25|$|Rapid {{changes in}} technology, changes in media (tapes, software, MP3), falling prices, and planned {{obsolescence}} {{have resulted in}} a fast-growing surplus of electronic waste around the globe. Technical solutions are available, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases,</b> a legal framework, a collection, logistics, and other services need to be implemented before a technical solution can be applied.|$|E
25|$|No {{matter what}} {{approach}} one takes to classifying a plot sequence in the series—be it geographical or character-based—the {{key element of}} the series to comprehend is that the events depicted in its now voluminous works are not taking place in a vacuum, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> are concurrent with developments {{in other parts of}} the European center.|$|E
25|$|The court {{rejected}} {{a lawsuit filed}} against the minister by {{the father of a}} schoolgirl who was suspended for refusing to remove the niqāb. Dozens of schoolgirls were suspended since the ban was issued, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> the courts have overruled the schools' decision. The well-known Islamist lawyer, Montasser el-Zayat, tried and won over twenty-five niqāb-related cases in the lower courts.|$|E
5000|$|The early Orthodox {{church of}} Sicily was Byzantine {{and part of}} the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Under Muslim rule, from around 827 until the 1060s, Christians in Sicily, like Jews, became a subjugated people, mildly persecuted and highly taxed <b>but</b> allowed, <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases,</b> to {{practice}} their religion and professions. [...] In Palermo alone there were twenty Orthodox Churches.|$|R
50|$|In his 20 {{years in}} Congress, Borski rose {{to become the}} second-ranking Democrat on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He was {{generally}} classed as a liberal Democrat, <b>but</b> opposed abortion <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{variations}} of the melody are <b>in</b> use, <b>but</b> the lyrics <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> stay the same (i.e., repeating Mnohaya lita). It remains {{an integral part of}} Ukrainian diaspora culture long after assimilation.|$|R
25|$|The united councils {{were based}} in the {{facilities}} of the largest TLA {{in the region and}} largely dependent on the TLAs for resources. They were allowed to levy rates <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> had minimal operating budgets (below $100,000 per annum). The notable exception was Canterbury, where the united council had a number of responsibilities. Only one united council undertook any direct operational activity – a forestry project in Wanganui.|$|E
25|$|Insect {{migration}} is the seasonal movement of insects, particularly those by species of dragonflies, beetles, butterflies and moths. The distance {{can vary from}} species to species, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> these movements involve large numbers of individuals. In some cases the individuals that migrate in one direction may not return and the next generation may instead migrate in the opposite direction. This is a significant difference from bird migration.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{construction}} {{boom of the}} late 1970s, relatively few modern buildings had been constructed. In {{many parts of the}} center, elegant nineteenth-century houses built around a central patio were still to be seen in 1990. In some cases, the patio was open to the air, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> it was covered by a skylight, some of which were made of elaborate stained glass. Few of these houses were used for single-family occupancy, however, and many had been converted into low-cost apartments.|$|E

50|$|In Congress, Bonior {{generally}} had {{a progressive}} voting record, <b>but</b> opposed abortion <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases.</b> <b>In</b> 1991 he strongly supported recognition of Ukraine {{as an independent}} nation and was critical of the Bush administration on that matter.|$|R
30|$|Traditional {{small-scale}} {{experiments are}} more resource efficient compared to full-scale experiments, <b>but</b> it is <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> {{not possible to}} conduct a complete scaling of all dimensionless groups simultaneously. Consequently systematic errors can be introduced when the results are scaled up.|$|R
25|$|This {{definition}} of immortality {{has been challenged}} in the Handbook of the Biology of Aging, because the increase in rate of mortality {{as a function of}} chronological age may be negligible at extremely old ages, an idea referred to as the late-life mortality plateau. The rate of mortality may cease to increase in old age, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> that rate is typically very high. As a hypothetical example, there is only a 50% chance of a human surviving another year at age 110 or greater.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no {{medications}} available to treat amnesia, underlying medical conditions can be treated to improve memory. Such conditions include {{but are not limited}} to low thyroid function, liver or kidney disease, stroke, depression, bipolar disorder and blood clots in the brain. Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome involves a lack of thiamin and replacing this vitamin by consuming thiamin-rich foods such as whole-grain cereals, legumes (beans and lentils), nuts, lean pork, and yeast. Treating alcoholism and preventing alcohol and illicit drug use can prevent further damage, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> will not recover lost memory.|$|E
25|$|A {{diving suit}} is a garment or device {{designed}} to protect a diver from the underwater environment. A diving suit may also incorporate a breathing gas supply (i.e. Standard diving dress or atmospheric diving suit). <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> applies only to the environmental protective covering worn by the diver. The breathing gas supply is usually referred to separately. There is no generic term for the combination of suit and breathing apparatus alone. It is generally referred to as diving equipment or dive gear along with any other equipment necessary for the dive.|$|E
30|$|Type 3 (44 students) is {{characterized}} by field dependence, long response time, reliance on outside help, ability to highlight key information. These students did the embedded figures test tasks quite slowly, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> of the <b>cases</b> correctly.|$|R
50|$|Widespread {{public access}} to {{recordings}} is an admirable goal for archives, <b>but</b> is unrealistic <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> considering current copyright policy.

40|$|The clinical, {{radiological}} and histological {{characteristics of}} 31 symptomatic residual radieular cysts are compared and contrasted with 39 asymptomatic residual cysts. Differences {{in size and}} site incidence are demonstrated along with an inversely proportional relationship between radiographic cortication and degree of acute inflammation in the cyst wall. A number of possible aetiological factors, to account for initiation of active inflammation in deeply placed residual cysts have been examined and excluded, <b>but</b> explanation, <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases,</b> remains paradoxical...|$|R
25|$|Medical imaging may be {{indicated}} in pregnancy because of pregnancy complications, intercurrent diseases or routine prenatal care. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without MRI contrast agents {{as well as}} obstetric ultrasonography are not associated with any risk for the mother or the fetus, and are the imaging techniques of choice for pregnant women. Projectional radiography, X-ray computed tomography and nuclear medicine imaging result in some degree of ionizing radiation exposure, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> the absorbed doses are not associated with harm to the baby. At higher dosages, effects can include miscarriage, birth defects and intellectual disability.|$|E
25|$|Practically all early {{respirators}} {{consisted of}} a bag placed completely over the head, fastened around the throat with windows through which the wearer could see. Some were rubber, some were made of rubberized fabric, and still others of impregnated fabric, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> a tank of compressed air or a reservoir of air under slight pressure was carried by the wearer to supply the necessary breathing air. In some devices certain means were provided for the adsorption of carbon dioxide in exhaled air and the rebreathing of the same air many times; in other cases valves allowed exhalation of used air.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} {{trait of}} Argentine rock is its uncompromising stance to only use Spanish language lyrics. Rock music {{is made in}} many languages around the world, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>cases</b> it shares the lyrical creative pen with English. The Argentine rock movement {{was one of the}} first non-English forms of rock to be commercially successful overseas. Today it's rare for an Argentine rock band to sing in a foreign language as happens in other nations, even within Latin America and Spain (except to convey a sense of artistic freedom, or in an attempt to isolate their message or aesthetic). Argentine rock today is a blanket term describing a number of rock styles and sub-cultures within Argentina.|$|E
50|$|In a broad sense, global {{movements}} such as communism, {{socialism and}} the green movement have some transnational qualities, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> such <b>cases</b> the party organization is separate in each country, with the transnational aspect being one more of consultatation and coordination, often through political internationals. One notable exception to this rule is the Progressive Labor Party (United States), which views proletarian internationalism as requiring that they set up party collectives all over the globe. Some Trotskyist parties behave similarly.|$|R
