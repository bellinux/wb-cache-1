40|$|Aims Cardiac arrest (CA) is an {{indication}} for defibrillator (ICD) implantation unless it occurs {{in the context of}} an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). We investigated the ventricular arrhythmia (VA) -free survival of patients resuscitated from CA in the setting of AMI. Methods We reviewed a database of 1600 AMI and CA survivors from which 48 patients were identified as having concurrent CA and AMI (CA+AMI group). Those patients were matched by age, gender, race, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to 96 patients with AMI <b>but</b> no <b>CA</b> (AMI group) and 48 patients with <b>CA</b> <b>but</b> no AMI (<b>CA</b> group). Results Patients and controls were followed for 3. 9 ± 3. 2 years. Patients in the 3 groups had similar baseline characteristics (age 63 ± 14 yrs, 78 % men, 98 % white, 53 % with CAD, LVEF 33 ± 14 %). The 5 -year VA-free survival was 67 %, 92 %, and 80 % for the CA+AMI, AMI, and CA groups, respectively, p< 0. 001. Conclusions Patients with concurrent CA and AMI are at high risk of recurrent VA, with VA-free survival rates significantly worse than those of patients with AMI <b>but</b> no <b>CA,</b> and comparable to those of patients with CA outside the context of an AMI. Accordingly, these patients should be considered for ICD implantation...|$|R

The Drivewise app rewards safe driving by analyzing speed, braking, and time of day to calculate cash rewards and/or savings on a customer’s auto insurance premium. The app provides feedback on each trip taken and offers tips for safe driving. As of May 2016, Drivewise is available in 48 of 50 states plus D.C. (all <b>but</b> <b>CA,</b> NC). The majority of states offer Drivewise through the app, while seven states (AK, FL, IN, MA, NY, OH, WA) currently only offer it through a car plug-in device. After downloading the Drivewise app and enabling location services, Drivewise will automatically detect trips. Both Allstate and non-Allstate customers can download the Drivewise app {{and use it to}} receive safe driving tips as well as Allstate Rewards points, which can be redeemed for savings on brand-name merchandise through a separate website.|$|E
5000|$|The two fleets {{gradually}} closed {{over the}} next two days, hampered by light winds. Favourable winds on the evening of 12 March caused the British to form a line of battle, but the French bore away. Heavy squalls blew up during the night of 12 March, causing the 74-gun [...] to carry away her maintopmast. She received permission to leave the fleet in company with a frigate, and made for Gourjean roads where she met the captured Berwick, also with a frigate in company, and together they made their way to Toulon, taking no further part in the battle. By dawn on 13 March, and with the French still declining an action, Hotham gave the signal for a general chase. As the British closed on the French, taking advantage of the fresh breeze, the third-most ship in the French rear, the 80-gun , collided with the ship in front of her, the 80-gun Victoire. Victoire was slightly damaged, <b>but</b> <b>Ça</b> Ira lost her fore and main topmasts as a result, causing her to lag behind.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in {{patients}} with benign and malignant ovarian cysts, serum samples and ovarian intracystic fluids {{for the presence of}} tumor markers such as CA 125, CA 15. 3, tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), CA 19. 9 and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). MATERIAL AND METHOD: We studied overall 64 patients with ovarian pathology. Sixteen patients were affected by functional cysts, 28 women by benign cystic tumors and 20 by cystoadenocarcinomas. RESULTS: Average serum levels of all <b>but</b> <b>CA</b> 15. 3, TPA and CEA tumor markers of benign cystic ovarian tumors were higher than those of functional cysts. All <b>but</b> <b>CA</b> 19. 9 mean intracystic fluid markers levels were more elevated in benign tumors than in functional cysts. In patients with malignant cystic tumors, all but CEA mean serum marker levels were higher than those of benign tumors; furthermore even all mean intracystic levels of markers were more elevated than those of benign tumors. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the high positivity of tumor markers such as CA 125, CA 15. 3, TPA, CA 19. 9 and CEA in both the serum and intracystic fluid of patients with malignant epithelial ovarian tumors...|$|E

40|$|In Dictyostelium discoideum, {{extracellular}} K+ or Ca 2 + at {{a concentration}} of 40 or 20 mM, respectively, facilitates motility in the absence or presence of a spatial gradient of chemoattractant. Facilitation results in maximum velocity, cellular elongation, persistent translocation, suppression of lateral pseudopod formation, and myosin II localization in the posterior cortex. A lower threshold concentration of 15 mM K+ or Na or 5 mM Ca 2 + is required for chemotactic orientation. Although the common buffer solutions used by D. discoideum researchers to study chemotaxis contain sufficient concentrations of cations for chemotactic orientation, the majority contain insufficient levels to facilitate motility. Here it has been demonstrated that Nhe 1, a plasma membrane protein, is required for K+ <b>but</b> not <b>Ca</b> 2 + facilitation of cell motility and for the lower K+ <b>but</b> not <b>Ca</b> 2 + requirement for chemotactic orientation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAt enzyme {{concentrations}} above 40 nM {{the configuration}} of the purified plasma membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase is that of calmodulin-insensitive dimers. Dilution of the enzyme generates progressively higher proportions of calmodulin-sensitive monomers with lower Vmax and Ca 2 + sensitivity than the dimeric enzyme. Dimerization from monomeric state had not been documented before. We investigated whether concentration by volume exclusion, obtained by addition of a large molecular weight dextran to a monomeric Ca 2 +-ATPase would elicit dimer-like behavior. Dextran induced self-association of monomers, as monitored by fluorescence energy transfer, <b>but</b> the <b>Ca</b> 2 + sensitivity of the re-associated monomers was lower than that of the native dimers. These results suggest that the self-association reaction is structurally but not functionally reversible, and also document the existence of a hitherto unknown kinetic state of the oligomerized Ca 2 +-ATPase, with high Vmax <b>but</b> low <b>Ca</b> 2 +-sensitivity...|$|R
30|$|Sugarbaker advocates {{measuring}} CEA levels {{but does}} not report data on his patients’ levels. A few authors have retrospectively reported the levels of CEA and CA 19 - 9 [19]. These data indicate only that levels of CEA, and perhaps CA 19 - 9, are frequently raised in patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei. In a report of four patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei and mucinous ovarian tumors, three also had elevated CA 125 levels [20]. In our patient, CEA and CA 19 - 9 levels were normal, <b>but</b> <b>CA</b> 125 was slightly increased. These changes were not specific for any diagnosis.|$|E
