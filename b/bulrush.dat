5|$|The {{saltmarsh}} contains glassworts {{and common}} cord {{grass in the}} most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea plantain and other common marsh plants. The drier areas contain maritime grasses such as sea couch grass and sea poa grass. The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common <b>bulrush</b> also common in the various wetland habitats.|$|E

The reedbeds are dominated by common reed with saltmarsh rush, brackish water crowfoot, sea clubrush and common <b>bulrush</b> also common in the various wetland habitats. The coastal pastures at Cley and the adjacent Salthouse Marshes have jointleaf rush, common silverweed and less common grasses such as annual beard grass, marsh foxtail and slender hare's-ear. The site is generally rich in plants, especially those that can cope with saline environments, but three species {{appear to have been}} lost: divided sedge was last recorded in 1999, grey hair-grass in 1982 and lax-flowered sea lavender in 1977. Lichens are not suited to the prevailing habitat, but the nationally rare soot lichen occurs on untreated wood. The locally rare bryophyte Heim's pottia occurs in the saltmarsh, and the coastal variety piliferum of cuspidate earth-moss is found at Salthouse.|$|E

25|$|The {{materials}} for baskets were sedge root, willow shoots and roots, <b>bulrush</b> or blackroot, redbud shoots, sometimes bracken fern {{and a variety}} of colorful bird feathers, abalone and other types of shells, magnesite beads and sometimes glass beads. Redbud shoots, used for the darker reddish colors in basket designs are gathered in October. Good redbud is hard to obtain around Ukiah, so it is usually found at Clear Lake. All these materials are gathered with a thankful heart and the gatherers talk continuously to the plants. They were, after all, living things that were giving themselves for something useful and beautiful. In order to preserve the soil and creek banks, sedge gathering was done with care. The commonly held decision would be leaving behind about half of what was found. Dyeing of the <b>bulrush</b> root takes about three to six months in a concoction of black walnuts, rusty metal and ashes in water.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate in}} the area is humid {{continental}} climate, characterized by temperate to hot summers and cold, occasionally severe winters with regular precipitation. The vegetation is dominated by a mixture of coniferous and deciduous forests and treeless coastal meadows and cliffs. The major forest trees are pine, spruce, birch, willows, rowan, aspen, common and gray alder. In the far {{eastern part of the}} gulf vegetation of the marshy areas consists mainly of <b>bulrush</b> and reeds, as well as fully aquatic plants, such as white and yellow waterlilies and acute sedge. Aquatic plants in the shallow waters of the gulf include Ruppia and spiny naiad.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the marsh}} {{supported}} an extremely diverse wetlands ecosystem, {{with a variety}} of primary productivity plants including pickleweed, eelgrass and giant <b>bulrush</b> (Scirpus californiens). There has also been historically significant fish, mammal, amphibian and avafauna. The marsh is a significant element within the Pacific Flyway providing resting and feeding areas for migratory birds. As of 2006 this ecosystem has been significantly compromised by fill, levee formation, dredging and other development; estimates generally state that 75 percent of the original biological productivity of the marsh has been destroyed. However, it remains a significant habitat and is subject to meaningful wetland restoration activity, that is being actively evaluated as of the 2000-2006 timeframe.|$|E

25|$|Mexican {{handcrafted}} {{toys are}} mostly miniature representations {{of things in}} life, such as birds, furniture, mermaids, bullfighting scenes, carts and much more, made with materials on hand such as <b>bulrush,</b> wood, cloth, clay and lead. They were mostly made for children of the Mexican underclasses. They are considered artistic not because of originality but rather the ingenuity of creating something special from practically nothing. These toys, most of which that survive are from the 19th and early 20th century are increasingly valued by collectors but are in disdain among the general Mexican populace. Since the 1950s, with the influence of movies and television, most children stopped wanting these types of toys for mass products produced abroad and {{based on what they}} see in media.

25|$|Amargosa voles {{have very}} {{specific}} habitat requirements. They live only along the Amargosa River in its associated tributary and marsh ecosystems on land {{with less than}} a 20 percent grade. The marshes in which they reside are typically one to five acres in size. Their habitat is unique; the landscape is a matrix of spring-fed marshes and tributaries that are naturally fragmented and isolated by inhospitable desert terrain. This subspecies requires permanent standing water and medium to dense vegetation. It is evident that the dominant plant preferred by this subspecies is <b>bulrush</b> (Scirpus olneyi), however, other plant species are also frequently found in ecosystems where Amargosa voles are known to live, including seepweed (Suaeda torreyana), arrowweed (Pluchea sericea), quailbush (Atriplex lentiformis), southern reed (Phragmites australis), and saltgrass (Distichlis spicata). It is estimated that there are only 247 acres of land that meets the habitat requirements of the Amargosa vole within their range.|$|E
25|$|Common {{plants in}} the Little Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} include conifer and hardwood trees, herbs, legumes, and grasses. The {{plants in the}} Little Nescopeck Creek watershed are fairly typical for the Ridge-and-Valley province. Resident deciduous trees in the watershed include five species of oak, one species of cherry, five species of maple, one species of walnut, two species of hickory, and four species of birch, two species of dogwood, and one species each of basswood, poplar, ash, and beech. All but four of these trees {{are found in the}} creek's riparian zone. Coniferous trees in the watershed include three species of pine, two species of spruce, and one species of hemlock. Four of these species are found in the creek's riparian zone. There are also 16 species of legumes, grasses, and weeds, seven species of bushes, and six species of perennials. All of the bushes and perennials, and seven of the grasses are found in Little Nescopeck Creek's riparian zone. There are also a number of aquatic plants in Little Nescopeck Creek. These include <b>bulrush,</b> pondweed, duckweed, waterweed, and some types of algae, all of which are typical for a stream in the eastern United States.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 This study {{investigated}} the effect of plant surface area (plant density) on the efficiency of organic carbon removal in a bench-scale constructed wetland. Constructed wetlands are commonly assumed to be biofilm reactors in which organic carbon removal occurs primarily through sedimentation and aerobic degradation by attached microbial biofilms. In conventional biofilm reactors, aerobic degradation of organic carbon {{is proportional to the}} amount of surface area for microbial attachment, provided that sufficient oxygen is available. In contrast, current design equations for constructed wetlands assume that the amount of surface area is not an important parameter. A bench-scale simulation of a constructed wetland was conducted, using <b>bulrushes</b> planted at varying plant densities in soil with a free water surface depth of about 0. 27 m. The carbon source was diluted ENSUR (TM). Total organic carbon (TOC) removal was measured. Concentration of TOC was correlated with biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). Tests were conducted in conditions of light and dark, and under two different carbon loadings. Performance of <b>bulrushes</b> was compared with that of inert acrylic rods. The rate of carbon removal by mature <b>bulrushes</b> was found to increase with increasing plant density until oxygen became depleted. Higher densities degraded carbon at rates much faster than those predicted by current design equations. Young <b>bulrushes</b> degraded carbon at faster rates than mature <b>bulrushes.</b> Once oxygen was depleted, rates of degradation were reduced to rates anticipated by current models.
