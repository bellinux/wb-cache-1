5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of the Civil War, McClellan became active in politics, supporting the presidential campaign of Democrat Stephen A. Douglas in the 1860 election. He claimed to have defeated an attempt at vote fraud by Republicans <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> the delay of a train that was carrying men to vote illegally in another county, enabling Douglas to win the county.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>ordering</b> {{the display}} of one part of Koppány's {{quartered}} corpse in Gyulafehérvár, {{the seat of his}} maternal uncle, Gyula the Younger, Stephen asserted his claim to reign all lands dominated by Hungarian lords. He also decided to strengthen his international status by adopting the title of king. However, the exact circumstances of his coronation and its political consequences are subject to scholarly debate.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, more {{resistance}} movements {{supported by}} Ethiopia's communist Derg administration had sprung {{up across the}} country. Barre responded <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> punitive measures against those he perceived as locally supporting the guerillas, especially in the northern regions. The clampdown included bombing of cities, with the northwestern administrative center of Hargeisa, a Somali National Movement (SNM) stronghold, among the targeted areas in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disagreement}} {{as to whether}} Craig was deserving of the captaincy, the team proceeded smoothly without infighting. Prior to the Fifth Test, Craig wanted to drop himself due to poor form, which would have made Harvey captain. Peter Burge, the third member of the selection panel and a Harvey supporter, was comfortable with this, but Harvey relinquished his opportunity to seize the leadership <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> Burge to retain Craig. When the vote was formally taken, Harvey and Burge outvoted Craig, who was still offering to drop himself.|$|E
5|$|Enterprise {{heads to}} Andoria after Ambassador Soval informs {{them that the}} Vulcans believe they have been {{developing}} Xindi weapon technology. Soval guides Enterprise to a nebula where the Andorian fleet is hiding. Commander Shran is dubious, and abducts and tortures Soval. After believing him, Enterprise joins a fleet of six Andorian ships to intercept the Vulcans. Commander Tucker attempts to buy time <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> Enterprise directly between the two fleets — this works for a while until Administrator V'Las orders them to be targeted too.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{promptly}} responded <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two Chevau-léger (lancer) regiments in the I Corps light cavalry division. Disorganized {{and milling}} about {{the bottom of}} the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the countercharge of Milhaud's cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.|$|E

5|$|The Anglos in Texas began {{agitating}} for {{war against}} Santa Anna, and Bowie worked with William B. Travis, {{the leader of}} the War Party, to gain support. Bowie visited several Indian villages in East Texas in an attempt to persuade the reluctant tribes to fight against the Mexican government. Santa Anna responded to the rumblings <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> large numbers of Mexican troops to Texas.|$|E
5|$|The Austrians briefly {{took the}} {{advantage}} {{when they moved}} a battery from the ridge north of the village to cover their infantry; the fire from the battery allowed the infantry to deploy {{at right angles to}} their original front. Frederick responded <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> the last of his reserved left wing to advance, but the Austrian battery drove it back. Finally, Frederick's heavy cannons on the Butterberg, a small knoll to the west of town, laid down a barrage. Some participants said it was this barrage, more than the Prussian infantry, which won the battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{debate over}} the {{proposed}} national constitution became moot when news of Italian troop movements in Tyrol and near the Venetian border reached Vienna in April 1866. The Austrian government ordered partial mobilization in the southern regions; the Italians responded <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> full mobilization. Despite calls for rational thought and action, Italy, Prussia, and Austria continued to rush toward armed conflict. On 1 May, Wilhelm gave von Moltke command over the Prussian armed forces, {{and the next day}} he began full-scale mobilization.|$|E

50|$|Once in Castile, Eleanor {{continued}} with her disruptive behavior, this time against her nephew King Peter I. Her youngest son, John of Aragon, {{was assassinated in}} Bilbao on 12 June 1358 <b>by</b> <b>order</b> of his cousin the Castilian sovereign, and one year later (March/April 1359), she was murdered in the castle of Castrojeriz <b>by</b> <b>order</b> of her nephew.

5|$|Three years later, a Macedonian {{fleet of}} 38 vessels was sent across by Philip V, while the larger {{warships}} sailed around Cape Malea. After his victory at Actium in 31BC, Octavian advanced {{as fast as}} possible against Marc Antony <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> part of his 260 Liburnians to be carried over the Isthmus. In 868AD, the Byzantine admiral Niketas Oryphas had his whole fleet of one hundred dromons dragged across the Isthmus in a quickly executed operation, but this took place most likely on a different route.|$|E
5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E
5|$|After Congress adjourned on August 6, 1861, Burnett {{returned}} home to Cadiz and spoke {{at a number of}} pro-Southern rallies. On September 4, 1861, Confederate Major General Leonidas Polk violated Kentucky's neutrality <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> Brigadier General Gideon Johnson Pillow to occupy Columbus. In response, Ulysses S. Grant captured Paducah on September 6, 1861. With neutrality no longer a tenable option, Burnett presided over a conference of Kentucky's Southern sympathizers that occurred at Russellville between October 29 and October 31, 1861. The self-appointed delegates to this conference called for a sovereignty convention on November 18, 1861 for the purpose of establishing a Confederate government for the state.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conflict}} ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> the re-fortification of Athens, and his perceived arrogance began to alienate {{him from the}} Athenians. In 472 or 471BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now saw an opportunity to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered {{the service of the}} Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465-424 BC). He was made governor of Magnesia, and lived there {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|After the war, he {{commanded}} the 92nd Gordon Highlanders at Jamaica—where he scandalised his regiment <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> them to adopt trousers {{instead of the}} kilt—and the 90th Light Infantry in the Ionian Islands, before retiring from active duty in 1829. He then held a number of administrative roles in Ireland, including the state secretary to the Lord-Lieutenant and the commissioner of police in Ulster, and after the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 became a palace courtier. His final military role was the (ceremonial) colonelcy of the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment, which he held from 1848 until his death.|$|E
5|$|Albanian {{intelligence}} groups informed Skanderbeg—the main {{leader of}} the revolt—that a large Ottoman army was preparing to march into Albania, the number of which was reported by some as being as high as 170,000. This army, however, {{is likely to have}} contained no more than 80,000 soldiers. Nevertheless, Murad marched his army into Monastir. Skanderbeg urgently called for material aid Venice. The answer, however, was negative. Instead, the only aid received came from the Neapolitans and the Ragusans. Nonetheless, Murad soon marched into Ohrid and Black Drin valley, traveling near Svetigrad. In response, Skanderbeg strengthened the garrisons of Krujë, Stellushi, Svetigrad, and Berat <b>by</b> <b>ordering</b> the populations around these fortress to take up arms.|$|E
