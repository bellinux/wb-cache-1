25|$|The {{threshold}} for stimulation of bitter taste by quinine averages {{a concentration of}} 8 μM (8 micromolar). The taste thresholds of other bitter substances are rated relative to quinine, which is thus given a reference index of 1.

The most bitter substance known is the synthetic chemical denatonium, which has an index of 1,000.

In Chapter 1, the generation of a number of <b>brucine</b> derivatives is described. Taking the advantage of brucine-diol’s excellent molecular recognition capability for multiple organic functional groups, we focused on the synthetic modifications of brucine-diol and the synthesis of <b>brucine</b> N-oxide. We also produced various <b>brucine</b> derivatives with different functional moieties in good yields and selectivities. In Chapter 2, we described the investigation of <b>brucine</b> N-oxide catalyzed Morita-Baylis-Hillman (MBH) reaction of alkyl/aryl ketones. <b>Brucine</b> N-oxide was used as a nucleophilic organic catalyst in the MBH reaction of alkyl vinyl ketone. In addition, asymmetric MBH reactions of alkyl vinyl ketones with aldehydes were investigated using a dual catalysis of <b>brucine</b> N-oxide and proline. In this dual catalyst system, proline was found to form iminium intermediates with electron-deficient aryl aldehydes, while the N-oxide activated vinyl ketones provided enolates through the conjugate addition. Our dual catalysis approach also allowed the development of MBH reaction of aryl vinyl ketones. In Chapter 3, <b>brucine</b> diol-copper complex catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of glycine (ket) imines to nitroalkenes is discussed. Stereodivergent catalytic asymmetric conjugate reactions for glycine (ket) imines with nitroalkenes were achieved using various chiral catalysts derived from a single chiral source, <b>brucine</b> diol. Both syn- and anti-conjugate addition products were obtained with high diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity. In Chapter 4, enantiodivergent production of endo-pyrrolidines from glycine (ket) imines using <b>brucine</b> diol-copper complex is described. The [3 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of glycine imines and activated alkenes was performed to produce endo-pyrrolidines. The reversal of enantioselectivity was observed for endo-pyrrolidines between concerted and stepwise reaction pathways. The three new <b>brucine</b> derivatives produced in this study would potentially work as organocatalysts and chiral ligands with metal ion in asymmetric synthesis. The <b>brucine</b> diol-metal complex catalyzed reactions laid a good foundation for catalytic asymmetric reactions, where a single chiral source was used to control the absolute and the relative stereochemical outcomes of reactions.

This effect is indicative of a positive allosteric action.
