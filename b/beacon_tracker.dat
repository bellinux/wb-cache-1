30|$|Several radio {{systems are}} {{employed}} for (classical) communications. A UHF dipole array {{is used for}} tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&C) and provides redundancy for low-speed data transmission (100  kb/s). An S-band patch antenna is used for high-speed uplink (nominally 1  Mb/s). For high speed downlink of mission data, X-band CubeSat transmitters are commercially available and provide up to 100  Mb/s data rate [37]. A GPS patch antenna is also incorporated into a face of the CubeSat. Space-rated GPS systems enable tracking of position and velocity to metre and sub-m.s− 1 accuracy respectively [38]. Onboard GPS enables precise orbital determination and calibration of two-line element measurements, necessary for the OGS to initially acquire the satellite and also for the ADCS to point the transmitter telescope towards the OGS to enable the optical <b>beacon</b> <b>tracker</b> (OBT) to lock onto the beacon sent up by the OGS.|$|E
40|$|A Separated Spacecraft Interferometer (SSI) Demonstration Mission {{with three}} {{spacecraft}} {{has been proposed}} for flight under the NASA New Millennium Technology Development Program. Both the rotation rate of the interferometer about the normal to the plane containing the three spacecraft and the orientation in the plane must be determined accurately in order to permit the detection of white light fringes from sources that have visual magnitudes as high as possible. It presently is planned to use signals from tracking the science object plus other auxiliary information to determine the interferometer rotation rate d@dt and the angular position 0. We have investigated a possible supplementary approach that makes use of a combined <b>beacon</b> <b>tracker</b> and narrow-field star tracker {{on one of the}} two collector spacecraft. A very small beacon mounted on the other collector spacecraft can be viewed with respect to a reference star nearly 180 " away to determine d&dt and 0 for the interferometer. Beacordstar tracker observations over roughly an hour appear sufficient o determine the sweep rate for starlight fringes in the interferometer to adequate accuracy and to detect the fringes...|$|E
30|$|Incoming 532  nm {{beacon light}} sent from the OGS is {{separated}} from the outgoing beampath using a dichroic mirror, sent through an insertable narrow bandpass filter, to reduce stray light, and onward to the <b>beacon</b> <b>tracker</b> consisting of a modified star tracker. 10 During a frame, the defocussed image of the beacon is imaged onto a pixel array. The integration time is chosen to be short enough so that the image is not smeared. The deliberately defocussed point is spread across several pixels and the Gaussian intensity profile is determined from measurements of neighbouring pixels, a centroiding algorithm is then used to estimate the centre position of the beacon to sub-pixel accuracy. The accuracy by which this can be performed depends on the image {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR) but better than 1 / 40 -pixel precision is achievable for moderate levels of noise and 1 / 20 -pixel for high levels of noise [68]. We will drive the OBT at a high frame rate (∼ 300 Hz full array readout, ∼kHz with region-of-interest readout) in order to reduces the beacon frame interval and the possibility of image smear. To achieve sufficient SNR, the beacon power can be increased.|$|E
30|$|Individuals {{who need}} to let others know about their {{whereabouts}} could greatly benefit from the activation of a distress mode in their devices. While saving {{as much energy as}} possible (e.g. by turning off non-essential features), a distress mode could regularly send pulse signals, which could be composed of a sound, a flash, and a radio signal containing data with personal information of medical relevance and individual location. This feature could be based on existing Personal Locator <b>Beacons,</b> SPOT Personal <b>Trackers</b> and the Iridium satellite system (Baze 2012) and could be built based on Digital Distress Identifiers that are already used by medically impaired costumers and as personal emergency alerts in accidents, as well as personal, community, state and regional emergencies. Even if victims fell unconscious, this feature (which could be built-in to enable its activation manually, by a voice command or even remotely by another device using a secure protocol) would increase the possibilities of a successful rescue.|$|R
5000|$|Wheeljack was {{revealed}} {{to have survived}} the crash, and was held at Megatron's fortress on earth in [...] "Darkmount, NV". There, he was tortured and interrogated by Starscream. In [...] "Scattered", he escapes after being interrogated by Shockwave and being sentenced to death, unkowingly having been planted with a tracking beacon by Starscream. Wheeljack then rendezvous with Bulkhead and Miko, and reveals he found the <b>tracker</b> <b>beacon</b> under his chassis when he realized it had been too easy to escape. He then uses it to outwit Starscream and draw his seeker armada into a trap. In [...] "Prey", Wheeljack and Bulkhead attack a Decepticon mine, hoping to draw attention from other members of Team Prime. However, they and Miko are attacked by Predaking, who was sent by Shockwave to hunt them. Wheeljack lures the dragon-like Predacon into the mine, and detonates the charges. This only aggravates Predaking, and he gives chase as they are rescued by Arcee, Jack, and Ultra Magnus. Through use of terrain and tactical advantage, Predaking is bested and sent fleeing. There, they reunite with Ratchet, Bumblebee, Raphael, June Darby, and Agent Fowler, and prepare to strike back at Megatron, aided by the weapons given to them by Ultra Magnus.|$|R
30|$|Optical {{trackers}} {{are more}} {{widely used in}} high-end motion picture production, but this technique {{can be used for}} immersive virtual reality. These devices incorporate a camera system to track the motion. Optical trackers fall under three categories: beacon trackers, pattern recognition, and laser ranging [113]. Beacon trackers use markers placed on the user to track the motions of the user. These markers are usually LEDs or reflective materials. The camera tracks the position of the markers. With an array of markers, the orientation of the body parts may also be determined. The SELSPOT {{is an example of a}} <b>beacon</b> <b>tracker</b> [114]. It has 30 infrared LEDs that are tracked by a camera. The OPTOTRAK 3020 (Northern Digital Inc., Waterloo, Ontario, Canada) is another device that uses the same principle [115]. The system can track up to 256 infrared light pulses from a LED. The FlashPoint Model 3000 (Image Guided Surgery Technology Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) is a system that uses infrared LEDs and can track up to 360 markers per second. These two systems have been tested for computer-aided surgery capabilities. The DynaSight Sensor from Origin Instruments (Grand Prairie, TX, USA) uses an infrared camera to track markers that are placed on the user [116].|$|E
