While regular dwarves will <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> simple rooms provided to them, dwarves appointed or elected to noble positions {{will need more}} luxurious accommodation. Nobles will even make demands and , getting negative thoughts {{if they are not}} fulfilled. A justice system is present to punish criminals, for example, dwarves who injure or kill another dwarf or destroy furniture. Occasionally, a vampire dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with a migrant wave and start killing and feeding on the other citizens without being noticed.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of specific Final Fantasy characters {{was based on}} the opinions of both fans and staff. Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe. Initially, Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design, because he was unfamiliar with the backstory of such characters. For Kingdom Hearts II, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He has stated that with speculation, even though a game gets old, people can still <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> it.|$|E

25|$|Though BDSM {{in itself}} can be {{considered}} a sexual orientation or identity, and is considered one by some of its practitioners, the BDSM and kink scene is more often seen as a diverse pansexual community.
