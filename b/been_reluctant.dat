5|$|Newton had <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to publish}} his {{calculus}} because he feared controversy and criticism. He {{was close to}} the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier. In 1691, Duillier started to write a new version of Newton's Principia, and corresponded with Leibniz. In 1693, the relationship between Duillier and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.|$|E
5|$|The Judy Garland Show was an American musical variety {{television}} series that aired on CBS on Sunday nights during the 1963-1964 television season. Despite a sometimes stormy relationship with Judy Garland, CBS had found success with several television specials featuring the star. Garland, {{who for years}} had <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to commit to a weekly series, saw the show as her best chance to pull herself out of severe financial difficulties.|$|E

Tensions between the United States and Britain had been high for several months {{as a result of}} British interference in U.S. commerce with France. As early as 1810, British agents had sought to secure an alliance with Native Americans to assist in the defense of Canada should hostilities break out, but the Natives had <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to accept their offer, fearing they had little to benefit from such an arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Qiyas or analogical {{reason is}} the fourth source of the sharia for the {{majority}} of Sunni jurisprudence. It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision. Shiites do not accept analogy, but replace it with reason (aql); among Sunnis, the Hanbalites have traditionally <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to accept analogy while the Zahirites don't accept it at all. Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist, confronted with an unprecedented case, bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment, but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-year-old Crawford had <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to volunteer, {{but he did}} so at {{the request}} of General Irvine. Williamson, {{although}} popular with the militia, was in disfavor with regular army officers such as Irvine because he had allowed the Gnadenhütten massacre. Hoping to avoid a repetition, Irvine made it known that he favored Crawford's election as commander. The election, which was acrimonious, ended in a close vote: Crawford received 235 votes to Williamson's 230. Colonel Crawford took command, and Williamson became second-in-command with the rank of major. The other majors included John B. McClelland, Thomas Gaddis, and either James Brenton or Joseph Brinton.|$|E

5|$|By William's death, after {{weathering}} {{a series}} of rebellions, most of the native Anglo-Saxon aristocracy {{had been replaced by}} Norman and other continental magnates. Not all of the Normans who accompanied William in the initial conquest acquired large amounts of land in England. Some appear to have <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to take up lands in a kingdom that did not always appear pacified. Although some of the newly rich Normans in England came from William's close family or from the upper Norman nobility, others were from relatively humble backgrounds. William granted some lands to his continental followers from the holdings of one or more specific Englishmen; at other times, he granted a compact grouping of lands previously held by many different Englishmen to one Norman follower, often to allow for the consolidation of lands around a strategically placed castle.|$|E
5|$|Eusebius' {{understanding}} of the Arab peoples is informed by his reading of the Bible and {{his knowledge of the}} history of imperial Rome. He {{does not appear to have}} personally known any Arabs. In his Chronicon, all the Arabs that appear—save for one reference to Ishmael—figure in the political history of the first three centuries of the Christian era. To Eusebius, the Saracens of the 4th century are direct-line descendants of the biblical Ishmaelites, descendants of the handmaid, Hagar, and the patriarch, Abraham. They are thus outcasts, beyond God's Covenant with the favored son of Abraham, Isaac. The twin images of the Ishmaelite and the Saracen—outcasts and latrones, raiders of the frontiers—reinforce each other and give Eusebius' portrait of the Arab nation an unhappy color. He may have <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to associate the first Christian emperor with a people of such unfortunate ancestry.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise discretion in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{marriage}} of Mary's parents was in jeopardy. Disappointed {{at the lack of}} a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine annulled, but Pope Clement VII refused his request. Henry claimed, citing biblical passages (Leviticus 20:21), that his marriage to Catherine was unclean because she was the widow of his brother Arthur (Mary's uncle). Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated and so was not a valid marriage. Her first marriage had been annulled by a previous pope, Julius II, on that basis. Clement may have <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine's nephew and Mary's former betrothed, whose troops had surrounded and occupied Rome in the War of the League of Cognac.|$|E
5|$|On 25 September 1905, {{following}} lobbying by Ickenham Parish Council, the Metropolitan Railway {{opened a}} small halt on their line between Harrow and Uxbridge. The railway company had <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to open a}} station in the area due to a perceived lack of demand, and so a compromise was reached {{with the construction of}} the halt. The new stop brought with it travellers from London seeking a day out in rural surroundings. Nearby villagers sold flowers from their gardens and served teas to the visitors. The parish council later requested shelters for passengers on the platforms, which were built in December 1905, followed by a booking hut in 1910. The original platforms, too short to align with all train carriages, were extended in 1922. Ickenham Halt was rebuilt as a station in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Only {{recently}} {{promoted to}} {{general manager of}} the New Jersey system, Stanley had <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to take the position in London and took it for one year only, provided he would be free to return to America {{at the end of the}} year. He told the company's senior managers that the company was almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months. Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and public relations, he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around, while the company's chairman, Sir Edgar Speyer, renegotiated the debt repayments. In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the managing director.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} French and Spanish fleet under Villeneuve's command numbered 33 {{ships of}} the line. Napoleon Bonaparte had intended for Villeneuve to sail into the English Channel {{and cover the}} planned invasion of Britain, but the entry of Austria and Russia into the war forced Napoleon to call off the planned invasion and transfer troops to Germany. Villeneuve had <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to risk an engagement with the British, and this reluctance led Napoleon to order Vice Admiral François Rosily to go to Cádiz and take command of the fleet, sail it into the Mediterranean to land troops at Naples, before making port at Toulon. Villeneuve decided to sail the fleet out before his successor arrived. On 20 October 1805, the fleet was sighted making {{its way out of}} harbour by patrolling British frigates, and Nelson was informed that they appeared to be heading to the west.|$|E
5|$|The testimonies of explorers {{and colonial}} administrators {{demonstrate}} that Carabane {{has participated in}} rice cultivation, fishery, trade, and palm wine production for a long time. The rice cycle plays a central economic and religious role {{in the lives of}} the population. Palm oil and palm wine are very popular and traditional in the area. The fishery has long been dominated by artisan fishing, which supplies the daily needs of the island's population; however, broader economic possibilities have been exploited since the early 20th century. Although there have been attempts to cultivate a tourism industry on the island, the inhabitants have <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to participate. Carabane was added to the list of historic sites and monuments of Senegal in 2003.|$|E

5|$|Tyler {{had been}} drawn into Virginia {{politics}} even as a U.S. Senator. From October 1829 to January 1830, {{he served as a}} member of the state constitutional convention, a role which he had <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to accept. The original Virginia Constitution gave outsize influence to the state's more conservative eastern counties, as it allocated an equal number of legislators to each county (regardless of population) and only granted suffrage to property owners. The convention gave the more populous and liberal counties of western Virginia an opportunity to expand their influence. Tyler, a slaveowner from eastern Virginia, supported the existing system. He largely remained on the sidelines during the debate, however, not wishing to alienate any of the state's political factions. He was focused on his Senate career, which required a broad base of support, and gave speeches during the convention promoting compromise and unity.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache {{revisited}} {{the type}} specimens of S. tudes {{and found that}} the lectotype from Nice is likely not a smalleye hammerhead, but rather a fetal whitefin hammerhead (S. couardi, likely a synonym of the scalloped hammerhead, S. lewini). This would also explain the anomalous locality of the Nice specimen, as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas. By the rules of binomial nomenclature, Sphyra tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead, taking precedence over S. couardi, and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi. Taxonomists, though, have <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> to change the names again, preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes. For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to reject the Nice specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place. The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{probably}} {{in the vicinity of}} Strasbourg, the vanguard of Barbatio's army was ambushed by a strong German force as it approached the camp of Julian's deputy, Severus, who was apparently operating separately from Julian. The vanguard fled in disarray, and, instead of engaging, Barbatio led the rest of his force in a hasty retreat, under close pursuit by the Germans, out of Alsace and a good way into Raetia, in the process losing most of his sutlers, pack-animals and baggage. Then Barbatio, whose cooperation with Julian had <b>been</b> <b>reluctant</b> at best, withdrew his army from the theatre of operations altogether, without Julian's permission. He sent his forces across the Alps into winter-quarters in Italy, despite it being the middle of the campaigning season and the Alamanni being far from defeated or ejected from Alsace. This reduced Roman forces in Alsace by two-thirds and effectively sabotaged the pincer strategy. It is uncertain whether Constantius instigated Barbatio's actions, but it seems unlikely that the magister would have risked breaking off operations unless confident of the emperor's approval.|$|E
