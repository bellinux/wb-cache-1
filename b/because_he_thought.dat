5|$|Konteradmiral Miklós Horthy, {{commander}} of the proposed attack, cancelled the attack <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 Nansen {{passed his}} {{university}} entrance examination, the examen artium. He decided to study zoology, claiming {{later that he}} chose the subject <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it offered {{the chance of a}} life in the open air. He began his studies at the Royal Frederick University in Christiania early in 1881.|$|E
5|$|Despite Beckham's move {{to unseat}} McCreary in the Senate, {{the two were}} once again allies by 1911, when Beckham {{supported}} the aging McCreary for the party's gubernatorial nomination. It is unclear whether McCreary sought the reconciliation {{in order to secure}} the gubernatorial nomination or Beckham made amends with McCreary <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he could control McCreary's actions as governor. In the Democratic primary, McCreary defeated William Adams by a majority of 25,000 votes.|$|E
50|$|Kosovo's Communist Party {{suffered}} purges, {{with several}} key figures, including its president, expelled. Veli Deva replaced Bakalli <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was <b>thought</b> {{to have been}} harder on Tirana.|$|R
60|$|He {{was a man}} as got 'imself {{very much}} liked at fust, {{especially}} by the old ladies, owing to his being so perlite to them, {{that they used to}} 'old 'im up for an example to the other men, and say wot nice, pretty ways he 'ad. Joe Barlcomb was everything at fust, but when they got to 'ear that his perliteness was <b>because</b> <b>'e</b> <b>thought</b> 'arf of 'em was witches, and didn't know which 'arf, they altered their minds.|$|R
5000|$|The son {{was troubled}} by the {{prospect}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> could now be comfortable, but in the end, he obeyed. A tiny scrap of paper floated by when he had sunk the money; it contained six shillings.|$|R
5|$|During his {{operations}} in Isauria, Illus took Zeno's brother, Longinus, prisoner and {{kept him in}} an Isaurian fortress. <b>Because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he would have great influence over a restored Zeno, he changed sides and marched with Zeno towards Constantinople {{in the summer of}} 476. When Basiliscus received news of this danger, he hastened to recall his ecclesiastical edicts and to conciliate the Patriarch and the people, but it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Education in Zimbabwe became {{under threat}} since the {{economic}} changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike {{because of low}} pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger {{and the price of}} uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury. Teachers were also one of the main targets of Mugabe's attacks <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> they were not strong supporters.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins was ticketed on November 24, 2007, for {{suspicion}} of {{contributing to the}} delinquency of a minor and two alcohol charges, {{one of which was}} underage possession of alcohol. He was due in court for an arraignment on December 19, 2007. According to local news sources, he threatened to kill a local teenager, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> she had stolen his CD player. He was also convicted as a juvenile of a felony drug conviction while in foster care in Omaha.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the votes}} were counted, the herald {{announced}} the final result. In cases of a tie, {{the defendant was}} acquitted, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was <b>thought</b> to have got [...] "the vote of Athena".|$|R
5000|$|Yankovic {{told the}} Chicago Sun-Times in 2004, [...] "Last year, Eminem {{forced me to}} halt {{production}} on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody <b>because</b> <b>he</b> somehow <b>thought</b> {{that it would be}} harmful to his image or career." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you always}} go to church?" [...] he asked, {{grounding}} his question not on any impertinent curiosity as to her observance of her religious duties, but <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> from her dress she must certainly be a Quaker.|$|R
5|$|Reich and Ilse Ollendorff {{divorced}} in September 1951, ostensibly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{she had had}} an affair. She continued working with him for another three years. Even after the divorce, he suspected her of having affairs, and persuaded her to sign confessions about her feelings of fear and hatred toward him, which he locked away in the archives of his Orgone Institute. He wrote several documents denouncing her, while having an affair himself with Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Institute Press.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{originally}} wrote Veronica Mars as a {{young adult}} novel, featuring a male as the protagonist. He changed {{the gender of the}} protagonist <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> a noir piece told from a female point of view would be more interesting and unique. The original pilot script was darker in tone than the one filmed, and several details were changed. Although it ranked low in the ratings, the pilot was critically acclaimed and Bell's performance as the protagonist was praised.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} {{to take the}} crippled Szent István into tow by Tegetthoff, the ship continued to sink and the attempt was abandoned. A few minutes after 6:00am Szent István sank. Admiral Horthy, commander of the proposed attack, soon canceled the attack <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola. On the contrary, the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that {{they were no longer}} there. This was the last military operation that the Viribus Unitis was to take part in and she spent the rest of her career at port in Pola.|$|E

5|$|Robben was {{selected}} {{to play for the}} Netherlands at Euro 2012. He started in the first group stage match, a 1–0 loss to Denmark, in which he hit the post with a curled effort. In the next match, a 2–1 loss to Germany, he hopped over the advertising boards and walked the long way round after being subbed off for Dirk Kuyt <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he could have inspired the Netherlands to a win. After a 2–1 loss to Portugal, the Netherlands were knocked out with three straight defeats.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} lenses {{required by}} the Fat Man had to be fabricated. A small explosive plant was established at Los Alamos known as Site S, {{as it was a}} former sawmill. Groves was appalled at the work practices and safety at Site S, and considered it {{only a matter of time}} before it blew up. On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants. He had some misgivings about this, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that the Navy might err too far on the side of workplace safety.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Ripley, Hindman continued his law studies under Orlando Davis. A {{year after the}} war ended, Hindman's brother, Robert, engaged {{in a fight with}} William Falkner <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that Falkner had tried to block his membership into the Ripley section of the Sons of Temperance. Robert Hindman tried to defend himself, but his gun failed to fire, and Falkner then fatally stabbed him. Falkner was tried for murder, but was acquitted by the jury which ruled that he was acting in self-defense. Afterward, Falkner killed a family friend of the Hindmans, and he again was acquitted in the murder trial. Thomas Hindman and Falkner engaged in a gun fight, but neither man was injured. The tense relationship between Falkner and Hindman culminated in a settlement made by Matthew C. Galloway, who would later become the future editor of the Memphis, Tennessee Appeal.|$|E
6000|$|... § 15. Now observe, the Lombardic workman {{did not do}} {{all this}} <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> it out, as you and I are doing together; <b>he</b> never <b>thought</b> a bit about it. He simply saw the beast; saw it as plainly as you see the writing on this page, and of course could not be wrong in {{anything}} he told us of it.|$|R
5000|$|After the fight, Jackson {{loses his}} temper <b>because</b> <b>he</b> and White <b>thought</b> that Sene {{should have won}} the fight for doing more damage than Rivera.|$|R
60|$|The good bishop, to Aben-Ezra's surprise, {{seemed to}} treat the whole matter as {{infinitely}} amusing. He chuckled, smote {{his hand on his}} thigh, and nodded approval at every pause--perhaps to give the speaker courage--perhaps <b>because</b> <b>he</b> really <b>thought</b> that Raphael's prospects were considerably less desperate than he fancied....|$|R
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> he had heard rabbits outside. He had left it on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his readers would have been familiar with it, not <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it authentic.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice William Rehnquist noted {{early in}} the oral {{argument}} that the case presented two questions. First, whether the Ninth Circuit's ruling was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. Second, whether the state courts' ruling was objectively unreasonable according to AEDPA. California Deputy Attorney General Deborah Chuang argued that the Ninth Circuit's ruling was not consistent with precedent because the Supreme Court had never addressed using age {{as a factor in}} custody analysis. Associate Justice Stephen Breyer remarked that he thought a Supreme Court precedent was not necessary <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it obvious that age affects whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. John P. Elwood, at the time assistant to the Solicitor General, argued that age doesn't make a legal difference for Miranda purposes because it is a rule uniformly applied to all people and that police officers should not be required to get inside the head of each suspect.|$|E
60|$|What was worse, Lady Conway had paired {{them off}} {{in the order of}} precedence; and Louis was a victim to two dowagers, between whom he could neither see nor speak to Mary. He was the more concerned, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> her looking {{depressed}} and avoiding his eye.|$|R
60|$|The people {{crowded around}} him, {{demanding}} {{the tale of}} his adventures, and their surprise was only equaled by their horror when they learned he had been captured by a band of monkeys, and shut up in a cage <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was <b>thought</b> to be a dangerous wild beast.|$|R
50|$|In 1987, {{he assumed}} {{the manager of}} the Taiyo Whales, which was another Japanese {{professional}} baseball team, on a five-year contract <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was <b>thought</b> highly of {{as a result of his}} work with the Carp. However, he retired from the post at the end of the season of 1989 <b>because</b> <b>he</b> could not bring the team to the top-class.|$|R
5|$|Following Szent István {{being hit}} by torpedoes and Tegetthoff pulling out of formation, Tegetthoff {{attempted}} to take the crippled Szent István into tow. However this attempt, as well as training the ship's turrets and placing her crew to port as well as throwing any ready ammunition overboard failed and the battleship continued to sink. The attempt to tow Szent István was then abandoned. A few minutes after 6:00am Szent István capsized and sank. Admiral Horthy soon canceled the attack <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola.

5|$|Howard {{repeatedly}} questions Vaughn, {{believing he}} is {{acting as the}} fall guy for his two friends. Vaughn says nothing, but eventually writes a letter of apology to Ellison. Felton closes the case despite Howard's protests for more time to investigate. Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving life without parole. Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison, but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort because his wife is still dead. Howard tries to give Vaughn's letter to Ellison, but he refuses to accept it. Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison, where Vaughn admits he handled the gun during the stick-up <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{if he had the}} gun, he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt. Vaughn said he lost control of the robbery, and insists he needs to serve the life sentence to make amends. A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter.|$|E
50|$|James Joyce spent a {{night at}} Ljubljana railway station {{on his way to}} Trieste in October 1904, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> mistakenly <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> had arrived at his destination. In his honour, a small monument, created by the {{sculptor}} Jakov Brdar, was erected at Ljubljana railway station on Bloomsday in 2003.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the premiere}} at Cannes, {{the film was}} picked up for U.S. {{distribution}} by the Weinstein Co. However, as of 2017, the film {{does not have a}} U.S. release date. Director Jérôme Salle announced that Harvey Weinstein has yet to release it <b>because</b> <b>he</b> probably <b>thought</b> it was [...] "too SA for US audiences." ...|$|R
60|$|Perhaps <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was <b>thought</b> of {{as still}} more eligible; since {{a great deal}} of what passes for {{likelihood}} in the world is simply the reflex of a wish. Mr. and Mrs. Arrowpoint, for example, having no anxiety that Miss Harleth should make a brilliant marriage, had quite a different likelihood in their minds.|$|R
