5|$|Raised by Mormon {{parents and}} devout to the faith, Dalton was a feminist; as a child, she felt jealous of <b>boys</b> <b>for</b> {{the freedom and}} {{privileges}} they enjoyed and felt that girls were neglected by the education system. She became a women's rights activist, believing that women {{should have the right}} to suffrage, education, property, control over their money, and custody of their children. As a teacher, she advocated for equal educational and recreational opportunities for girls.|$|E

After Henry James FitzRoy, Earl of Euston, was named in the press as a client, he successfully sued for libel.|$|E

5|$|The school became {{independent}} in 1977 when {{the parents and}} staff of the school, led by the Chairman of the Governors, John Fergrieve Brown, raised sufficient funds to purchase the school. The RGS then withdrew from the government maintained system, becoming independent and fee paying. This was followed in 1978 by the purchase of Lanesborough Preparatory School which became the junior school, preparing <b>boys</b> <b>for</b> entry to the RGS at either 11 or 13.|$|E
5|$|When Scott Rudin was {{adapting}} Wonder <b>Boys</b> <b>for</b> the screen, {{the author}} declined {{an offer to}} write the screenplay, saying {{he was too busy}} writing The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Directed by Curtis Hanson and starring Michael Douglas, Wonder Boys was released in 2000 to critical acclaim and financial failure. Having bought the film rights to The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, Rudin then asked Chabon to work on that film's screenplay. Although Chabon spent 16 months in 2001 and 2002 working on the novel's film adaptation, the project has been mired in pre-production for years.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} <b>boys</b> <b>for</b> the freedom they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 309, Maximinus resumed {{persecution}} by issuing letters to provincial governors and his praetorian prefect, the highest authority in judicial proceedings after the emperor, demanding that Christians conform to pagan customs. His new legislation called for another general sacrifice, coupled with a general offering of libations. It was even more systematic than the first, allowing no exceptions for infants or servants. Logistai (curatores), strategoi, duumviri, and tabularii, who kept the records, {{saw to it that}} there were no evasions. Maximinus introduced some innovations to the process, making him the only known persecuting emperor to have done so. This edict now required food sold in the marketplaces to be covered in libation. Maximinus sent sentries to stand guard at bathhouses and city gates to ensure that all customers sacrificed. He issued copies of the fictitious Acts of Pilate to encourage popular hatred of Christ. Prostitutes confessed, under judicial torture, to having engaged in debaucheries with Christians. Bishops were reassigned to work as stable <b>boys</b> <b>for</b> the Imperial horse guard or keepers of the Imperial camels.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who {{promises}} {{to pay them}} money if they can find naughty little <b>boys</b> <b>for</b> him to take to Pleasure Island.

Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in smoking tobacco, gambling, vandalism, and getting drunk, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into donkeys and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.|$|E

The album garnered mixed reviews upon its release, with some critics praising its intensity and uniqueness while others bemoaned its comparative impenetrability.
