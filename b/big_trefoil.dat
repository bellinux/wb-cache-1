Legumes that were hosts for the nematode were dwarf English trefoil (Lotus corniculatus var. arvensis), <b>big</b> <b>trefoil</b> (L. uliginosis), birdsfoot trefoil (L. corniculatus), narrowleaf birdsfoot trefoil (L. tenuis), ball clover (Trifolium nigrescens), rose clover (T. hirtum), subterranean clover (T. subterraneum), striate lespedeza (Lespedeza striata), and partridge pea (Cassiafasciculata). Most nonleguminous plants tested did not support population increases, but small increases were observed on orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata), broadleaf signalgrass (Brachiaria platyphylla), purslane (Portulaca oleracea), and Carolina geranium (Geranium carolinianum).

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out with the {{objective}} of describing the aerial and underground organs of birdsfoot trefoil [Lotus corniculatus (São Gabriel and ARS- 2620 cultivars) ] and <b>big</b> <b>trefoil</b> [Lotus uliginosus (Maku cultivar) ]. The plants were cultivated in pots and harvested at 150 and 210 days after sowing. Stems, leaves and roots were prepared in according to conventional anatomical techniques. The anatomical structures of L. corniculatus and L. uliginosus differed in terms of pith cell integrity, starch content in the parenchyma root cell and underground stem cortex. The leaves were amphistomatic, with phenolic idioblasts, small vascular bundles and few conducting elements. The underground system was diffuse, with adventitious shoots that grew in two directions, had no cataphylls, emerged from the ground, and gave rise to aerial stems. The morphological characteristics of the shoot system of both species matched the recent descriptions of soboles...|$|E

60|$|On the Monday {{afternoon}} the Trefoils arrived. Mr. Morton, {{with his grandmother}} and both the carriages, went down to receive them,--with a cart also for the luggage, which was fortunate, as Arabella <b>Trefoil's</b> <b>big</b> box was very big indeed, and Lady Augustus, though she was economical in most things, had brought a comfortable amount of clothes. Each of them had her own lady's maid, so that the two carriages were necessary. How it was that these ladies lived so luxuriously was a mystery to their friends, as for some time past they had enjoyed no particular income of their own. Lord Augustus had spent everything that came to his hand, and the family owned no house at all. Nevertheless Arabella Trefoil was to be seen at all parties magnificently dressed, and never stirred anywhere without her own maid. It would have been as grievous to her to be called on to live without food as to go without this necessary appendage. She was a big, fair girl whose copious hair was managed after such a fashion {{that no one could}} guess what was her own and what was purchased. She certainly had fine eyes, though I could never imagine how any one could look at them and think it possible that she should be in love. They were very large, beautifully blue, but never bright; and the eyebrows over them were perfect. Her cheeks were somewhat too long and the distance from her well-formed nose to her upper lip too great. Her mouth was small and her teeth excellent. But the charm of which men spoke the most was the brilliance of her complexion. If, as the ladies said, it was all paint, she, or her maid, must have been a great artist. It never betrayed itself to be paint. But the beauty on which she prided herself was the grace of her motion. Though she was tall and big she never allowed an awkward movement to escape from her. She certainly did it very well. No young woman could walk across an archery ground with a finer step, or manage a train with more perfect ease, or sit upon her horse with a more complete look of being at home there. No doubt she was slow, but though slow she never seemed to drag. Now she was, after a certain fashion, engaged to marry John Morton and perhaps {{she was one of the}} most unhappy young persons in England.|$|R
40|$|The {{precipitation}} of {{bovine serum}} albumin (BSA), lysozyme (LYS) and alfalfa leaf protein (ALF) by two large- and two medium-sized condensed tannin (CT) fractions of similar flavan- 3 -ol subunit composition is described. CT fractions isolated from white clover flowers and <b>big</b> <b>trefoil</b> leaves exhibited high purity profiles by 1 D/ 2 D NMR and purities > 90 % (determined by thiolysis). At pH 6. 5, large CTs {{with a mean}} degree of polymerization (mDP) of ~ 18 exhibited similar protein precipitation behaviors and were significantly more effective than medium CTs (mDP ~ 9). Medium CTs exhibited similar capacities to precipitate ALF or BSA, but showed small but significant differences in their capacity to precipitate LYS. All CTs precipitated ALF more effectively than BSA or LYS. Aggregation of CT-protein complexes likely aided precipitation of ALF and BSA, but not LYS. This study, {{one of the first}} to use CTs of confirmed high purity, demonstrates that mDP of CTs influences protein precipitation efficacy...|$|E
40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{requirements}} of ruminants are met by two sources; microbes leaving the rumen and dietary protein escaping fermentation in the rumen. Much ruminant research has therefore focused on improving amino acid {{supply to the}} duodenum by increasing both microbial protein synthesis and escape of feed proteins from the rumen. The escape of dietary protein {{is dependent on the}} degradation characteristics and retention time in the rumen. The overall aims of this thesis were to increase the knowledge of ruminal degradation of buffer soluble proteins and to investigate the effect of condensed tannins on the degradation. The thesis examines the effect of trichloroacetic acid, perchloric acid, and tungstic acid on detection and recovery of feed peptides and chemically-defined peptides. Twenty-five feeds were screened for buffer soluble protein N. In vitro ruminal degradation rates of buffer soluble proteins were estimated in 11 of these feeds. Buffer soluble protein from peas or cold-pressed rapeseed cake was given as a pulse dose together with a liquid marker to lactating dairy cows, to investigate rumen in vivo degradation rates. The concentration of condensed tannins was determined for birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), <b>big</b> <b>trefoil</b> (L. uliginosus Schkur.) and sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) and related to nitrogen solubility in fresh-frozen and ensiled material and ruminal in vitro degradation. The different protein precipitants did not alter detection of peptides formed in a ruminal in vitro system. The recovery of an eight-residue peptide was 0. 66, 0. 88, and 0. 91 for tungstic acid, perchloric acid, and trichloroacetic acid, respectively. The content of soluble protein N in feeds ranged from 0 to 874 g/kg buffer soluble N with the highest contents for lupine, peas, and cold-pressed rapeseed cake. Fractional degradation rates determined in vitro for soluble protein ranged from 0. 18 (linseed cake) to 1. 0 /h (casein). Soluble protein from soybean meal, peas, and lupine were degraded at intermediate rates. Soluble proteins given as a pulse dose were rapidly degraded in vivo. Results were disturbed by slow mixing in the rumen. In several cases, concentration of the liquid marker was higher after 1 h than 0. 5 h post dosing. Based on two experiments and a total of nine varieties of birdsfoot trefoil, the concentration of condensed tannins determined by a radial diffusion method ranged from 3 to 17 g/kg DM. The tannin content for sainfoin and <b>big</b> <b>trefoil</b> was 21. 6 (maximum concentration) and 24. 8 g/kg DM, respectively. Buffer N solubility and ruminal in vitro N degradability were negatively correlated to tannin content. Tannin content and wilting time cumulatively reduced buffer soluble nitrogen in birdsfoot trefoil silage. This thesis shows that there is no distinct cut-off for peptide size when using different protein precipitation agents. Soluble proteins degrade at different rates depending on source. As they are not instantly degraded, they must contribute to the dietary amino acid supply of the ruminant. The in sacco method, which assumes complete degradation of soluble proteins should not be used for feeds high in soluble proteins...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the genetic structure and symbiotic characteristics of Bradyrhizobium isolates recovered from four legume species (Lupinus albus [white lupine], Lupinus angustifolius [blue lupine], Ornithopus compressus [yellow serradella], and Macroptilium atropurpureum [sirato]) grown in an Oregon soil. We established that multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) can provide {{insights into the}} genetic relatedness among Bradyrhizobium strains by showing a positive correlation (r 2 = ≥ 0. 90) between the relatedness of Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains determined by MLEE at 13 enzyme loci and that determined by other workers using either DNA-DNA hybridization or DNA sequence divergence estimates. MLEE identified 17 electrophoretic types (ETs) among 95 Bradyrhizobium isolates recovered from the four hosts. Although the overall genetic diversity among the ETs (H = 0. 69) {{is one of the}} largest measured to date in a local population of any soilborne bacterial species, there was no evidence of multilocus structure (linkage disequilibrium) within the population. The majority of the isolates (73 %) were represented by two closely related ETs (2 and 3) which dominated the root nodules of white lupine, serradella, and siratro. In contrast, ET 1 dominated nodules of blue lupine. Although representative isolates from all of the 17 ETs nodulated siratro, white lupine, blue lupine, and <b>big</b> <b>trefoil</b> (Lotus pedunculatus), they were either completely ineffective or poorly effective at fixing nitrogen on these hosts. Despite the widespread use of serradella as a surrogate host for lupine-nodulating bradyrhizobia, 7 of the 17 ETs did not nodulate this host, and the remaining 10 ETs were ineffective at fixing nitrogen...|$|E
40|$|Tanniferous forage {{plants can}} have {{beneficial}} effects on ruminant productivity and health (improved protein supply, bloat safety and antiparasitic properties). However, condensed tannins can also lower palatability, voluntary feed intake and digestibility. The aim of our interdisciplinary {{project was to}} generate basic knowledge on plant management, feed palatability and the antiparasitic properties of tanniferous forage plants for their practical application in agronomy, focusing on their usefulness in controlling gastrointestinal nematodes in organic farming. We found that Onobrychis viciifolia (sainfoin), Lotus corniculatus (birdsfoot trefoil) and Cichorium intybus (chicory) were suitable for cultivation under the given temperate climatic conditions, whereas Lotus pedunculatus (<b>big</b> <b>trefoil)</b> was soon outcompeted by unsown species. Growing the tanniferous plant species in a mixture with Festuca pratensis (meadow fescue) {{rather than in a}} monoculture had the advantage of increasing total dry matter (DM) yield (especially in the case of tanniferous legumes) and of reducing the DM proportions of unsown species. However, due to dilution by non-tanniferous F. pratensis, the tannin concentrations of mixtures were clearly lower and the seasonal fluctuations in tannin concentrations greater than that of monocultures. Across species, tannin concentrations were highest for O. viciifolia, followed by L. corniculatus and very low for C. intybus. Palatability of all tanniferous forages was comparable to that of a ryegrass/clover mixture when fed as dried forage and, when offered as silage, palatability of O. viciifolia was clearly superior to that of the respective ryegrass/clover control. Administration of dried or ensiled O. viciifolia reduced parasite egg counts in feces of lambs co-infected with the gastrointestinal nematode species Haemonchus contortus and Cooperia curticei. We conclude that O. viciifolia is the most promising among the tested tanniferous forage plant species due to its suitability for cultivation, its high tannin concentration, its high palatability and its antiparasitic activity even in dried or ensiled for...|$|E
40|$|Condensed tannins (CTs, syn. proanthocyanidins) {{account for}} up to 13 % of the dry matter in forage legumes used as {{ruminant}} feeds, such as sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia. Scop), sulla (Hedysarum coronarium), sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata), Lotus spp (e. g birdsfoot trefoil and <b>big</b> <b>trefoil),</b> the flowers of white clover, as well as seed coats of Lucerne. They also occur in weeds (e. g. Rumex), many herbaceous plants and tree/shrub species. Concentrations are usually higher in leaves than stems, {{but this does not}} deter their consumption by ruminants. Animal responses to CTs have included improved growth, milk production, fertility, wool growth and reduced methane emissions and ammonia volatilization from dung or urine. Perhaps most important are the ability of forages with CTs to combat the effects of some gastro-intestinal (GI) parasites, and even kill the nematodes as well as reduce egg hatching, larval development, exsheathment and fertility. However, benefits may be variable and are not universal, especially when dietary protein concentrations are low. Inconsistent animal responses to CTs were initially attributed to concentration in the diet, but recent research has highlighted the importance of their molecular structures, as well as concentration, and also the composition of the diet containing the CTs. The importance of tannin structural traits cannot be underestimated; one structure will kill GI nematodes, another will have no effect. Interdisciplinary research is the key to unraveling the relationships between tannin traits and bioactivities, whether positive or negative, and will enable future on-farm exploitation of these natural plant compounds. Research is also needed to provide plant breeders with guidelines and screening tools to optimize tannin characteristics and concentrations, in both the forage and in the whole diet. In addition, the competitiveness and agronomic traits of tannin-containing legumes needs improvement and a better understanding of options for their inclusion in ruminant diets. Farmers need varieties that are competitive in mixed swards and have predictable bioactivities. This review focuses on recent results from multidisciplinary research involving sainfoin, but also provides an overview of current developments with other tanniniferous forages. Tannin chemistry is now being linked with agronomy, plant breeding, animal nutrition and parasitology. The past decade has yielded significant progress, but also generated more questions; an enviable consequence of new knowledge!authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
