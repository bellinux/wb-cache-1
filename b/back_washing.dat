Performance measures including coagulant demand, turbidity, colour, total organic carbon, head loss development, filter run time, <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> water consumption, filtration solids volume and iron and manganese were examined for a water source with low turbidity and high organic matter content. The optimal coagulant dosage established for in-line direct filtration was much lower than that required for conventional treatment of the same raw water. Direct filtration preceded by ozonation achieved similar, or substantially higher, turbidity removal efficiencies with a significantly lower alum coagulant dosage. Pre-ozonation was effective in lowering turbidity, colour, head loss development and iron and manganese levels but was not significant in removing TOC. Pre-ozonation increased filter run time by about 7 % when compared with the case of no ozonation treatment.

Normally the treatment consists of removal of suspended and dissolved solids through different units of ETP. Experiments were conducted with different sizes of activated carbon for TDS removal. Activated carbon plays a major role for TDS removal. Reduction in the size of activated carbon increases the efficiency to reduce TDS that is due to the increased surface area.

40|$|International audienceThe {{participation}} of scapula motion in arm movement is clinically {{well known and}} recent three dimensional (3 D) analyses using kinematic techniques have confirmed its importance. Scapular motion relative to the thorax has a theoretical maximum of {{6 degrees of freedom}} (DoF), resulting from rotations at both clavicular joints (3 rotational DoF each). However, most recent kinematic studies have only analysed the 3 D rotations of the scapula relative to the thorax. In the present study, the 3 D translations of the barycentre of the scapula were considered in order to complete the description of movement at the shoulder complex. Eight healthy subjects performed arm elevation in the sagittal and frontal planes, simulated activities of daily living (hair combing and <b>back</b> <b>washing)</b> and maximum voluntary scapula movement (forward and backward rolling). Measurements were recorded using a 6 DoF electromagnetic device and the acromial method of analysis was used. The results showed that 3 D scapular rotations and translation of its barycentre were functionally consistent for all tasks. A principal component analysis (PCA) yielded three factors, explaining 97. 6 % of the variance. The first two factors (protraction and shrug, according to clinical descriptions) combined rotations and translations, consistent with the hypothesis that the scapula rolls over the curved thoracic surface. The third factor related to lateral-medial rotation, thus representing rotation in the plane tangential to the thorax. The PCA suggested that scapular motion can be described using these 3 DoF. This should be studied in a larger group of individuals, including patients with pathological conditions...|$|E
40|$|O processo de tratamento por filtraÃÃo direta costuma ser selecionado para o tratamento de Ãgua com qualidade razoÃvel (baixos a mÃdios teores de cor, turbidez e algas). Nesse processo, as mudanÃas de qualidade - particularmente no que tange Ã proliferaÃÃo de algas - provocam problemas de sobrecarga nos filtros, uma vez que toda fraÃÃo particulada deve ser removida nos meios filtrante. Identifica-se desta forma a necessidade de se buscar soluÃÃes alternativas para aliviar a sobrecarga dos filtros rÃpidos. VÃrios sistemas de abastecimento de Ãgua operados pela Companhia de Ãgua e Esgoto do CearÃ - CAGECE adotam a FiltraÃÃo Direta Ascendente (FDA) como tecnologia de tratamento, soluÃÃo que Ã Ãpoca de sua implantaÃÃo mostrou-se compatÃvel com as caracterÃsticas dos mananciais. Atualmente, devido Ã eutrofizaÃÃo dos mananciais e conseqÃentes floraÃÃes dos mais diversos tipos de algas, os sistemas trabalham de forma crÃtica com sobrecarga de filtros e grande perda de Ãgua (necessidade de constantes lavagens dos filtros) para atender aos padrÃes de qualidade definidos pela legislaÃÃo. A implantaÃÃo de uma unidade Ã montante dos filtros existentes para prÃ condicionar a Ãgua bruta e adequÃ-la ao tratamento existente Ã opÃÃo, mas esbarra em um problema de carÃter operacional jÃ que grande parte dos estudos disponÃveis na {{literatura}} adota filtros ascendentes seguidos de descendentes, o que do ponto de vista hidrÃulico compromete o aproveitamento das estruturas existentes. A unidade de prÃ-tratamento possibilitou a adequaÃÃo da Ãgua bruta com elevada presenÃa de algas Ãs limitaÃÃes do sistema de filtraÃÃo direta ascendente, melhorando a qualidade da Ãgua produzida e reduzindo as perdas de Ãgua tratada nas lavagens de filtros. O filtro de pressÃo PFP 1 (leito com Te= 2, 4 e Cd= 1, 1) operando com uma taxa de filtraÃÃo de 400 m 3 /m 2. dia apresentou uma remoÃÃo de 50 % de cor aparente e 65 % de turbidez com perda de carga permanecendo abaixo de 1 m. c. a. ao longo de uma carreira de filtraÃÃo mÃdia em torno de 2, 5 horas. O sistema com filtro de pressÃo a montante do filtro ascendente apresentou ainda perdas com Ãgua de lavagem (6, 2 %) menores em comparaÃÃo ao filtro ascendente operando isoladamente (16, 2 %). The {{process of}} treatment by direct filtration is often selected to treat water with reasonable quality (low to medium levels of color, turbidity and algae). In this process, the changes - {{particularly with regard}} to algae blooms - cause overload problems in the filters, since the particulate fraction must be removed at the filter media. It was identified therefore the need to seek alternative solutions to alleviate the burden of rapid filters. Several water supply systems operated by the Water and Sewerage Company of CearÃ - CAGECE adopt the Ascending Direct Filtration (ADF) as treatment technology, a solution which {{at the time of its}} implementation was compatible with the characteristics of the raw water. Currently, due to eutrophication of water sources and the resulting blooms of many kinds of algae, systems work critically overloading filters and causing large water loss (the need for constant filters <b>back</b> <b>washing)</b> to meet quality standards set by legislation. The deployment of a unit placed before the existing filters to condition the raw water to the existing treatment stumbles on anoperational problem since much of the available studies adopts upflowfollowed by dowflowfilters which in the hydraulic point of view precludes the use of the existing structures. The unit of pre-treatment installed allowed the suitability of raw water with high presence of algae to the limitations of direct upflow filtration system, improving the quality of the water produced and reducing losses of treated water by the wash procedures. The pressure filter PFP 1 (bed with Te = 2. 4 and Cd = 1. 2) operating at a filtration rate of 400 m 3 /m 2. day showed a removal of 50 % of apparent color and 65 % of turbidity with a head loss remaining below 1 m. w. c. and a mean filtration runof 2. 5 hours.

40|$|In The Netherlands, Belgium {{and other}} European countries, {{manganese}} {{is removed from}} groundwater by aeration followed by rapid (sand) filtration. Although manganese removal from groundwater has been studied extensively, the mechanisms that control the ripening of filter media are not yet fully understood. This thesis highlights {{the role of the}} formation of a manganese oxide coating on virgin filter media. Characterization and identification of the media revealed that Birnessite was the manganese oxide responsible for effective manganese removal. This study confirmed that Birnessite formed {{at the beginning of the}} ripening process was of biological origin. As filter ripening progressed, the origin of the Birnessite became predominantly physico-chemical, although biological manganese oxidation still contributed to the overall removal of manganese. The formation of Birnessite at the start of filter media ripening was negatively influenced by a high filter <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> frequency. Molecular DNA analyses showed that Pseudomonas species are most likely involved at the start of the manganese oxide formation process. Based on the knowledge that manganese removal in conventional groundwater treatment is initiated biologically, long ripening times may be reduced by creating conditions favouring the growth of manganese oxidizing bacteria, e. g., by limiting the <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> frequency and/or intensity. Finally it was shown that the use of freshly prepared manganese oxide, containing Birnessite, can completely eliminate the need for filter media ripening. The results of this research enable the development of an innovative manganese removal process to shorten or completely eliminate long periods of ripening of virgin filter media, as well as significantly prolonging the lifetime of the filter media. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Water is a {{precious}} and necessary good for humans. We make great {{use of it}} be it for industry or urban use. In consequence its quality is altered and generates what we denominate waste waters. This water has to be treated to prevent {{negative impact on the}} environment. To avoid this there are waste water treatments. Conventional treatments in waste water treatment plants are composed of physic-chemical and biological treatments. But those water treatment plants present limitations that difficult improvement of the process. This limitations can be balanced out by integrating other advanced technologies of waste water treatment that will improve the treatment and generate better quality water diminishing the impact on the environment. One of those systems is called membrane bioreactor (MBR). This process generates much better water quality but has two big inconvenient: the operational cost and the membrane fouling. The membrane fouling is due to particle accumulation on the surface, negatively affecting water filtration. Fouling is detected by the increase in trans-membrane (TMP) pressure. In consequence there is an increment on the energetic cost and when accumulated it can damage the membrane. There exist different measures to help reduce fouling. Systems like the application of airing to create turbulence and detach fouling. Also periodical <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> process to release obstructed pores or chemical washes to recover filter capacity even though it reduces the membrane useful life. All these measures imply direct actions on the membranes. What we study is the option to apply an external peptic treatment that coats the membrane surface, able to prevent bio-fouling from membranes. With this treatment we could reduce <b>back</b> <b>wash</b> frequency, airing flow or even chemical washes. Therefore we can reduce operational costs from this technology increasing its profitability.
