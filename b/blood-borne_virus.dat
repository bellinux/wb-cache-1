25|$|Hepatitis C {{virus is}} {{predominantly}} a <b>blood-borne</b> <b>virus,</b> with very low risk of sexual or vertical transmission. Because of {{this mode of}} spread the key groups at risk are injecting drug users (IDUs), recipients of blood products and sometimes patients on haemodialysis. Common setting for transmission of HCV is also intra-hospital (nosocomial) transmission, when practices of hygiene and sterilization are not correctly followed in the clinic. A number of cultural or ritual practices have been proposed as a potential historical mode of spread for hepatitis C virus, including circumcision, genital mutilation, ritual scarification, traditional tattooing and acupuncture. It has also been argued that given the extremely prolonged periods of persistence of HCV in humans, even very low and undetectable rates of mechanical transmission via biting insects may be sufficient to maintain endemic infection in the tropic, where people receive large number of insect bites.|$|E

50|$|In {{response}} {{to the emergence of}} HIV/AIDS in the mid-1980s, Australian drug users began toself-organize into community, peer-driven state and national drug userorganisations. The aim of these organisations was to give voice to the experiences of Australian drug users and to advocate for drug-related policy reform, the provision of harm reduction prophylactics, the expansion of opioid substitution programs, to highlight the health issues affecting illicit drug users and to reduce the stigma and discrimination many illicit drug users experience. Drug user organisations have been recognized by state and federal governments as an effective strategy to educate illicit drug users in relation to techniques for avoiding <b>blood-borne</b> <b>virus</b> transmission, responding to drug overdose, safer injecting techniques, safer sex and legal issues. Australian drug user organisations use a peer education and community development approach to health promotion, with the aim of empowering illicit drug users by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blood-borne</b> <b>virus</b> {{transmission}} Summary Infection control practices which {{increase the}} risk of <b>blood-borne</b> <b>virus</b> transmission with associated dental practice in one South African province were studied. All 24 state dental clinics were observed for adequate provision to carry out good infection prevention and control (IPC) practice, 75 staff including dentists, nurses and dental assistants were interviewed to assess IPC knowledge and 23 dental procedures were observed. Significant findings were the difference between knowledge and practice, despite adequate provisions for safe infection control practice. The lack of protective eye wear during a dental procedure, not washing hands between patients, not disassembling an item prior to disinfection or sterilization, and not using a sterile drill for each patient were identi-fied. A rapid method for detection of occult blood was used as a marker for inadequate IPC practice. Contaminated dental items of equipment just prior to patient use in 25 % of equipment tested and 37 % of surfaces and sur-rounding areas in the dental clinics and units were recorded. This study concludes that, despite provision for safe dental practice available in state dental clincs, {{there was a lack of}} knowledge application in clinical prac-tice.

Using data from semi-structured interviews, we highlight the experiences of 41 males and females who had received injections from other IDUs.
