40|$|The {{sanitation}} agent container, {{which was}} selected {{in a trade}} off study, employs two chambers, a rigid outer container and an inner flexible bladder. The bladder contains the sanitation agent formulation and its release is controlled by a manually operated valve. The outer container holds a high pressure vapor. There is no void in the bladder which makes the package operation independent of orientation and therefore usable in zero gravity. Foam is developed by a low boiling point fluid or dissolved in the product. When the product is dispensed at atmospheric presure, the evolved gas or vapor whips up a goam in the valve. The sanitation agents were initially formulated with freons which produces an excellent foam. However freon is incompatible with the life support system and was replaced with carbon dioxide dissolved at high pressure.

40|$|The {{electrokinetic}} {{method used}} for remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals {{is a new}} developing technique for <b>cleaning</b> <b>soil</b> from heavy metals and radionuclides. By feeding an electric current through soil one induces movement of charges, which is generated by migration of ions and colloids in water present in pores and by reductive reactions {{on the surface of}} electrodes. The aim of the present investigation was to find out whether the electrokinetic <b>soil</b> <b>cleaning</b> method is suitable for cleanup of polluted soils. The method utilizes electrokinesis to drive contaminant species into and through a bed adjacent to a drive electrode. The bed comprises a moderately electrically conductive adsorbent material which is porous and is infused with water or other solvent capable of conducting electrical current. The efficiency of the method depends not so much on soil permeability as on the electric conductivity of water in pores and the distance of movement. The major task and the key goal were to determine suitability of the electrokinetic method for the treatment of soil contaminated with heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn and Pb). Also, it was important to determine the maximum level of cleanup, dependence on the voltage, the level of soil pollution for which this remediation method would prove to be effective for <b>cleaning</b> <b>soil</b> down to the permitted pollution limits, the type of soil most suitable for this remediation technique, the materials of the electrodes, etc. The electrokinetic method is most effective when cleaning polluted sand and sandy loam. The highest efficiency and smallest residual concentrations were reached when removing manganese and chromium from <b>soil.</b> A higher <b>cleaning</b> efficiency is reached applying 29 V rather than 24 V voltage. However, results were quite similar, therefore to clean soil from heavy metals the standard 24 V voltage could be applied, but the cleaning process should be prolonged. Elektrokinetinio metodo panaudojimas sunkiaisiais metalais užterštų dirvožemių valymui – tai nauja besiplėtojanti dirvožemio valymo nuo sunkiųjų metalų ir radionuklidų technologija. Pro dirvožemį leidžiant elektros srovę vyksta krūvių judėjimas, kurį sukuria jonų ir koloidų, esančių dirvožemio porose, migracija bei redukcinės reakcijos ant elektrodų paviršiaus. Tyrimo tikslas buvo nustatyti, ar elektrokinetinis dirvožemio valymo metodas yra efektyvus ir tinkamas sunkiaisiais metalais (Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn ir Pb) užterštiems dirvožemiams valyti. Valymo metu teršalų dalelės yra priverčiamos judėti į ir pro sluoksnį, sudarytą iš laidžios sorbuojančios medžiagos, sudrėkintos laidumą didinančiu skysčiu. Metodo efektyvumas ne tiek priklauso nuo dirvožemio laidinių savybių, kiek nuo porose esančio vandens elektrinio laidumo ir dalelių judėjimo kelio. Taip pat buvo svarbu nustatyti išvalymo efektyvumą, jo priklausomybę nuo įtampos, valymo metodo ribas (kokio užterštumo dirvožemis gali būti efektyviai išvalytas), kokiam dirvožemio tipui metodas yra tinkamiausias ir pan. Tyrimo rezultatai rodo, kad metodas efektyviausias, kai valomas sunkiaisiais metalais užterštas. smėlis ir priesmėlis. Didžiausias efektyvumas ir mažiausios liekamosios koncentracijos buvo pasiektos valant iš dirvožemio manganą ir chromą.

40|$|Vascular plants {{possess an}} enzyme system that detoxifies cyanide by {{converting}} {{it to the}} amino acid asparagine. Hybrid willows (Salix matsudana KoidzxSalix alba L.) were exposed to cyanide to determine whether willows can transport and metabolize this compound. Pre-rooted trees were grown in different environmental compartments spiked or irrigated with potassium cyanide at 24. 0 +/- 0. 5 degrees C. Cyanide in compartments, in air and in tissues of plants was analyzed spectrophotometrically. Results from this study indicated that large amounts of applied cyanide {{was removed from the}} systems during the presence of willows. Growing compartments of plants have a strong influence on the removal rates of cyanide. Little or no initial cyanide was detected in plant materials. Volatilization of cyanide was not occurring. Mass balance studies showed that applied cyanide was significantly metabolized during transport through willows cuttings. However, there was a clear difference between the metabolism rates of cyanide by willows exposed to different environmental compartments. The highest cyanide metabolism rate was found at the treatment with willows growing in hydroponic solution with a metabolism rate of 2. 44 mgCN/ (kg center dot d), followed by willows growing in sand with a value of 1. 02 mgCN/(kg center dot d). The lowest metabolism rate had the willows growing in soils(0. 43 mgCN/(kg center dot d)).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to aid in the}} development of Remedial Extraction And Catalytic Hydrodehalogenation (REACH), a green remediation technology used to remove and destroy halogenated hydrophobic organic compounds from soil. REACH has no secondary waste streams, uses an environmentally benign solvent, and aims to catalytically destroy rather than transfer the organic contaminants into a different phase. In this thesis, a bench-top semicontinuous model of the proposed remediation technology was constructed and used to extract the model contaminant, 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobenzene, from soil and to convert it to an acceptable end product, cyclohexane. Palladium was used as a catalyst for hydrodehalogenation, which converted the tetrachlorobenzene to benzene. Rhodium was used to catalyze the hydrogenation of benzene to cyclohexane. A novel method, ultraviolet solvent treatment, was proposed to mitigate catalyst deactivation that occurs because of extracted chemicals contained in the contaminated soil. The goal of this treatment is to degrade organic matter that is suspected of causing catalyst deactivation. The REACH process was found to successfully extract TeCB from the soil, but only partial conversion from TeCB to cyclohexane occurred. Catalyst deactivation was the suspectedcause of the low amount of conversion observed. Hydrogen limitation was also tested as a cause of limited conversion, but was not found to be a contributor. Ultraviolet solvent treatment was tested as a means of mitigating catalyst deactivation. However, the treatment was not effective in making a profound difference in stopping the catalyst from deactivating. The experiments conducted in this research show that REACH has the potential to become a viable technology for <b>cleaning</b> <b>soil</b> contaminated with halogenated organic compounds. However, future research {{needs to be done to}} greatly reduce the severity of catalyst deactivation and to determine with which other halogenated organic compounds the technology works well...|$|R

40|$|The task of <b>cleaning</b> <b>soil</b> and/or {{groundwater}} {{contaminated by}} leakage from aging underground gasoline or petrochemical tanks along with surface spills {{of gasoline and}} other hazardous chemicals is of utmost importance for federal and state environmental agencies. Traditional clean up and contaminant removal involves dig-and-treat methods that are costly and impractical for large, contaminated sites. Less disruptive remediation techniques, such as air sparging, have become more attractive in the past decade. Air sparging, bioventing, and other remediation technologies that use air injection into soil can become very effective for non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) removal using volatilization and bioremediation. However, the effectiveness of methods such as air sparging {{is limited by the}} restriction of airflow. The majority of the injected air in air sparging flows through narrow air channels formed in the soil and water matrix, which forms a limited mass transfer zone (MTZ) for contaminant removal. Diffusion of air between these air channels, even though very slow, can help the cleanup. Pulsation of the air sparging pumps is among the only existing methods used to enhance airflow, but it is time-consuming and unable to create a controlled and uniform airflow pattern. In this thesis, use of electromagnetic (EM) stimulation to expedite air sparging is investigated. A relatively high-power electromagnetic field is radiated into the water by utilizing a co-axial antenna connected to an EM source. The alternating electric field emitted into the medium can stimulate different mechanisms in the medium. As a result, the stimulated water molecules enhance diffusion of air and contaminant. This thesis shows {{the first step in the}} study of EM stimulation on air and contaminant flow through saturated soils via an analogous demonstration of the effect of EM waves on diffusion of a non-reactive dye in water. It is successfully demonstrated in this work that the EM stimulation of the water and dye controls and changes the direction and rates of dye transport.
