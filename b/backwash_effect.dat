40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the study is to give {{insights}} about the four language skills and language use assessed in achievement tests and the possible <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> of the items on both learning/teaching processes in English preparatory classes at the tertiary level. For this purpose, some samples of achievement tests from 13 institutions have been collected and analyzed in terms of test items used to assess four language skills, language use and vocabulary, and their potential <b>backwash</b> <b>effect.</b> The results have revealed that reading skill and subskills, language use and vocabulary knowledge are assessed in the achievement tests by all institutions. However, listening, writing and speaking skills are assessed by 70 % of the institutions. In addition, 15 % of them also assess translation in their achievement tests. All in all, four language skills and their subskills are tested to some extent in almost all institutions. This is a very effect ive approach to create needs for the learners to focus on four language skills and to get them ready for their academic life as the tests items/tasks have tendency to assess performance rather than language knowledge solely...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{magnitude}} and dynamics of regional inequalities in Israel during the period 1962 - 1976. Economic well-being is measured by regional motorization rates, which {{were found to be}} highly correlated with personal income levels. Various measures point towards a divergence in regional inequalities, although the rates of change of these measures are declining with time. An analysis of the spatial pattern of the regional levels of economic well-being indicates a well-defined core - periphery structure which is significantly stable over time. Spread and <b>backwash</b> <b>effects</b> are examined within the labour markets of the primary and secondary cores. This examination shows that <b>backwash</b> <b>effects</b> were the dominant factor in shaping the space-economy within the regional systems. The levels of economic well-being within the labour markets were found to be positively related to the levels of the respective cores. From a policy point of view it can be concluded that the persistent pursuit of the national objective of dispersal of population has been concomitant with an increase in the levels of regional inequalities within a national framework, and that <b>backwash</b> <b>effects</b> have caused an increase in the regional imbalances between the cores and their respective peripheries. ...|$|R

We explored whether the changing flows of sales and purchases, spillovers and commuting between 1982 and 2006 suggested a dominance of spread <b>effects</b> or <b>backwash</b> <b>effects.</b> We found increased commuting between periphery and core, decreased core-periphery transactions, and smaller core-to periphery spillovers and periphery-to-core spillovers in both goods and services. Our findings do not point to a clear dominance of spread or <b>backwash</b> <b>effects.</b> Results showing smaller core-to-periphery and periphery-to-core multipliers/spillovers suggest that spread effects related to trade in goods and services weakened between 1982 and 2006.

40|$|AbstractAssessment is an {{important}} aspect of learning and teaching which enables students to progress to either higher grades of studies or seek for employment, it also helps the teachers to assess the effectiveness of their teaching methodology. Several academicians have emphasized that assessment has strong impact on all aspects of learning. According to Buck, Backwash is influence of examination on learning. We explored presence of <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> by questionnaire, rated on 6 point Likert scale with 10 items, in first year medical students and compared with their academic performances. The first year medical students were surveyed by newly developed and validated backwash questionnaire (BAQ) in this study. The questionnaire was based on qualitative studies on <b>backwash</b> <b>effect.</b> All students were categorised into three groups based on their previous exam scores. High achievers were defined as having cGPA of > 3. 5, medium achievers with cGPA ranges between 3. 5 to 3. 0 and low low achievers of cGPA < 3. 0. All three groups were evaluated for the presence of backwash. The first year MBBS students (n= 81) from a designated private medical university in Malaysia participated in this study. The male: female ratio was 1 : 1. High achievers were 39. 5 % (32 / 81), medium achievers 48. 1 % (39 / 81) and low achievers were 12. 3 % (10 / 81). Backwash was present in 46 % (38 / 81), highest in medium achievers 50 % (19 / 38), followed by high achievers 39 % (15 / 38), low achievers 10. 5 % (4 / 38). These results suggest that medium achievers are more prone to adopt learning strategies with the aim to pass assessments only. However, it is also interesting observation that high achievers also tend to have backwash. As far as low achievers are concerned, they have less <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> as observed in this study. The presence of negative effect of Backwash in high & medium achievers, suggests that assessment exert great impact on learning of medical students. To take the maximum benefits out of assessment, there is need to improve learning by adopting new strategies and improvements in teaching learning activities...|$|E

40|$|An {{effective}} way to change student learning {{is to change the}} form of assessment. This has become known as the <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> of assessment. However, academic teachers’ ways of understanding the role of assessment in student learning are also important. This paper reports a phenomenographic study of the views of the role of assessment amongst Swedish and Hong Kong university teachers. The results are described in eight categories of conceptions, placed within a two-dimensional outcome space. The two dimensions are (1) the relation between teaching and assessment, and (2) the focus of the <b>backwash</b> <b>effect.</b> The results indicate that two features of the described conceptions are critical for changing teachers’ views of the role of assessment. One is the way one understands the significance of “basic knowledge” in one’s discipline while the other is whether one looks upon the relation between teaching and assessment as being of an internal or external nature. As much research literature points out, to bring about changes in approaches to teaching and learning you must first bring about changes in conceptions of teaching and learning. To utilize assessment to improve student learning, teachers need to be made aware of the need of such improvement and of the role assessment can play in this process. On the basis of research such as that reported in this paper, staff developers could develop workshops or other strategies, which can accomplish this task...|$|E

This paper attempts to provide evidence for resource curse theory through comparing Resource Abundance Index with economic growth among China’s 27 regions; and then to analyse Shanxi’s plight from several particular aspects.

To capture the goals of this study, it uses panel data during the period 2000 to 2010 consisting of 23 districts/cities of Aceh Province. The results show that the potential conditions for convergence because the dominant factor affecting the disparity without entering variable cumulative effect, the concentration of economic activity among regions have positive and negatively affected HDI. By entering variable cumulative effects, it turns HDI to have a negative effect, while the cumulative effect of the growth of inter-regional and the GDP per capita were positive. Thus, {{it can be said that}} the economic disparity among regions has the potential for convergence if and only if there is a policy intervention by the government in improving the quality of education, health, and consumer purchasing power to reduce the disparity. It is recommended that the Government of Aceh and District/City Government should encourage the growth of GDP per year, equal to or above the average growth of the national economy in order to increase labour productivity so that economic prosperity has also increased (spread effect is greater than <b>backwash</b> <b>effect)</b> because workings of the cumulative effect of growth within the region and among regions.

This study {{investigated}} the content validity and <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> of the end-of-term Oral Assessment Test (OAT) administered at Hacettepe University, Department of Basic English. The end-of-term OAT is a final achievement test used to measure students’ oral language abilities. The content validity of the OAT was investigated in terms of consistency between the learning goals set for {{the students in the}} course book content and taught in the language program and the content of the OAT. A related issue to the content validity was the <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> of the OAT, which is the effect of the test on teaching and learning in the classroom. The idea behind this study originated from overhearing complaints from the teachers and students that the OAT did not test what students had learned in the fi-amework of the course book content. For this reason, I launched this study to investigate the content validity and <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> of the OAT. This study included three groups of subjects: 14 B-level subject teachers and two testers, 62 B-level students and three administrators. To gather data, questionnaires were given to the three groups of subjects mainly to obtain their opinions about the course book content and the content of the OAT. Apart from that, the types of speaking tasks in both the course book and the OAT were identified and compared with each other with the aim of revealing consistency. Data from questiormaires were analyzed using frequencies and percentages and the results were shown in tables. For the comparison of the speaking task types between the course book content and the OAT, the types of speaking tasks specified in the course book content are documented and then matched with those tested in the OAT. The results of the documentary analysis of the types of speaking tasks both in the course book content and content of the OAT showed that although there were 13 types of speaking tasks occurring in the course book, only three of them were on the OAT. This resulted in a low degree of the content validity of the OAT. The results of the questioimaires supported the findings of the documentary analysis above indicating {{that the majority of the}} speaking task types in the course book were not included and tested in the QAT, which liroved inconsistency to a certain extent. In addition, through the questionnaires, it was revealed that students did not put a lot of time and effort in the classroom on the types of the speaking tasks which were not tested and were of no value in terms of passing or failing the OAT. The findings suggest that the content of the OAT should be redesigned to include a greater variety of speaking tasks, such as discussions, role plays, and simulations. Another suggestion is that an oral assessment test should be administered at least twice a term in addition to the one administered at the end of the term. Ösken, HasanM. S...|$|E

We identify the key issue as being one of validity, with a tension existing between construct and consequential validities of the existing system and of CEOTS. We argue that a computer-based system seems to offer the only solution to the negative backwash problem but the development of the technology required to meet current construct validity demands makes this a very long term prospect.

In Germany, production of ICT devices is concentrated in clusters of innovating regions (in terms of patents). ICT service production, on the other hand, is concentrated in larger urban areas. Growth rates in ICT-related employment show different spatial patterns. The data show that negative spatial effects are present for several sectors, which might give support for the so-called <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> described by Gunnar Myrdal (1957).

We use all the course curricula (in total 632) from the two faculties to analyze and compare undergraduate and graduate courses within each department, and different departments with each other. 2 Background The <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> of examinations is a well-known phenomenon at all levels of education and it is seen in typical student questions such as: “Is this going to be a question on the examination paper? ” A related question to teachers is: “What is the use of this? ” Sometimes teachers have goo...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Since its {{opening up to}} the outside world in the 1980 s and the {{introduction}} of economic reforms that have involved engagement with the global economy and wider community, the Chinese government has become determined to promote the teaching and learning of English as a foreign language among its citizens. In particular, it has mandated the study of English for all college and university students and has made the passing of the College English Test (CET) at Band 4 level a requirement for obtaining a degree. With some ten million candidates annually (and rising) CET Band 4 has become the world’s largest language test administered nationwide (Jin and Yang, 2006). In a deliberate attempt to harness the <b>backwash</b> <b>effect</b> of examinations on teaching and learning, the Ministry of Education has insisted that all college and university students (generally when in their second year of study) must sit the CET Band 4 written papers that test reading, writing and listening skills in English. Aimed largely, but not exclusively, at those students majoring in English, there is also a higher level, Band 6, CET available...|$|E
40|$|Epistemological beliefs—beliefs {{about the}} nature of {{knowledge}}, where it resides, and how knowledge is constructed and evaluated—have been the target of increased research interest lately. Heretofore, emphasis has been directed to language teaching/learning aspects and strategies. Language assessment practices have not yet received due attention in epistemic research literature. The current study examined the relationship between pre-service EFL teachers’ epistemological beliefs and their assessment orientations. Dimensions of epistemological beliefs were assessed via a questionnaire designed and validated by the researcher based on Schommer’s work. Two assessment orientations were examined including: (a) transmissive surface- processing orientation and (b) constructive deep-processing orientation. The study involved 114 preservice EFL teachers enrolled in the Professional Diploma in Teaching Program in the Abu Dhabi University, the United Arab Emirates. Results of the study showed that EFL teachers’ epistemological beliefs have a direct bearing on their assessment orientations and practices. EFL teachers with naive epistemological beliefs tended more to adopt surface-level assessment orientations whereas those with sophisticated epistemological beliefs showed more tendency to adopt deeper level approaches to assessment in language settings. Results are discussed in terms of <b>backwash</b> <b>effects</b> on foreign language instruction, curriculum development, and teacher education. Suggestions for further research are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the National Assessment Program-Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN)  has played an {{increasingly}} important role in Australian education and {{there is evidence that}} it has become a high-stakes measure of achievement. Research suggests that this kind of largescale, high-stakes accountability testing has a profound impact on teaching and learning. This effect is generally referred to as “backwash”.  This study focused on the perceptions of Year 9 English teachers in selected schools in Darwin in relation to the <b>backwash</b> <b>effects</b> of NAPLAN Reading testing. Those participating in this study teach a number of students whose NAPLAN achievement in 2008 - 13 was either just above the National Minimum Standard in Reading or below it. This demonstrates the apparent challenge facing them as they need to cater for older students who have reading difficulties and must undertake the NAPLAN test.  A descriptive survey method was used to gather data on how teachers perceived the NAPLAN Reading testing and its effects on (i) their instructional decisions in class and (ii) the learning outcomes of their students. Data showed that although teachers were polarised on whether they felt positively or negatively towards NAPLAN, they generally viewed NAPLAN as a high-stakes test which put extra pressure on them and their students. On the whole teachers had negative perceptions of testing and its effects; most teachers reported that they engaged in test-preparation practices such as “teaching to the test”, thereby distorting and narrowing the curriculum. However, some teachers expressed a contrary view, claiming that the testing has positive <b>effects</b> (beneficial <b>backwash)</b> or no <b>effect</b> (neutral <b>backwash)</b> on their instructional decisions and student learning. As it is unlikely that high-stakes testing and accountability pressures on Australian teachers will be reduced, understanding the phenomenon of backwash and how teachers perceive testing is a useful way of contributing to the debate about the value of national tests such as these...|$|R
40|$|In 2006, {{after years}} of stagnating and even {{significantly}} declining production, the construction industry finally experienced a year of strong growth (Table 1). In nominal terms, the industry expanded by 7 % in 2006. After allowing for price increases, there was real growth of almost 5 %, much higher than expected. Admittedly, one cause of this expansion was {{the effect of a}} VAT increase announced for 1 January 2007. A large number of both public and private investors brought projects forward to 2006 to avoid the increased VAT charges. Yet at the beginning of 2007, undiminished high construction production could be observed and {{there was no sign of}} the expected <b>backwash</b> <b>effects.</b> In the course of the year, however, the growth rate in construction slowed considerably. There was a steep rise in construction prices at the beginning of 2007. Here, the large increase in VAT as of 1 January 2007 must be taken into account. But even without the effect of higher VAT, the price increase over the previous year amounts to around four percent. This is partly due to higher construction costs. On the other hand, we can assume that companies also experienced an improvement in their earnings. Towards the end of 2007, prices began to stabilize. Nevertheless, the average real growth of construction volume for 2007 was only just under 2 %. In 2008, continued moderate growth is expected for real construction volume. The annual average growth rate should be 1 %. In the new Länder the growth rate should be lower than in the old Länder. Housing demand, Construction industry, Estimates 2008...|$|R
