40|$|An {{open-loop}} control strategy for vibration suppression of a flexible manipulator system using genetic algorithms {{is presented in}} this paper. This consists of developing suitable forcing functions so that the dominant vibration modes of the system are not excited and hence the system vibration is reduced. The method requires that the vibration modes of the system be determined very precisely. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used for this purpose. Low-pass and <b>band-stop</b> (elliptic type) <b>filtered</b> bang-bang torque inputs are accordingly developed {{on the basis of}} the identified vibration modes. The filtered torque inputs thus developed are applied to the system in an open-loop configuration and their performances in suppressing structural vibrations of the system are assessed in comparison to a bang-bang torque input.
