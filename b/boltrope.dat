60|$|Twenty men sprang eagerly {{forward to}} execute the order, among the {{foremost}} of whom were <b>Boltrope</b> and the stranger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! no--no--dear Mr. <b>Boltrope,</b> you mistook {{me and my}} {{doctrine}} altogether!" [...] exclaimed the chaplain; [...] "at {{least you}} mistook----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Boat, ahoy!" [...] murmured <b>Boltrope,</b> {{through a}} trumpet, which, aided by his lungs, {{produced}} sounds {{not unlike the}} roaring of a bull.|$|E
60|$|We {{were ordered}} to the West Indies. Although Captain <b>Boltrope's</b> manner toward me was still severe, and even harsh, I {{understood}} that my name had been favorably mentioned in the despatches.|$|R
6000|$|... "How, now, brother!" [...] exclaimed <b>Boltrope,</b> with a {{smile of}} grim fierceness; [...] "some of that grist has gone to your mill, ha!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Captain <b>Boltrope,</b> as {{he smiled}} grimly, [...] "under the circumstances, Mr. Breezy, {{you had better}} go to the {{masthead}} too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bess his 'ittle heart! Did he {{have the}} naughty fever?" [...] This face seemed again changed to the {{well-known}} stern features of Captain <b>Boltrope.</b>|$|E
6000|$|And so Captain <b>Boltrope</b> was my father. Heavens! Was it a dream? I {{recalled}} his stern manner, his observant eye, his ill-concealed uneasiness when in my presence. I longed to embrace him. Staggering to my feet, I rushed in my scanty apparel to the deck, where Captain <b>Boltrope</b> was just then engaged in receiving the Governor's wife and daughter. The ladies shrieked; the youngest, a beautiful girl, blushed deeply. Heeding them not, I sank at his feet, and, embracing them, cried,-- ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the news}} of the sudden and serious illness of Captain <b>Boltrope</b> put off the duel. I hastened to his bedside, but too late,--an hour {{previous}} he had given up the ghost.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps, sir," [...] {{interrupted}} Griffith, gently, [...] "our honest friend {{will not}} be more fortunate now. Is there nothing earthly that hangs upon your mind, <b>Boltrope?</b> no wish to be remembered to any one, nor any bequest to make of your property?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Boltrope</b> {{listened to}} this sudden {{alteration}} {{in the language}} of his commander with sufficient wonder; nor was it until he had shaken his head repeatedly, with the manner of one who saw deeper than his neighbors into a mystery, that he found leisure to observe: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One, two, {{three rows}} of teeth!" [...] said <b>Boltrope,</b> {{deliberately}} counting the tiers of guns that bristled {{along the sides}} of the enemy; [...] "a three- decker! Jack Manly would show his stern to such a fellow t, and even the bloody Scotchman would run!" ...|$|E
60|$|No {{part of the}} {{preceding}} scene had been unobserved by <b>Boltrope,</b> whose small, hard eyes were observed by the young men to twinkle, when they returned into the state apartment; and they approached their wounded comrade to apologize for the seeming neglect that their conduct had displayed.|$|E
6000|$|When we {{were called}} {{down to the}} deck I thought it {{a good chance to}} profit by this instruction. I {{approached}} Captain <b>Boltrope</b> and repeated the salute without conscientiously omitting a single detail. He remained for a moment livid and speechless. At length he gasped out,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dead!" [...] said <b>Boltrope,</b> {{suspending}} {{the operation}} of his active jaws for a moment, in surprise; [...] "and buried in a wet jacket! Well, it is lucky 'tis no worse; for damme if I did not think every stick in the ship would have been cut out of her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Boltrope</b> {{appeared}} to be choking; he made an attempt to raise his exhausted frame on the couch; but fell back exhausted and dying, perhaps a little prematurely, through the powerful and unusual emotions that were struggling for <b>Boltrope</b> {{appeared to}} be choking; he made an attempt to raise his 'exhausted frame on the couch; but fell back exhausted and dying, perhaps a little prematurely, through the powerful and unusual emotions that were struggling for utterance. [...] "God forgive me my misdeeds!" [...] he at length said, [...] "and chiefly for ever speaking a word against your discipline; remember the best bower--and look to the slings of the lower yards--and--and--he'll do it, Dicky, he'll do it! I'm casting off--the fasts--of life--and so God bless ye all--and give ye good weather--going large--or on a bowline!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Flag!" [...] echoed <b>Boltrope,</b> {{dropping}} his trumpet in amazement--"that's a big word {{to come out}} of a jolly-boat! Jack Manly himself could not have spoken it with a fuller mouth; but I'll know who it is that carries such a weather helm, with a Yankee man-of-war's prize! Boat ahoy! I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! you are there, Griff, {{and with}} a whole skin, I see," [...] cried Barnstable, smiling with pleasure; [...] "they have passed poor <b>Boltrope</b> down {{into one of his}} own storerooms! If that fellow's {{bowsprit}} had held on ten minutes longer, what a mark I should have made on his face and eyes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You young devil, {{what are}} you doing?" [...] said a stifled voice behind me. I looked up and beheld Captain <b>Boltrope,</b> endeavoring to calm his stern features, but the {{twitching}} around his mouth betrayed his intense enjoyment of the scene. [...] "Go to the masthead--up with you, sir!" [...] he repeated sternly to Briggs.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the most}} {{remarkable}} glass of grog you have, <b>Boltrope,</b> that I ever sailed with; it draws as little water as the Ariel, and is as hard to find the bottom. If your spirit-room enjoys {{the same sort of}} engine to replenish it, as you pump out your rum, Congress will sail this frigate cheaply." ...|$|E
6000|$|An {{official}} letter, {{with the}} Admiralty seal, {{informed me that}} I was expected to join H. M. ship Belcher, Captain <b>Boltrope,</b> at Portsmouth, without delay. In a few days I presented myself to a tall, stern- visaged man, who was slowly pacing the leeward side of the quarter- deck. As I touched my hat he eyed me sternly:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, very good, sir!" [...] screamed Captain <b>Boltrope,</b> {{rubbing his}} hands and {{absolutely}} capering about the deck with rage. [...] "O d--n you! Of course you shall! O ho! the gunner's daughter! O, h--ll! this is too much! Boatswain's mate!" [...] Before I well knew where I was, I was seized, borne to an eight-pounder, tied upon it and flogged! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{presence}} of Mr. <b>Boltrope</b> {{being required to}} take charge of the cutter, the divine was denied an opportunity of dissenting from the opinions of his rough companion; for the loveliness of their novel shipmates had not failed to plead loudly in their favor with every man in the cutter whose habits and ideas had not become rigidly set in obstinacy.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR BOY,--I {{regret to}} inform you that in all {{probability}} you are not my son. Your mother, I am grieved to say, was a highly improper person. Who your father may be, I really cannot say, but perhaps the Honorable Henry <b>Boltrope,</b> Captain R. N., may be able {{to inform you}}. Circumstances over which I have no control have deferred this important disclosure. YOUR STRICKEN PARENT.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not the}} {{province}} of man to determine on the decrees of the merciful dispensations of the Deity; and nothing that I can do, Mr. <b>Boltrope,</b> will have any weight in making up the mighty and irrevocable decree. What I said to you last night, in our conversation on this very subject, must still be fresh in your memory, {{and there is no}} good reason why I should hold a different language to you now," ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] muttered <b>Boltrope</b> to {{his friend}} the chaplain, [...] "now the old man has hauled out his mizzen, you'll see him carry a weather-helm! He wakes up about as often as the trades shift their points, and that's once in six months. But when {{there has been a}} neap-tide in his temper for any time, you're sure to find it {{followed}} by a flood with a vengeance. Let us hear what the first lieutenant can say in favor of his petticoat quality!" ...|$|E
6000|$|With the {{appearance}} of light, the boatswain sent his rough summons through the vessel, and the crew were collected in solemn silence in her gangways to [...] "bury the dead." [...] The bodies of <b>Boltrope,</b> {{of one or two}} of her inferior officers, and of several common men who had died of their wounds in the night, were, with the usual formalities, committed to the deep; when the yards of the ship were again braced by the wind, and she glided along the trackless waste, leaving no memorial, {{in the midst of the}} ever-rolling waters, to mark the place of their sepulture.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] {{returned}} <b>Boltrope,</b> with {{a little}} show of pertinacity, [...] "I have an opinion that the cleaner a man takes his hands into the other world, of the matters of duty in this the better he will be fitted to handle anything new.--Now, the parson, here, undertook to lay down the doctrine last night {{that it was no}} matter how well or how ill a man behaved himself, so that he squared his conscience by the lifts and braces of faith; which I take to be a doctrine that is not to be preached on shipboard; for it would play the devil with the best ship's company that was ever mustered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What signifies a calling?" [...] {{returned}} <b>Boltrope,</b> {{catching his}} breath after a most persevering draught: [...] "a man's shins are his shins, let his upper works belong to what sarvice they may. I took an early prejudyce against knee-breeches, perhaps from a trick I've always had of figuring the devil as wearing them. You know, parson, we seldom hear much said of a man, without forming {{some sort of}} an idea concerning his rigging and fashion-pieces--and so, as I had no particular reason to believe that Satan went naked--keep full, ye lubber; now you are running into the wind's eye, and be d----d to ye!--But as I was saying, I always took a conceit that the devil wore knee-breeches and a cock'd hat. There's some of our young lieutenants, who come to muster on Sundays in cock'd hats, just like soldier-officers; but, d'ye see, I would sooner show my nose under a nightcap than under a scraper!" ...|$|E
60|$|Between {{two of the}} sullen cannon, {{which gave}} such an air of {{singular}} wildness to the real comfort of the cabin, was placed a large couch, on which the colonel was lying, evidently near his end. Cecilia was weeping by his side, her dark ringlets falling in unheeded confusion around her pale features, and sweeping in their rich exuberance the deck on which she kneeled. Katherine leaned tenderly over {{the form of the}} dying veteran, while her dark, tearful eyes seemed to express self-accusation blended with deep commiseration. A few attendants of both sexes surrounded the solemn scene, all of whom appeared to be {{under the influence of the}} hopeless intelligence which the medical officer had but that moment communicated. The servants of the ship had replaced the furniture with a care that mocked the dreadful struggle that so recently disfigured the warlike apartment, and the stout square frame of <b>Boltrope</b> occupied the opposite settee, his head resting on the lap of the captain's steward, and his hand gently held in the grasp of his friend the chaplain. Griffith had heard of the wound of the master, but his own eyes now conveyed the first intelligence of the situation of Colonel Howard. When the shock of this sudden discovery had a little subsided, the young man approached the couch of the latter, and attempted to express his regret and pity, in a voice that afforded an assurance of his sincerity.|$|E
60|$|His next {{work was}} the Pilot, {{in which he}} showed how, from the vicissitudes of a life at sea, its perils and escapes, from the beauty and terrors of the great deep, from the working of a vessel on a long voyage, and from the frank, brave, and generous but {{peculiar}} character of the seaman, may be drawn materials of romance by which the minds of men may be as deeply moved as by anything {{in the power of}} romance to present. In this walk, Cooper has had many disciples but no rival. All who have since written romances of the sea have been but travellers in a country of which he was the great discoverer; and none of them all seemed to have loved a ship as Cooper loved it, or have been able so strongly to interest all classes of readers in its fortunes. Among other personages drawn with great strength in the Pilot, is the general favorite, Tom Coffin, the thorough seaman with all the virtues and {{one or two of the}} infirmities of his profession, superstitious, as seamen are apt to be, yet whose superstitions strike us as but an irregular growth of his devout recognition of the Power who holds the ocean in the hollow of his hand; true-hearted, gentle, full of resources, collected in danger, and at last calmly perishing at the post of duty, with the vessel he has long guided, by what I may call a great and magnanimous death. His rougher and coarser companion, <b>Boltrope,</b> is drawn with scarcely less skill, and with a no less vigorous hand.|$|E
60|$|The Pilot {{threw him}} a still fiercer glance, and turning {{away with a}} look of disgust, he walked along the {{quarterdeck}} towards the stern of the vessel, with an air of haughty silence, as if disdaining to answer. <b>Boltrope</b> kept his eyes fastened on him for a moment longer, with some appearance of scorn; but the arrival of the boat first hailed, which proved to be the barge, immediately drew his attention to other matters. Barnstable had been rowing about in the ocean for a long time, unable to find the cutter; and as he had been compelled to suit his own demeanor to those with whom he was associated, he reached the Alacrity in no very good-humored mood. Colonel Howard and his niece had maintained during the whole period the most rigid silence, the former from pride, and the latter touched with her uncle's evident displeasure; and Katherine, though secretly elated with the success of all her projects, was content to emulate their demeanor for a short time, in order to save appearances. Barnstable had several times addressed himself to the latter, without receiving any other answer than such as was absolutely necessary to prevent the lover from taking direct offence, {{at the same time that}} she intimated by her manner her willingness to remain silent. Accordingly, the lieutenant, after aiding the ladies to enter the cutter, and offering to perform the same service to Colonel Howard, which was coldly declined, turned, with that sort of irritation that is by no means less rare in vessels of war than with poor human nature generally, and gave vent to his spleen where he dared.|$|E
60|$|As {{the freedom}} of a {{successful}} expedition was unavoidably permitted, loud jokes, and louder merriment, broke on the silent waters from the reckless seamen, while the exhilarating can passed from hand to hand, strange oaths and dreadful denunciations breaking forth at times {{from some of the}} excited crew against their enemy. At length the bustle of re-embarking gradually subsided, and many of the crew descended to the hold of the cutter, in quest of room to stretch their limbs, when a clear, manly voice was heard rising above the deep in those strains that a seaman most loves to hear. Air succeeded air, from different voices, until even the spirit of harmony grew dull with fatigue, and verses began to be heard where songs were expected, and fleeting lines succeeded stanzas. The decks were soon covered with prostrate men, seeking their natural rest under the open heavens, and perhaps dreaming, as they yielded heavily to the rolling of the vessel, of scenes of other times in their own hemisphere. The dark glances of Katherine were concealed beneath her falling lids: and even Cecilia, with her head bowed on the shoulder of her cousin, slept sweetly in innocence and peace. <b>Boltrope</b> groped his way into the hold among the seamen, where, kicking one of the most fortunate of the men from his berth, he established himself in his place with all that cool indifference to the other's comfort that had grown with his experience, from the time when he was treated thus cavalierly in his own person to the present moment. In this manner head was dropped after head on the planks, the guns, or on whatever first offered for a pillow, until Griffith and Barnstable, alone, were left pacing the different sides of the quarter-deck in haughty silence.|$|E
60|$|During {{the time}} {{occupied}} by the incidents that occurred after the Pilot had made his descent on the land, the Alacrity, now under the orders of Mr. <b>Boltrope,</b> {{the master of the}} frigate, lay off and on, in readiness to receive the successful mariners. The direction of the wind had been gradually changing from the northeast to the south, during the close of the day; and long before the middle watches of the night, the wary old seaman, who, it may be remembered, had expressed, in the council of war, such a determined reluctance to trust his person within the realm of Britain, ordered the man who steered the cutter to stand in boldly for the land. Whenever the lead told them that it was prudent to tack, the course of the vessel was changed: and in this manner the seamen continued to employ the hours in patient attendance on the adventurers. The sailing-master, who had spent the early years of his life as the commander of divers vessels employed in trading, was apt, like many men of his vocation and origin, to mistake the absence of refinement for the surest evidence of seamanship; and, consequently, he held the little courtesies and punctilios of a man-of-war in high disdain. His peculiar duties of superintending the expenditure of the ship's stores, in their several departments; of keeping the frigate's log-book; and of making his daily examinations into the state of her sails and rigging--brought him so little in collision with the gay, laughing, reckless young lieutenants, who superintended the ordinary management of the vessel, that he might be said to have formed a distinct species of the animal, though certainly of the same genus with his more polished messmates. Whenever circumstances, however, required that he should depart from the dull routine of his duty, he made it a rule, as far as possible, to associate himself with such of the crew as possessed habits and opinions the least at variance with his own.|$|E
6000|$|An earnest {{desire to}} {{ameliorate}} {{the situation of}} those who were doomed to meet death on the great deep had induced an experienced and simple- hearted divine to accept this station, in the fond hope that he might be made the favored instrument of salvation to many, who were then existing in a state of the most abandoned self-forgetfulness. Neither our limits, nor our present object, will permit the relation of the many causes that led, not only to an entire frustration of all his visionary expectations, but to an issue which rendered the struggle of the good divine with himself both arduous and ominous, in order to maintain his own claims to the merited distinctions of his sacred office. The consciousness of his backsliding had so far lessened the earthly, if not the spiritual, pride of the chaplain, as to induce him to relish the society of the rude master, whose years had brought him, at times, to take certain views of futurity that were singularly affected by the peculiar character of the individual. It might have been that both found themselves out of their places--but it was owing to some such secret sympathy, let its origin be what it would, that the two came to be fond of each other's company. On the night in question, Mr. <b>Boltrope</b> had invited the chaplain to accompany him in the Alacrity; adding, in his broad, rough language, that as there was to be fighting on shore, [...] "his hand might come in play with some poor fellow or other." [...] This singular invitation had been accepted, as well from a desire to relieve the monotony of a sea-life by any change, as perhaps with a secret yearning in the breast of the troubled divine to get as nigh to terra firma as possible. Accordingly, after the Pilot had landed with his boisterous party, the sailing-master and the chaplain, together with a boatswain's mate and some ten or twelve seamen, were left in quiet possession of the cutter. The first few hours of this peaceable intercourse had been spent by the worthy messmates, in the little cabin of the vessel, over a can of grog; the savory relish of which was much increased by a characteristic disquisition on polemical subjects, which our readers have great reason to regret it is not our present humor to record. When, however, the winds invited the near approach to the hostile shores already mentioned, the prudent sailing-master adjourned the discussion to another and more suitable time, removing himself and the can, by the same operation, to the quarter-deck.|$|E
5000|$|A cringle is an eye {{through which}} to pass a rope. In {{nautical}} settings, the word refers to a small hole anywhere along the edge or {{in the corner of}} a sail, rimmed with stranded cordage and worked into the <b>boltrope.</b> [...] Typically it encloses a metal grommet for reinforcement and to reduce wear. In this context, cringle and grommet coincide enough that the two are sometimes used interchangeably.|$|E
