25|$|SL: {{entry-level}} variant, {{available only}} as five-door hatchback, featuring the five-speed manual transmission and 1.6-litre engine combination. The <b>brake</b> <b>setup</b> for the LD series Astra in any specification was a disc/drum setup, whereas the equivalent Australian Pulsars had four-wheel disc brakes as standard.|$|E
25|$|The {{rebuilding}} involved stripping {{back to the}} frame, {{with everything}} except for the nose section and monocoque frame removed. Changes included the EMD 645E3 engines being replaced with overhauled EMD 645E3C engines imported from Morrison Knudsen in the USA, the original main alternators were rebuilt from AR10/A4-D14 to the AR10/A9-D14 type, refurbished D78 traction motors replaced the originals along with a new gear ratio, and new MK-LOC microprocessor controls were fitted. The cab was upgraded to modern standards, the <b>brake</b> <b>setup</b> was also changed from twin to single shoe per wheel, {{and a number of}} other small changes were made to assist maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|The first mass {{production}} {{use of the}} modern disc brake was in 1955, on the Citroën DS, which featured caliper-type front disc brakes among its many innovations. These discs were mounted inboard near the transmission, and were powered by the vehicle's central hydraulic system. [...] This model went on to sell 1.5 million units over 20 years with the same <b>brake</b> <b>setup.</b>|$|E
50|$|Drum brakes {{generally}} can {{be found}} on older car and truck models. However, because of their low production cost, drum <b>brake</b> <b>setups</b> are also installed on the rear of some low-cost newer vehicles. Compared to modern disc brakes, drum brakes wear out faster due to their tendency to overheat.|$|R
50|$|The CM400 series {{includes}} only a speedometer {{and three}} indicator lights (neutral, oil pressure, high beam) with a tachometer for the C and T models. The E (economy) model had wire wheels and drum brakes, {{while the others}} had Comstar wheels and a front disk/rear drum <b>braking</b> <b>setup.</b> While not particularly powerful, the CM400's handling makes {{it one of the}} great starter bikes.|$|R
50|$|The main {{downside}} to {{this method is}} that, similar to a smooth rim, even small amounts of moisture will drastically reduce the stopping performance of this <b>braking</b> <b>setup.</b> Some spray-on products are available to coat rims to give a tar like stopping performance. Generally only riders who live in very dry climates or ride only on dry surfaces in dry weather favour this method of enhancing the brake.|$|R
50|$|Cheaper models now {{featured}} {{drum brakes}} all around, whilst higher spec models retained the 55's front disk <b>brake</b> <b>setup.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{third row}} is also better {{upholstered}} in the seven-seat version. It was available with either four-wheel disc brakes or traditional front disc/rear drum <b>brake</b> <b>setup,</b> with anti-lock brakes (ABS) as an option.|$|E
50|$|The 25 {{was also}} {{exported}} to Australia. Introduced in 1985, it was priced at A$35,000 without cruise control. It had a disc-drum <b>brake</b> <b>setup,</b> {{rather than a}} 4-wheel-discs as on the Renault 8.|$|E
5000|$|Low {{gear ratio}} single-speed bikes have {{advantages}} for quick acceleration and control {{on a small}} court. Although any bike is acceptable for the game, eventually most players customize their bikes especially for bike polo and their playing needs. Most riders prefer a short wheelbase for tight turning and a smaller [...] "5-hole" [...] {{as well as a}} medium to long stem for better turning. Front brake or dual <b>brake</b> <b>setups</b> are the most popular.|$|R
50|$|BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars is {{the most}} {{sophisticated}} stock car formula, with a race-tuned V8 engine developing 650 bhp, quick-change axles and gearboxes and staggered chassis and <b>braking</b> <b>setups</b> for constant left turning. Large bumpers are mandatory and contact is encouraged to remove opponents. Smaller BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars, previously known as 'Junior Stock Cars', is also very popular. A downsized version of the Formula 1 Stock Car, these cars are powered by a 2-litre Ford engine. V8 Hotstox is a third BriSCA formula that uses the Rover V8 engine.|$|R
5000|$|Porsche made {{significant}} updates to the GT3 for 2004 (the first year {{the car was}} offered to US customers), using the 2002 996 facelift including headlights that were differentiated from the Porsche Boxster. The 2004 version {{is commonly known as}} the 996.2 GT3. Horsepower was raised to [...] and torque to 284 lbft Nm, 80% of which was available from 2,000 rpm. The <b>braking</b> <b>setup</b> was upgraded, now featuring 6-piston calipers on the front (rears remained 4-piston), and the Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake system was offered as an option.|$|R

50|$|The {{braking system}} now {{featured}} thicker {{front and rear}} discs, twin-piston aluminium-headed front calipers, bigger non-asbestos brake pads, larger master cylinder and a higher capacity booster. The discs were now ventilated 287x28 mm at the front and solid 287x16 mm at the back.

40|$|With the {{conventional}} nonrenewable {{sources of energy}} nearing depletion, the world is on a lookout for alternate source of renewable energy. The problem plaguing the world is pollution and its ill effects. The automotive industry, highest guzzler of nonrenewable sources {{and one of the}} highest polluting source, needs to shift its focus towards the renewable fuels to escape the energy crisis and the perils of pollution. The green vehicle is a solution designed, having these problems in mind. Green vehicle is powered using solar energy, wind energy, regenerative braking and external electric power supply. The energy is stored in a battery, which drives the motor through a speed controller. The battery and motor are connected by means of a regenerative <b>braking</b> <b>setup,</b> so that the energy spent can be captured again and can help in increasing the efficiency of the three wheeler...|$|R
5000|$|Because the Low Voltage Propulsion {{system was}} not {{compatible}} with earlier High Voltage equipment, the Flivvers could not run with those cars. Because the Flivver AMRE <b>braking</b> <b>setup</b> was not {{compatible with the}} other Low Voltage equipment, the Flivvers could not run with those cars either. Therefore, they could only run amongst themselves. Further, they were found to perform better in certain specific combinations than in others, {{and so they were}} left to run in these [...] "optimal" [...] configurations. When arranged in less than optimal configurations, the cars often gave a very rough ride with a lot of bucking. In optimal configurations they were respectable performers. Many IRT crews commented about the speed of these cars, even noting {{that at the end of}} their service lives, they were still significantly faster than the other equipment running. This was because, towards the end of their operation, trailers cars were eliminated and the Flivvers operated in trains of all motor cars. Historians hypothesize that their speed was a large reason why they were typically assigned to express services throughout their lifetimes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Magnetorheological (MR) fluids {{can be used}} as brake {{friction}} materials [1 - 6]. During braking, kinetic energy of machines gets converted into heat and shear thinning of MR fluid due to increase in temperature occurs which in turn reduces the braking effect. To lessen the effect of heat generation on MR fluids due to heat, synthesis of magnetorheological fluid using nano-copper-powder has been proposed. To explore the feasibility of incorporating copper powder, four carbonyl iron (CI) powder based MR fluids (without any copper powder, with 0. 25 % weight, 0. 5 % weight and 0. 75 % weight copper powder) have been synthesized. Yield stress of all four MR fluids have been estimated using magnetorheometer. A flywheel based MR <b>brake</b> experimental <b>setup</b> has been developed to analyze the performance of synthesized MR fluids. To increase the braking torque of MR brake, compression mode along with the shear mode has been introduced. The comparison of the braking torque in shear and compression modes has been presented. “T ” type thermocouples have been used to measure the temperature distribution of the fabricated MR brake. Results of braking torque and corresponding temperature distribution are presented...|$|R

50|$|The 1998 Escort ZX2 {{replaced}} the Ford Probe as Ford's sport compact car. The ZX2 {{was a much}} lower-slung and rakish car than either the Escort sedan and wagon, aimed squarely at the youth market {{as a replacement for}} the Escort GT (although lacking the latter's rear disc <b>brake</b> <b>setup)</b> and was built exclusively at Ford's Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico assembly plant. The interior was refreshed for 1999, and the model was retired after 2003. It had a completely redesigned dashboard, and included a panel that unified the heat and radio controls, {{similar to that of the}} third generation Ford Taurus.|$|E
50|$|The brakes in the BH Persona {{consist of}} {{ventilated}} discs {{at the front}} and drums at the back. Although the old CM Persona had disc brakes both front and rear, the <b>brake</b> <b>setup</b> in the new Persona is more competent. At a speed of 100 km/h, it would take 41.4 metres to reach a complete stop, compared to 44.6 metres in the old Persona, an improvement of approximately 7%. The Standard and Executive BH Persona variants get 185/55R15 Silverstone Kruizer tyres, while the Premium model is fitted with 185/55R15 Goodyear Assurance tyres. The new Persona has a kerb weight between 1,155 kg and 1,210 kg depending on the variant, which represents an increase of between 20 and 30 kg over the Iriz.|$|E
50|$|This {{allows the}} {{installation}} of a cog (or freewheel) {{on one side of}} the hub, and another (cog or freewheel) on the other side of the same hub. Reversing the rear wheel allows switching between Fixed/Free drivetrain, between two different size gears, or both. Generally, the freewheel is selected to be the same size, or slightly larger (more teeth) than the fixed cog. Same size allows the same gearing, but with coasting option, while a slightly larger freewheel gear allows coasting and easier pedaling for longer or hilly rides. Both could also be freewheels for two different coasting gear selections. Any two different size cogs/freewheels can be used as long as they are within the limits of adjustibility allowed by the length of the frame's dropout slots, derailleur cage and chain length. Large differences in the number of teeth may require adding or subtracting chain links to achieve proper fit. Also, if rear brakes are used (recommended for fixed/free, or free/free <b>setups)</b> <b>brake</b> pad reach to the rear rim may need to be adjusted.|$|R
25|$|The cars, as built, {{featured}} an old {{style of}} WABCO passenger braking equipment previously used on passenger railroads. The braking schedule {{was known as}} AM(P). Originally, it was known as AM, but the 'P' was added later to distinguish the setup from newer AM types like AML. Therefore {{for the purposes of}} this notation, the P has been included in parentheses – as in Braking Schedule AM(P) – to acknowledge this change. On a train equipped with AM(P), there was no electric synchronization of braking throughout a train, so a braking effort took a few seconds to apply or release uniformly throughout a train as different cars reacted to the brake request (which was entirely pneumatic) at different times. Additionally, an operator could not partially reduce his braking effort so as to smooth out stops or correct if he had undershot the mark (a feature known as a graduated release of the <b>brakes).</b> The AM(P) <b>setup</b> required the train to fully release the brakes before they could be applied again. This made making precision stops in stations by motormen a real art, but a task that the majority of IRT motormen proved up to.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on high-frequency brake squeal noise conducted on an appropriately designed experimental rig, called laboratory brake. Brake squeal {{is one of}} the major issues in the design process of an automotive brake and the development of a robust procedure for a “squeal-free” design is still under investigation. The high-frequency squeal is the most frequent noise generated by automotive brakes and is characterized by a wavelength of the “squealing mode” comparable to the length of the brake pad. The proposed “laboratory brake” is a good compromise between simple test rigs, such as the beam-on-disc, and the experimental setups that use real <b>brakes.</b> The beam-on-disc <b>setup</b> is a useful tool to understand the mechanism leading to the instability, but it does not simulate appropriately a real brake. On the other hand, real brakes are too complex for fundamental investigation and for efficient modeling. The experimental analysis shows a strong correlation between the length of the pad, the dynamic behavior of the system, and the squealing deformed shape. Moreover, depending on the length of the pad compared with the wavelength of the disc mode, three different kind of squeal instability may occur during experiments: the sine mode squeal, the cosine mode squeal and the rotating squeal. The latter is characterized by nodal diameters rotating during a squeal cycle. A linear reduced model, able to reproduce the dynamic behavior of the experimental setup, is used to predict the squeal occurrence. However, such linear model is not able to predict the rotating squeal characteristic that seems to be caused by nonlinear interactions due to the contact between the disc and the caliper...|$|R
50|$|The {{handling}} was average, but {{adequate for}} the era, with coil independent suspension {{at the front}} and leaf springs at the rear, employing lever arm shock absorbers or 'dampers' which, when worn, resulted in a characteristic 'wave motion' over undulating surfaces. The underpinnings were somewhat less exotic than the all-enveloping bodywork: the chassis and running gear were based on that of the well-proven 1949 Austin A70 Hampshire saloon (not {{to be confused with}} the smaller entry level A40 Devon). Brakes were initially a mix of hydraulic (front) and mechanical (rear) with 11 in drums, replaced by a fully hydraulic <b>brake</b> <b>setup</b> from 1951 onwards on the hardtop coupe (saloon)which with large diameter finned drums and vented wheels. This made for efficient anti-fade braking for the time, necessary to bring 26cwts (1323.64 kg) to rest.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the four}} famous aero-cars, the Dodge Daytona had {{featured}} special body modifications that included a 23 in stabilizer wing on the rear deck, a special sheet-metal [...] "nose cone" [...] that replaced the traditional upright front grille, a flush rear backlight (rear window area), a 'window cap' to cover the original Charger's recessed rear window, specific front fenders and hood that were modeled after the upcoming 1970 Charger, stainless steel A-pillar covers and fender mounted tire clearance/brake cooling scoops. The Daytona {{was built on the}} 1969 Charger's R/T trim specifications, meaning that it carried a heavy-duty suspension and <b>brake</b> <b>setup</b> and was equipped with a 440 CID Magnum engine as standard. Of special note to collectors is the optional 426 CID Hemi V8 engine, which only 70 of the 503 Daytonas carried.

5000|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} types of high performance brake systems on offer for the C4 S4. [...] All S4s' initially had 310 mm diameter by 25 mm thick, radially ventilated disc brakes up front, each with an ATE single-piston sliding caliper inside a 'UFO' styled bell-shaped disc. With the introduction of the V8 engine, a new front <b>brake</b> <b>setup</b> became standard; again the discs used radial ventilation, but these front discs were now sized at 314 mm by 30 mm - with a conventionally mounted Lucas-Girling caliper in an external position over the disc. US models had smaller 276 mm discs. The rear brakes, 269 mm by 20 mm and also radially ventilated - remained the same throughout C4 production; they used a Lucas-Girling single-piston sliding caliper with an integrated cable-actuated handbrake mechanism. A Bosch three-channel operation (four-channel sensing) Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with a mechanical load sensing valve for the rear brakes was standard throughout production.|$|E
40|$|In this dissertation, {{we focus}} on {{development}} of algorithms for estimating the severity of air leakage and for predicting the out-of-adjustment of pushrod in an air brake system of heavy commercial vehicles. The leakage of air from the brake system causes {{a reduction in the}} steady-state pressure in the brake chamber and an increase in the lag of the braking pressure response thereby increasing the stopping distance of the vehicle. Currently a presence of leak in the system is detected for the severities of leak that cause the reservoir pressure to drop below a threshold, such as, the leakage of compressed air due to rupture of the reservoir or of the hoses carrying the compressed air. The leakage of air is also possible due to several other reasons such as, cracks in the hoses, loose couplings between the hoses etc. The severities of leak, corresponding to such situations, do not lead to the reservoir pressure drop below the threshold; therefore, their presence remains undetected. For the detection and estimation of such severities of leak, a diagnostic scheme has been given and is based on a model developed for the mass ow rate of the leakage of air from the air brake system. Out-of-adjustment of the pushrod is the extension of pushrod beyond a prede- ned value and for safety concerns, an extension beyond this value is not desired. Currently no warning system is available for monitoring the out-of-adjustment of pushrod, except, during the safety inspection. Inspection of the pushrod for outof- adjustment is the most labor-intensive and time consuming task during a typical safety inspection procedure. For efficient and continuous monitoring of the pushrod for out-of-adjustment, a diagnostic algorithm for estimating the steady-state pushrod stroke has been developed. The scheme is expected to expedite the inspection process for the out-of-adjustment of pushrod. Experimental data from the air <b>brake</b> test <b>setup</b> at Texas A and M University has been used for corroborating both the models. Also, the problem of parameter estimation of sequential hybrid systems such as the air brake system, has been addressed. The " nature of the air brake system stems from the system being in di erent modes corresponding to di erent values of the displacement of the pushrod and is a result of di erent spring compliances associated with the pushrod in di erent ranges of its displacement. The air brake system is " in the sense that as the pressure increases, the displacement of the pushrod increases and there is a distinct sequence of modes that the system will transition through and upon a reduction in pressure, the sequence of modes is revisited in the reverse order. The mode to mode transition of the air brake system is governed by the parameters, such as, the clearance between the brake pad and the brake drum. The problem of estimation, that has been addressed, is as follows: Suppose the pressure in the air brake system were to be measured and that the motion of the pushrod is not measured. Is it possible to estimate the nal displacement of the pushrod without knowing the parameters, such as the clearance, that govern the system to transition from one mode to another...|$|R
5000|$|Buell XB models also {{incorporated}} the industry's first Zero Torsional Load (ZTL) perimeter floating front disc brake system, a patented [...] "inside-out" [...] wheel/brake design {{that puts the}} brake disc on {{the outer edge of}} the wheel,rather than at the hub. This lets the suspension function better, improving control and traction, through reducing unsprung weight on the front wheel, because only a single disc and caliper - with a corresponding reduction in bolts and brake fluid - is needed compared with the conventional dual-disc <b>brake</b> <b>setup</b> on most modern sport bikes. In an exchange in the pages of Motorcyclist magazine between Suzuki engineer James Parker, creator of the GSX-RADD hub-center steering system, and Buell's Director of Analysis, Test & Engineering Process, Abraham Askenazi, Parker conceded the ZTL system's advantage in unsprung weight. But he pointed out the remaining weight is located further out on the rim where it is most detrimental to acceleration and braking, and that there were potential heat transfer issues, and the need for one fork leg to be stronger than the other. Responding, Askenazi disputed all of Parker's criticisms, saying the ZTL system was 30% lighter than the brakes on the Suzuki GSX-R1000, and that the inertia of having the weight further out on the rim, and the heat generation near the tire, were not negative factors, based on testing. Askenazi concluded that testing and race track experience had proven the ZTL to be [...] "state of the art." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study a new <b>brake</b> <b>setup</b> was {{developed}} to test drum brake linings on an industrial brake with drum diameter of 30 ''. During the tests performed on the setup, the brake undergoes a series of cycles in which the drum is slowed down from service speed to standstill. In each cycle {{the same amount of}} energy is dissipated as during a realistic safety stop. This was obtained by adding a flywheel in the setup so that the system's kinetic energy at service speed matches the energy of the hoisting system dissipated during an emergency stop. Two different brake lining materials were characterized. Both materials were subjected to two test series to study the changes in coefficient of friction over a number of cycles. It was observed that the coefficient of friction of both linings was dependent on the drum temperature. The coefficient of friction of the first material decreased with increasing drum temperature, while the latter had the opposite behaviour...|$|E
