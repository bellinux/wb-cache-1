40|$|There {{are still}} {{substantial}} {{differences between the}} rights {{of men and women}} in most of southern Africa, and this is exacerbated by the discrepancy between written and actual practice, not to mention the lop-sided application of the law. In Botswana, the Emang Basadi Women <b>s</b> <b>Association</b> has researched the problem of land and property grabbing, including livestock and houses, after the death of a spouse or when a couple separates. This book s sometimes harrowing accounts of women s experiences, provided by victims and observers, lead into an analysis of the causes of property grabbing. The accounts and analysis, and the practical recommendations for legal reform, worth following in other countries, make for an exemplary book.
