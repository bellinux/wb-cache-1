5|$|The studio {{launched}} into {{the production of}} new animated features, {{the first of which}} was Pinocchio, released in February 1940. Pinocchio was not initially a box office success. The box office returns from the film's initial release were both below Snow Whites unprecedented success and the studio's expectations. Of the film's $2.289 million cost– twice of Snow White– Disney only recouped $1 million by late 1940, with studio reports of the film's final original box office take varying between $1.4 million and $1.9 million. However, Pinocchio was a critical success, winning the Academy Award for Best Original Song and Best Original Score, making it the first film of the studio to win not only either Oscar, but <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time.|$|E

25|$|Controversies {{concerning}} {{gifted education}} are varied and often highly politicized.

25|$|Retirement {{oriented}} taxes, such as Social Security {{or national}} insurance, also are {{a type of}} income tax, though not generally referred to as such.

25|$|A waist {{covering}} should {{generally be}} worn {{as part of}} a black tie ensemble.

Although the English authority Debrett's consider that wearing a waistcoat is smart, they no longer consider either waist covering to be essential. The American authority, The Emily Post Institute, considers them to be an essential component of proper black tie attire. Waist coverings shouldn't be matched to wedding theme colours.|$|E

A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position.

25|$|The Australian Red Ensign, {{is a red}} {{version of}} the Australian Flag and is a {{reserved}} civil ensign. From 1901 to 1954 the flag {{was used as a}} civil flag, to be flown by private citizens on land, while the government used the Blue Ensign, reflecting British practice. In 1941, Prime Minister Robert Menzies stated {{that there should be no}} restrictions on private citizens using the Blue Ensign on land, and in 1947 Prime Minister Ben Chifley reaffirmed this position, but it wasn't until the passage of the Flags Act 1953 that the restriction on civilians flying the Blue Ensign was officially lifted, after which use of the Red Ensign on land became a rarity. Under the Navigation and Shipping Act 1912 and the Shipping Registration Act 1981, the Red Ensign remains the only flag permitted for use by merchant ships registered in Australia. Pleasure craft may use either the Red Ensign or the national flag, but not <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{principle}} underlying {{this technique is}} that when the sample undergoes a physical transformation such as phase transitions, more or less heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on whether the process is exothermic or endothermic. For example, as a solid sample melts to a liquid, it will require more heat flowing to the sample to increase its temperature {{at the same rate as}} the reference. This is due to the absorption of heat by the sample as it undergoes the endothermic phase transition from solid to liquid. Likewise, as the sample undergoes exothermic processes (such as crystallization) less heat is required to raise the sample temperature. By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning calorimeters are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during such transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer curing.|$|E

25|$|LeuT {{has been}} co-crystallised with {{sertraline}} and (R)- and (S)-fluoxetine where the SSRIs {{have been found}} to bind as non-competitive inhibitors in a vestibule binding site (can be looked at as a second binding site), which is separated from the drugs binding site by the site chains of the two aromatic amino acids of the extracellular gate of the transport protein. The halogens on the SSRIs chemical structure all bind to the same HBP within LeuT and interact with similar amino acids, but the amino acid sequence in the HBP is highly preserved between LeuT and SERT. That suggest that in the human SERT the SSRIs also bind <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position and with similar manner, which is a key feature making the SSRIs selective for SERT. Conversely, there could be differences in their binding where {{the other part of the}} drug molecule will likely bind to SERT in a different way, given the diversity in their structure. The localisation of the vestibular binding site, as the primary SSRI binding site in SERT is, is however controversial since some research has shown that the SSRIs work in competitive manner by binding to the drugs binding site, not to the second binding site.|$|E

[...] Film critic Roger Ebert gave it {{two and a half}} stars out of four, declaring that the script was peopled from the [...] "Stock Characters Store" [...] and [...] "the movie could have been (a) a gay love story, or (b) an attack on the Mormon Church, but is an awkward fit by trying to be (c) <b>both</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time".
