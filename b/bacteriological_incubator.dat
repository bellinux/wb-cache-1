OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the bacterial contamination on toothbrush bristles using different methodologies. METHOD: We used 40 toothbrushes from healthy individuals aged 3 to 58 years. The samples were grown in test tubes containing trypticase soy broth sterile, and with the help of a tracking 0. 1 &# 956;l samples were placed on plates containing sheep blood agar 5 % and MacConkey agar then the samples were stored in a <b>bacteriological</b> <b>incubator</b> at 37 °C for 24 hours for later analysis.

CONCLUSION: According to the results presented in this study, we observed a high incidence of bacterial contamination in the brushes analyzed. The most frequent microorganisms were members of the Enterobacteriaceae. The usage time of toothbrushes may be related to contamination found and, therefore, not only good hygiene ensures the reduction of microbial load, but replacing the toothbrush can also ensure individuals better oral health...|$|E

These pH levels are chosen to investigate the E. Coli activity in acidic medium. My research question was “How do different pH levels affect the growth of Escherichia Coli by measuring its optical density via spectrophotometer?” According to the research question my hypothesis was “As the pH level of the medium increases, it will be more likely for E. Coli to die. ” In {{this experiment}} spectrophotometric method was used to measure the optical density of E. Coli in 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 pH levels. These pH levels are chosen so that experiment includes both acidic and neutral medium and the comparison of E. Coli activity can be made easily. Liquid broths with different pH levels were prepared and were put in <b>bacteriological</b> <b>incubator</b> for 1 day at a stable temperature. After 1 day the optic densities of these liquid broths were measured via spectrophotometer. Optical densities of these liquid broths illustrated the reproduction of the E. Coli. Higher optical density illustrates more reproduction of the bacteria. The optical density is higher in 6, 7 and 8 pH levels and this means that there is more reproduction of E.

So that this extended essay includes the comparison of the destabilizing effect of methylene blue with rifampicin which is a well-known αβ-fibril destabilizer. My research question was “Does the destabilizing effect of methylene blue on Aβ-fibril formation in vitro sufficient for its usage in the Alzheimer’s disease’s treatment compared to Rifampicin?” My hypothesis was “Methylene blue can destabilize Aβ-fibril formation which is a symptom of Alzheimer’s disease in vitro as much as Rifampicin. ” In order to answer the research question and test the hypothesis, Ellman’s spectrophotometric method and thioflavin-t fluorometric method was used. Ellman’s spectrophotometric method was to calculate the IC 50 value of methylene blue which will be used in the second part. Second part was the comparison of the fluorescence concentrations {{at the end of the}} 24 th hour. Destabilizers at their IC 50 values were put into bathtubs and the bathtubs were put into <b>bacteriological</b> <b>incubator.</b> At the end of the 24 th hour tubes were put into fluorometer device and the fluorescence concentrations were measured. As fluorescence concentration is directly proportional with αβ-fibril formation this measurement gave the necessary data about the destabilizing activity of methylene blue and rifampicin. At the end of the 24 th hour fluorescence concentrations in the tubes that contain methylene blue and rifampicin were close to each but t-test results showed that there is difference between them. After the calculation of percentage effects of the destabilizer, the difference was more observable: the effect of methylene blue was more compared to rifampicin.

The antibacterial activity of the essential oils was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC). The MIC was obtained by the microdilution technique using 96 -well microplates, in which we inserted: 100 μL of Brain Heart Infusion broth at double concentration, 100 μL of the dilution of the essential oils and 10 μL of bacterial suspension (1. 5 × 106 organisms / mL). The products were diluted from the initial concentration of 8 % up to 0. 0625 %. The MIC corresponded to the last dilution in which there was no presence of bacteria or turbidity in the culture medium.
