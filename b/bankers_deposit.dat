40|$|Until banking sector {{reforms were}} {{introduced}} in India in 1991, the emphasis in the credit provision through formal banking system was to meet the targets {{at the expense of}} the quality of credit and viability of the banking system. The policies after 1991 stipulated the banks to continue to meet targets on credit to socio-economically deprived sections and sectors. At the same time, banks were asked not to neglect the viability of the banking system. This paper examines the impact of such contrasting policies on the flow of credit and deposit mobilisation in rural and urban areas in Karnataka State, India. The paper argues that as <b>bankers</b> consider <b>deposits</b> a means for security, easy and attractive deposit schemes should be introduced in rural areas.

60|$|It is not {{impossible}} that {{the disposition of}} the lenders might be such, that they would cease to lend rather than acquiesce in any reduction of the rate of interest.

A slight fall would take place, and with that exception things would be as before, except that the capital {{in the hands of the}} banker would have put itself into the place of an equal portion of capital belonging to other lenders, who would themselves have engaged in business (e.g., by subscribing to some joint-stock company, or entering into commandite). Bankers' profits would then be limited to the ordinary rate chiefly by the division of the business among many banks, so that each on the average would receive no more interest on his deposits than would suffice to make up the interest on his own capital to the ordinary rate of profit after paying all expenses.|$|R

We show how to implement incentive-feasible allocations with a direct mechanism using circulating banknotes. Banking is essential: without it, the set of feasible allocations would be inferior. We show agents who are more patient or visible, or who have a bigger stake in the system or less ability to liquidate collateral make better bankers, because they are less inclined to renege on obligations. Other things equal, bankers should have good investment opportunities, {{but it can be}} efficient to sacrifice return by using a bank that is more trustworthy (less inclined to renege).

50|$|There was {{no central}} bank {{to monitor the}} money supply and control {{economic}} conditions, and nearly no regulation of the banking system. The setup of the banking system under the Empire allowed the exchange of extremely large sums without the physical transfer of coins, which led to fiat money. With no central bank, a professional <b>deposit</b> <b>banker</b> (argentarius, coactor argentarius, or later nummularius) received and held deposits for a fixed or indefinite term, and lent money to third parties. Generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers, so loans were made and credit was extended on risky terms. The senatorial elite were involved heavily in private lending, both as creditors and borrowers, making loans from their personal fortunes {{on the basis of}} social connections. Banks of classical antiquity typically kept less in reserves than the full total of customers' deposits, as they had no incentive to ensure that customers' deposits would be insured {{in the event of a}} bank run. It was common consensus among Romans at the time, especially due to Seneca's ideologies, that anyone involved in commerce should have access to credit. This tendency toward fiat money caused the money supply to fluctuate consistently.|$|R

The holder of a debt could use it as a means of payment by transferring it to another party, without cash changing hands. Although it has sometimes been thought that ancient Rome lacked [...] "paper" [...] or documentary transactions, the system of banks throughout the Empire also permitted the exchange of very large sums without the physical transfer of coins, {{in part because of the}} risks of moving large amounts of cash, particularly by sea. Only one serious credit shortage is known to have occurred in the early Empire, a credit crisis in 33 AD that put a number of senators at risk; the central government rescued the market through a loan of 100 million HS made by the emperor Tiberius to the banks (mensae). Generally, available capital exceeded the amount needed by borrowers. The central government itself did not borrow money, and without public debt had to fund deficits from cash reserves.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a new theory}} of money and banking based on an old story about money and banking. The story is that <b>bankers</b> originally accepted <b>deposits</b> for safe keeping, then their liabilities began to circulate {{as a means of}} payment (bank notes or checks). To capture this we propose a model where money is a genuine medium of exchange, but is subject to theft. We study competition between inside and outside money. We analyze how the equilibrium circulation of cash and demand deposits varies with the cost of banking and with the outside money supply. We consider cases where theft is exogenous and where it is endogenous, and cases with 100 % reserves and with fractional reserves.

More especially it is chie°y concerned with the activities of banks as holders of deposit accounts against which cheques are drawn for the payment of goods and services. In Anglo-Saxon countries, and in other countries where economic life is highly developed, these cheques constitute the major part of circulating medium.

Dhaka Bank Limited {{is one of the}} fastest growing banks in our country and the bank is contributing a lot to our economy with their banking operation since 1995. As a private commercial bank, DBL is trying it’s best to extend their services to the public. DBL, KDA Avenue Branch, Khulna, provides all kinds of commercial banking services to its customers. To be the premier financial institution in the country providing high quality products and services backed by latest technology and a team of highly motivated personnel to deliver Excellence in banking. As an intern I started working in Dhaka Bank on 1 st September 2015, and it ended on 30 th November 2015. I have worked in the general banking department of the bank. Dhaka Bank gave me the opportunity to work in the banking industry; I got a huge idea on how the whole banking system works. The tasks, that I have performed during the tenure of my internship has surely enriched my skills and this working experience in a bank was very beneficial to me. Bank is a financial intermediary, which mobilizes fund from surplus unit and deploy it to deficit unit. Bank mobilizes the fund by accepting deposits from depositors and allocates the fund by providing loan to borrower. The relationship between a banker and his customer begins with the opening of an account by the banker in the name of the customer. <b>Banker</b> solicits <b>deposits</b> from the public of different walks of life and having different financial status. Accepting deposits is one of the main functions of commercial banks. In DBL various types of accounts are offered to various customers. But there are some errors in account opening process in the banks. As a partial requirement of MBA program I need to go for internship to gather practical experience and need to submit the report regarding that practical knowledge. This report is originated after completing the MBA program from BRAC university of Bangladesh. This report is the outcome of the assigned internship, suggested by the supervisor. The report will definitely increase the knowledge of other students about errors in account opening, reason behind the errors and the possible solutions, and help to know the banking industry of Bangladesh.

Using a simple model for the determination of the optimal level of insurance coverage, it is shown that the optimal coverage is higher for developing compared to developed countries; a condition that is broadly satisfied by prevailing deposit insurance practices around the world.

40|$|This {{study will}} {{identify}} specific periods {{during the years}} 1975 - 1989 where change in bank risk may have occurred. The work of Kane and Unal (1988) is most similar to this study, although different econometric methodology was utilized. ^ Four return measures are tested. The returns to equity holders {{will be used as}} in many other studies. Certificates of deposit represent insured <b>deposits.</b> <b>Bankers</b> acceptances represents the uninsured debt. Interbank lending will be measured by federal funds. ^ For all of the debt series, the spread between the specific series and the treasury bill rate will be used as the risk measure. The regression coefficient will represent the risk premium of the debt series. ^ An econometric technique will be used to find switch point dates rather than to prespecify them as in traditional event study methodology. There are two procedures which have been used to do so. The first is the Goldfeld-Quandt switching regressions method developed by Goldfeld and Quandt (1972). The other is a combination of the cumulative sum of the squares of recursive residuals method, developed by Brown, Durbin, and Evans (1975), and the log likelihood ratio technique from Quandt (1958). ^ In this study, the cumulative sum of the squares of recursive residuals method and the log likelihood ratio will be used in the manner suggested by Hays and Upton (1986). The Hays and Upton contribution consists of a ratcheting technique using increasingly more observations. ^ After all switch points have been found and heteroskedasticity tested for, parameter estimates for the time periods between the dates will be obtained. If no heteroskedasticity was detected then ordinary least squares will be used. White 2 ̆ 7 s consistent covariance matrix will be employed when heteroskedasticity is found. In addition, if autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity is present, then that model will be used. ^ A binary dummy variable will be included which will take the value zero before and one after the date being considered. Tests will be performed on these coefficients for changes in risk. ...|$|R
