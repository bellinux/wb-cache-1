40|$|Online <b>Behavioural</b> {{targeted}} <b>Advertising</b> (OBA) {{has risen}} in prominence {{as a method}} to increase the effectiveness of online advertising. OBA operates by associating tags or labels to users based on their online activity and then using these labels to target them. This rise {{has been accompanied by}} privacy concerns from researchers, regulators and the press. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for measuring and understanding OBA in the online advertising market. We rely on training artificial online personas representing behavioural traits like 'cooking', 'movies', 'motor sports', etc. and build a measurement system that is automated, scalable and supports testing of multiple configurations. We observe that OBA is a frequent practice and notice that categories valued more by advertisers are more intensely targeted. In addition, we provide evidences showing that the advertising market targets sensitive topics (e. g, religion or health) despite the existence of regulation that bans such practices. We also compare the volume of OBA advertising for our personas in two different geographical locations (US and Spain) and see little geographic bias in terms of intensity of OBA targeting. Finally, we check for targeting with do-not-track (DNT) enabled and discover that DNT is not yet enforced in the web. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

Based on Eichner criteria of scientific theory a comparison of neoclassical, institutional, post-Keynesian and <b>behavioural</b> attitudes to <b>advertising</b> is carried on. The attitudes differ according to ontology and epistemology that determine standard headings and consequently also potential integration of advertising.

40|$|In this article, we analyse the {{determinants}} of firm-level profit margins in Indian manufacturing. The model we estimate is rich in its dynamic characterization allowing as it does for lagged terms, trend movements, business cycle effects and a structural break in 1991. We hypothesize that the reforms undertaken {{by the government in}} 1991 constitute a structural break that influences a firm's independence to react to other firms as well as the extent of competition faced by these firms. Inserting this into the standard industrial organization model of profits, we obtain a dynamic market model. Estimating this model for 1980 - 98, we find that the 1991 reforms did {{have a significant impact on}} profit margins in Indian industry. The reforms have worked through their impact on a firm's <b>behavioural</b> variables - <b>advertising,</b> Research and Development (R&D), capital-output ratios and managerial remuneration - though the precise variables that were significant varied from sector to sector. We find that relatively inefficient firms make significantly lower profits than others both before and after the liberalization as expected.

Method: This thesis follows a deductive approach. We are using secondary data from books, articles and studies but also primary data {{thanks to a}} questionnaire; which allows us to answer our purpose. Theoretical Framework: First define the online consumer behaviour and its characteristics through existing models and then define <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising,</b> how is the leisure industry using this marketing tool {{and what are the}} drawbacks of such practices. Conclusion: The authors conclude that Facebook users are more and more aware of the use of <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising.</b> But {{due to a lack of}} education about such marketing techniques the 18 - 30 years old tend to adopt mostly strict privacy settings with the intention to block those advertisements. The privacy issue is important and even if the users seems to be interested in the offers of the leisure industry there is still a long way before obtaining a full acceptance of this practice.

40|$|Scholars from a {{wide range}} of {{backgrounds}} have compared political and commercial marketing and advertising. Some have argued that the differences between these two spheres are relatively slight, others that they are fundamental. In this paper we attempt to problematize, deepen and add nuance to the voting-consumption analogy drawing on a range of literature in the political marketing and brand marketing fields. In order to add an empirical perspective to the discussion we draw on tentative findings from a small-scale exploratory case study of voting attitudes. The responses of eight focus groups of British voters to two well-known Labour Party election broadcasts were interpreted using theoretical concepts from brand marketing and also from cultural studies of political marketing. In conclusion, we argue that there may be aspects of audience response to political advertising that are incompatible with brand marketing theory. ‘Voters’ and ‘consumers’ do seem to share some resemblance in their affective, cognitive and <b>behavioural</b> responses to <b>advertising,</b> which is perhaps unsurprising, since political parties and commercial entities do sometimes employ similar marketing techniques. However, in this study these voters displayed certain responses that differentiated them strongly from consumers. This implies that the analogy between commercial and political marketing has its limitations. We conclude by suggesting that the voter-consumer analogy is highly plausible when viewed on a macro-level but becomes weaker as research focuses in on a micro-level analysis of the individual within the voting context...|$|R

Chapter 1 provides an introduction to music and advertising, highlighting contemporary research issues {{in this area and}} underlining research objectives and questions, as well as a rationale for the research. Chapter 2 provides a critical review of the academic literature on music in advertising, focussing on congruity as the overarching concept examined in the thesis, and identifying various dimensions of musical congruity. Chapter 3 provides the justification for the research methodology and the subsequent selection of a mixed methods approach. Chapter 4 (Study 1) presents the university advertising findings obtained through focus group, surveys, as well as the brief YouTube Analytics statistical data. Findings of Study 1 investigating the effects of musical congruity in the context of university advertising reveal that pop music produced the most positive responses in terms of consumers’ perceived image of the university and their intention to enrol. Study 2 presented in Chapter 5 develops, refines, and redefines the concept of musical in/congruity and extends it to the context of advertising music in order to address the ongoing flaws in many of the existing music and advertising studies pertaining to the use of incongruent musical stimuli. Findings indicate how the deliberate crafting of musical incongruity can be used to engage and amuse consumers, proposing that resolving musical incongruity may enhance consumers’ recall, ad attitude, perception of brand image and quality, as well as their purchase intent. Chapter 6 (Study 3) involves netnographic findings highlighting the effects of in/congruity on consumers’ lived experiences of musical consumption in advertising. Findings relate to musical taste, indexical congruity, repetition congruity, and semantic congruity. The thesis concludes with Chapter 7 (Discussion) and Chapter 8 (Conclusion) ...|$|R

What are the causes of fake news, political bots and fake social media accounts? 3. What are the problems and impacts of fake news, political bots and fake accounts? 4. What can be done against fake news culture? This submission gives special attention to the role of online advertising in fake news culture. (§§ 1. 1 - 1. 16) Reports, research and analyses suggest that fake news, automated social media bots that post content online and fake online attention, as well as fake profiles {{play a significant role in}} political communication on social media. (§§ 2. 1 - 2. 6) The proliferation of fake news, political bots and fake accounts on social media has interacting economic, political and ideological causes. There are no technological fixes to the problems associated with fake news. (§§ 3. 1 - 3. 5) There are a number of potential problems associated with fake news, political bots and fake accounts that can limit and negatively impact the public sphere: the undermining of human communication’s validity claims; threats to democracy; one-dimensional, instrumental, highly polarised and symbolically/communicatively violent politics; spirals of intensifying political aggression and violence. (§§ 4. 1 - 4. 12) There is a number of feasible measures that can be taken in order to challenge fake news culture. These include: Outlawing targeted and <b>behavioural</b> political online <b>advertising,</b> the substitution of algorithmic activity by paid human work of fact-checkers and knowledge professionals, the legal requirement to introduce a fake news alert button, providing support to new types of online platforms and new formats that decelerate news and political communication and act as slow media, the advancement of and support for public service Internet platforms, giving the BBC an important role in advancing public service Internet platforms that foster advertising-free political debate that challenges fake news, the introduction of an online advertising tax on all ads targeted at users accessing the Internet in the UK in order to provide a resource base for funding public service and alternative Internet platforms that foster a new culture of political debate...|$|R

40|$|Online {{advertising}} is a multi-billion dollar industry, forming {{one of the}} primary sources of income for many publishers that offer free web content. Online <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Advertising</b> (OBA), the practice of showing advertisements based on individual users' web browsing behaviours, greatly improves the expected effectiveness of advertisements, and is believed to be beneficial to advertisers and users alike. The privacy of users, however, is threatened by the widespread collection and exchange of users' browsing behaviour by dozens of companies for the purpose of <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising.</b> The aim of this thesis is to alleviate these privacy concerns by investigating how an online advertising system can serve advertisements tailored to users' interests within the current online advertising ecosystem, such that no party other than the user themselves can gain any knowledge of the user's interests. To protect user privacy in the online advertising ecosystem, two main challenges need to be overcome. Not only do advertising companies need to adapt their machine learning models to a setting in which they have no knowledge of user interests, they also need to integrate their privacy-preserving targeting systems into a complex advertising landscape where advertisement impressions are traded within a fraction of a second. We present two complete privacy-preserving protocols for online <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> that combine machine learning methods commonly encountered in existing advertising systems with secure multi-party computation techniques. The first protocol uses a threshold variant of an additively homomorphic cryptosystem to distribute trust between parties while allowing computations on encrypted data, such that advertisements can be served based on detailed user profiles. The second protocol distributes trust between advertising companies using an additively homomorphic threshold secret sharing scheme, allowing collaborative computations on user profiles while preventing a coalition of colluding parties smaller than a predefined threshold from obtaining any sensitive information. Both protocols achieve performance multilinear in the size of user profiles and the number of advertising campaigns, and show promising initial results in terms of privacy and performance. To the best of our knowledge, our two protocols are the first protocols that preserve user privacy in <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> while allowing the use of detailed user profiles and machine learning methods.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Research Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Emotions {{have become}} an {{important}} research topic in both the <b>behavioural</b> sciences and <b>advertising.</b> Nowadays, emotions are acknowledged as an important mediator of cognitive and behavioural consumer responses to advertising. Consequently, researchers in marketing and advertising have emphasised the need to consider emotions as a crucial factor in the advertising process. To test the viability of this assumption, an empirical research study was conducted at the Behavioural and Communication Research Division of the Bureau of Market Research (BMR). More specifically, the research study used a three–dimensional approach to measure generational differences in consumers’ emotional response to television advertisements. To capture immediate, positive and negative emotive responses towards a pre–selected test advertisement, the study used three research instruments, namely AdSAM, PrEmo (both non–verbal measurement instruments) and the List of Emotions (LoE) (verbal measurement instrument). Gauteng consumers (n = 102) who view television participated in the study, which revealed that ageing {{appears to be a}} significant antecedent in measuring emotive response to advertisements. In this regard, the study showed, among others, that Baby Boomers (older generation) were inclined to react to the advertisement in a different manner than younger generations (Millennials and Xers). For example, Baby Boomers found it easier to acknowledge higher levels of engagement with the test advertisement, as was noted in the high Arousal ratings. No significant differences were, however, evident between generations on the Pleasure dimension as all generations seem to have felt positively towards the test advertisement. Furthermore, although all generations felt positive emotive reactions when viewing the test advertisement, Millennials feel more Comfortable, whereas the Xers and Baby Boomers feel stronger Warmed emotions. Overall, older people tend to purposefully seek to experience positive emotions and avoid or limit negative emotions. In summary, both non–verbal and verbal measures reflected generational differences that seem to be more apparent when analysing negative emotions. The study also revealed that the AdSAM instrument appears to be advantageous when measuring emotions in television advertising due to its non–verbal properties. However, greater generational differences seem to be evident when emotions are measured with a verbal rather than non–verbal instrument. Against this background, certain recommendations for future research were made, amongst others, the need for further research on emotive reaction to television advertisements and the need for innovative research models that are customised for the diverse South African consumer market.

40|$|The rising market {{penetration}} of the mobile phone and rapid increase in wireless technology represent significant opportunities for advertisers to reach consumers. Mobile phone advertising has {{emerged as one of}} the fastest growing advertising mediums in recent times, and this rise is being led by Short Message Service (SMS) advertising. Despite the growing number of worldwide companies adopting SMS advertising, very little is understood about consumer reactions to this medium. In particular, little academic research has been conducted on consumers’ acceptance of this medium and their <b>behavioural</b> responses to <b>advertising</b> messages. In addition, researchers have thus far been unable to identify the impact of culture on acceptance and response to SMS advertising. This research aims to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and advertising practice by testing five potential drivers of consumer acceptance of SMS advertising as well as the relationships between the acceptance of SMS advertising, intention to receive SMS <b>advertising</b> and <b>behavioural</b> responses to SMS advertising. This research is conducted cross-nationally by comparing Australian and South Korean consumers. In order to test the hypotheses proposed in this study, a survey instrument was developed. This instrument consists of existing scales in the literature as well as a scale developed for the purpose of this study, which measures consumers’ behavioural responses to SMS advertising. Data were collected from 203 Australian and 207 South Korean consumers, from personal and online survey distribution at universities in Australia and South Korea. A series of regression analyses were conducted to test the relationships between the variables, with results compared across samples. The results from this study generally suggest that acceptance, intentions and responses to SMS advertising are similar for Australians and South Koreans. Consumers from the two samples agreed on the importance of four out of the five potential drivers of the acceptance of SMS advertising. The utility of SMS advertisements, context of SMS advertisements and attitudes to advertising in general were found to have a significant impact on the acceptance of either sample. Furthermore, trust in advertisers and laws was important to South Koreans but not to Australians. These results indicate that Australian and South Korean consumers are typically not accepting of SMS advertising, unwilling to receive advertisements and respond negatively to them, while the relationships between these variables are generally strong and consistent. The results from this study highlight the need for advertisers to design SMS advertisements carefully, containing information that is useful, contextually relevant and correctly targeted. In addition, marketers should focus on building relationships with customers and offer incentives to accept SMS advertising in order to improve negative behavioural responses. This study provides useful theoretical contributions to the field of SMS advertising, with an insight into the crosscultural impact of SMS advertising, the development of a new scale to measure behavioural responses to SMS advertising and the application of key marketing theories...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the subject}} of online privacy has been {{attracting}} much interest, especially as more Internet users than ever are beginning {{to care about the}} privacy of their online activities. Privacy concerns are even prompting legislators in some countries to demand from service providers a more privacy-friendly Internet experience for their citizens. These are welcomed developments and {{in stark contrast to the}} practice of Internet censorship and surveillance that legislators in some nations have been known to promote. The development of Internet systems that are able to protect user privacy requires private information retrieval (PIR) schemes that are practical, because no other efficient techniques exist for preserving the confidentiality of the retrieval requests and responses of a user from an Internet system holding unencrypted data. This thesis studies how PIR schemes can be made more relevant and practical for the development of systems that are protective of users' privacy. Private information retrieval schemes are cryptographic constructions for retrieving data from a database, without the database (or database administrator) being able to learn any information about the content of the query. PIR can be applied to preserve the confidentiality of queries to online data sources in many domains, such as online patents, real-time stock quotes, Internet domain names, location-based services, online <b>behavioural</b> profiling and <b>advertising,</b> search engines, and so on. In this thesis, we study private information retrieval and obtain results that seek to make PIR more relevant in practice than all previous treatments of the subject in the literature, which have been mostly theoretical. We also show that PIR is the most computationally efficient known technique for providing access privacy under realistic computation powers and network bandwidths. Our result covers all currently known varieties of PIR schemes. We provide a more detailed summary of our contributions below: Our first result addresses an existing question regarding the computational practicality of private information retrieval schemes. We show that, unlike previously argued, recent lattice-based computational PIR schemes and multi-server information-theoretic PIR schemes are much more computationally efficient than a trivial transfer of the entire PIR database from the server to the client (i. e., trivial download). Our result shows the end-to-end response times of these schemes are one to three orders of magnitude (10 [...] 1000 times) smaller than the trivial download of the database for realistic computation powers and network bandwidths. This result extends and clarifies the well-known result of Sion and Carbunar on the computational practicality of PIR. Our second result is a novel approach for preserving the privacy of sensitive constants in an SQL query, which improves substantially upon the earlier work. Specifically, we provide an expressive data access model of SQL atop of the existing rudimentary index- and keyword-based data access models of PIR. The expressive SQL-based model developed results in between 7 and 480 times improvement in query throughput than previous work. We then provide a PIR-based approach for preserving access privacy over large databases. Unlike previously published access privacy approaches, we explore new ideas about privacy-preserving constraint-based query transformations, offline data classification, and privacy-preserving queries to index structures much smaller than the databases. This work addresses an important open problem about how real systems can systematically apply existing PIR schemes for querying large databases. In terms of applications, we apply PIR to solve user privacy problem in the domains of patent database query and location-based services, user and database privacy problems in the domain of the online sales of digital goods, and a scalability problem for the Tor anonymous communication network. We develop practical tools for most of our techniques, which can be useful for adding PIR support to existing and new Internet system designs...|$|R

40|$|Without {{questioning}} {{the fact that}} to achieve efficiency emitters should pay for the true costs of their actions (a core principle of economic policies such as pollution taxes), we find sufficient evidence in the literature to demonstrate that many other policy instruments {{can be used in}} combination with taxes and permits to ensure that the transport needs of the present generation can be met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet any needs of their own. The policies and policy aspects considered in this paper broadly fall into three categories: physical policies, soft policies, and knowledge policies. All three aim to bring about changes in consumers' and firms' behaviour, but in different ways. The first category includes policies with a physical infrastructure element: public transport, land use, walking and cycling, road construction, and freight transport. We also consider the particular challenges for mobility in developing countries, and how these may be addressed. Soft policies, on the other hand, are non-tangible aiming to bring about behavioural change by informing actors about the consequences of their transport choices, and potentially persuading them to change their behaviour. These measures include car sharing and car pooling, teleworking and teleshopping, eco-driving, as well as general information and advertising campaigns. Finally, knowledge policies emphasise the important role of investment in research and development for a sustainable model of mobility for the future. The main findings can be summarised as follows. Physical policies An increase in the use of public transport, combined with a decrease in the use of private cars, can reduce traffic congestion and, more importantly, carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, as public transport generally causes lower CO 2 emissions per passenger kilometre than private cars. Public transport fares are subsidised in most places, which can be justified by economies of scale and by the fact that public transport can reduce total road transport externalities. London, Singapore, Portland and Curitiba are all examples of good practice at government level, having achieved reliable, frequent and integrated public transport. Policies to increase public transport use must be part of an integrated policy. Integrated policy refers to integration across different modes of transport, different government objectives (such as the economy, health and the environment), considering the needs of different social groups, and coordinating action between the relevant government institutions. There is evidence that a lack of coordination can jeopardise the achievement of policy objectives. A sustainable model for transport policy also requires integration with land-use policies. These may be somewhat limited within the bounds of existing cities, but as cities grow and new cities are built, urban planners must put more emphasis on land use for sustainable transport in order to reduce congestion and CO 2 emissions. Sustainable land-use policy can direct urban development towards a form that allows public transport as well as walking and cycling to be at the core of urban mobility. Walking and cycling, which improve general health and produce no tailpipe emissions, constitute an excellent alternative to motorised transport on short-distance trips within towns and cities. The policies which can incentivise walking and cycling include crime reduction to make streets safer, well-maintained and clean pavements, attractive street furniture, safe crossings with shorter waiting times, dedicated cycle paths, showers in offices, and lower speed limits, to name but a few. Road construction and expansion used to be seen {{as one of the most}} promising ways to reduce traffic congestion. However, in the mid- 1990 s, the issue was reassessed and it was found that building and expanding roads, increased, rather than decreased, congestion, and ultimately induced higher levels of travel demand. The reason for this is that the extra capacity reduces the general cost of travelling and the less expensive the travel, the more it will be demanded. Regarding freight modal shift, road transport is much more polluting than rail per tonne-km of goods transported and therefore a shift towards greater use of rail in freight transport is desirable. Inadequate infrastructure is the main obstacle preventing this modal shift taking place. Developing countries face great mobility challenges: rural areas are often extremely poorly connected to transport infrastructure, such that, in contrast to the situation in developed countries, the benefits of road construction can strongly outweigh the total costs (including environmental ones). The main challenge, however, is to develop a solution to the problems arising from the combination of urbanisation and motorisation. Integration of transport and land-use policy will be key to rising to this challenge. Soft policies Car sharing and car clubs can also potentially reduce CO 2 emissions, although the aggregate reduction in congestion and emissions has not been measured with an adequate degree of precision in the literature. Teleworking and teleshopping can potentially reduce congestion and also CO 2 emissions. However, the evidence for this reduction is rather mixed, as it is unclear whether these measures lead to overall reductions in road transport. Eco-driving campaigns aim to inform and educate drivers in order to induce them to drive in a fuel-efficient and thus environmentally friendly way. There seems to be some consensus in the literature that eco-driving could lead to reductions in CO 2 emissions of around 10 per cent. Information and education policies have often been advocated as instruments which may affect behavioural change. We find in this paper that these types of measures are necessary, but not sufficient for <b>behavioural</b> change. <b>Advertising</b> and marketing may go a long way in changing peoples' behaviour. In California, for example, Kahn (2007) finds the "Prius" effect: the Toyota Prius is preferred by consumers relative to other similarly green vehicles, probably due to extensive marketing and celebrity endorsements. Family life changes are also found to trigger changes in behaviour ([Goodwin, 1989] and [Goodwin, 2008]). People whose lives are being changed by some important development (birth of a child, retirement, etc) tend to respond more to changes in the relative attractiveness of different transport modes. Advertising campaigns promoting a modal shift towards public transport, for instance, may thus be more successful if targeted at people in the process of important life transitions. Knowledge policies Research and Development is crucial for developing sustainable and low-carbon transport for the future, and it is essential that governments provide incentives to undertake R&D, so that new low-carbon technologies in the transport sector can be demonstrated and applied at a large scale. Finally, we consider the issue of policy combination and integration. There is evidence that the combination and integration of policies can lead to positive side-effects and synergies. Policy integration is crucial in order to rise to the challenges we face in moving towards a sustainable mobility model. We conclude that classical economic policies may be successfully combined with a number of policy measures discussed in this paper in order to achieve sustainability in transport.

40|$|Online {{tracking}} {{technologies have}} raised considerable concerns regarding privacy {{and the protection}} of personal data of users. In order to help users to regain control over their personal data, Europe has amended its ePrivacy directive towards an opt-in regime. There are however many open questions concerning its implementation, especially regarding the issue of informed consent. This paper explores how the new legal situation impacts on behavioral advertising practices via the storing and reading of cookies in the Netherlands. The results show {{that the majority of the}} surveyed parties involved in <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> do not inform users about the storing of cookies or the purposes of data processing of the subsequently obtained data, neither do they have obtained users ’ consent for the storage of cookies. We also found that the majority of users lack the skills and knowledge how to handle cookies. These findings critically question the wisdom of the “informed consent regime ” which lies currently at the heart of Europe’s ePrivacy directive. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{distinctive}} {{contribution of}} critical {{political economy of}} media approaches has been to examine the implications of advertising as a system of financing media {{and the influence of}} marketers on media content, media provision, and access to communications. Classic contributions examined advertisers influence on non-advertising content and media firms’ behaviour. The problems they identified are of central concern today, but critical political economy theory and analysis needs to be updated to deal with transformations in the ways marketing communications are produced and circulated within the changing dynamics of media-advertising relationships. Key features include the expansion of marketers’ self-promotion (‘owned’ media), the ‘disaggregation’ of media and advertising, as marketers bypass media to target and reach consumers directly through online <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising,</b> and the ‘integration’ of media and advertising through product placement, sponsored stories and native advertising (Turow 2011; Hardy 2013). This chapter explores the strengths and limitations of political economy perspectives and offers guidelines for contemporary analysis and critique of marketer influences on communications...|$|E
40|$|Online <b>Behavioural</b> <b>Advertising</b> (OBA) enables {{promotion}} {{companies to}} effectively target users with ads that best satisfy their purchasing needs. This is {{highly beneficial for}} both vendors and publishers who are {{the owners of the}} advertising platforms, such as websites and app developers, {{but at the same time}} creates a serious privacy threat for users who expose their consumer interests. In this paper, we categorize the available ad-distribution methods and identify their limitations in terms of security, privacy, targeting effectiveness and practicality. We contribute our own system, which utilizes opportunistic networking in order to distribute targeted adverts within a social network. We improve upon previous work by eliminating the need for trust among the users (network nodes) while at the same time achieving low memory and bandwidth overhead, which are inherent problems of many opportunistic networks. Our protocol accomplishes this by identifying similarities between the consumer interests of users and then allows them to share access to the same adverts, which need to be downloaded only once. Although the same ads may be viewed by multiple users, privacy is preserved as the users do not learn each other’s advertising interests. An additional contribution is that malicious users cannot alter the ads in order to spread malicious content, and also, they cannot launch impersonation attacks...|$|E
40|$|Online <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> (OBA) is {{a special}} form of {{targeted}} advertising. For OBA, {{it is necessary to}} collect data about online surfing behaviour, which is usually undertaken by installing ‘cookies’. The use of cookies is heavily debated by policy makers in the US and Europe. Central to this discussion is whether users should provide informed consent prior to the installation of cookies. However, to provide informed consent, it is vital that website users understand the mechanisms of OBA and cookies. This study investigates whether the existing knowledge is sufficient, whether website users are concerned about their privacy, and how they cope with OBA, cookies and the requested informed consent. An online questionnaire (N = 2022) was fielded briefly after new European cookie regulations were enacted. The results confirmed that the knowledge is still insufficient to obtain good understanding of this new advertising technique. In addition, the results showed that groups of Internet users did not differ in terms of knowledge, although they did differ in terms of privacy concerns. A comparison of privacy-concerned groups showed that a dual approach is needed in communicating about OBA, not only to inform but also to reduce worries, especially in older and less-educated groups...|$|E
40|$|This is the authors’ revised {{personal}} {{version of}} {{the text of the}} final journal article (to reflect changes made in the peer review process). The final published version can be found at: [URL] customers are increasingly being tracked and profiled by behavioural advertisers to enhance delivery of personalized advertising. This type of profiling relies on automated processes that mine databases containing personally-identifying or anonymous consumer data, and it raises a host of significant concerns about privacy and data protection. This second article in a two part series on “Profiling the Mobile Customer” explores how to best protect consumers’ privacy and personal data through available mechanisms that include industry self-regulation, privacy-enhancing technologies and legislative reform. 1 It discusses how well privacy and personal data concerns related to consumer profiling are addressed by two leading industry self-regulatory codes from the United Kingdom and the U. S. that aim to establish fair information practices for <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> by their member companies. It also discusses the current limitations of using technology to protect consumers from privacy abuses related to profiling. Concluding that industry self-regulation and available privacy-enhancing technologies will not be adequate to close important privacy gaps related to consumer profiling without legislative reform, it offers suggestions for EU and U. S. regulators about how to do this...|$|E
40|$|Online <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> (OBA) {{comes to}} {{consumers}} at a price. Often unknowingly, people deliver up commercially-valuable personal information {{as a condition}} of online user experience, functionality and access. Websites are increasingly tracking user behaviours for commercial purposes and social media derives its income largely from data collection and advertising targeted to the personal disclosures and behavioural attributes which are its data-production mainstay. In this context, consumers face a plethora of information collection practices, all designed to generate data analytics including inferential and predictive profiling to create a 2 ̆ 7 digital identity 2 ̆ 7 for OBA purposes. In this subterranean exchange, consumers are economically redefined as data subjects and advertising targets; a reframing which is perhaps why the OBA industry faces a crisis in consumer concern, both as to privacy and trust. This paper proposes that the regulatory control of OBA in Australia is in disarray. Consumer ignorance of online privacy management and OBA practices is demonstrable. Industry transparency, disclosure, consent processes and compliance practices are questionable. Regulator interest is minimal, industry self-regulation is weak and consumer technical ability and personal responsibility is a last fragile line of defence. Data breaches are ubiquitous in a crowded and poorly-audited supply chain, and entail significant adverse consumer consequences. Yet despite these serious concerns, Australian regulators are failing to respond to OBA issues, either through mandating greater industry disclosure or through regulatory action. The author seeks to expose these weaknesses in calling for consumer and privacy regulators to take more meaningful action to better protect consumers 2 ̆ 7 interests onlin...|$|E
40|$|Profiling {{the online}} {{behaviour}} of Internet users {{has become a}} defining feature of the Internet. Individual surfing behaviour is tracked by many enterprises for statistical purposes, but also for <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising</b> and other personalisation services. Profiling implies the processing of personal data often facilitated by cookies and other markers placed on the terminal equipment of Internet users. The European rules for the regulation of cookies and similar technologies were modified in 2009 requiring prior consent of the user, in order to guarantee that the user has some control over the processing of their information. In 2013 the Netherlands introduced probably the strictest implementation of the European rules concerning the installation of cookies. However, in practice the new legal requirements resulted in neglect of the obligations regarding user information {{on the one hand and}} in the widespread deployment of annoying banners, popup screens and ‘cookie walls’ on the other. Not only the advertising industry, but also web publishers and even ordinary Internet users opposed the regulation. Furthermore, the regulation, certainly initially, did not lead to increased user control. These and other factors support the conclusion that the Dutch cookie regulation is a case of regulatory failure. This paper discusses the practices that were deployed in the Netherlands and assesses them based on a multi-site study that examined the practices of 100 Dutch websites with regard to the installation of cookies. It further reflects on the response of the Dutch regulator, who –under the pressure of industry and consumers outcry- amended the relevant provisions of the Dutch Telecommunications Act in 2014...|$|E
40|$|New {{advertising}} formats such as <b>behavioural</b> <b>advertising,</b> {{for which}} children’s personal data are processed, or advergames, which integrate editorial and commercial content, {{may have a}} significant impact on children’s rights, including their fundamental right to privacy, access to (high-quality) information, freedom of expression, protection against information and material injurious to their well-being and protection from economic exploitation (United Nation Convention on the Rights of the Child, UNCRC). It has been emphasised in Unicef’s Children’s rights and Business Principles (2012) that companies must ensure that communications and marketing do not have an adverse impact on children’s rights. In the advertising sector, self-regulation has traditionally played an important (complementary) role. The International Chamber of Commerce has drafted a Code Advertising and Marketing Communication Practice (Consolidated ICC Code), and in many countries self-regulatory bodies observe compliance with the principles of this Code. The added value of a self-regula‑ tory framework lies in its flexibility and adaptability (to technological change), a higher degree of expertise and a relatively low cost. However, at the same time, self-regulatory mechanisms have been considered to suffer from low levels of transparency and accountability and the fact that private interests are put before the public interest. Moreover, the degree of legal certainty is sometimes low, resulting in a decrease in democratic quality of regulation. Considering these drawbacks of self-regulation, this article questions whether something as fundamental as children’s rights should be safeguarded by self-regulation to such a significant extent. First, the paper will assess the applicability of the current self-regulatory framework to new, digital advertising formats. The ICC Code will be examined, as well as the national self-regulatory frameworks of the United Kingdom and Belgium. Second, this self-regulatory framework will be assessed from a children’s rights perspective, evaluating the degree of protection and participation, and compliance with essential prin‑ ciples such as accountability and transparency. This analysis will take into account the UNCRC and general comments of the Children’s Rights Committee, case-law, as well as scholarly literature, both with regard to children’s rights and (characteristics of) self-regulation. Attention will also be paid to the fine line between persuasion and manipulation of new advertising formats, and the impact the effects thereof may have on children’s rights...|$|E
