5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt.

5|$|Ged is {{depicted}} as proud and yet unsure of himself in multiple situations: early in his apprenticeship he believes Ogion to be mocking him, and later, at Roke, feels put upon by Jasper. In both cases, he believes that others do not appreciate his greatness, and Le Guin's sympathetic narration does not immediately contradict this belief. Cadden writes that Le Guin allows young readers to sympathize with Ged, and only gradually {{realize that there is}} a price to be paid for his actions, as he learns to discipline his magical powers. Similarly, as Ged <b>begins</b> <b>his</b> apprenticeship with Ogion, he imagines that he will be taught mysterious aspects of wizardry, and has visions of transforming himself into other creatures, but gradually comes to see that Ogion's important lessons are those about his own self.|$|E
