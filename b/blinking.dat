40|$|Eye <b>blinks</b> cause {{disruptions}} {{to visual}} input and are accompanied by rotations of the eyeball [1]. Like every motor action, these eye movements {{are subject to}} noise and introduce instabilities in gaze direction across <b>blinks</b> [2]. Accumulating errors across repeated <b>blinks</b> would be debilitating for visual performance. Here, we show that the oculomotor system constantly recalibrates gaze direction during <b>blinks</b> to counteract gaze instability. Observers were instructed to fixate a visual target while gaze direction was recorded and <b>blinks</b> were detected in real time. With every spontaneous blink-while eyelids were closed-the target was displaced laterally by 0. 5 ° (or 1. 0 °). Most observers reported being unaware of displacements during <b>blinks.</b> After adapting for ∼ 35 <b>blinks,</b> gaze positions after <b>blinks</b> showed significant biases toward the new target position. Automatic eye movements accompanied each <b>blink,</b> and an aftereffect persisted for a few <b>blinks</b> after target displacements were eliminated. No adaptive gaze shift occurred when <b>blinks</b> were simulated with shutter glasses at random time points or actively triggered by observers, or when target displacements were masked by a distracting stimulus. Visual signals during <b>blinks</b> are suppressed by inhibitory mechanisms [3 - 6], so that small changes across <b>blinks</b> are generally not noticed [7, 8]. Additionally, target displacements during <b>blinks</b> can trigger automatic gaze recalibration, similar to the well-known saccadic adaptation effect [9 - 11]. This novel mechanism might be specific {{to the maintenance of}} gaze direction across <b>blinks</b> or might depend on a more general oculomotor recalibration mechanism adapting gaze position during intrinsically generated disruptions to visual input...|$|R

40|$|Recently, the human-machine {{interface}} using information of user 2 ̆ 7 s eye <b>blink</b> was reported.

By using this system, the usability of input is increased. We have proposed a new eye <b>blink</b> detection method that uses a Hi-Vision video camera. This method utilizes split interlace images of the eye. These split images are odd- and even- field images in the 1080 i Hi-Vision format and are generated from interlaced images.

40|$|Hyperexcitable reflex <b>blinks</b> are a {{cardinal}} sign of Parkinson’s disease. The {{first step in}} the circuit linking the basal ganglia and brainstem reflex <b>blink</b> circuits is the inhibitory nigrostriatal pathway (Basso et al., 1996).

Importantly, no <b>blink</b> related activations were observed in the pre-frontal and parietal <b>blinks</b> motor command areas nor in the prefrontal, parietal, and medial temporal <b>blink</b> suppression areas.

5|$|Many birds show plumage {{patterns}} in ultraviolet that are {{invisible to the}} human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar {{to the naked eye}} are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers.

Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. With the exception of pigeons and a few other species, the eyelids of birds are not used in <b>blinking.</b> Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study characterizes trigeminal <b>blinks</b> {{in normal}} human {{subjects}} between 20 and 80 years of age, 60 -year-old Parkinson’s disease patients, and {{young and old}} guinea pigs. In normal humans over 60 years of age, lid-closing duration, and the excitability and latency of the trigeminal reflex <b>blink</b> increase significantly relative to younger subjects. Aged guinea pigs appear to display similar increases in reflex <b>blink</b> duration and latency. Reflex <b>blink</b> amplitude, however, does not change consistently with age. For subjects less than 70 years of age, a unilateral trigeminal stimulus evokes a 37 % larger <b>blink</b> in the eyelid ipsilateral to the stimulus than in the contralateral eyelid, but 70 -year-olds exhibit <b>blinks</b> of equal amplitude. In all cases, <b>blink</b> duration is identical for the two eyelids. If normal, age-related loss of dopamine neurons explains these trigeminal <b>blink</b> modifications, then Parkinson’s disease should exaggerate age-related changes in these <b>blink</b> parameters.

The Enterprise bridge itself remained largely unchanged from its appearance in the previous films, though the floor was repainted from black to grey to make it photograph better.

5|$|Traditionally, devices like a blink {{comparator}} {{were used}} in astronomy to detect objects in the Solar System, because these objects would move between two exposures—this involved time-consuming steps like exposing and developing photographic plates or films, and people then using a blink comparator to manually detect prospective objects. During the 1980s, the use of CCD-based cameras in telescopes {{made it possible to}} directly produce electronic images that could then be readily digitized and transferred to digital images. Because the CCD captured more light than film (about 90% versus 10% of incoming light) and the <b>blinking</b> could now be done at an adjustable computer screen, the surveys allowed for higher throughput. A flood of new discoveries was the result: over a thousand trans-Neptunian objects were detected between 1992 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} <b>blinking</b> lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time.

5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four <b>blinking</b> lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 of the devices were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E

The loudspeakers were booming, 'Bombers approaching... there's six of them... there's twelve... there's eighteen... good God, there's twenty-five!' The anti-aircraft ship lurched forward and altered course to head off the attack. Commodore Dowding signalled Keppel to ask if the convoy should make an 'emergency turn'; but it was deemed too late for such a manoeuvre, since half the ships would most likely miss the signal altogether and Broome flashed back, 'I {{do not think it}} worth it.' The developing air attack spotted by Ledbury turned into a blitz of the convoy, with Luftwaffe aircraft being shot down over the formation, and one plane crashed into the sea about four thousand yards from the destroyer , on the convoy's starboard bow. The crash occurred not far from Ledbury and seamen on board saw four German airmen climbing out into a rubber dinghy with the bomber sinking soon after. The pilot, Lieutenant Kaumeyr, and his three crewmen were picked out of their dinghy by Ledbury. The attack however, continued and throughout the fierce fighting the escorts distinguished themselves by screening the merchantmen from many attacks, especially U-boat sorties; Ledbury alone had sighted seven.|$|E
