25|$|Many {{economic}} historians {{regard the}} Netherlands {{as the first}} thoroughly capitalist country in the world. In early modern Europe it had the wealthiest trading city (Amsterdam) and the first full-time stock exchange. The inventiveness of the traders led to insurance and retirement funds as well as phenomena such as the <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycle,</b> the world's first asset-inflation bubble, the tulip mania of 1636–1637, and the world's first bear raider, Isaac le Maire, who forced prices down by dumping stock and then buying it back at a discount. In 1672 – known in Dutch history as the Rampjaar (Disaster Year) – the Dutch Republic was at war with France, England and three German Bishoprics simultaneously. At sea it could successfully prevent the English and French navy entering the western shores. On land, however, it was almost taken over internally by the advancing French and German armies coming from the east. It managed to turn the tide by inundating parts of Holland, but could never recover to its former glory again and went {{into a state of}} general decline in the 18th century, with economic competition from England and long-standing rivalries between the two main factions in Dutch society, the republican Staatsgezinden and the supporters of the stadtholder the Prinsgezinden, as main political factions.|$|E

40|$|This paper uses a small-open economy {{model for}} the Canadian economy to examine the optimal Taylor-type {{monetary}} policy rule that stabilizes output and inflation {{in an environment where}} endogenous <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles</b> in house prices can occur. The model shows that <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles</b> in house prices emerge when credit-constrained mortgage borrowers expect that future house prices will rise and this expectation is neither shared by savers nor realized ex-post. These <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles</b> replicate the stylized features of housing-market <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles</b> in industrialized countries. In an environment where mortgage borrowers are occasionally over-optimistic, the central bank should be less responsive to inflation, more responsive to output, and slower to adjust the nominal policy interest rate. This optimal monetary policy rule dampens endogenous <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles</b> in house prices, but prolongs inflation target horizons due to weak policy reactions to inflation fluctuations after fundamental shocks.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a business cycle model capturing the stylized features of housing-market <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles</b> in developed countries. The model implies that over-optimism of mortgage borrowers generates housing-market <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles,</b> if mortgage borrowers are credit-constrained and savers {{do not share}} their optimism. This result holds without price stickiness. If price stickiness is introduced into the model, then the model replicates a low policy interest rate during a housing boom as an endogenous reaction to a low inflation rate, given a Taylor rule. Thus, monetary easing observed during housing booms {{are consistent with the}} presence of over-optimism causing <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} heterogeneous beliefs among {{households in}} a small open economy model for the Canadian economy. The model suggests that simultaneous <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles</b> in house prices, output, investment, consumption and hours worked emerge when credit-constrained mortgage borrowers expect that future house prices will rise and this expectation is neither shared by savers nor realized ex-post. With sticky prices and a standard monetary policy rule, the model shows that the nominal policy interest rate and the CPI inflation rate decline during housing booms and rise as house prices fall. These results replicate the stylized features of housing-market <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles</b> in industrialized countries. Policy experiments demonstrate that stronger policy responses to inflation amplify housing-market <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles.</b> Also, higher loan-to-value ratios amplify housing-market <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycles</b> by encouraging speculative housing investments by mortgage borrowers during housing booms and increasing liquidation of housing collateral during housing busts.

50|$|England's wool-trade was volatile, however, {{affected}} by diverse {{factors such as}} war, taxation policy, export/import duties or even bans, disease and famine, {{and the degree of}} competition among European merchants for English wool. For example, since Continental industry relied on English wool, and export embargoes could 'could bring whole areas to the brink of starvation and economic ruin', the wool trade was a powerful political tool. Likewise, taxes on the wool trade financed Edward I's wars and enabled England to conduct the Hundred Years' War with the better resources France.

50|$|The rush to Pennsylvania created violent {{swings in}} the {{petroleum}} {{market for the}} first decade of the oil boom. In 1861, the proliferation of wells across the Oil Creek Valley pushed the price of oil down to 10 cents a barrel. In response, producers in the region formed the Oil Creek Association to restrict output and maintain a minimum price of $4 a barrel. Despite efforts such as this to control the petroleum market, the volatile <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycle</b> continued into the early 1870s. By 1871, refining capacity had grown to over 12 million barrels per year, more than twice the amount of oil that was actually processed in that year. The first oil exchange in the US was established in Titusville in January 1872 in response to rumors that a conspiratorial ring of crude oil traders in New York City had cornered the market. As the decade progressed, larger producers, such as John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil, began to consolidate their holdings over the wells and refineries in the region, and the oil rush began to settle down.|$|E

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} for the benefits of capital account liberalization to the recipient economy is inconclusive. Some economies seem to experience a costly <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycle</b> after liberalization. In particular, economies that are less able to control domestic agency problems {{appear to have a}} higher likelihood of crisis. In this paper we construct a simple model relating the severity of the domestic agency problem and the efficiency in its management to the possible <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycle.</b> In the model an economy is more likely to experience the cycle when its financial system is poor at controlling the agency problem. The agency problem with financial contacting results in inefficient and riskier investment. This loss can be large enough to offset the benefits of liberalization. This is especially so for economies with intermediate levels of governance and income. Improving domestic governance before liberalization is crucial to avoiding the costly <b>boom-bust</b> <b>cycle.</b> ...|$|E

While all these policies can be used to cool down the output boom, exchange rate revaluation seems the most attractive option.

In contrast, an interest-rate rule that responds to financial variables mitigates {{macroeconomic and financial}} cycles and is welfare improving relative to the estimated rule. Second, counter-cyclical Loan-to-Value rules that respond to credit growth do not increase in ation volatility and are more effective in maintaining a stable provision of financial intermediation than interest-rate rules that respond to financial variables.
