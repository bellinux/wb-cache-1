5|$|Fabian Cancellara {{was born}} on 18 March 1981, in Wohlen bei Bern, Switzerland, to Italian parents. He {{discovered}} cycling {{at the age of}} 13 after falling in love with an old family <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> he had found in the garage and immediately gave up football to concentrate on cycling. In addition, Cancellara excelled at cross-country skiing during his youth.|$|E
25|$|When Ducati re-joined MotoGP in , MotoGP {{had changed}} its rules to allow {{four-stroke}} 990cc engines to race. At the time Ducati was the fastest bike. In , MotoGP reduced the engine size to , and Ducati {{continued to be}} the fastest with a <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> was markedly quicker than its rivals as was displayed by Casey Stoner on tracks with long straights.|$|E
25|$|It was {{predicted}} that the gentlemen's agreement speed cap would hurt sales, because buyers would not want a <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> was hobbled with a speed limiter, even riders who would never approach the hypothetical maximum. However, sales in the United States have increased year after year since its release in 1999 until 2006 and went from just a few thousand units in 1999 to over 10,000 in 2006.|$|E

25|$|The Ronde, in {{its first}} decades, {{followed}} the general rule that each racer was responsible for his own problems. Help from others was banned and riders carried spare tyres looped round their shoulders to cope with punctures. It could take {{two or three minutes}} to change and inflate a tyre, longer if it was cold or there were other problems. Tyres weighed around 500g (compared to currently around 200g). A rim or any other part of the <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> broke spelled the end of the race and still left the rider with the problem of getting to the finish.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was four}} years old, Gordon rode a BMX <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> his {{stepfather}} bought for him and began racing quarter midgets {{at the age of}} five. The Roy Hayer Memorial Race Track (previously the Cracker Jack Track) in Rio Linda, California is noted as the first track Gordon ever competed on. By the age of six Gordon had won 35 main events and set five track records. In 1979 Gordon won 51 quarter midget races. When he was 11, Gordon won all 25 of the karting races he entered. At age 12, Gordon became bored with cars and decided to start a career in waterskiing before switching back to driving one year later. In 1986, Gordon began racing sprint cars, winning three races. The next year, Gordon was awarded a USAC license at age 16, the youngest driver to do so.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{continued}} his road racing successes in 1975, winning {{three out of}} four races in the 1975 Transatlantic Match races. After having won the national championship in 1974, Roberts faced an increasingly difficult battle in dirt track races, as Harley-Davidson continued to improve their XR-750 dirt tracker while Yamaha struggled to maintain the pace. Roberts made up for his bike's lack of power with an almost fearless, determined riding style. He battled Harley-Davidson factory rider Gary Scott throughout the 1975 season but mechanical breakdowns hampered his title defense. He had been leading the Daytona 200 when mechanical problems yielded the victory to his Yamaha teammate Gene Romero. At the Ascot TT, Roberts battled from 17th place to take the lead before a broken sprocket ended his race. Roberts' fearless riding style was highlighted at the Indy Mile Grand National. In a desperate effort to keep Scott within reach in the points chase, Yamaha wedged a Yamaha TZ750 two-stroke road racing engine inside a dirt track frame. On a <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> was considered unrideable due to its excessive horsepower, Roberts came from behind on the two-stroke, and overtook the factory Harley-Davidson duo of Corky Keener and Jay Springsteen on the last lap {{for one of the most}} famous wins in American dirt track racing history. Afterward, Roberts was famously quoted as saying, [...] "They [...] pay me enough to ride that thing". Despite accomplishing another Grand Slam, this time in only one season, Roberts lost his crown, finishing second to Gary Scott in the 1975 national championship.|$|E

2500|$|Bikes {{are usually}} {{built around a}} theme, such as a NASCAR-inspired bike with retro-70s chrome wheels, racing numbers, flames and sponsor {{insignia}} reminiscent of a stock car, or a <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> takes its cues from popular films, such as Freddy Krueger of A Nightmare on Elm Street.

2500|$|There is no {{universal}} {{system for}} classifying {{all types of}} motorcycles. There are strict classification systems enforced by competitive motorcycle sport sanctioning bodies, or legal definitions of a motorcycle established by certain legal jurisdictions for motorcycle registration, emissions, road traffic safety rules or motorcyclist licensing. There are also informal classifications or nicknames used by manufacturers, riders, and the motorcycling media. Some experts do not recognize sub-types, like naked <b>bike,</b> <b>that</b> [...] "purport to be classified" [...] outside the six usual classes, because they fit within {{one of the main}} types and are recognizable only by cosmetic changes.|$|E

50|$|With {{choppers}} {{still not}} yet a mass market concept regional variations and formulations flourished in this period. Many innovations were tried in this period, found not to work that well, and then abandoned. A great deal of knowledge about how to build long <b>bikes</b> <b>that</b> handled well adjusting rake and trail was developed, yet less sophisticated builders also {{created a lot of}} <b>bikes</b> <b>that</b> had handling issues in this period as expertise was still scarce and closely held.|$|R

2500|$|As a {{young man}} Larry learned how to weld from Conrad Stenglein in the Newburgh, New York area. [...] The shop was simple. As Stenglein {{described}} it: [...] "All {{we had in the}} shop was a welding machine, torches, grinder, body putty, stuff like that." [...] Quality of work was important to Larry early on. [...] Stenglein said that [...] "Whatever part we made for a bike, it had to be strong and had to be good, that was our thing. It had to be perfect. If Larry put something on a <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> he didn't like, he'd cut it off. That's how he was." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Laverda was facing {{increasing}} {{competition from the}} Japanese. While launching their new [...] model range in 1968, the company turned its attention to a new three-cylinder powerplant, which was first shown as a prototype at the Milan and Geneva shows in 1969. The [...] prototype was essentially a 750 twin with an additional cylinder. After extensive testing, modifications, and mechanical engineering, the company finally unveiled the new liter-class, three-cylinder bike in competition at the Zeltweg race in Austria. The <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> went into production shortly later in 1972 was recognisable as a motorcycle of the modern era, {{but it was still}} configured in a conservative layout, sharing some of the features of the earlier SF/SFC models, such as the high-quality alloy castings and distinctive styling.|$|E
2500|$|Albasini was not {{originally}} Orica–GreenEDGE's leader; {{he inherited}} the role after Simon Gerrans was dropped {{towards the end}} of the race. He said that he thought he was the strongest of the four-man group that formed on the final climb and blamed a mistake for his failure to win: he said that he had chosen the wrong gearing for the sprint and was unable to match Poels's acceleration. He said that he had ridden [...] "a good race" [...] even though he had failed to win. Albasini's performance came at the end of a strong spring classics season for his team, following Mathew Hayman's victory at Paris–Roubaix two weeks previously. Costa, meanwhile, said [...] "It was the toughest day on a <b>bike</b> <b>that</b> I can remember" [...] and [...] "when it’s bad weather, my body seems to react well". He congratulated Poels, saying that he was stronger in the sprint.|$|E
