5000|$|Sardinella brasiliensis, (<b>Brazilian</b> <b>sardinella</b> or orangespot sardine) is {{a species}} of ray-finned fish in the genus Sardinella. S. brasilensis are {{extremely}} hard to distinguish from Sardinella aurita and are combined in most studies and catch estimates. They spawn in coastal areas during late spring and summer. The most dense spawning periods are in December and January. From 1973-1990 the catch in Venezuela was down from 228000 tons to 31000 tons. These fish {{are present in the}} Western Atlantic (including the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, West Indies {{all the way down to}} Brazil ...|$|E

The most important species, the Argentine shortfin squid, which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value, is considered fully fished to overfished. Another important species was the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>sardinella,</b> with a production of 100,000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished. Half the stocks {{in this area are}} being fished at unsustainable levels: Whitehead’s round herring has not yet reached fully fished but Cunene horse mackerel is overfished. The sea snail perlemoen abalone is targeted by illegal fishing and remain overfished.|$|E

The model parameters were estimated with the nonlinear iterative method of least squares. The value of the coefficient of determination (r 2) and residual analysis were employed to verify the appropriateness of fit.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the main spatial patterns and scales of <b>Brazilian</b> sardine (<b>Sardinella</b> brasiliensis) spawning and the Southeastern Brazilian Bight (SBB) environmental variability was investigated, using historical egg density data, remotely sensed SST anomalies from AVHRR and Wind velocity data from SSM/I. The spatial variability of egg densities at each cruise was linearly modeled using eigenvector filters as predictors. Environmental data series were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Wavelet decomposition. Results showed that spawning spatial variability was expressed at rougher scales, due to a concentration of the main spawning areas at the central and southern areas of the SBB. A high mesoscale variability was also evidenced by the regression models. The evolution of spatial patterns showed a progressive increase in {{the relative importance of}} mesoscale filters when mean egg densities lowered, which is consistent with the hypothesis of contraction-expansion of the spawning habitat. Areas characterized by lower environmental variability matched the most recurrent spawning grounds which suggests that the Brazilian sardine spawning might benefit more from stable environments.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to analyze and describe the statistical correlations between oceanographic variables measured by satellite and the catch of <b>Brazilian</b> sardine, (<b>Sardinella</b> janeiro), in the southeast-south coast of Brazil for the period between 1990 and 2005. The analysis of the environmental variables obtained by satellite is based on time series of monthly averaged measurements of chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface temperature (SST), surface wind, and Ekman pumping. As a result, this study shows that the variability of CPUE is correlated with the environmental parameters, although the coefficients are not generally high. Ekman pumping showed the best correlation with CPUE (0, 39) followed by the wind (0. 32), concentration of chlorophyll-a (0. 30) and SST (- 0. 2). A significant difference occurred in the lag of maximum correlation between the wind related variables, Ekman pumping (1 [...] 3 months) and wind (6 mouth), and SST (20 months) and chlorophyll-a concentration (30 months). This should have definitely been {{taken into account in}} ocean monitoring program for fishery management. Pages: 3365 - 337...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{magnitude}} of domestic and industrial pollution, fishery yield registered in several landing points at Guanabara Bay, between April 2001 and March 2002 was slightly over 19, 000 tons, corresponding to a value of US $ 4. 8 million. When considered only the fish directed to the food market, the total catch amounted to about 6, 300 tons and a value of US $ 3. 7 million. Only a few fish species reached expressive densities compatible with commercial fisheries. Among small pelagic fish, Atlantic anchoveta and <b>Brazilian</b> <b>sardinella</b> were the dominant species, while in terms of demersal fish, croakers, mullets and catfishes comprised {{the main part of}} the catch. The absence of landing data previous to the spilling of 1. 3 million liters of oil in January 2000 led to claims by fishermen representative organizations of values corresponding to about 50 years of fish harvest in the bay. Possibly, a data collection network could be established in a participative way with the main fishermen local associations. The relatively stabilized fisheries in the bay suggested that reasonable inferences could be made, without, necessarily having a complete coverage of all landing points...|$|E
40|$|We {{provide a}} {{detailed}} account of the spatial structure of the <b>Brazilian</b> sardine (<b>Sardinella</b> brasiliensis) spawning and nursery habitats, using ichthyoplankton data from nine surveys (1976 - 1993) covering the Southeastern Brazilian Bight (SBB). The spatial variability of sardine eggs and larvae was partitioned into predefined spatial-scale classes (broad scale, 200 - 500 km; medium scale, 50 - 100 km; and local scale, < 50 km). The relationship between density distributions at both developmental stages and environmental descriptors (temperature and salinity) was also explored within these spatial scales. Spatial distributions of sardine eggs were mostly structured on medium and local scales, while larvae were characterized by broad-and medium-scale distributions. Broad-and medium-scale surface temperatures were positively correlated with sardine densities, for both developmental stages. Correlations with salinity were predominantly negative and concentrated on a medium scale. Broad-scale structuring might be explained by mesoscale processes, such as pulsing upwelling events and Brazil Current meandering at the northern portion of the SBB, while medium-scale relationships may be associated with local estuarine outflows. The results indicate that processes favouring vertical stability might regulate the spatial extensions of suitable spawning and nursery habitats for the Brazilian sardine.

40|$|The {{recruitment}} {{process for}} <b>Brazilian</b> sardine (<b>Sardinella</b> brasiliensis) from 1977 to 1993 was investigated by {{taking into account}} the effects of spawning stock biomass (SSB), the intensity of the wind and the sea surface temperature (SST). Nonparametric models were applied. Best fits resulted from relating recruitment to a combination of SSB and Ekman transport. Transformation of Ekman transport is nearly dome-shaped, with lower and upper limits of 520 and 700 kg s- 1 m- 1 respectively. Fitting explained 94 % of recruitment variability. Regions of maximum values in the transformations were for predictors related to wind, such as wind stress and turbulence index, whose limits were respectively 0. 035 - 0. 045 N m- 2 and 30 - 45 m 3 s- 3. These values correspond approximately to winds of 3. 0 - 4. 5 m s- 1. SST transformations also follow an apparent dome-shaped curve optimising around 24. 75 and 25. 5 ºC. Inclusion of SST as a third predictor variable led to the loss of the dome-shaped relationship, as shown by the transformations with two predictor variables. Biomass curves are almost logarithmic, their critical point oscillating around 200, 000 - 250, 000 t, below which value the stock becomes more dependent on recruitment. The biomass range is greater than previous estimates...|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} Brazilian {{coast is}} the major fishery ground for the <b>Brazilian</b> sardine (<b>Sardinella</b> brasiliensis), a species responsible for up to 40 % of marine fish catches in the region. Fish spawning and recruitment are locally influenced by seasonal advection of nutrient-rich waters from both inshore and offshore sources. Plankton communities are otherwise controlled by regenerative processes related to the oligotrophic nature of the Tropical Water from the Brazil Current. As recorded in other continental margins, zooplankton species diversity increases towards outer shelf and open ocean waters. Peaks of zooplankton biomass and ichthyoplankton abundance are frequent on the inner shelf, either at upwelling sites or off large estuarine systems. However, meandering features of the Brazil Current provide an additional mechanism of upward motion of the cold and nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water, increasing phyto- and zooplankton biomass and production on mid- and outer shelves. Cold neritic waters originating off Argentina, and subtropical waters from the Subtropical Convergence exert a strong seasonal influence on zooplankton and ichthyoplankton distribution towards more southern areas. This brief review highlights {{the need for further}} experimental studies on zooplankton life cycle strategies {{in order to understand the}} major processes controlling food web dynamics in this shelf ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{quantify}} the variation in total length and body mass for the early-juvenile <b>Brazilian</b> herring <b>Sardinella</b> janeiro and to determine total length and body mass correction equation to allow fresh measures to be calculated from preserved ones. Fishes {{were randomly assigned to}} one of five preservation methods (freezing at - 20 º C, 2. 5 % and 5 % formalin, 70 % and 95 % ethanol), and measured for total length (TL) and body mass (W) before preservation, and on days 5, 15, 30, and 60 after storage. Significant reductions in total length and body mass occurred during the first 5 days after preservation and continued to contract significantly at a lesser rate through 30 days in most methods. Exceptions were shown for body mass in freezing and 5 % formalin, where the greatest losses occurred after 30 days of preservation. The degree of shrinkage for total length and body mass was very much dependent on fish size, with smaller specimens shrinking more than larger ones. The fresh total length and body mass can be back-calculated using equations that describe the relationship between fresh and preserved individuals after 60 days storage for all methods except for body mass in freezing...|$|R
40|$|Data on {{distribution}} and abundance of larvae of the <b>Brazilian</b> sardine, <b>Sardinella</b> brasiliensis, are presented based on samples collected in waters off southern Brazil during 1969 to 1971. The distribution pattern and relative abundance of sardine larvae during three spawning seasons are discussed. Relative abundance, using regional census estimates, was calculated each year. In general, larval abundance in each subarea coincided {{with that of}} eggs, al-though the area of distribution of larvae was larger than the spawn-ing area. Estimates of larval abundance showed that the 1970 - 71 spawning season was the poorest, both in larval and egg abundance, despite the enlarged size of the area surveyed. The average tempera-ture at stations where sardine larvae occurred was 23. 40 C, r anging from 14. 6 to 27. 40 C, and the average salinity was 35. 60 / 00, ranging from 35. 0 to 36. 70 / 00. Distribution of the larvae in different depth zones was analysed. Larvae usually were most abundant in the 51 - 100 m depth zone. No tendency for a unidirectional transport of larvae was observed; apparently they move from the spawning ground in alI possible directions, spreading over the continental shelf. An estimate of survival rate of larvae, based on length frequency data pooled from the three years, was calculated. Undersampling of larvae during daytime was observed. The mean night-day catch ratio, based on larvae from alI length classes sampled, was 3. 93. * This study was partially financed by Fundação de Amparo ã Pesquisa do Es...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The rough scad, Trachurus lathami Nichols, 1920, {{is a small}} {{pelagic species}} {{distributed}} along the West Atlantic coast. It is most abundant in the Southern Brazil (28 ° 30 ’- 34 °S) and in the Southeastern Brazilian Bight (SEBB, 22 °- 28 ° 30 ’S). The rough scad is fished by purse seines, which main target is the <b>Brazilian</b> sardine, <b>Sardinella</b> brasiliensis (Steindachner, 1879). Age and growth are vital to understand {{the life cycle of}} a species, to fishery management and ecosystem modeling. This study aimed to assess the age and growth of T. lathami, to identify its age structure in the SEBB, and to evaluate what causes the wide differences among Trachurus species in terms of body size and growth parameters. Data available on T. lathami was attained between 2008 and 2010 from surveys at SEBB. A total of 278 whole otoliths of T. lathami, total length between 27 mm and 208 mm, were analyzed and compared with the only other source of otolith data, from 1975. Three blind readings were performed and assessed using traditional methods to study fish age and growth. Zero up to eight rings were found, each ring corresponding to one year in the life of an individual of this species. The von Bertalanffy growth model parameters were L∞ = 211. 90 mm and K = 0. 319 year- 1. The results of the analyses have shown similarities between 1975 and 2008 - 2010, indicating that the otolith development, the growth pattern and the age structure remained stable. T. lathami is the smallest species of Trachurus and it has the highest growth rates among them. This is probably related to the different temperatures where larvae/juvenile and adult grow, to the absence of a strong fishing pressure and to decadal population variability...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{establishes}} the spawning habitat of the <b>Brazilian</b> sardine <b>Sardinella</b> brasiliensis and investigates the spatial variability of egg density {{and its relation}} with oceanographic conditions in the shelf of the south-east Brazil Bight (SBB). The spawning habitats of S. brasiliensis have been {{defined in terms of}} spatial models of egg density, temperature-salinity plots, quotient (Q) analysis and remote sensing data. Quotient curves (Q(C)) were constructed using the geographic distribution of egg density, temperature and salinity from samples collected during nine survey cruises between 1976 and 1993. The interannual sea surface temperature (SST) variability was determined using principal component analysis on the SST anomalies (SSTA) estimated from remote sensing data over the period between 1985 and 2007. The spatial pattern of egg occurrences in the SBB indicated that the largest concentration occurred between Paranagua and Sao Sebastiao. Spawning habitat expanded and contracted during the years, fluctuating around Paranagua. In January 1978 and January 1993, eggs were found nearly everywhere along the inner shelf of the SBB, while in January 1988 and 1991 spawning had contracted to their southernmost position. The SSTA maps for the spawning periods showed {{that in the case of}} habitat expansion (1993 only) anomalies over the SBB were zero or slightly negative, whereas for the contraction period anomalies were all positive. Sardinella brasiliensis is capable of exploring suitable spawning sites provided by the entrainment of the colder and less-saline South Atlantic Central Water onto the shelf by means of both coastal wind-driven (to the north-east of the SBB) and meander-induced (to the south-west of the SBB) upwelling.

40|$|The {{studies which}} form the {{background}} for this synoptic presentation aimed {{to contribute to}} the investigation of the reason for great yearly fluctuations in recruitment in marine fish stocks. In order to evaluate if mass mortality due to starvation in the larval stage contributes to these fluctuations, trypsin activity was suggested as an appropriate indicator to assess individually both the nutritional condition and feeding activity of fish larvae of all age stages. Based on the principle of conventional chromogenic methods a highly sensitive fluorometric measurement was developed, which allows the individual assessment of tryptic activity even in the youngest larval stages. In order to evaluate species-specific features of tryptic activity, larvae of six different marine species were reared under laboratory conditions (herring, Clupea harengus, turbot, Scophthalmus maximus, cod, Gadus morhua, sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, and <b>Brazilian</b> sardine, <b>Sardinella</b> brasiliensis). The exemplary application of the laboratory calibration in field surveys clearly demonstrates that the tryptic activity is appropriate to evaluate the nutritional condition of larvae from field samples. Examples for some species are presented (herring, cod and sprat). The most significant results from laboratory experiments: Larval age and larval size were chosen as the standard for comparison to relate to tryptic activity. Tryptic activity was found even in yolk sac stages of the investigated species. Tryptic activity increases with age in continuously fed larvae following a non-linear pattern which is supposed to be determined in the ontogenetic development of each species. Increase in tryptic activity persists until larvae develop a functional stomach. The amount of maximum tryptic activity at a given size and age is species specific: turbot larvae show the highest whereas herring larvae have the lowest values at a given age. The amount of trypsin which has its origin in the ingested food oganism is of minor significance for the measurement. Tryptic acticity reacts very sensitive on variations in food density. Not only fed and starved larvae can be separated but also larvae kept at high and low food concentration. Differences in tryptic activity between fed and starved larvae are statistically significant in the majority of the investigated species, but differences in larvae kept at high and low food densities are not always significant. In yolk sac stages and beyond, while adapting to exogenic food sources, differences in tryptic activity are insignificant in larvae with and without food supply. This stage can last until ten days after hatching, depending from the species. When relying completely on external food sources, differences in tryptic activity occurs within hours when fed and starving larvae are compared. However, significant differences arise only after 1 - 3 days, depending on species, size and age. Species with their origin in temperate latitudes shows a slower decrease in tryptic activity compared to species from subtropical or tropical areas. If food deprivation persists, tryptic activity levels off to zero within days; the number of days is depending from the species, age and size. Individual variability of tryptic activity is large in continuously fed larvae, moderate in larvae kept on low food density and disappears in starving larvae. A diurnal rhythm in tryptic activity was identified. In addition, tryptic activity increases as a consequence of active feeding and decreases thereafter within hours to the pre-feeding level; however, those level is always well above the tryptic activity level of starving larvae. Starving larvae show a very weak diurnal oscillation in tryptic activity. 196 Laboratory calibration was used to estimate the number of starving larvae in field samples. For this purpose, tryptic activity was related to the larval size and the values for starving larvae were fitted to a linear regression. The upper 99...|$|R
40|$|O presente trabalho foi motivado pelas condições de comercialização da sardinha verdadeira (Sardinella brasiliensis) fresca, descongelada e processada no município de São Paulo-SP, aparentemente não adequadas. Amostras de sardinhas foram analisadas usando como parâmetros os valores de substâncias que reagem com o ácido tiobarbitúrico (TBARS) e nitrogênio de bases voláteis totais (N-BVT). As amostras foram coletadas e analisadas em três momentos diferentes da cadeia produtiva: ao desembarque na CEAGESP (Companhia de Entrepostos e Armazens Gerais do Estado de São Paulo), durante a comercialização em feiras-livres antes da vigência do defeso da espécie e durante a comercialização em feiras-livres na vigência do defeso da espécie (dezembro a março). Para a sardinha desembarcada na CEAGESP, foram observados os seguintes valores médios ± desvio-padrão: TBARS= 0, 18 ± 0, 17 mg de aldeído malônico (AM) / kg e N-BVT= 15, 75 ± 2, 39 mg/ 100 g. Para a sardinha comercializada em feira-livre antes do defeso, os valores registrados foram TBARS= 0, 82 ± 0, 63 mg AM/ kg e N-BVT= 27, 06 ± 2, 18 mg/ 100 g. Para a sardinha comercializada em feira-livre durante o defeso foram detectados TBARS= 7, 14 ± 5, 36 mg AM/ kg e N-BVT= 27, 69 ± 2, 80 mg/ 100 g. Os resultados mostraram haver, para os valores de TBARS, diferença estatisticamente significativa entre a sardinha desembarcada na CEAGESP e a comercializada em feira-livre antes do defeso, bem como entre estas e as comercializadas na vigência do defeso. Já para os valores de N-BVT foi notada diferença estatisticamente significativa entre a sardinha desembarcada na CEAGESP e as comercializadas em feira-livre, porém não houve diferença estatisticamente significativa entre as sardinhas comercializadas em feira-livre antes e durante a vigência do defeso. Na sardinha salmourada foram verificados valores médios de TBARS= 4, 07 ± 1, 22 mg AM/ kg e N-BVT= 44, 32 ± 14, 38 mg/ 100 g quando não-lavada; e TBARS= 1, 25 ± 0, 23 mg AM/ kg e N-BVT= 39, 63 ± 4, 00 mg/ 100 g quando lavada. Para a sardinha anchovada foram detectados os valores médios de TBARS= 3, 71 ± 0, 77 mg AM/ kg e N-BVT= 62, 96 ± 9, 33 mg/ 100 g. Foram ainda comparados valores de TBARS e lisina biodisponível, não se observando correlação significativa entre eles (R 2 = 0, 1732). Apenas a sardinha fresca comercializada na CEAGESP apresentou condição aceitável de consumo. This {{work was}} {{motivated}} by the observation of the apparently not adequate trade conditions of the fresh, defrosted and processed <b>Brazilian</b> sardine (<b>Sardinella</b> brasiliensis) {{in the city of}} São Paulo-SP. Sardine samples were analysed for thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS) and total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N). The samples were collected and analysed at three different times in the production chain: on landing at CEAGESP (the Central Warehouse Company of the State of São Paulo), while on sale at the street markets before the species-catching prohibition and while on sale at the street markets during the species-catching prohibition period (December-March). The following results were observed for the sardine landed at CEAGESP (mean ± standard deviation) : TBARS= 0. 18 ± 0. 17 mg malondialdehyde (MDA) / kg and TVB-N= 15. 75 ± 2. 39 mg/ 100 g. For the sardines collected at the street markets before the prohibition period, the results were TBARS= 0. 82 ± 0. 63 mg MDA/ kg and TVB-N= 27. 06 ± 2. 18 mg/ 100 g. The values detected for the samples collected at the street markets during the prohibition period were TBARS= 7. 14 ± 5. 36 mg MDA/ kg and TVB-N= 27. 69 ± 2. 80 mg/ 100 g. The results show a statistically significant difference between the TBARS values for the samples collected at CEAGESP and the ones collected at the street markets before the prohibition period and between the latter and the ones collected at the street markets during the prohibition period. On the other hand, a statistically significant difference was noticed between the TVB-N values for the sardines collected at CEAGESP and the ones collected at the street markets, but there was not any statistically significant difference between the samples collected at the street markets before and during the prohibition period. In unwashed brined sardines the following values were recorded: TBARS= 4. 07 ± 1. 22 mg MDA/ kg and TVB-N= 44. 32 ± 14. 38 mg/ 100 g, while for the washed samples the results were TBARS= 1. 25 ± 0. 23 mg MDA/ kg and TVB-N= 39. 63 ± 4. 00 mg/ 100 g. For ripened sardine values of TBARS= 3. 71 ± 0. 77 mg MDA/ kg and TVB-N= 62. 96 ± 9. 33 mg/ 100 g were detected. TBARS values were also compared to available lysine and no significant correlation was found (R 2 = 0. 1732).
