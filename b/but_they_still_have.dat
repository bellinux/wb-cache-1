25|$|The {{staff of}} the {{circulation}} department liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by newspaper carriers, at retailers, and through vending machines. Free newspapers do not sell subscriptions, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include graphic designers, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an advertising-free newspaper, there is no advertising department.|$|E

5000|$|The Papists {{wanted to}} condemn any ruler {{who did not}} offer {{compliance}} {{to the will of}} Rome. As Charles I was officially a Protestant, this was not popular.

25|$|The {{effect of}} {{temporal}} lobe {{damage on the}} reminiscence bump is highly variable {{as a function of}} age at the time of injury. This is because patients with damage to the temporal lobes or underlying structures in the limbic system may lose the ability to form new memories, especially if the damage is within the hippocampal formation, while retaining access to at least some memories from before the injury. Individuals with this type of brain damage are not able to form new memories after the incident that caused the brain damage, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> access to memories that happened before the brain damage occurred. If the brain damage was present at the age of 10, the individual may not remember anything from between the age of 10 and 30 and have no reminiscence bump.|$|E
500|$|During the {{rehearsal}} for that evening, Julie and Steve {{learn that the}} town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut {{on the back of}} her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists that the show cannot proceed, because Julie is a mulatto woman married to a white man, and local laws prohibit such miscegenation. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has [...] "black blood" [...] in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.|$|E
60|$|There {{was never}} a better name for a plant than this, for the {{delicate}} leaves which grow on this slender stalk are almost as sensitive to the touch {{as if they were}} alive. If you place your hand on a growing plant, you will soon see all the leaves on the stem that you have touched fold themselves up as tightly {{as if they had been}} packed up carefully to be sent away by mail or express. In some of the common kinds of this plant, which grow about in our fields, it takes some time for the leaves to fold after they have been touched or handled; but if you watch them long enough--five or ten minutes--you will see that they never fail to close. They are not so sensitive as their cultivated kindred, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the family disposition.|$|E

6000|$|... "When the dikes {{enclosing}} {{the lake}} were completed, the engineers set up three very powerful steam engines, and gave {{to each one}} ten or twelve enormous pumps to work. These pumping engines were made on such a grand scale that they lifted over sixty tuns of water at every stroke. But yet so large was the lake, and so vast the quantity of water to be drained, that though {{there were three of}} the engines working at this rate, and though they were kept at work night and day, it took them {{a year and a half}} to lay the ground dry. The work was, however, at last accomplished, and now, what was the bottom of the lake is all converted into pastures and green fields. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to keep the pumps going all the time to lift out the surplus water that falls over the whole space in rain. You may judge that the amount is very large that falls on a district thirty miles round. They calculate that the quantity which they have to pump up now, every year, in order to keep the land from being overflowed again, is over fifty millions of tuns. And that is a quantity larger than you can ever conceive of.|$|E

500|$|The {{two main}} {{features}} of England's first innings were Scotton's [...] "stonewalling" [...] and Read's (batting at number ten) [...] "hard and rapid hitting". Scotton's 90 in six hours and Read's 117 in two enabled England {{to reach a}} respectable 346 <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to follow on, 205 runs behind. But the time taken by Scotton's innings left Australia with {{not enough time to}} bowl England out again and the result was a draw.|$|R
5000|$|The branch was {{six and a}} {{three quarter}} miles long, but its point to point length was a mere {{four and a half}} miles, the {{difference}} being due to the extremely sinuous course it had to take to keep the ruling gradient to a [...] "mere" [...] 1 in 44. The gradients largely favoured loaded trains, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> to cope with half a mile uphill through Arlecdon and {{a mile and a half}} uphill from Brownriggs Gill to Whillimoor Top.|$|R

This compulsory fee was abolished in the 1960s. Nowadays, the nations are a feature peculiar to the University of Helsinki, the oldest Finnish university and they concentrate on the student culture.
