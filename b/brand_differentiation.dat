40|$|ABSTRACTMarket share on a {{daily basis}} has {{unstable}} behavior. New brand launch causes disruptions in market dynamics, but it does not explain exclusively the fluctuations in this competitive index. Branding and pricing strategies help to explain these fluctuations. This research examines the impact of introducing new brands on brand share and the impact of marketing strategies at point of sale in prior and subsequent periods of brand launch. Longitudinal design was conducted using eight brands of a routinely purchased product over 365 days. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were suitable to analyze the regression of the panel data. The results show that: (1) brand launch has a sharp negative impact on the market share of all pre-existing brands during the subsequent days and a dampening impact weeks later for almost all brands, except for the pioneer; (2) brand introduction explains little variation of market share; (3) pricing and <b>branding</b> (<b>differentiation</b> of attributes and consumer-based brand equity) strategies have exponential effect and quite explain the market share dynamics; (4) pricing strategies (promotional, premium and shelf) no longer have extreme effects on market share with brand introductions; and (5) branding strategies become more relevant in post-launch periods.

50|$|Color is a {{key element}} in logo design and plays an {{important}} role in <b>brand</b> <b>differentiation.</b> The importance of color in this context is due to the mechanics of human visual perception wherein color and contrast play critical roles in visual detail detection. In addition, we tend to acquire various color connotations and color associations through social and cultural conditioning, and these play a role in how we decipher and evaluate logo color. While color is considered important to brand recognition and logo design, it shouldn't conflict with logo functionality, and it needs to be remembered that color connotations and associations are not consistent across all social and cultural groups. For example, in the United States, red, white, and blue are often used in logos for companies that want to project patriotic feelings but other countries will have different sets of colors that evoke national pride. Similarly, diverse industry sectors tend to favour different color palettes: strong, saturated colors are favoured in the fast food industry and less saturated, more sombre colors in the banking and insurance sectors.|$|E

[...] Popular fancy cuts include the baguette (French, meaning rod or loaf of bread), marquise, princess cut (square outline), heart, briolette (a form of the rose cut), and pear cuts. Newer cuts that have been introduced into the jewelry industry are the [...] "cushion" [...] "radiant" [...] (similar to princess cuts, but with rounded edges instead of square edges) and Asscher cuts. Many fancy colored diamonds are now being cut according to these new styles. Generally speaking, these [...] "fancy cuts" [...] are not held to the same strict standards as Tolkowsky-derived round brilliants and there are less specific mathematical guidelines of angles which determine a well-cut stone. Cuts are influenced heavily by fashion: the baguette cut—which accentuates a diamond's luster and downplays its fire—was popular during the Art Deco period, whereas the princess cut — which accentuates a diamond's fire rather than its luster — is currently gaining popularity. The princess cut is also popular amongst diamond cutters: of all the cuts, it wastes the least of the original crystal. The past decades have seen {{the development of new}} diamond cuts, often based on a modification of an existing cut. Some of these include extra facets.

40|$|As {{this paper}} study how a brand can {{differentiate}} itself {{to stand out}} among the competitions for better growth opportunities, focus is given to two emerging trends in the market, the halal skincare and also functional skincare brand. Halal skincare stands for the skincare product that is permissible for Muslim consumption from the religious perspective. This trend is growing tremendously as Muslim is the second biggest religion {{in the world with}} high fertility rate. In skincare, the concept of halal would exclude the use of alcohol and pig-derives material in the product. This market amount to $ 46 billion in 2013 and is growing at 8 % annually. This undercapitalised halal skincare market with few competition provides good opportunities for a brand to grow and develop. The functional skincare on the other hand, is a trend emerged over time where products provide additional benefits on top of basic function. This skincare trend is basically driven by modern technology that leads to many innovations of these multi-featured products. Example of the additional benefits that will be the focus in this study are the anti-aging and the sun care protection. Both trends gained enough attention by demonstrating a strong growth in the respective segments. This study will provide a snapshot of the current growing trends in the market and provide the key steps to position and differentiate a brand in order to stand out against the competitors with reference to the halal and functional skincare.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Computer Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. This {{preliminary}} {{study investigated the}} factors which influence consumer choice of beef. A questionnaire and sensory evaluation considered the level of importance which consumers attached to the sensory (intrinsic attributes) properties of beef as compared to extrinsic factors. It was found that consumers use sensory properties to predict the freshness and overall eating quality, {{but they can also}} misinterpret the quality cues. Consumers {{made it clear that the}} freshness and the place of purchase played a prominent role in their decision to purchase red meat because they perceive the retailer to be an integral part of the overall quality assessment with regard to the purchase process of mutton and beef. The Total Food Quality Model is used as the frame of reference for analysing the way in which consumers perceive meat quality. The way in which consumers form expectations about the quality at the point of purcha 7 se, based on their own experience and information cues available in the shopping environment, is described as well as the way in which quality is experienced in the home during and after meal preparation. The relationship between quality expectations and quality experience and its implications for consumer satisfaction and repeat purchase intent is addressed. The study collected data by means of a questionnaire to evaluate the quality perceptions of beef. Cronbach alpha as reliability coefficient recorded high levels of reliability and the factor analysis revealed that only one factor, namely that of quality considerations is present in the analysis. Furthermore, the building on the insights obtained on subjective quality perception, possibilities for consumer–oriented product development in the meat sector are addressed.

40|$|Abstract. Brand {{positioning}} {{is essential}} for <b>brand</b> <b>differentiation</b> and building brand equity. Obtaining and sustaining competitive advantage through brand positioning is a complex process {{in the context of}} increasing competition and complicated consumers. However, many positioning strategies are prone to follow similar pitfalls by aligning to market tendencies and thus failing to provide significant <b>brand</b> <b>differentiation.</b> This paper analyzes new positioning strategies for gaining sustainable competitive advantage. By using anti-market reactions such as transformation, subtraction and division, companies are able to build effective positioning strategies by making the problem of competition irrelevant. We relate these new positioning strategies to the classic positioning process and identify the key elements which make them successful. We describe the value proposition of new positioning strategies from the means-end theory perspective. Finally, the managerial implications of new positioning strategies are reviewed. We suggest directions for effective positioning and propose avenues for future positioning research...|$|E

40|$|Product {{differentiation}} {{is pervasive}} in markets. It {{is at the}} heart of structural empiricism and it smoothes jagged behavior that causes paradoxical outcomes in several theoretical models. Firms differentiate their products to avoid ruinous price competition. Representative consumer, discrete choice, and location models are not necessarily inconsistent, but performance depends crucially on the degree of localization of competition. With (symmetric) global competition, rents are typically small and market variety near optimal. With local competition, profits may be protected because entrants must find profitable niches. These rents lead firms to competitively dissipative them, and performance may be poor. 1.
