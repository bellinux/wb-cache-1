In a study conducted by Roy Baumeister, after participants read an article arguing against free will, {{they were more likely to}} lie about their performance on a test where they would be rewarded with cash. Provoking a rejection of free will has also been associated with increased aggression and less helpful <b>behaviour</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as mindless conformity.

When he was introduced, GameSpy's Christian Nutt {{called him a}} [...] "clone" [...] of Guile from the Street Fighter series because of their similar movesets but Ash's team was praised as new characters with new elements in the series. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN wrote that a major fan complaint was the character's strength in the games, which {{made him one of}} the strongest opponents despite an apparent lack of effort. According to Thomas, Ash is [...] "nothing if not strange" [...] and the writer lamented his many appearances in the KOF 2003 manhua compared with more-popular characters. When playable characters for the arcade version of The King of Fighters XIII were introduced, Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek speculated about Ash's lack of teammates and wondered if he was alone because [...] "no one likes Ash now." [...] Marissa Meli of UGO Networks ranked Ash sixteenth on a list of [...] "The Most Androgynous Video Game Characters", with Meli jokingly attributing his androgynous appearance to a desire by Japanese designers to confuse Western gamers about their sexuality. Although he called Ash's voice one of [...] "Gaming's Top 10 Deepest Voices", Dan Howdle of Now Gamer referred to him as a female character and writers for Game Informer joked about their surprise at the discovery that Ash is a male character. After UTV Ignition Entertainment polled fans to choose an artbox for console versions of The King of Fighters XII, the company announced that Ash's unpopularity reduced the number of potential covers to two (featuring Kyo and Iori). Den of Geek listed Ash as the 23rd best The King of Fighters with the writer comparing him with Loki based on their antagonistic and tricky <b>behaviour</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as how his heroic traits in KOF XIII gave fans different thoughts.

2500|$|The {{other type}} of {{catatonia}} {{is more of an}} outward presentation of the profoundly agitated state described above.

[...] An example is someone walking very fast in circles to the exclusion of anything else with a level of mental preoccupation (meaning not focused on anything relevant to the situation) that was not typical of the person prior to the symptom onset. [...] In both types of catatonia there is generally no reaction to anything that happens outside of them. [...] It is important to distinguish catatonic agitation from severe bipolar mania, although someone could have both.|$|E

2500|$|While at Cambridge, Sharp {{heard the}} lectures of William Morris {{and became a}} Fabian Socialist and lifelong vegetarian. He was {{cautious}} in his public statements, however, feeling that he had much to lose, since, unlike Morris, he was not independently wealthy but dependent on outside funding for his researches. Respectability was important to him, increasingly so as he got older. According to his biographer, Maud Karpeles: [...] "Any display of singularity was displeasing to him; and he followed the convention in <b>behaviour</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as in appearance unless {{there was a very}} good reason for departing from them. 'It saves so much trouble,' he would say." [...] During the post World War II [...] "second" [...] British folk revival of the 1950s and 60s, Sharp was occasionally chided for this by leftist critics such as Bert Lloyd. C. J. Bearman writes that [...] "Lloyd was effectively the first to offer public criticism of Sharp and of the first revival generally. This critique was from a Marxist perspective: Lloyd (1908-82) had associated himself with the Communist Party since the 1930s. ... However, he was always more pragmatic than doctrinaire, and he combined criticism of Sharp's philosophy and methods with high and unreserved praise for his motivation and the epic scale of his achievement.|$|E
