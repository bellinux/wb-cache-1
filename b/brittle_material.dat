500|$|Even in {{a narrow}} range of {{concentrations}} of mixtures of carbon and iron that make a steel, {{a number of different}} metallurgical structures, with very different properties can form. Understanding such properties is essential to making quality steel. At room temperature, the most stable form of pure iron is the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure called alpha iron or α-iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon, no more than 0.005% at [...] and 0.021 wt% at [...] The inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called ferrite. At 910°C pure iron transforms into a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, called gamma iron or γ-iron. The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called austenite. The more open FCC structure of austenite can dissolve considerably more carbon, as much as 2.1% (38 times that of ferrite) carbon at , which reflects the upper carbon content of steel, beyond which is cast iron. When carbon moves out of solution with iron it forms a very hard, but <b>brittle</b> <b>material</b> called cementite (Fe3C).|$|E

40|$|<b>Brittle</b> <b>materials</b> such as silicon, germanium, {{glass and}} {{ceramics}} {{are widely used}} in semiconductor, optical, micro-electronics and various other fields. Traditionally, grinding, polishing and lapping have been employed to achieve high tolerance in surface texture of silicon wafers in semiconductor applications, lenses for optical instruments etc. The conventional machining processes such as single point turning and milling are not conducive to <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> as they produce discontinuous chips owing to brittle failure at the shear plane before any tangible plastic flow occurs. In order to improve surface finish on machined <b>brittle</b> <b>materials,</b> ductile regime machining is being extensively studied lately. The process of machining <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> where the material is removed by plastic flow, thus leaving a crack free surface is known as ductile-regime machining. Ductile machining of <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> can produce surfaces of very high quality comparable with processes such as polishing, lapping etc. The objective of this project {{is to develop a}} comprehensive predictive model for ductile machining of <b>brittle</b> <b>materials.</b> The model would predict the critical undeformed chip thickness required to achieve ductile-regime machining. The input to the model includes tool geometry, workpiece material properties and machining process parameters. The fact that the scale of ductile regime machining is very small leads to a number of factors assuming significance which would otherwise be neglected. The effects of tool edge radius, grain size, grain boundaries, crystal orientation etc. are studied so as to make better predictions of forces and hence the critical undeformed chip thickness. The model is validated using a series of experiments with varying materials and cutting conditions. This research would aid in predicting forces and undeformed chip thickness values for micro-machining <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> given their material properties and process conditions. The output could be used to machine <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> without fracture and hence preserve their surface texture quality. The need for resorting to experimental trial and error is greatly reduced as the critical parameter, namely undeformed chip thickness, is predicted using this approach. This can in turn pave way for <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> to be utilized in a variety of applications. Ph. D.

40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} devoted to the study of dynamic {{propagation}} of mode II cracks in porous <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> with nanoscale pore size. We compared static (shear strength) and dynamic parameters of crack growth in dry and fluid saturated nanoporous <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> at different degrees of confinement. We have shown that pore fluid in nanoporous <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> influences mainly the dynamics of crack propagation. This leads in particular to pronounced peculiarities of the dependence of the critical value of dimensionless geometrical parameter of the initial crack (it majorizes the interval of the ratios of length to thickness for the cracks that are capable to accelerate to intersonic velocity) on applied crack normal stress. The results of the study are relevant for understanding the conditions of supershear regime of propagation of mode II cracks as well as for assessment of the ability of mode II cracks in <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> (including nanoporous fluid-saturated solids) to develop in supershear regime...|$|R

40|$|Because {{of recent}} {{advances}} in precision engineering that allow controlled grinding infeed rates as small as several nanometers per grinding wheel revolution, {{it is possible to}} grind <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> so that the predominant material-removal mechanism is plastic-flow and not fracture.

Furthermore, an analytical and experimental investigation of the infeed rates necessary for ductile-regime grinding of <b>brittle</b> <b>materials</b> is presented.
