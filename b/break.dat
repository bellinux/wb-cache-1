5|$|In the semi-finals, now best-of-11, Higgins took 73 {{minutes to}} {{whitewash}} Murphy 6–0, scoring breaks of 58, 114, 57, 89, and completing the victory {{with a total}} clearance of 144, the highest <b>break</b> so far. The time of 73 minutes was only two minutes slower than the quickest best-of-11 match—the semi-finals of the 1993 International Open between Hendry and Dave Harold—and Higgins outscored Murphy 566–72. In the first three frames, Murphy managed to score a total of 10 points. In the fourth, Murphy broke down on a <b>break</b> of 50 before Higgins fluked a yellow, enabling {{him to make a}} 57 <b>break.</b> He then fortuitously snooked Murphy on the pink, which Higgins potted to make it 4–0. An 89 <b>break</b> extended Higgins' lead, before he finished the match with a 144 <b>break.</b> Higgins attributed his performance to a shortening of his cue.|$|E

40|$|Results of {{numerical}} investigations, {{based on}} full dynamic equations, are presented for wave <b>breaking</b> in a one-dimensional environment {{with a wave}} spectrum. The <b>breaking</b> {{is defined as a}} process of irreversible collapse of an individual wave in physical space, and the incipient breaker is a wave that reached a dynamic condition of the limiting stability where the collapse has not started yet but is inevitable. The main attention is paid to documenting the evolution of different wave characteristics before the <b>breaking</b> commences. It is shown that the <b>breaking</b> is a localized process that rapidly develops in space and time. No single characteristic, such as wave steepness, wave height, and asymmetry, can serve as a predictor of the incipient <b>breaking.</b> The process of <b>breaking</b> is intermittent; it happens spontaneously and is individually unpredictable. The evolution of geometric, kinematic, and dynamic characteristics of the <b>breaking</b> wave describes the process of <b>breaking</b> itself rather than indicating an imminent <b>breaking.</b> It is shown that the criterion of <b>breaking,</b> valid for the <b>breaking</b> due to modulation instability in one-dimensional waves trains, is not universal if applied to the conditions of spectral environment. In this context, the development of algorithms for parameterization of <b>breaking</b> for wave prediction models and for direct wave simulations is more important...|$|R

40|$|An {{effective}} SAT preprocessing {{technique is}} {{the construction of}} symmetry <b>breaking</b> formulas: auxiliary clauses that guide a SAT solver away from needless exploration of symmetric subproblems. However, during the past decade, state-of-the-art SAT solvers rarely incorporated symmetry <b>breaking.</b> This suggests that {{the reduction of the}} search space does not outweigh the overhead incurred by detecting symmetry and constructing symmetry <b>breaking</b> formulas. We investigate three methods to construct more effective symmetry <b>breaking</b> formulas. The first method simply improves the encoding of symmetry <b>breaking</b> formulas. The second detects special symmetry subgroups, for which complete symmetry <b>breaking</b> formulas exist. The third infers binary symmetry <b>breaking</b> clauses for a symmetry group as a whole rather than longer clauses for individual symmetries. We implement these methods in a symmetry <b>breaking</b> preprocessor, and verify their effectiveness on both hand-picked problems as well as the 2014 SAT competition benchmark set. Our experiments indicate that our symmetry <b>breaking</b> preprocessor improves the current state-of-the-art in static symmetry <b>breaking</b> for SAT and has a sufficiently low overhead to improve the performance of modern SAT solvers on hard combinatorial instances. status: publishe...|$|R
