25|$|On 30 June 2006, the {{management}} of the Tour de France announced at a press conference that a number of riders, including Ivan Basso, would not <b>be</b> <b>riding</b> in the 2006 Tour de France due to rumours of blood doping stemming from the Operación Puerto investigation in Spain. According to the investigation, Basso was allegedly given blood doping by the Dr. Fuentes in a Spanish clinic. No formal charges had been raised, but following an agreement between the managers of all the ProTour teams, any rider under suspicion of doping {{would not be allowed to}} start in ProTour races. This forced CSC to remove Basso from their squad for the 2006 Tour.|$|E
25|$|A highly fictionalized {{version of}} Balian {{is the main}} {{character}} of the 2005 film Kingdom of Heaven, played by Orlando Bloom {{as a young man}} with a questioning sensibility regarding religion and social attitudes. In the film, Balian's father, a fictional character named Godfrey the Baron of Ibelin (played by Liam Neeson), returns to Europe to find Balian, his long-lost illegitimate son, who is a blacksmith in France, and encourages him to come to the Holy Land as his heir. Balian is portrayed as having a love affair with Sibylla (this is possibly derived from the Old French Continuation of William of Tyres claims about her and Baldwin). The film depicts Balian as the sole commander of the defence of Jerusalem, and instead of working in close alliance with Patriarch Eraclius, Balian is depicted as his rival. In the film's coda, Balian returns to France (with Sibylla) where he meets Richard I of England, who rides up to Balian and says to him that he is looking for Balian, the defender of Jerusalem, to which Balian replies that he is a blacksmith. After some time passes Balian and Sibylla are seen to <b>be</b> <b>riding</b> up the crossroads his father had used when returning from Jerusalem.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{from the music}} press, with Billboard magazine predicting that [...] "the Byrds will <b>be</b> <b>riding</b> high on the LP charts again with this top rock package." [...] Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times was more cautious, noting that [...] "the album is a good one, {{but it would be}} sad if it served as a monument, marking the end of the Byrds' development. There is little to distinguish it from their previous LPs in terms of creativity." [...] A resoundingly positive review came from the pen of Peter Reilly, writing in Hi-Fi/Stereo Review, who described the record as [...] "an enjoyable and well-made album which, if listened to closely enough, explains a good deal {{about what is going on}} around us." ...|$|E

500|$|While the Byrds {{outwardly}} {{seemed to}} <b>be</b> <b>riding</b> {{the crest of}} a wave during the latter half of 1965, the recording sessions for their second album had not been without tension. [...] One source of conflict was the power struggle that had begun to develop between producer Terry Melcher and the band's manager Jim Dickson, with the latter harboring aspirations to produce the band himself, causing him to be overly critical of Melcher's work. [...] Within a month of Turn! Turn! Turn! being released, Dickson and the Byrds approached Columbia Records and requested that Melcher be replaced, {{despite the fact that he}} had successfully steered the band through the recording of two number 1 singles and two hit albums. [...] Any hopes that Dickson had of being allowed to produce the band himself, however, were dashed when Columbia assigned their West Coast head of A, Allen Stanton, to the band.|$|E
2500|$|The Fort Worth rodeo was nicknamed [...] "Yak's show" [...] {{after he}} won the saddle-bronc {{competition}} {{three years in a}} row from 1921 to 1923. [...] He had won the saddle-bronc competition in Pendleton in 1917, 1919, and 1923 and came second in 1915 and 1929. Canutt won the steer bulldogging in 1920 and 1921, and won the All-Around Police Gazette belt in 1917, 1919, 1920 and 1923. While in Hollywood in 1923 for an awards ceremony, he was offered eight western action pictures for producer Ben Wilson at Burwillow Studios; the first was to <b>be</b> <b>Riding</b> Mad.|$|E
2500|$|The puppeteer, often dubbed as the [...] "Muppet performer", {{holds the}} Muppet {{above his head}} or {{in front of his}} body, with one hand {{operating}} the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or by [...] "wearing" [...] the hands like gloves. One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left-handed as the puppeteer uses his right hand to operate the head while operating the arm rod with his left hand. There are many other common designs and means of operation. In advanced Muppets, several puppeteers may control a single character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for the character. As technology has evolved, the Jim Henson team and other puppeteers have developed an enormous variety of means to operate Muppets for film and television, including the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote radio control, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of a mix of technologies has allowed for scenes in which Muppets appear to <b>be</b> <b>riding</b> a bicycle, rowing a boat, and even dancing on-stage with no puppeteer in sight.|$|E
50|$|Dual-sports, by definition, are compromises - {{giving up}} some dirt {{performance}} to <b>be</b> <b>ridden</b> {{on the street}} and some street performance to <b>be</b> <b>ridden</b> in the dirt. The merits of a particular model can only be judged relative to the owner’s intended mix of dirt and street riding. Although aficionados may argue the merits of different models, versatile dual-sports can be desirable alternatives to more specialized motorcycles that can only <b>be</b> <b>ridden</b> in one environment.|$|R

[...] Other {{studies show that}} African-Americans who experience frequent episodes of isolated sleep paralysis, i.e., reporting having one or more sleep paralysis episodes per month coined as [...] "sleep paralysis disorder," [...] were predisposed to panic attacks. This finding has been replicated by other independent researchers.|$|R
2500|$|On the Confederate left flank, two Confederate regiments (50th Tennessee and {{consolidated}} 10th/30th Tennessee) were sneaking {{forward in}} complete silence, ready to stream {{into the field}} in the federal rear and seal the trap. [...] Skirmishers of the leading 50th Tennessee chased off the cavalry pickets with a few ill-aimed shots. In the field behind the federal army, General Logan must have been near panic. [...] The cavalry protecting his right flank was scrambling from the woods, his rightmost infantry regiment was nowhere to be seen, and {{what was left of the}} next regiment in line had emerged from the woods in disorganized groups of three and four, and was attempting in vain to regroup. [...] Normally calm in battle, Logan was noted to <b>be</b> <b>riding</b> behind the lines screeching like an eagle for his troops to plug the perceived gaps. [...] He pulled the 8th Illinois and the 81st Illinois out of line, sending the former to the left where the 23rd Indiana was reforming, and the latter to the right where the 23rd Indiana should have been, and then sent the remaining two regiments of his reserve to probe for the force that had scattered his cavalry picket.|$|E
2500|$|The idealist {{interpretation}} {{in which}} the beast finds expression in the socio-cultural, economic and political arena of all human activities since the existence of man best describes the scriptural perspective of the beast. This position was fully annunciated by Chike Udolisa is his book. In this perspective, {{the image of the}} four kingdoms that were to rule the world as shown to Nebuchadnezzar were equated to the four beasts revealed to Daniel, and to the seven-headed beast revealed to John. The records of [...] and [...] show this beast to represent the kings of the earth. Furthermore, the revelation in Daniel 7 of four beasts comprising a lion, bear and leopard also correlates with the seven headed beast as shown to John in [...] having the same features of the lion, bear and leopard. Thus the beast represents the kingdoms that will bear rule over the world from Adam until the second coming of Christ. While in the spirit, this beast is seen as a personality as in Revelation 19:20, in the physical he is represented at different ages throughout the period of human existence as different kingdoms. The import of this interpretation is that as the Whore of Babylon is seen to <b>be</b> <b>riding</b> this beast, the beast is the seat of operation of the whore from where she is expressed, and by whom her dominion is exercised. This corresponds to Revelation 13 where the power exercised by this beast was completely that of the dragon. This brings to light the scriptural fact that the governments of the nations are puppets in the hands of this beast, consistent with the truth that the whole world system is under the dragon, the god of this world.|$|E
