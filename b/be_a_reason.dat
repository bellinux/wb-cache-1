5|$|While {{going to}} meet Doggett and Scully, Wells gets shoved into a dominos game and while picking them up gets slashed on his right cheek from a man with the spider web tattoo on his hand. Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving {{backwards}} in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says there must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for it and Scully suggests that the answer may already be within him. Studying {{the evidence of the}} case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a hand with a spider web tattoo.|$|E
5|$|According to Williams, it is {{possible}} that after Sveinn defeated Ölvir and Frakökk, Ölvir may have fled to kinsmen of his in the Suðreyjar. Williams suggested that the blood feud between the families may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for Sveinn's military activities in the Hebrides and the Isle of Mann, afterwards; although Sveinn had other interests in the area, since he is stated to have married the window of a Manx king. In the late 19th century, antiquary F.W.L. Thomas speculated that the memory of Ölvir may have been preserved in the Hebrides. Thomas stated that within the mythological history of the Outer Hebridean island of Lewis, the island clan of Macaulays were said to be the descendants of a man named Amhlaebh, {{who was one of the}} twelve sons, or near relations, of a man named Oliver, among whom Lewis was divided. This Oliver was said to have been the eldest son of the Norse king who was given the Isles and Highlands by a son of Kenneth MacAlpin, for his assistance in driving his own brother from Scotland. Thomas speculated that Oliver could represent Ölvir Rósta; meaning that he was the progenitor of the Macaulays.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); this may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also {{attract the attention of}} predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E

5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for adult males {{to stay close to}} the female before and during the egg laying period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at least a month.|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} is built of rose granite quarried in Ortonville, with many stones greater than 20tonnes in weight. The granite was originally {{only going to}} be used for the foundation of the building, with brick used for the upper portion. However, the public appreciated the appearance of the foundation so much that they lobbied for the entire building to be made of granite. This may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for the significant cost overruns — it was originally expected to cost only $1.15million.|$|E
25|$|Promotion is {{effected}} {{by turning the}} piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. Promoting a piece {{has the effect of}} changing how that piece moves. See below. For example, promoting a kirin turns it into a lion, and thereafter it behaves exactly like the original lion, even for the lion-trading rules. (Which can <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to defer promotion of a kirin.) A rook obtained by promoting a gold differs from an original rook, though, by that the latter can still promote (to dragon horse), while the former cannot.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} the {{incorporation}} of Lesser Poland is also not completely resolved. Possibly Mieszko took the region before 990, which is indicated by the vague remark of Thietmar, who wrote of a country taken by Mieszko from Boleslav. In light of this theory, the conquest of Lesser Poland could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for the war, or its first stage. Many historians suggested that the Czech rule over Lesser Poland was only nominal and likely limited to the indirect control of Kraków and perhaps a few other important centers. This theory {{is based on the}} lack of archaeological discoveries, which would indicate major building investments undertaken by the Bohemian state.|$|E
25|$|The {{company has}} a long history of acquisitions. Coca-Cola {{acquired}} Minute Maid in 1960, the Indian cola brand Thums Up in 1993, and Barq's in 1995. In 2001, it acquired the Odwalla brand of fruit juices, smoothies, and bars for $181million. In 2007, it acquired Fuze Beverage from founder Lance Collins and Castanea Partners for an estimated $250million. The company's 2009 bid to buy a Chinese juice maker ended when China rejected its $2.4billion bid for the Huiyuan Juice Group, on the grounds the resulting company would be a virtual monopoly. Nationalism was also thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> for aborting the deal. In 1982, Coca-Cola purchased Columbia Pictures for $692 million. It sold the movie studio to Sony, for $3 billion, in 1989. In 2013, Coca-Cola finalized its purchase of ZICO, a coconut water company. In 2011, the Coca-Cola company bought the rest of the organic tea company Honest Tea, after buying a 40% stake in the company in 2008. In 2015, the company took a minority stake ownership in the cold pressed juice manufacturer, Suja Life LLC.|$|E
25|$|This could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> why {{environmental}} Kuznets curves {{have been}} found to be applicable to only certain types of pollutants. Yandle et al. argue that the EKC has not been found to apply to carbon because most pollutants create localized problems like lead and sulfur, so there is a greater urgency and response to cleaning up such pollutants. As a country develops, the marginal value of cleaning up such pollutants makes a large direct improvement to the quality of citizens' lives. Conversely, reducing carbon dioxide emissions does not have a dramatic impact at a local level, so the impetus to clean them up is only for the altruistic reason of improving the global environment. This becomes a tragedy of the commons where it is most efficient for everyone to pollute and for no one to clean up, and everyone is worse as a result (Hardin, 1968). Thus, even in a country like the US with a high level of income, carbon emissions are not decreasing in accordance with the EKC.|$|E
40|$|An action's {{illegality}} can <b>be</b> {{irrelevant to}} <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not to perform it. A plausible example of <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not to assault is that assault causes suffering. Since assault is illegal, the <b>reason</b> pertains to <b>a</b> legally proscribed action. Still, assault's illegality is irrelevant in this case: the reason would pertain (assault would cause suffering; {{we would have}} reason not to assault) even if assault were not legally proscribed. On the other hand, it appears that <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> can <b>be</b> one that derives from the interposition of law. This thesis is about reasons of this second type (legal reasons). In particular, it is about their formal features. For example, it is about their individuating conditions (when are p and q two legal reasons rather than one?) and about how legal reasons can be second-order rather than first-order (what follows when p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> not to have another reason figure in deliberation about action?). Most particularly, however, it is about their identity conditions (if p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason,</b> when and only when <b>is</b> p <b>a</b> legal <b>reason?).</b> I argue against three widely-accepted claims {{about the nature of}} legal reasons: (i) p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>reason</b> only if p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> content-independent <b>reason</b> (chapters 5 and 6); (ii) if p <b>is</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>reason</b> to ¢, p could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> complete <b>reason</b> to ¢ or a part of <b>a</b> complete <b>reason</b> to ¢ (chapters 2, 3 and 4); (iii) <b>a</b> legal <b>reason</b> p has <b>a</b> significant formal feature when p <b>is</b> <b>an</b> exclusionary <b>reason</b> (chapter 8). I also argue that one argument to the conclusion that analytical jurisprudence must pay special to attention moral legal <b>reasons</b> - <b>an</b> argument seen in recent work by R. <b>A.</b> Duff - <b>is</b> unconvincing (chapter 7) ...|$|R

25|$|Pursuit {{predation}} {{revolves around}} a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move {{to find new}} foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, dilution factor may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>reason</b> to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, dilution factor seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships {{can be used as}} support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also metapopulation persistence.|$|E
