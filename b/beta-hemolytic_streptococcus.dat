25|$|Infectious {{vulvovaginitis}} can {{be caused}} by group A <b>beta-hemolytic</b> <b>Streptococcus</b> (7-20% of cases), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella, Yersinia, or common STI organisms (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus). Symptoms and treatment of infectious vulvovaginitis vary depending on the organism causing it. Shigella infections of the reproductive tract usually coexist with infectious of the gastrointestinal tract and cause mucous, purulent discharge. They are treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

40|$|The Directigen Group A Strep Test (DGAST), a new rapid {{method of}} {{detecting}} group A <b>beta-hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> directly from throat swabs, was {{compared with a}} traditional culture technique {{for the detection of}} group A <b>beta-hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci.</b> Five hundred oropharyngeal swabs from pediatric and adult patients were cultured and then processed by using the DGAST. Of the 144 specimens positive by culture, 131 were DGAST positive (sensitivity, 90. 9 %). Of the 356 specimens negative by culture, 353 were DGAST negative (specificity, 99. 2 %). Twelve of the 13 false-negative DGAST results were from pediatric patients. One hundred isolates of non-group A <b>beta-hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> were recovered, primarily groups C, F, and G.

We performed {{an evaluation of}} inducible clindamycin resistance using an animal model as well as retrospectively reviewing the charts of patients treated with clindamycin monotherapy who were infected with <b>beta-hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> in-ducibly resistant to clindamycin. The neutropenic mouse thigh model of infection {{was used to evaluate}} the in vivo activity of clindamycin against <b>beta-hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci,</b> including isolates susceptible, inducibly resistant, or constitutively resistant to clindamycin. The clinical microbiology laboratory information system and pharmacy databases were cross-referenced to iden-tify patients with infections due to inducibly clindamycin-resistant <b>beta-hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> who were treated with clindamy-cin monotherapy. Medical records of these patients were reviewed to evaluate microbiologic and clinical outcomes. Inducible clindamycin resistance resulted in impaired killing of <b>beta-hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> in the animal model. Though suppressed ini-tially, compared to those with constitutive resistance (P 0. 0429), by 48 h, colony counts of inducibly clindamycin-resistant organisms were similar to those of constitutively resistant isolates (P 0. 1142). In addition, we identified 8 patients infected with inducibly clindamycin-resistant <b>beta-hemolytic</b> <b>streptococci</b> who experienced clinical andmicrobiologic failure when treated with clindamycin monotherapy.

5000|$|Streptococcus pyogenes is {{a species}} of Gram-positive {{bacteria}}. These bacteria are aerotolerant and an extracellular bacterium, made up of non-motile and non-sporing cocci. As expected with a streptococci, it is clinically important in human illness. It is an infrequent, but usually , part of the skin flora. It is the predominant species harboring the Lancefield group A antigen, and is often called group A streptococcus (GAS). However, both Streptococcus dysgalactiae and the Streptococcus anginosus group can possess group A antigen. Group A streptococci when grown on blood agar typically produces small zones of beta-hemolysis, a complete destruction of red blood cells. (A zone size of 2-3 mm is typical.)

A single throat culture has a sensitivity of 90-95% {{for the detection of}} GABHS (which means that GABHS is actually present 5-10% of the time culture suggests that it is absent). This small percentage of false-negative results are part of the characteristics of the tests used but are also possible if the patient has received antibiotics prior to testing. Identification requires 24 to 48 hours by culture but rapid screening tests (10-60 minutes), which have a sensitivity of 85-90%, are available.

Method: A prospective study with oropharynx samples from patients with Down syndrome and other mental disorders (test) and students from a private school (control) aged 5 - 15 years.
