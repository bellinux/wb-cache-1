50|$|Some {{scientists}} {{hypothesize that}} this ability {{could have come}} about as an evolutionary response to usurpation and parasitism. B. occidentalis suffer high rates of inter-specific and intra-specific usurpation. In addition, they also face invasion by the parasitic Psithyrus bees. It {{is possible that the}} recognition ability evolved in form of adaptions to them. Others argue that <b>brood</b> recognition <b>ability</b> is a byproduct of factors of B. occidentalis. For social wasps, like B. occidentalis, nestmate recognition is crucial. The queen might have just evolved to recognize unfamiliar odors, allowing them to also recognize foreign broods.|$|R

25|$|Hatch order usually {{follows the}} same {{sequence}} as laying order. Regardless of clutch size, eight is the typical maximum {{size of a}} brood. Egg desertion is a frequent occurrence among coots because females will often deposit more than eight eggs. Brood size limits incubation time, and when {{a certain number of}} chicks have hatched the remaining eggs are abandoned. The mechanism for egg abandonment has not yet been discovered. Food resource constraints may limit the number of eggs parents let hatch, or the remaining eggs may not provide enough visual or tactile stimulation to elicit incubation behavior. An American coot can be forced to hatch more eggs than are normally laid. These additional offspring, however, suffer higher mortality rates due to inadequacy in <b>brooding</b> or feeding <b>ability.</b>|$|R
40|$|Many animals live in {{societies}} of {{varying degrees of}} organization. Some individuals in these societies seem to sacrifice their own fitness to increase the fitness of some others. Understanding the forces that mould the evolution of such altruistic behaviour has become a dominant theme in modern evolutionary biology. Primitively eusocial polistine wasps provide excellent model systems to study the evolution of altruism as they show high degrees of plasticity in their behaviour. Different individuals in the same population pursue different social strategies such as nesting alpne or nesting in groups. When wasps nest in groups, usually only one individual becomes the egg layer, while die rest {{assume the role of}} sterile workers. Why do the workers not become solitary foundresses and rear their own offspring instead of working to rear the brood of another individual? Here I have used the tropical primitively eusocial wasp Ropalidia marginata to explore some factors that might potentially favour the worker strategy over the solitary founding strategy. Workers in multiple foundress nests may benefit by rearing brood more closely related to them than their own offspring would be. However, from previous work on this species it is known that relatedness between sisters is rather low and that workers therefore rear quite distantly related brood. Therefore, I have concentrated on factors other than genetic relatedness that might potentially favour the worker strategy. A total of 145 naturally initiated nests with different numbers of foundresses was monitored over a period of 16 months, and their productivities were compared. Although the total colony productivity increased, the per capita productivity did not increase with increasing foundress numbers. Colonies with larger foundress numbers did not produce significantly heavier progeny and did not produce them significantly faster than colonies with fewer individuals. The conspecific usurpers preferred to usurp single foundress colonies more often than multiple foundress colonies. Therefore, protection from conspecific usurpers might be an advantage of multiple foundress associations. About 10 % of the multiple foundress nests experienced queen turnovers. This provides a finite chance to reproduce and gain some individual fitness for workers, at some future point of time. Wasps may not be similar in their reproductive abilities and those who are less fertile might be joining others who are more fertile. Testing such a hypothesis would require that individuals who have chosen to be subordinate cofoundresses in multiple foundress associations are forced to nest alone. During this study a total of 77 nests was monitored. Cofoundresses forced to nest alone had significantly lower productivity than natural solitary foundresses and also queens of multiple foundress nests who were forced to nest alone. This suggested that wasps are not similar either in their reproductive <b>ability</b> or <b>brood</b> rearing <b>ability</b> or both. To ascertain which of the factors was responsible for lower productivity in cofoundresses, productivity of wasps isolated into laboratory cages was compared. There {{was no significant difference in}} the productivity of isolated cofoundresses and isolated queens. This suggests that wasps are not subfertile per se but probably differ in their foraging and <b>brood</b> rearing <b>abilities.</b> The certainty with which resources are brought into the nest and therefore, the certainty with which the mean per capita productivity is attained, provides an automatic benefit of group living according to the central limit theorem. This prediction was also tested. The coefficient of variation of mean per capita productivity decreased significantly with increasing foundress numbers. Behavioural observations on another 36 colonies, with different number of adults, showed that the coefficient of variation of food brought to the nest and the rate at which larvae were fed, decreased significantly with increasing number of adults. A computer simulation was used to find out the effect of group size on the variance in feed larva. Assuming that larvae cannot be starved for too long and cannot utilize more than a certain amount of food at a time, the fitness of larvae was found to increase with an increase in the number of adults attending the nest. Previous work on R. marginata has been largely confined to postemergence colonies. An attempt was made to look at and compare social organization in preemergence colonies with that of postemergence colonies. It was found that the egg layer was not the most dominant animal in the well-established preemergence colonies. There were no detectable differences in the social organization of the preemergence colonies (of this study) with that of postemergence colonies of the earlier studies. Perhaps my conclusions drawn from studying preemergence colonies are therefore applicable more widely to the species. It can be concluded that the apparent increased fitness of the worker strategy over solitary foundress strategy does not come from any increase in per capita productivity, but comes instead from (i) the greater predictability with which the mean per capita productivity is attained in larger colonies, (ii) the lower probabilities of usurpation of larger colonies, (iii) queen turnovers that provide opportunities for workers in multiple foundress colonies to gain some direct individual fitness and (iv) the lower <b>brood</b> rearing <b>abilities</b> of workers in multiple foundress nests that make the worker strategy the best of a bad job...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{reproduce}} successfully, a {{honey bee}} colony has to rear brood efficiently. This requires a fecund queen and {{depends on the}} coordinated activities of workers in brood care, in foraging, and in maintaining inner nest homeostasis. Maintaining homeostasis involves thermal regulation of the brood area and providing {{a steady supply of}} nutrients, which requires building food reserves during favorable weather so that the brood can be well fed even during times of low nutritional influx. The workforce of adult bees is appropriately divided among the required tasks, and the wax comb itself is spatially organized in a way that saves energy and supports <b>brood</b> nursing. The <b>ability</b> to achieve this homeostasis results from a set of individual behaviors and communication processes performed in parallel by thousands of bees. In this review, we discuss these proximate individual mechanisms that lead to the precise regulation of the complex system that is a honey bee society...|$|R
50|$|In M. genalis, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that foundresses practice sex allocation in their offspring. In a foundress's first brood, she rears offspring that are either all males or some males and some females but never only females. Of those foundresses who rear a male-only first brood, {{there is a possibility that}} they rear a brood later on with female eggs, but they would not exhibit social behavior. In broods with both females and males, 76% of the females stay past 10 days of birth in their natal nest in order to become a worker bee for their mother and the other 24% find their own nests. Therefore, in this facultatively social species, a foundress who rears a first brood of males only is considered solitary, while a foundress who rears both males and females in its first <b>brood</b> has the <b>ability</b> to be social. The males in the brood usually leave the nest after 4 days of emerging in order to mate. The population sex ratio can therefore be seen as male-biased in both solitary and social colonies.|$|R
40|$|The {{ecological}} {{conditions under which}} bumble bees hibernate have been investigated and differences noted {{in the type of}} site chosen for overwintering by certain species. Queens were most often found 8 cm. below the surface, but the depths at which hibernacula are constructed vary according to soil conditions. Spring soil temperatures in hibernacular positions typical of early-emerging species such as Bombus lucorum (Linn.) show higher daily maxima than temperatures in positions typical of later-emerging species such as B. lapidarius (Linn.). The characteristics of the adult fat body of bumblebees are described, with particular reference to queens. Both fat and glycogen, but not protein, are stored in the trophocytes. In queens about to enter hibernation, fat forms 34 [percent] of their total dry weight. The utilization of both fat body reserves and honey stomach contents during hibernation, particularly in the autumn, has been demonstrated. Investigations of natural incipient colonies of bumblebees have shown that 1 st brood adults produced may be divided into two groups according to size. Typically, the larger individuals develop in the centre of the brood clumps and are the first adults to emerge. The number of eggs laid in incipient colonies varies according to the species. In B. agrorum (Fabr.), for example, 8 eggs and in B. hortorum (Linn.) 12 to 14 eggs aregenerally laid. The immature stages of Syntretus splendidus (Marshall), a gregarious endoparasite of adult bumblebees, are described and an account given of its life history. Five larval instars have been recognized. In the late spring and early summer of 1967, the incidence of parasitism among foraging bumblebee queens exceeded 17 [percent], and in foraging workers. The <b>brood</b> rearing <b>ability</b> of parasitized queens is impared and parasitic castration occurs. The host dies shortly after the emergence of the full-grown parasite larvae from its body. <p...|$|R
40|$|Choosing where {{offspring}} {{will develop}} {{is especially important}} for insects whose larval stages are restricted to a particular host resource. In such insects, maternal egg laying decisions may not only involve choosing optimal hosts based on their intrinsic qualities but also avoiding hosts occupied by conspecific <b>brood.</b> The <b>ability</b> to discriminate between previously exploited and unexploited hosts is often mediated by the use of a marking pheromone. Despite engaging in what appears to be host-marking behavior, the walnut fly Rhagoletis juglandis prefers to deposit clutches into previously exploited hosts. In this dissertation, I quantified host reuse in R. juglandis and assessed its impacts on offspring fitness. I also explored the role that marking pheromone plays in level of reuse. Host reuse by the walnut fly was common in the field, where trees were synchronously infested over a 14 - 17 day period. It was not unusual for individual fruit to bear 40 - 80 eggs; given that females laid clutches of ca. 16 eggs, each oviposition puncture probably contained ca. 1. 6 clutches. The overall number of eggs deposited into fruit was positively correlated with fruit volume. Field and laboratory experiments showed that increases in larval densities within fruit reduced larval survival and pupal weight, the latter being strongly correlated with the number of eggs a female produced over her lifetime. The temporal staggering of clutches strongly and negatively impacted survival of later clutches. The effect of spatial patterning of clutches on offspring fitness depended on the number of clutches in the fruit: at higher densities, clutches performed better when deposited into the same puncture than when distributed uniformly over fruit. The evidence taken together suggests that host reuse by the walnut fly, R. juglandis, reduces per capita offspring fitness. Consistent with this inference was a final set of observations on female host-marking behavior. In field-cage experiments, fruit that were marked by females for longer durations were less acceptable to other females. Moreover, the duration of time that a female marked a fruit was positively correlated with the size of her clutch. These results indicate that, while females commonly reuse fruit, they nevertheless signal the level of larval competition associated with a fruit and adjust allocation of eggs to fruit accordingly...|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies done using this species of water bug. Food web and habitat studies have used B. flumineum as the {{predation}} pressure for tadpoles and observed the difference between vegetated areas and non vegetated ares when looking at the survival rate of tadpoles. They found that the tadpoles survived better in highly vegetated area even though those areas tended to have more predators in them. Other studies used B. flumineum as a predation pressure on snails to see if they would change their susceptibility though ontogeny. and as a stress inducer on amphibians to see if that would make them more susceptible to disease. The other main area of research done using this species was on factors that influence paternal care. Crowl and Alexander studied the potential costs of males brooding, specifically if <b>brooding</b> effected their <b>ability</b> to forage for food. They did get results that suggested that brooding males could not catch faster prey such as small fish as well as females or non brooding males could and thus it does have a foraging effect. Gilg and Kruse wanted to test if reproduction decreased life span and they chose B. flumineum because both the female and male have relatively high costs of reproduction. The females require a lot of energy to make such large eggs and then the males spend energy brooding eggs and are more exposed to predators. They did find statistically significant differences between the life spans of virgin and breeding in both males and females.|$|R
40|$|Worker {{policing}} (any behavior {{performed by}} workers that reduces reproduction by other workers) via egg eating {{has been observed}} in three species of honey bee (Apis mellifera, A. cerana, and A. florea). The maternity of drones of the giant honey bee A. dorsata (n = 660) was determined using DNA microsatellite analysis. None carried markers from the queen's mates indicating that none was a worker's son. In addition, dissection of 1, 902 workers from 8 colonies showed that none had activated ovaries indicating that worker sterility is usual. Worker policing behavior involves costs when police workers make errors: removing eggs laid by a queen or failing to remove worker-laid eggs. We develop a model that examines {{the effect of these}} costs on the acceptance threshold of eggs. The model shows that costs may be reduced by any cues that help police workers distinguish worker-laid and queen-laid eggs. Once such cue may be the use of unique cells for rearing drones and workers. Unlike other Apis, A. dorsata rear both workers and drones in the same-size cells with the drone brood scattered among worker <b>brood.</b> Thus, the <b>ability</b> of A. dorsata workers to detect and eliminate (police) worker-laid eggs may be associated with higher costs than in other species. Our model suggests that these higher costs may select for a more permissive egg-acceptance threshold, because of the costs of erroneously removing queen-laid eggs, leading to greater worker reproduction. However our empirical results suggest that worker reproduction is very low in the species, suggesting that worker policing is efficient and that police workers have no difficulty in distinguishing queen-laid and worker-laid eggs...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The flight {{behavior}} of Ips confusus (Lec.) was primarily studied under field conditions, but augmented with complementary laboratory studies whenever feasible. The experiments were mostly conducted {{in areas of}} endemic population levels, but also under epidemic and prairie conditions. The techniques and devices used in marking, releasing, attracting, and trapping of the test beetles {{in the field are}} described in detail. The flight {{behavior of}} Ips confusus under laboratory conditions were studied by means of flight bars, standardized flight mills, and a laboratory olfactometer that incorporated flying scolytids. Flight behavior was also observed under restricted flying conditions as found in a large flight arena and in a 27 cubic meter screened cage. By attracting Ips confusus to baited field olfactometers over short distances, it was possible to observe the entire flight from take-off to subsequent response and landing. From these studies the following conclusions can be made: Beetles take-off with the wind and respond against it. The responses to attractants occur immediately, indicating that flight exercise is not a prerequisite in the response of this species. When Ips confusus are attracted, over longer distances (i. e., 500 meters) they clearly respond against the wind. The distance over which the beetles responded directly and in appreciable proportions was between 500 and 1000 meters. The relative attractiveness of the test material depend on the intensity of attack and on the age of the material. Responding beetles aggregate in greater numbers on the strongest attractive source. Beetles released from either end of an attractant gradient respond in greater proportions to the strongest attractant, regardless of wind direction. By measuring the wind at various heights it was noted that Ips confusus response flights were densest in the regions of the least wind. When relatively high winds prevail, the flights are restricted practically to ground level. Light conditions seem to have little influence on response flights except that direct solar radiation seems to be avoided. Both released beetles and the field population exhibit diurnal response patterns that apparently are temperature dependent. The ability to respond to attractants was found to vary from beetle to beetle, with sex, within a brood, and from population to population. Beetles which had responded once (termed responding beetles) repeatedly responded better than unselected, freshly emerged beetles (termed emerging beetles). This heterogeneity in response was due to the response ability of individuals rather than to their flight capacity. Females and responding beetles are superior in response over distances greater than 25 meters, but males and emerging beetles respond in larger proportions over distances up to 25 meters. Within the rime <b>brood,</b> the <b>ability</b> to respond decreases from the first developing beetles to the later emerging individuals. There also seem to be large differences in the response ability among various populations. These findings suggest that the differences are due to physiological condition of beetles and populations rather than to inherited. abilities. Further studies are suggested on the possible influence of various host materials on beetle development The relative ability of beetles to respond to attractants {{can be used as a}} criterion of their physiological performances...|$|R
