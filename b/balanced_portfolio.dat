40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{international}} spillover effects of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) using a two-country dynamic stochastic general-equilibrium model with nominal and real rigidities, and <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> effects. <b>Portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> effects arise from imperfect substitution between short- and long-term bond portfolios in each country, {{as well as}} between domestic and foreign bonds within these portfolios. We show that LSAPs lower both domestic and foreign long-term yields, and stimulate economic activity in both countries. International spillover effects become larger as the steady-state share of long-term U. S. bond holdings increases in the rest-of-the-world portfolio, as the elasticity of substitution between short- and long-term bonds decreases, or as the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign bonds increases. We also find that U. S. asset purchases that generate the same output effect as U. S. conventional monetary policy have larger international spillover effects. This is because <b>portfolio</b> <b>balance</b> effects appear to be stronger under unconventional policy, and foreigners' U. S. bond holdings are heavily weighted toward long-term bonds...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{a theory of}} {{development}} that links the degree of market incompleteness to capital accumulation and growth. Because sectoral indivisibilities limit the extent of diversification, poor economies suffer higher volatility of growth and endogenously lower productivity. As the economy develops, agents hold more <b>balanced</b> <b>portfolios</b> and can take better advantage of high-return production opportunities. Although all agents are price takers {{and there are no}} technological spillovers, the decentralized equilibrium is inefficient because individuals do not internalize the impact of their investment decisions on others' diversification opportunities. The results generalize to economies with international capital flows. Copyright 1997 by the University of Chicago. ...|$|R
