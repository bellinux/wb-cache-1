5|$|Tessa Ludwick (born October 5, 1988) is a Korean American actress from Apollo Beach, Florida. She began acting at age five, {{when she}} held a lead role in Allegra's Window, a Nick Jr. children's {{television}} program show taped at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida. When filming on Allegra's Window ended in May 1996, seven-year-old Ludwick went from Allegra's Window to a lead role in <b>Big</b> <b>Bag,</b> a live action television puppet program for preschoolers on the Cartoon Network. At 8, she landed the role of Kate, an orphan girl in the touring Broadway musical Annie, the 20th Anniversary. For the next eight months, she toured the United States and Canada with the musical, during which time Ludwick gave eight performances per week.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to {{what looks like a}} baby, but is {{actually}} a <b>big</b> <b>bag</b> of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features a group of people of Asian heritage, who walk down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to change}} the way Sandvik Coromant handles their chip managment system. The need arose when a larger project, {{involving}} the implementation of AGV (automatic guided vehicles) fork lifts to handle all the internal transports of goods. This forced Sandvik Coromant {{to change the}} current system of transporting metal chips. The work started with three days orientation in the factory. This was mainly {{to get a sense of}} how the chip managment system works today and what kind of solutions that could work given the circumstances. Idea generation resulted in a number of candidates, where only one was found to be realistically implementable, namely having the AGVs transport <b>big</b> <b>bags</b> placed on EUR pallets. Tests were conducted which showed that the <b>big</b> <b>bags</b> leak cutting fluid along the seams. Discussions have been established with suppliers regarding having specially made <b>big</b> <b>bags</b> which would be waterproof. If it is not possible to find waterproof <b>big</b> <b>bags</b> there are complimentary equipment that solves the problem discussed in Chapter 11 Recommendations...|$|R
500|$|Ludwick {{was drawn}} away in 1997 from <b>Big</b> <b>Bag</b> {{to act in}} the role of Kate in Annie, the 20th Anniversary, the Broadway musical on tour revival of the 1977 Broadway theatre {{production}} of Annie. The Annie, the 20th Anniversary tour spanned the United States and Canada from October 1997 through June 1998, during which time Ludwick gave eight performances per week. The Buffalo News noted that her November 1997 performance as the orphan girl Kate at Buffalo, New York's Shea's Performing Arts Center crafted a personality for the character whose [...] "naturalness [...] that of the original Broadway cast." [...] Characterized at that time as [...] "bright, bubbly and [...] a sparkle wherever she goes," [...] Ludwick additionally made the honor roll in Hillsborough County's program for gifted students in 1998. A year later, Ludwick became a spokesperson for Kids with a Cause, a youth organization based in California dedicated to improving {{the quality of life of}} children who suffer from poverty, lack of education, or health-related issues.|$|E

[...] He cooked his supper, but ghosts appeared and put their hands all in his food; {{when he began to}} eat it, he had terrible diarrhea. [...] This happened night after night, until he created a san or sangwaa, twisted pieces of grass tied into a knot in the middle. [...] The ghosts wouldn't touch the food protected by this item, and he could enjoy his food in peace. [...] Even today, this object can be seen employed in various ways as a ward against evil or, in the case of offerings, food rot. (Okinawa Folk Stories, 46–54) ...|$|E

60|$|Pretty soon {{all were}} in the bag but one, a willful little Breeze, who was not quite ready to go home; {{he wanted to play}} just a little longer. He danced ahead of Old Mother West Wind. He kissed the sleepy daisies. He shook the nodding buttercups. He set all the little poplar leaves a dancing, too, and he wouldn't come into the <b>big</b> <b>bag.</b> So Old Mother West Wind closed the <b>big</b> <b>bag</b> and slung it over her shoulder.

40|$|Modified atmospheres (MA) {{based on}} high carbon dioxide (CO₂) {{contents}} {{offer an alternative}} to synthetic chemical fumigation for insect pest control in food commodities during storage and shipment processes. The present study aimed to establish the efficacy of using CO₂ in <b>big</b> <b>bags</b> and containers to prevent pests’ development. Four trials were conducted with gastight <b>big</b> <b>bags</b> (900 x 900 x 1000 or 1600 cm). Two of these trials were conducted with polished rice and samples of Sitophilus oryzae, one trial with chamomile infested with Lasioderma serricorne and one trial with cocoa and samples of Tribolium confusum and Ephestia kuehniella. Initial contents of CO₂ were higher than 75 %, which decreased depending on exposure time (13 to 90 d) and food product. In all four trials the insects present in the infested samples were controlled with the MA. An additional trial was conducted in a 9 m container containing dried herbs in boxes, <b>big</b> <b>bags</b> and other packaging formats. Twelve infested samples of L. serricorne and Plodia interpunctella were distributed uniformly {{at the bottom and}} top of the container. A concentration between 70 % and 15 % CO₂ was maintained for an exposure time of 18 d. In spite of the decrease in CO₂ content, the treatment was also effective to control all insects present in the samples. Our results confirmed that CO₂ could be applied to food products during the storage in <b>big</b> <b>bags</b> and containers to control the occurrence of pests...|$|R

40|$|An Investigation {{was carried}} out to note the {{survival}} and growth rate of eucalyptus saplings planted in salt affected and hypoxia areas with plastic container bags totally removed compared to base only removed. The soil used was highly saline sodic in nature with wide variation in electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECe), pHs and sodium adsorption rate (SAR) within the field. At Basti Thabal, Pindi Bhattian site half acre of eucalyptus was transplanted with <b>bigger</b> <b>bags,</b> half acre with original smaller bags and three and half kanals of eucalyptus were transplanted at Jalalpur Kangra. Survival rate data was collected fifteen days after transplanting of tree seedlings. While height and girth data was recorded within 15 - 25 days after transplantation. The results showed that survival rate of eucalyptus was more than 82 % at Jalalpur Kangra while survival rate was more in smaller <b>bags</b> than <b>bigger</b> <b>bags</b> at Pindi Bhattian site. The treatment effect remained nonsignificant. The gain in height was more than 84 cm in case of <b>bigger</b> <b>bags</b> at Pindi Bhattian, more than 73 cm at Jalalpur Kangra and more than 47 cm incase of smaller bags at Pindi Bhattian site. However treatment effect remained nonsignificant at all the sites. The gain in girth was more than 1. 20 cm at Jalalpur Kangra, 0. 90 cm in case of <b>bigger</b> <b>bags</b> while more than 0. 34 cm in case of smaller bags at Pindi Bhattian site. The treatment effect was again nonsignificant at all the sites. In case of root proliferation, tap root length was more at Jalalpur Kangra and Pindi Bhattian (<b>bigger</b> <b>bags)</b> while lateral root length was more in case of smaller bags at Pindi Bhattian site and treatment was observed nonsignificant. There was a slight improvement in ECe, pHs and SAR of soil in the plough layer only indicating that salts were leached down only at Jalalpur Kangra. While at Pindi Bhattian site the ECe, pHs and SAR were increased due to the eroded soil by rain that brought salt to this low lying area. The results lead to conclude that eucalyptus plantation in salt affected soils has some ameliorative effects on soil chemical characteristics...|$|R
