5|$|The {{issue of}} {{improving}} navigation along the Kentucky River was raised numerous times by Representative James Blue during the 1876 legislative session. Despite Blue's promises of manifold {{benefits to the}} state from such an investment, parsimonious legislators defeated a bill allocating funds for the improvements. The issue gained traction with some voters during the biennial legislative elections, however, which brought it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in the 1878 session. Prompted by recommendations from the Kentucky River Navigation Convention in 1877, McCreary abandoned his typical fiscal conservatism and joined the calls for improvements along the river. In response, legislators passed a largely ineffective bill providing that, if funds could be raised through special taxes in districts along the river, the state would provide the funds to maintain the improvements.|$|E

She has also appeared on the ITV1 show , and in 2007, she was one of 12 well known individuals to serve on a jury in a fictional rape case in the BBC TV project The Verdict, which show received a number of mixed reviews.|$|E
25|$|The 80th {{floor of}} the {{original}} design was planned to be an observation deck, {{the first one in}} Miami. The complex was later redesigned as two 70-floor towers, with the main tower being all office space, hence taller. The shorter tower was to be all hotel space. The current design goes back to a single mixed-use tower with 80 floors on a large podium with the top floors being office space and the bottom being hotel or residential space. The observation deck {{can be seen in the}} schematic diagram. Two FECR published sources have gone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> count of 80 with the 1,010-foot design, and renderings of this design from 2009 show an observation deck, as well as the Metromover connection, in the blueprints.|$|E
50|$|In each episode, {{the three}} of them would descend in the lift from their flat in the tower block. After their adventures they would return home, Midge would press the button for <b>the</b> lift <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> correct <b>floor,</b> by {{standing}} on Mungo's nose.|$|R
60|$|At {{the head}} of the {{stairway}} he paused and looked curiously about him.

Every door that he found in the house was painted green.|$|R
50|$|Water {{diverted}} from Mingus Creek via a sluice (canal) and a wooden flume turns two turbines which provide power <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mill. An iron shaft connects <b>the</b> turbines <b>to</b> grindstones on <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> and a wheat cleaner and bolting chest on <b>the</b> second <b>floor</b> (<b>the</b> latter two via {{a series of}} pulleys). Wheat or corn is first transported by bucket belt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wheat cleaner, which is essentially a fan which clears the grain of dirt and excess material, and then drops it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> cleaned grain is then fed into the grindstones, which break it down into flour (or cornmeal). The flour is then transported <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second <b>floor</b> and fed into the bolting chest, which uses bolts of progressively coarser cloth <b>to</b> separate <b>the</b> flour into different grades.|$|R
25|$|As seen on Hart's documentary, Hart {{proceeded}} to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who pleaded {{that he knew}} nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged. McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, known as The Undertaker, furious with McMahon, banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told he had to apologize to Hart. As recounted in Michaels' autobiography, he was told by McMahon not to say anything about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on Raw and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart. Hart {{proceeded to}} the dressing room to shower and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Remus had locked themselves in McMahon's office. When McMahon went to Hart's dressing room and tried to explain himself, Hart angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched. An altercation ensued, with Hart giving McMahon a single punch, dropping him to the floor. Although Vince's son, Shane McMahon, and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences. Hart angrily asked McMahon {{if he was going to}} screw him on the pay he was still owed, to which a groggy McMahon replied in the negative. In the hallway outside the dressing rooms, Hart's then-wife Julie angrily confronted Triple H and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart. McMahon had a black eye and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince off the floor and Vince rolling his ankle once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on WWE Confidential that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince's foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet immediately sprained his ankle and sent him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco's action as a 'comedy.' Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship between The Undertaker and Edge. The match went {{in and out of}} the ring early on, with both {{competitors}} throwing each other out of the ring. The Undertaker instinctively tried to apply the triangle choke hold on Edge, but the referee made him break the hold. Edge then tried to do one of Undertaker's moves, Old school, but Undertaker countered. Mid-way in the match, Edge's associates, Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder, distracted Undertaker after performing an Old school on Edge. This distraction led Edge to remove the top turnbuckle padding. Back and forth action was seen between the two individuals. As the top turnbuckle was exposed, the Undertaker executed Snake Eyes on Edge. As the Undertaker ran off the ropes, Edge performed a Spear for a near-fall. Afterwards, the Undertaker clotheslined Edge to the outside of the ring, then rolled to the floor after. Undertaker threw Edge over the barricade to the front row with a clothesline while the referee began the 10-count. Both men struggled <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and the Undertaker tackled Edge into the barricade at the eight count. He then rolled into the ring to win the match by countout and the belt. After the match, Vickie Guerrero announced that Undertaker hadn't won the title as it can only be won by pinfall or submission, leaving the title vacant. Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Edge.|$|E
2500|$|Myanmar National Education Law (...) , {{enacted on}} 30 September 2014, is {{designed}} to reform the countryâ€™s outdated education system. Drafted in March 2014, the bill was passed after being sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> by President Thein Sein with 25 proposed changes, 19 of which were accepted. From the beginning of its drafting process, the law faced criticism from students and teachers unions as well as various civil society groups. Concerns over the law later turned into protests, which were eventually cracked down by the government.|$|E
50|$|Contender and gladiator {{climb up}} a giant pole and must use only their body weight to {{traverse}} across four other similar poles, before grabbing a giant ring <b>to</b> fly <b>back</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> If <b>the</b> contender wins, they will score ten points, if the gladiator wins, the contender scores a point for every pole they have successfully traversed.|$|R
60|$|The stay {{below was}} so small in {{diameter}} that all Roger could do was to cling to it {{with both hands and}} one leg. In this position he hung until Dave let himself down several feet and managed to give him a hand. Then with extreme caution both worked their way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unfinished <b>flooring</b> of <b>the</b> bridge.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydrophone}} must {{be positioned}} below the thermocline layer which reflects sounds, either <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> surface or <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean <b>floor.</b> Since <b>the</b> pinger signal is relatively weak, the hydrophone must be within about one nautical mile (6076 ft) <b>to</b> detect it. <b>The</b> hydrophone is typically deployed about 1000 ft above <b>the</b> ocean <b>floor,</b> {{where it can}} scan a swath approximately 12000 ft wide, on a flat, level surface.|$|R

6000|$|Soon {{after this}} I {{returned}} to my seat; the cone was lifted {{high into the air}} silently, broken apart, and then, with the small end jangling inside the larger one, was carried over the table and <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> It fell with a bang that seemed final and decisive. [...] "That is 'good-bye,'" [...] said Mrs. Smiley.|$|E

25|$|Auvinen then reentered <b>the</b> school, went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor,</b> {{and began}} walking around, {{knocking}} on classroom doors. He then managed to enter an occupied comprehensive-school classroom. Inside, he shouted orders {{at some of the}} students, proclaimed a revolution, and urged <b>the</b> students <b>to</b> destroy school property. Despite firing two shots at a television set and a window, Auvinen left the classroom without shooting anyone.|$|R

500|$|By 1983, {{the club}} {{was known as the}} New Smalls Paradise. [...] This version of Smalls Paradise offered {{everything}} from music and dancing to craft shows and political speeches. By 1986, the club, which was the longest-operating night club in Harlem, had fallen vacant. Before its closure it had undergone a transition from a jazz to a disco club. Just prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club's demise, the New York Swing Dance Society brought <b>the</b> Lindy Hop <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dance <b>floor</b> at Smalls.|$|R

5000|$|Apart {{from this}} main bank of lifts, {{there are a}} series of [...] "connecting" [...] lifts to take people between the groups. Unlike the main lifts, these are not the {{double-decker}} type. Two lifts are provided to take people from levels 37/38 to levels 41/42 (levels 39 and 40 are not accessible as office space). This spares someone in {{the lower half of the}} building from having <b>to</b> go <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper half of the building.|$|R
50|$|It was July 1974 {{before the}} Glomar and the Barge began the raising attempt. When the section was lifted about 3000 ft off the seabed, {{one of the}} claws broke, {{followed}} by a collapse and shattering of the entire section. All but a small portion - some 10 percent of the original sub - fell <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> lost portions included the items most desired by the intelligence community. Six bodies were in the recovered section, and were given a formal burial at sea.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{abyssal species}} in the abyssal order Elasipodida have evolved to a [...] "benthopelagic" [...] behaviour: their body is nearly the same density as the water around them, {{so they can make}} long jumps (up to 1000 m high), before falling slowly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean <b>floor.</b> Most of them have {{specific}} swimming appendages, such as some kind of umbrella (like Enypniastes), or a long lobe on top of the body (Psychropotes). Only one species is known as a true completely pelagic species, that never comes close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom: Pelagothuria natatrix.|$|R
50|$|The {{bill was}} {{assigned}} to the Senate Public Works Committee which quickly reported it <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> for a vote.

In the House of Representatives, the bill {{was assigned to}} the House Public Works Committee and reported <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> on September 22, 1965. However, due to pressure on members from special interest groups, the bill languished on the floor while its sponsors tried to garner support. At the urging of President Lyndon Johnson, the bill was passed by a vote of 245 to 138 at 1:00 am on October 8. The House version was subsequently passed by the Senate on October 13.|$|E

5000|$|U.S. Major General Roland Lajoie stated that, {{according}} to a briefing he received by the CIA, during recovery operations, Clementine suffered a catastrophic failure, causing two-thirds of the already raised portion of K-129 <b>to</b> sink <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ocean <b>floor.</b> Former Lockheed and Hughes Global Marine employees {{who worked on the}} operation have stated that several of the [...] "claws" [...] intended <b>to</b> grab <b>the</b> submarine fractured, possibly because they were manufactured from maraging steel, which is very strong, but not very ductile compared with other kinds of steel.|$|R
60|$|The maid at the door, {{who knew}} nothing of the wild {{reputation}} of the Haneys, guided them up-stairs to their respective dressing-rooms, and helped to remove their wraps so expeditiously that {{they were on their}} way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> before any other guests arrived.

50|$|<b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Floor</b> is {{a reality}} {{television}} series broadcast on BBC2 in the late 1990s and early 2000s in which CEOs or top level managers went undercover in their organisations and took a junior/entry level job in their company. This gave them much to think about during the exercise and learn how their company really works, what the industry is like, and what their employees really think of them.|$|E
50|$|Winston {{was made}} a Boston Terrier for three main reasons. The filmmakers wanted a breed that {{does not appear in}} any prior Disney film. The breed is small so that he can be shown being {{promoted}} to a chair at the table and demoted <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Because of the flat style of the film, a breed with distinct markings like the Boston Terrier helps cue the audience to subtle movements.|$|E
