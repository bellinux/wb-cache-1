50|$|Also {{referred}} to as <b>Bioresource</b> Engineering: <b>Bioresource</b> engineering {{is related to the}} applications of biological engineering, chemical engineering and agricultural engineering usually based on biological and/or agricultural feedstocks. <b>Bioresource</b> engineering is more general and encompasses a wider range of technologies and various elements such as biomass, biological waste treatment, bioenergy, biotransformations and <b>bioresource</b> systems analysis, and technologies associated with Thermochemical conversion technologies: combustion, pyrolysis, gasification, catalysis, etc. Biochemical conversion technologies: aerobic methods, anaerobic digestion, microbial growth processes, enzymatic methods, composting Products: fibre, fuels, feedstocks, fertilisers, building materials, polymers and other industrial products Management: modelling, systems analysis, decisions, support systems. The impact of urbanization and increasing demand for land, food, and water presents engineers in a world with serious challenges. Little attention has been given to the interface between the biological world and traditional engineering in the past. It is the job of <b>bioresource</b> engineers to fill that gap. Agricultural and <b>bioresource</b> engineers develop efficient and environmentally-sensitive methods of producing food, fiber, timber, bio-based products and renewable energy sources for an ever-increasing world population.|$|E
