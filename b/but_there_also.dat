500|$|Upon the {{dismissal}} of Heiden, Himmler assumed the position of Reichsführer-SS with Hitler's approval in January 1929. There are differing accounts {{of the reason for}} this dismissal. The party merely announced that it was for [...] "family reasons". It was also suggested at the time that {{the dismissal}} was due to Heiden associating with Jews. [...] Since 1928, Heiden was co-owner of a clothing supply business that sold uniforms to the SS. Another company in Munich supplied Heiden and his partner with the pants which were used for the SS uniforms. It was discovered that this other company was owned by a Jew. Further, it was alleged that Heiden had been making large profits on the clothing sales to the SS for uniforms. This led to Heiden having to resign as head of the SS. Historian Adrian Weale says that the dismissal was probably because he was ineffective in the job, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>also</b> were rumors that he was a police informer. Himmler's biographer Peter Longerich says that beyond the official announcement [...] "we have no further clues to explain either Heiden's dismissal or Himmler's appointment". Under Himmler the SS greatly expanded over time, with his ultimate aim being the one to turn it into the most powerful organization in Germany.|$|E

[...] Ironically, he and the Nosotros Foundation were instrumental in taking roles away from Nico Minardos, a Greek-American actor who in the 1970s often played Latino roles because of his appearance and accent. Minardos similarly became outspoken and, according to his agent and others, it cost him a recurring role as a Mexican mayor in an episode of Alias Smith and Jones.|$|E

During the reign of Maximinus, Rome had suffered the loss of considerable territories in Mesopotamia to Ardashir which the Roman Emperor had been unable to prevent or avenge because of his internal distractions: on his accession, Shapur renewed the onslaught, capturing more of the Mesopotamian fortresses and penetrating Syria itself where Antioch, the capital of the Roman east may have come under threat.
