50|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{woven fabrics}} are fabrics {{that could be}} formed to near net shape with considerable thickness. There {{is no need for}} layering to create a part, because a single fabric provides the full three-dimensional reinforcement. The 3-D woven fabric is a variant of the 2D weaving process, and it’s an extension of the very old technique of creating double and triple woven cloth. 3D weaving allows the production of fabrics up to 10 cm in thickness.Fibers placed in the thickness direction are called z-yarn, warp weaver, or <b>binder</b> <b>yarn</b> for 3D woven fabrics. More than one layer of fabric is woven at the same time, and z-yarn interlaces warp and woof yarns of different layers during the process. At the end of the weaving process, an integrated 3D woven structure, which has a considerable thickness, is produced. Three-dimensional woven structures can create composite materials with fiber volume fractions around 50% in both 3D unit cell and 3D orthogonal structures.|$|E
40|$|A study {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the theoretical models of the fancy yarns. The investigated fancy yarns are of traditional structure, i. e., their effect intermediate product composed of two yarns as well as of complex structure – their effect intermediate product made of three yarns. The analysis is done using two theoretical methods for predicting the coil length of the <b>binder</b> <b>yarn</b> in the fancy yarn. Theoretical values of the coil length of the <b>binder</b> <b>yarn</b> of 29 types of investigated fancy yarns are compared with the experimental data. The experimental comparison was performed for various structure fancy yarns specially manufactured for this investigation and using data presented by the other authors. The comparison between the calculated coil length values and experimental data shows good agreement for 21 results (according to the 1 st and 2 nd method). Here the deviations not exceed 5 %. The developed analysis showed that the both theoretical methods could be used for the predicting of the geometrical indices of the fancy yarns, still the method satisfying the requirement of the precondition about the circle shaped cross-section of the effect intermediate product is more precise in many cases...|$|E
40|$|A common {{method to}} {{fabricate}} net-shaped three-dimensional (3 D) woven preforms for composite T-joints is to weave flat 3 D preforms via a standard weaving machine with variation in <b>binder</b> <b>yarn</b> path and then separate the preform {{in the form}} of a bifurcation. Folding introduces fiber architecture deformation at the 3 D woven bifurcation area. In this paper, a geometric modeling approach is proposed to represent the realistic fiber architecture, as a preprocessor for finite element analyses to predict composite structural performance. Supported by X-ray micro-computed tomography (mCT), three important deformation mechanisms are observed including yarn stack shifting, cross-section bending, and cross-section flattening resulting from the folding process. Furthermore, a set of mathematical formulae for simulation of the deformations in the junction region are developed and satisfactory agreement is observed when compared with mCT scan results...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of 3 D weaves has advantages over conventional uni-directional or 2 D woven lay-ups. There is potential to produce near net-shaped preforms {{and to increase}} damage resistance due {{to the presence of}} through thickness reinforcement. Conventional 3 D weaves typically consist of orthogonal yarns interwoven with through thickness <b>binder</b> <b>yarns.</b> This paper describes a feasibility study to find optimum architectures for 3 D woven fabrics where some of the normal manufacturing constraints are relaxed. This will provide the basis for development of novel manufacturing methods based on optimum textile architectures. A framework has been developed for the automatic generation and analysis of 3 D textile geometries, utilising the open-source pre-processor TexGen. A genetic algorithm is used to select an optimum geometry by evaluating results from finite element simulations using the commercial solver Abaqus. This paper highlights the flexibility of TexGen software to create complex 3 D models by means of its Python scripting application programming interface (API). A standard layer-to-layer geometry is used as a starting point to which off-axis yarn rotations, in-plane shift of entire layers and adjustments to <b>binder</b> <b>yarns</b> can be applied. Geometric variables are selected to represent the textile architecture enabling the automation of unit cell creation and finite element analysis. A Genetic Algorithm is used to determine the optimum through thickness binder path, the number and the width of the <b>binders,</b> and <b>yarn</b> angles using a weighted objective function of the material elastic properties. The case studies show that the algorithm is efficient to converge to the optimum fibre architecture...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of 3 D woven composite materials {{is affected by}} deformations as resulting from the manufacturing process. The present study is based on comparison of three different methodologies to predict the internal yarn geometries of 3 D through-thickness orthogonal interlock. The first approach idealises the geometry, which is obtained directly from manufacturing parameters assuming constant elliptical cross-sections. The second technique generates the yarn geometry from the Digital Element Method, which simulates the compaction process of the material. The last method considered is an analytical method defining longitudinal and transverse contours, which describe the undulation of fill, warp and <b>binder</b> <b>yarns.</b> The yarn geometries from the different methods are numerically analysed using voxel finite element analysis to determine the global volume fraction and the elastic properties. The results are also compared with experimental values to determine {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of each approach. The first approach is quicker than the others although the geometry is not the most accurate. The second and third method have a good match between the predicted geometry and optical micrograph of the fabric and the elastic properties are very similar for both methodsThis work has been partially funded by the Spanish Government (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) and the European Union under contract DPI 2012 - 3446...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the failure mechanisms for angle-interlocked (AI) and modified layer-to-layer (MLL) three dimensional (3 D) woven composites under tension–tension (T–T) fatigue loading has been conducted using surface optical microscopy, cross-sectional SEM imaging, and non-destructive X-ray computed tomography (CT). X-ray microCT has revealed how cracks including surface matrix cracks, transverse matrix cracks, fibre/matrix interfacial debonding or delamination develop, and has delineated the complex 3 D morphology of these cracks in relation to fibre architecture. For both weaves examined, transverse cracks soon become uniformly distributed in the weft yarns. A higher crack density {{was found in the}} AI composite than the MLL composite. Transverse cracking initiates in the fibre rich regions of weft yarns rather than the resin rich regions. Delaminations in the failed MLL specimen were more extensive than the AI specimen. It is suggested that for the MLL composite that debonding between the <b>binder</b> <b>yarns</b> and surrounding material is the predominant damage mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{methods have}} become {{increasingly}} effective tools for analysis and design of composite materials. This study investigates how the inclusion of geometrical variations in modelling 3 D woven fabrics affects the accuracy of numerical predictions. Based on micro-Computed Tomography data of 3 D orthogonal woven composites, unit cell models were generated in TexGen {{at different levels of}} geometrical detail. Two types of analysis were implemented: (a) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulates resin flow during fabric impregnation in composites processing to predict permeability; (b) implicit static finite element analysis predicts in-plane tensile strength of the composites. By comparison with experimental data, the numerical predictions indicate that local geometrical variations, particularly in yarn cross-section, surface crimp and <b>binder</b> <b>yarn</b> path, have significant influence on both permeability and material strength. It is important to model the precise geometry in certain locations while the overall geometry can be simplified {{in order to maintain the}} practicality of model generation...|$|E
40|$|A study {{deals with}} hollow spindle yarns {{that are made}} by one process technology. Such yarns have the special {{structure}} of three components with deliberately introduced irregular characteristics in diameter. The effect intermediate product of investigated hollow spindle yarns consists of the two yarns or of the three yarns. Analysing geometrical model of hollow spindle yarns the main precondition about the circle shaped cross-section of effect intermediate product was done. The structural and geometrical parameters influencing geometrical model of hollow spindle yarns are identified. It is presented that the coil length of the <b>binder</b> <b>yarn</b> {{is determined by the}} structural and geometrical indices of the components and the manufacture parameters of hollow spindle yarn. Hollow spindle twisting machine was used to produce different types of yarn varying in manufacture parameters as well as in raw material and linear density of the components. The predicted results and experimental data of the binder component coil length are presented. The good agreement between the theoretical calculations and experimental results was btained. ...|$|E
40|$|Realistic {{geometric}} representation of fabrics {{is essential for}} modelling of mechanical and physical properties of textiles and textile composites. It is also advantageous {{to be able to}} generate those models quickly and easily. Recent developments in TexGen which automate the creation of models for 3 D orthogonal, angle interlock and layer-to-layer fabrics and sheared 2 D fabrics are described. Micro-Computed Tomography data of 3 D fabrics has been used to identify geometrical characteristics which have formed the basis for implementation of refinements to the idealised fabrics generated automatically in TexGen. In 3 D orthogonal textiles local geometrical variations, particularly in yarn cross-section, surface crimp and <b>binder</b> <b>yarn</b> path are apparent at different levels of compaction. The “refine” option in TexGen‟s 3 D wizard automatically adjusts these features to achieve compaction to a specified thickness, using yarn volume fraction as a constraint. For sheared textiles a generic 2 D plain weave fabric was used to identify key geometric features. Yarn rotation has been identified as one of these and the geometric description of the sheared fabric considers yarn rotations in terms of two elliptical cylinders crossing each other at an oblique angle. The rotational angle is derived mathematically from the tangential contact between yarns. Variations in yarn height {{along the length of the}} yarn have also been identified and both of these features are incorporated into a refine function for sheared textiles. Compatible voxelised mesh and periodic boundary conditions for the sheared domain have also been implemented. The models have been used to generate manufacturing data: permeability data for the 3 D fabric and coefficient of thermal expansion for the sheared 2 D fabric...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the failure}} {{behaviour}} of three-dimensional weaved composites {{is necessary to}} allow the design of weave forms appropriate for application, or to predict the failure mode a component will undergo. The different effects at different length-scales call for multi-scale simulation. In this work, a finite-element model is proposed using the asymptotic homogenisation method to distribute macro-scale stresses to the micro-scale, i. e. yarns and matrix, in a repeating unit cell (RUC) model. The stresses in the yarns and matrix are then used in a continuum damage model to determine localised stiffness degradation, and the cell properties are homogenised to determine the macro-scale effect. The model is demonstrated by simulating a through-the-thickness reinforced orthogonally weaved composite, undergoing tensile, compressive and shear loading. The stress-strain response and failure are reproduced and shown to match experimental results. The model reveals the locations of damage initiation, and the progress of damage through the RUC. It is observed that the <b>binder</b> <b>yarns</b> create localised stress concentrations from which the failure process is initiated. It is concluded {{that the use of}} such a model can be critical to designing a 3 D weave with optimal behaviour...|$|R
40|$|PhDComposite {{integral}} armour {{plays an}} important role in future combat system. Despite numerous experimental studies there are still disadvantages such as complex manufacturing process, relatively big damage area, difficult to repair and limit shape etc. Composite integral armour without all these problems is essential for the success of future main battle tank which has a total weight of only 20 tons. 3 D fabrics are seen as potential solution to poor impact damage tolerance of textile composites. <b>Binder</b> <b>yarns</b> in through-thickness direction can bridge cracks and stop crack tip growth resulting very good impact damage tolerance. The major purple of this work is to incorporate new materials and new configuration into composite integral armour. The underlying premise is that ballistic performance of new armour is judged mainly by single hit ballistic limit followed by damage resistance which in turn followed by energy absorption in high energy low velocity impact. Computer simulation of 3 D textile composites and damage mechanism study were used through-out the study for analysing and explaining experimental results. Judged by these properties, conclusions regarding to ballistic performance of eight 3 D texile composties were made. The benefit of the work will be a new explanation of composite armour research.

40|$|Damage {{initiation}} {{and evolution}} of three-dimensional (3 D) orthogonal woven carbon fibre composite (3 DOWC) is investigated experimentally and numerically. Meso-scale homogenisation of the representative volume element (RVE) is utilised to predict the elastic properties, simulate damage initiation and evolution when loaded in tension. The effect of intra-yarns transverse cracking and shear diffused damage on the in-plane transverse modulus and shear modulus is investigated while one failure criterion is introduced to simulate the matrix damage. The proposed model is based on two major assumptions. First, {{the effect of the}} <b>binder</b> <b>yarns,</b> on the in-plane properties, is neglected, so the 3 DOWC unit cell can be approximated as a (0 o/ 90 o) cross-ply laminate. Second, a micro-mechanics based damage approach is used at the meso-scale, so damage indicators can be correlated, explicitly, to the density of cracks within the material. Results from the simulated RVE are validated against experimental results along the warp (0 o direction) and weft (90 o direction). This approach paves the road for more predictive models as damage evolution laws are obtained from micro mechanical considerations and rely on few well-defined material parameters. This largely differs from classical damage mechanics approaches in which the evolution law is obtained by retrofitting experimental observations...|$|R

30|$|Labanieh et al. (Labanieh et al. 2017) {{recently}} {{studied the}} effect of adding two layers of biased (+θ°/−θ°) yarns to a classical ORT architecture on the mechanical response in tension and short beam testing. Three ORT architectures were experimentally tested, two of which included the biased in-plane yarns while the last one represented a classical ORT architecture for baseline comparison. In-plane yarns were glass fibre <b>yarns</b> while the <b>binder</b> <b>yarns</b> were Kevlar yarns. The two multiaxial ORT architectures were different from the stacking sequence point of view. One of them (referred to as IMA) had the biased layers (+θ°/−θ°) adjacent to each other while they were separated by a 0 ° layer in the second architecture (referred to as MA). So from the testing point of view, off-axis yarns experienced bi-axial stress state when the global loading direction was along the warp or the weft. The “as manufactured” internal microstructure was examined by optical microscopy at different sections and fibre volume fraction was determined experimentally (~ 50 %). During testing, full strain mapping was captured with DIC for monotonic and “loading/unloading” tension. In the case of off-axis loading, a significant difference was observed between the multiaxial ORT specimens and the classical ORT. Classical ORT stress-strain response was significantly non-linear compared to the two multiaxial counter parts with much higher strain to failure and much lower strength. This distinguished behaviour of the classical ORT was attributed to the absence of reinforcing fibres along this off-axis (45 °) loading direction. Modulus degradation due to damage evolution was measured through the “loading/unloading” tensile test in the warp, weft and off-axis direction and recommended by the authors for incorporation in modelling {{the effect of}} damage in 3 D woven composites. The reader is referred to the original article for extensive discussion of ILSS data of the specified architectures.|$|R
