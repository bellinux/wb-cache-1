25|$|The {{end point}} of most titrations is {{detected}} {{by the use}} of visual indicator but the method can be inaccurate in very dilute or colored solutions. However under the same conditions, a potentiometric method for the detection of the equivalence point can yield accurate results without difficulty. The electrical apparatus required consists of a potentiometer or pH meter with a suitable indicator and reference electrode. The other apparatus consists of a <b>burette,</b> beaker and stirrer.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the solution to be titrated and the potential difference between the electrodes is measured. Measured volumes of titrant are added, with thorough (magnetic) stirring, and the corresponding values of emf (electromotive force) or pH recorded. Small increments in volume should be added near the equivalence point which is found graphically by noting the <b>burette</b> reading corresponding to the maximum change of emf or pH per unit change of volume. When {{the slope of the}} curve is more gradual it is not always easy to locate the equivalent point by this method. However, if small increments (0.1nbsp&cm³ or less) of titrant are added near the end point of the titration and a curve of change of emf or pH per unit volume against volume of titrant is plotted, a differential curve is obtained in which the equivalence point is indicated by a peak.|$|E

50|$|A <b>burette</b> (also buret) is a {{laboratory}} equipment used in analytical chemistry for the dispensing of variable, and for measuring amount {{of a chemical}} solution. It is a long glass tube with taper end that are attached with a stopcock at {{the opposite of the}} terminal valve. The flow of liquid from the tube to the <b>burette</b> tip is controlled by the stopcock valve.  In General Chemistry lab, the <b>burette</b> utilized a 50-mL volume with a stopcock without lubrication. Mainly, {{there are two types of}} <b>Burette</b> which are volumetric <b>burette</b> and Piston <b>burette</b> or Digital <b>burette.</b> A volumetric <b>burette</b> delivers measured volumes of liquid.

5000|$|Volumetric {{analysis}} {{originated in}} late 18th-century France. François-Antoine-Henri Descroizilles (fr) developed the first <b>burette</b> (which {{was similar to}} a graduated cylinder) in 1791. Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac developed an improved version of the <b>burette</b> that included a side arm, and coined the terms [...] "pipette" [...] and [...] "burette" [...] in an 1824 paper on the standardization of indigo solutions. A major breakthrough in the methodology and popularization of volumetric analysis was due to Karl Friedrich Mohr, who redesigned the <b>burette</b> by placing a clamp and a tip at the bottom, and wrote the first textbook on the topic, Lehrbuch der chemisch-analytischen Titrirmethode (Textbook of analytical-chemical titration methods), published in 1855.|$|E
50|$|The <b>burette</b> is used {{to measure}} a volume of a {{substance}} in a specific amount, but different from measuring cylinder as its graduations measure from top to bottom. Therefore {{the difference between the}} starting and the final volume is equal to the amount dispensed. The precise measurement of the <b>burette</b> is beneficial for using in titration in order to add titrant to the titrated solution.|$|E

The research was implemented by using a questionnaire and a preferential test and was given to first and third year students from five Prague high schools. The conclusion of my research study shows that students prefer neither animals on photographs nor the real specimen presented as a liquid preparation.
