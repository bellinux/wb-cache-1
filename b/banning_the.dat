5|$|Grammars and {{dictionaries}} {{of indigenous}} languages were composed throughout the colonial period, but their quality was {{highest in the}} initial period.

In 1770 another decree, calling {{for the elimination of}} the indigenous languages, did away with Classical Nahuatl as a literary language.

5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating.

A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or <b>banning</b> <b>the</b> use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
