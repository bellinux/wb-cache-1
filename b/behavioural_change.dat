At the same time, the general theories of <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> suggest possible explanations to criminal behaviour {{and methods of}} correcting deviant behaviour. Since deviant behaviour correction entails <b>behavioural</b> <b>change,</b> understanding of <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> can facilitate the adoption of effective correctional methods in policy-making. For example, the understanding that deviant behaviour like stealing may be learned behaviour resulting from reinforcers like hunger satisfaction that are unrelated to criminal behaviour can aid the development of social controls that address this underlying issue rather than merely the resultant behaviour.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The {{long-lasting}} {{beneficial effects}} of subthalamic nucleus (STN) {{deep brain stimulation}} (DBS) on motor function have now largely been acknowledged. Whereas <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> have been demonstrated in certain case reports and small case series, some authors have not observed <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> at all. The {{extent to which these}} changes occur has not yet been established. The aim {{of the present study was}} to systematically analyse <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> of bilateral STN DBS. Materials and methods. A structured Medline search was conducted using previously described methods. Studies were selected according to specific in- and exclusion criteria. Data on patients, surgical technique, outcome and complications were collected and pooled. Results. In total 1398 patients who underwent bilateral STN DBS were included. The total cumulative follow-up period was 1480 patient-years. Cognitive problems were seen in 41 %, depression in 8 %, and (hypo) mania in 4 % of the patients. Anxiety disorders were observed in less than 2 %, and personality changes, hypersexuality, apathy, anxiety, and aggressiveness were observed in less than 0. 5 % of the group studied. About half of the patients did not experience <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes.</b> Conclusion. Caregivers should be aware of the extent of these <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> and a risk/benefit evaluation should be performed for individual patients. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: The {{contribution}} of <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> to functional decline {{is yet to}} be explored in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Objectives: (1) investigate functional changes in two PPA variants [semantic (svPPA) and non-fluent (nfvPPA) ], at baseline and after 12 months; (2) investigate baseline differences in <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> between groups, and (3) explore predictors of functional decline after a 12 -month period. Methods: A longitudinal study involving 29 people with PPA (18 svPPA; 11 nfvPPA) seen annually in Sydney/Australia was conducted. A total of 114 functional and behavioural assessments were included for within-group (repeated-measures ANOVA; annual rate of change; multiple regression analyses) and between-group analyses (pairwise comparisons). Results: Functional profiles in svPPA and nfvPPA were similar in people with up to 5 years of disease duration. <b>Behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> were marked in svPPA patients (stereotypical behaviour and apathy) but did not predict annual rate of change of functional abilities; global cognitive scores at baseline did. Despite mild <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> in nfvPPA (disinhibition, apathy), these were significant predictors of annual rate of functional change. Conclusions: The presentation and interplay of <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes</b> and functional disability differ in svPPA and nfvPPA. These varying factors should be taken into account when considering prognosis, disease management, and selection of outcome measures for interventions...|$|R

25|$|<b>Behavioural</b> <b>change</b> {{theories}} are not universally accepted. Criticisms include the theories' emphases on individual behaviour {{and a general}} disregard for the influence of environmental factors on behaviour. In addition, as some theories were formulated as guides to understanding behaviour while others were designed as frameworks for behavioural interventions, the theories' purposes are not consistent. Such criticism illuminates {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the theories, showing that there is room for further research into <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> theories.|$|E
25|$|Self-efficacy is an individual's {{impression}} {{of their own}} ability to perform a demanding or challenging task such as facing an exam or undergoing surgery. This impression is based upon factors like the individual's prior success in the task or in related tasks, the individual's physiological state, and outside sources of persuasion. Self-efficacy {{is thought to be}} predictive of the amount of effort an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a <b>behavioural</b> <b>change,</b> so although self-efficacy is not a <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> theory per se, it is an important element of many of the theories, including the health belief model, the theory of planned behaviour and the health action process approach.|$|E

25|$|<b>Behavioural</b> <b>change</b> {{theories}} are attempts {{to explain why}} behaviours change. These theories cite environmental, personal, and behavioural characteristics as the major factors in behavioural determination. In recent years, there has been increased interest {{in the application of}} these theories in the areas of health, education, criminology, energy and international development with the hope that understanding <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> will improve the services offered in these areas. Some scholars have recently introduced a distinction between models of behavior and theories of change. Whereas models of behavior are more diagnostic and geared towards understanding the psychological factors that explain or predict a specific behavior, theories of change are more process-oriented and generally aimed at changing a given behavior. Thus, from this perspective, understanding and changing behavior are two separate but complementary lines of scientific investigation.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{reasoned}} action assumes that individuals consider a behaviour's consequences before performing the particular behaviour. As a result, intention {{is an important}} factor in determining behaviourive or negative together with the individual's impression of the way their society perceives the same behaviour. Thus, personal attitude and social pressure shape intention, which is essential to performance of a behaviour and consequently <b>behavioural</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E

25|$|Each <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> {{theory or}} model focuses on {{different}} factors {{in attempting to}} explain behaviour change. Of the many that exist, the most prevalent are learning theories, social cognitive theory, theories of reasoned action and planned behaviour, transtheoretical model of behavior change, the health action process approach and the BJ Fogg model of behavior change. Research has also been conducted regarding specific elements of these theories, especially elements like self-efficacy that are common to several of the theories.|$|E

The tax system and its administration also {{play an important role in}} state-building and governance, as a principal form of 'social contract' between the state and citizens who can, as taxpayers, exert accountability on the state as a consequence.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{some of the}} theories, {{like the}} social {{learning}} theory and theory of planned behaviour, were developed as attempts to improve health education.

Although health education is still the area in which <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> theories are most often applied, theories like the stages of change model have begun to be applied in other areas like employee training and developing systems of higher education.|$|E

Data for the research were gathered through administrated a survey instrument at the beginning and end of semester. Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy and Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) of changing individual behaviour were used to measure the levels of students’ knowledge and <b>behavioural</b> <b>changes,</b> respectively.

25|$|According to {{the social}} {{learning}} theory (more recently expanded as social cognitive theory), <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> is determined by environmental, personal, and behavioural elements. Each factor affects each of the others. For example, in congruence {{with the principles of}} self-efficacy, an individual's thoughts affect their behaviour and an individual's characteristics elicit certain responses from the social environment. Likewise, an individual's environment affects the development of personal characteristics as well as the person's behavior, and an individual's behaviour may change their environment as well as the way the individual thinks or feels. Social learning theory focuses on the reciprocal interactions between these factors, which are hypothesised to determine behavioral change.|$|E
25|$|There are however, some {{actions of}} prey species are clearly {{directed}} to actual or potential predators. A {{good example is}} warning colouration: species such as wasps {{that are capable of}} harming potential predators are often brightly coloured, and this modifies the behaviour of the predator, who either instinctively or as the result of experience will avoid attacking such an animal. Some forms of mimicry fall in the same category: for example hoverflies are coloured {{in the same way as}} wasps, and although they are unable to sting, the strong avoidance of wasps by predators gives the hoverfly some protection. There are also behavioural changes that act in a similar way to warning colouration. For example, canines such as wolves and coyotes may adopt an aggressive posture, such as growling with their teeth bared, to indicate they will fight if necessary, and rattlesnakes use their well-known rattle to warn potential predators of their venomous bite. Sometimes, a <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> and warning colouration will be combined, as in certain species of amphibians which have most of their body coloured to blend with their surroundings, except for a brightly coloured belly. When confronted with a potential threat, they show their belly, indicating that they are poisonous in some way.|$|E

[...] Gender, manual dexterity, the child's preferences, cognitive impairment and epilepsy were found {{to have an impact on}} children's leisure activities, with manual dexterity associated with more leisure activity.

2500|$|Neuromodulation {{exists in}} the {{olfactory}} system and is responsible for neural plasticity and <b>behavioural</b> <b>change</b> in both mammals and insects. In the context of olfactory memory, neuromodulators regulate storage of information {{in a way that}} maintains the significance of the olfactory experience. These systems are highly dependent on norepinephrine and acetylcholine, which affect both implicit and explicit memory. Studies involving the noradrenergic system of mice demonstrate elimination of habitual learning when areas involving this system are lesioned, and subsequent restoration of habitual learning abilities when noradrenaline is injected into the olfactory bulb. [...] The importance of cholinergic systems has been demonstrated in studies of rats and the effects of scopolamine, with acetylcholine being involved in initial learning stages and more specifically in the reduction of interference between stored memories.|$|E
