5|$|The still wines of {{the area}} were highly prized in Paris under the {{designation}} of vins de la rivière and vins de la montagne- wines {{of the river and}} wines of the mountain in reference to the wooded terrain and the river Marne which carried the wines down to the Seine and into Paris. The region was in competition with Burgundy for the Flemish wine trade and tried to capitalize on Reims' location along the trade route from Beaune. In the 15th century, Pinot noir became heavily planted in the area. The resulting red wine had difficulty comparing well to the richness and coloring of <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines,</b> despite the addition of elderberries to deepen the color. This led to a greater focus on white wines.|$|E

In the 18th century, Burgundy and Champagne were rivals for the lucrative Paris market, to which Champagne had earlier access. The two regions overlapped much in wine styles in this era, since Champagne was then primarily a producer of pale red still wines rather than of sparkling wines.

25|$|The 1305 {{election}} of Pope Clement V {{was followed by}} the move of the papacy from Rome to Avignon. During this time, the wines of the Rhone and Burgundy region received a higher profile due to their preference by the Avignonese popes. When Petrarch wrote to Pope Urban V, pleading for his return to Rome, he noted that one obstacle to his request was that the best <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines</b> could not be had south of the Alps. Following the prominence of Burgundy wine during the Avignonese papacy, the Valois Dukes of Burgundy took a keen interest in leveraging the region's wines into power and status. The Duchy would {{become one of the most}} powerful in France and very nearly its own kingdom—fueled in part by the prestige of the region's wines.|$|E

25|$|Wines {{from the}} Champagne region were known before medieval times. The Romans {{were the first}} to plant {{vineyards}} in this area of north-east France, with the region being cultivated by the 5th century, or possibly even earlier. Later, churches owned vineyards and monks produced wine for use in the sacrament of Eucharist. French kings were traditionally anointed in Reims, and Champagne was served as part of coronation festivities. The Champenois were envious of the reputation of the wines made by their Burgundian neighbours to the south and sought to produce wines of equal acclaim. However, the northerly climate of the region gave the Champenois a unique set of challenges in making red wine. At the far extremes of sustainable viticulture, the grapes would struggle to ripen fully and often would have bracing levels of acidity and low sugar levels. The wines would be lighter bodied and thinner than the <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines</b> they were seeking to outdo.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Louis XIV, his {{personal}} physician Guy-Crescent Fagon recommended that he drink only wines from Nuits St-Georges for their health giving properties. Wine merchants in the Côte de Nuits latched onto this royal association as a great marketing coup over the region's rivals in Champagne and Bordeaux. The 18th century ushered {{in a period of}} tête de cuvée of wines made solely from the best grapes produced in single vineyards. To add to the distinctiveness of these wines, new winemaking techniques such as extended maceration and longer fermentations became popular. This produced dark, tannic vin de garde wines that required extended periods of aging. Imitation of this style by producers using lower quality of grapes saw producers use various methods of adulteration such as adding honey to the wine in order to increase the sugar and, consequently, the alcohol level of the wine. Following Jean-Antoine Chaptal's, Napoleon's Minister of the Interior, recommendation to use the method now known as chaptalization to boost alcohol levels, the market was flooded with <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines</b> from the Côte de Nuits and beyond that were dark, dense and highly alcoholic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{status of}} <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines</b> {{continued}} {{in the court of}} the House of Valois, which ruled as Dukes of Burgundy for much of the 14th and 15th centuries. Their ban on the import and [...] export of non-Burgundian wines, effectively shutting out the then popular wines of the Rhone Valley from north European markets, gave a considerable boost to the Burgundy wine industry. It was during this era that the first reliable references to grape varieties in Burgundy were made. Pinot noir was first mentioned in 1370 under the name Noirien, but it was believed to have been cultivated earlier than that, since no other grape variety associated with Medieval Burgundy {{is believed to have been}} able to produce red wines of a quality able to impress the papal court. On 6 August 1395, Duke Philip the Bold issued a decree concerned with safeguarding the quality of <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines.</b> The duke declared the [...] "vile and disloyal Gamay"—which was a higher-yielding grape than Pinot noir in the 14th century, as it is today—unfit for human consumption and banned the use of organic fertilizer (manure), which probably increased yields even further to the detriment of quality. High-quality white <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines</b> of this era were probably made from Fromenteau, which is known as a quality grape in northeastern France in this time. Fromenteau is probably the same variety as today's Pinot gris. Chardonnay is a much later addition to Burgundy's vineyards.|$|E

2500|$|The {{awareness}} of the difference of quality and style of <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines</b> produced from different vineyards goes back to Medieval times, with certain climats being more highly rated than others. An early author on this aspect of <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines</b> was Denis Morelot with his La Vigne et le Vin en Côte d'Or from 1831. In 1855, {{the same year as}} the famous Bordeaux Wine Official Classification was launched, Dr. Jules Lavalle published an influential book, Histoire et Statistique de la Vigne de Grands Vins de la Côte-d'Or, which included an unofficial classification of the Burgundy vineyards in five classes and which built on Morelot's book. In decreasing order, Lavalle's five classes were hors ligne, tête de cuvée, 1ère cuvée, 2me cuvée and 3me cuvée. [...] Lavalle's classification was formalized in modified form by the Beaune Committee of Agriculture in 1861, and then consisted of three classes. Most of the [...] "first class" [...] vineyards of the 1861 classification were made into Grand Cru appellations d'origine contrôlées when the national AOC legislation was implemented in 1936.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 June 2012, a {{blind tasting}} {{comparing}} {{red and white}} wines from New Jersey and Bordeaux and <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines</b> from France was held at Princeton University during a four-day conference of the American Association of Wine Economists (AAWE). [...] It was modelled after the Judgment of Paris event in 1976, a famous blind tasting in which California wines beat French wines. [...] It was organized by George M. Taber, a former journalist from TIME Magazine who attended the Judgment of Paris event and later {{wrote a book about}} it, and Princeton University economics professors Orley Ashenfelter and Richard E. Quandt, New York University economics professor and Journal of Wine Economics managing editor Karl Storchmann, and wine shop owner Mark Censits.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{successful}} commercial production of California Chardonnay was from plantings in the Livermore Valley AVA. Wente Vineyards developed a Chardonnay clone {{that was used}} to introduce the grape variety in several Californian vineyards throughout the 1940s. In the 1950s, James David Zellerbach, one-time US Ambassador to Rome, started Hanzell Vineyards winery and dedicated it to making Burgundian-style Chardonnay. His success encouraged other Californian winemakers to follow suit and culminated in Chateau Montelena's victory over Burgundy Chardonnay in the 1976 blind tasting event conducted by French judges known as the Judgment of Paris. In response, the demand for Californian Chardonnay increased and Californian winemakers rushed to increase plantings. In the 1980s, the popularity of Californian Chardonnay increased so much, the number of vines planted in the state eclipsed that of France by 1988. By 2005, nearly [...] accounted for almost 25% of the world's total Chardonnay plantings. The early trend was to imitate the great <b>Burgundy</b> <b>wines,</b> but this soon gave way to more rich buttery and oaked styles. Starting with the 1970s, the focus was on harvesting the grapes at more advanced degrees of ripeness and higher Brix levels. New oak barrels were used to produce wines that were big in body and mouthfeel. Frank J. Prial of The New York Times was an early critic of this style, particularly {{because of the lack of}} [...] "food friendliness" [...] that was common with these massive wines. Another criticism of California Chardonnays, and one that has been levied against other Californian wines, is the very high alcohol levels which can make a wine seem out of balance. In recent years, California winemakers have been using process such as reverse osmosis and spinning cones to bring the alcohol levels down to 12 to 14%.|$|E
