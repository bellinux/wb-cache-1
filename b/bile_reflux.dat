25|$|The {{long-term}} erosive {{effects of}} acid reflux (an extremely common condition, {{also known as}} gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) have been strongly linked {{to this type of}} cancer. Longstanding GERD can induce a change of cell type in the lower portion of the esophagus in response to erosion of its squamous lining. This phenomenon, known as Barrett's esophagus, seems to appear about 20 years later in women than in men, maybe due to hormonal factors. Having symptomatic GERD or <b>bile</b> <b>reflux</b> makes Barrett's esophagus more likely, which in turn raises the risk of further changes that can ultimately lead to adenocarcinoma.

5000|$|The {{treatment}} for <b>bile</b> <b>reflux</b> {{is the same}} as the {{treatment for}} acidic reflux.

In addition, smoking has been found to be a factor in the development of acidic reflux. Thus, all of these factors should be applied to <b>bile</b> <b>reflux</b> as well. Likewise, drugs that reduce the secretion of gastric acid (e.g., proton pump inhibitors) or that reduce gastric contents or volume can be used to treat acidic <b>bile</b> <b>reflux.</b> Because prokinetic drugs increase the motility of the stomach and accelerate gastric emptying, they can also reduce <b>bile</b> <b>reflux.</b> Other drugs that reduce the relaxations of the lower esophageal sphincter, such as baclofen, have also proven to reduce <b>bile</b> <b>reflux,</b> particularly in patients who are refractory to (medically unresponsive to) proton pump inhibitor therapy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcute {{pancreatitis}} (AP) is {{a formidable}} disease, which, in severe forms, causes significant mortality. Biliary AP, or gallstone obstruction-associated AP, accounts for 30 – 50 % of all clinical cases of AP. In biliary AP, pancreatic acinar cell (PAC) death (the initiating event in the disease) is believed to occur as acinar cells make contact with bile salts when <b>bile</b> <b>refluxes</b> into the pancreatic duct. Recent advances have unveiled an important receptor responsible for the major function of bile acids on acinar cells, namely, the cell surface G-protein-coupled bile acid receptor- 1 (Gpbar 1), located in the apical pole of the PAC. High concentrations of bile acids induce cytosolic Ca 2 + overload and inhibit mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, resulting in cell injury to both PACs and pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. Various bile salts are employed to induce experimental AP, most commonly sodium taurocholate. Recent characterization of taurolithocholic acid 3 -sulphate on PACs has led researchers to focus on this bile salt because of its potency in causing acinar cell injury at relatively low, sub-detergent concentrations, which strongly implicates action via the receptor Gpbar 1. Improved surgical techniques have enabled the infusion of bile salts into the pancreatic duct to induce experimental biliary AP in mice, which allows {{the use of these}} transgenic animals as powerful tools.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Bile acid {{toxicity}} {{has been}} shown in the gastric, colonic, and hepatic tissues; the effect on oesophageal mucosa is less well known.  AIMS—To determine the spectrum of <b>bile</b> acids <b>refluxing</b> in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and its relation to oesophageal pH using a new technique of combined oesophageal aspiration and pH monitoring.  METHODS—Ten asymptomatic subjects and 30 patients with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (minimal mucosal injury, erosive oesophagitis (grade 2 or 3 Savary-Miller), Barrett's oesophagus/stricture; n= 10 in each group) underwent 15 hour continuous oesophageal aspiration with simultaneous pH monitoring. Bile acid assay of the oesophageal samples was performed using modified high performance liquid chromatography.  RESULTS—The peak bile acid concentration and DeMeester acid scores were significantly higher in the patients with oesophagitis (median bile acid concentration 124 µmol/l; acid score 20. 2) and Barrett's oesophagus/stricture (181 µmol/l; 43. 3) than patients with minimal injury (14 µmol/l; 12. 5) or controls (0 µmol/l; 11. 1). The predominant bile acids detected were cholic, taurocholic, and glycocholic acids but there was a significantly greater proportion of secondary bile acids, deoxycholic and taurodeoxycholic acids, in patients with erosive oesophagitis and Barrett's oesophagus/stricture. Although <b>bile</b> acid <b>reflux</b> episodes occurred at variable pH, a temporal relation existed between reflux of taurine conjugates and oesophageal acid exposure (r= 0. 58, p= 0. 009).  CONCLUSION—Toxic secondary bile acid fractions have been detected in patients with extensive mucosal damage. Mixed reflux is more harmful than acid reflux alone with possible toxic synergism existing between the taurine conjugates and acid. ...|$|R

5000|$|Cholestasis means [...] "the slowing or {{stopping}} of bile flow" [...] {{which can}} be caused by any number of diseases of the liver (which produces the bile), the gallbladder (which stores the bile), or biliary tract (also known as the biliary tree, the conduit that allows the bile to leave the liver and gallbladder and enter the small intestine). When this occurs, conjugated bilirubin and the waste products that usually would be cleared in <b>bile</b> <b>reflux</b> back into the bloodstream. This causes a primarily conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice; the liver conjugates the bile to make it water-soluble and because the bile has already been processed by the liver, when it gets backed up because of a blockage and is refluxed into the blood, the blood will have high levels of conjugated bilirubin. This is in contrast to primarily unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia which is the water-insoluble form that is bound to serum albumin; the liver has not had a chance to conjugate the bilirubin yet and can be caused either because too much unconjugated bilirubin is made (such as in massive hemolysis or ineffective erythropoiesis) or because too little is conjugated (Gilbert's disease or Crigler-Najjar syndrome).

The mechanism of symptom production (pyrosis and/or chest pain) is incompletely understood. Chemoreceptors are involved but manometric disturbances and irritability of the esophagus may play an important role. The pathogenesis of pathological reflux is multifactorial: 1. An ineffective anti-reflux barrier {{at the level of}} the gastroesophageal junction is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of reflux. 2. Once reflux has occurred, an appropriate clearing of the refluxed material is necessary to minimize the contact time of the noxious agent with the esophageal mucosa.
