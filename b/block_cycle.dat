40|$|OBJECTIVE: Monomorphic {{sustained}} {{ventricular tachycardia}} (VT) {{can often be}} entrained and interrupted at a critical paced cycle length. The aim was to evaluate a possible determinant of this phenomenon by observing the action of mexiletine on the critical paced cycle length and other variables. METHODS: Nine consecutive patients with symptomatic VT were studied. After induction of VT, the area of slow conduction was mapped as the earliest site of the activation or the site with mid-diastolic potential during the tachycardia. Rapid pacing was performed at a site distant from the tachycardia circuit to entrain the tachycardia, starting at a cycle length 10 - 20 ms shorter than the VT cycle length, and repeated after a decrement of the cycle length in steps of 10 ms to obtain the longest paced cycle length that interrupted the tachycardia: the <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length. The effective refractory period (ERP) was measured at the pacing site at which the myocardium was presumed to be normal {{and also in the}} area of slow conduction. The effects of mexiletine on the cycle length of VT, the <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length, and the ERP at two sites were obtained before and after mexiletine administration. The relation between the cycle length of VT and <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length and their changes were also analysed. RESULTS: 11 VTs with the same morphology were induced before and after mexiletine administration. The VT cycle length was prolonged by mexiletine from 309 (SD 53) to 361 (47) ms, and it was interrupted at <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> lengths of 247 (37) and 307 (41) ms, respectively, the changes being 18 (12) % and 23 (8) % (both P < 0. 001). All VTs were entrained, and during pacing at the <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length there was abrupt loss of fusion and change in the presystolic electrogram, always associated with interruption of VT on cessation of rapid pacing. A good correlation was observed between the VT cycle length and the <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length (r = 0. 77 to 0. 80). The ERP at the pacing site (normal myocardium) and in the area of slow conduction showed no significant change: 241 (21) v 240 (22) ms and 262 (9) v 252 (9) ms, respectively. The <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length was longer than the ERP after mexiletine administration: 362 (55) v 252 (9) ms (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Mexiletine prolonged the cycle length of VT and the VT-interrupting critical cycle length but not the ERP. The prolongation of the VT cycle length and the <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length by mexiletine seemed to be unrelated to the action potential duration, but related to depressed intercellular conduction...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{procainamide}} may markedly impair or abolish anterograde conduction over {{an accessory}} atrioventricular (AV) pathway, orthodromic AV reentry may remain inducible. This difference {{may be related}} to a systemic differential effect of procainamide on anterograde and retrograde accessory pathway refractoriness. To examine this phenomenon, an infusion of procainamide producing five incremental Mood levels over 75 min was administered to 15 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. At each procainamide level, accessory pathway effective refractory period and accessory pathway <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length were determined in the anterograde and retrograde directions. At baseline, {{there were no significant differences}} between anterograde and retrograde accessory pathway effective refractory periods (282 ± 7 vs. 266 ± 9 ms, p = 0. 08) and <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> lengths (288 ± 15 vs. 283 ± 9 ms, p = 0. 66). The concentration of procainamide resulting in 50 % prolongation of accessory pathway refractoriness was less in the anterograde direction than in the retrograde direction (27. 5 [log concentration − 4. 56 ± SE 0. 13] vs. 64. 6 [− 4. 19 ± 0. 11] μmol/liler, p = 0. 02). Similarly, the concentration of procainamide resulting in 50 % prolongation of accessory pathway <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length in the anterograde direction (25. 1 [− 4. 60 ± 0. 13) μmol/liter) was less than in the retrograde direction (52. 5 [− 4. 28 ± 0. 07] μmol/liter, p = 0. 01). The probability of persistence of accessory pathway conduction in the anterograde direction was less than in the retrograde direction by Kaplan-Meier analysis (p = 0. 04). By the 3 rd procainamide dose (mean procainamide level 32. 3 ± 1. 36 μmol/ liter) anterograde pre-excitation was no longer present in 6 of the 15 patients, whereas retrograde conduction over the accessory pathway did not disappear in any patient. These results demonstrate that procainamide has more marked effects on anterograde than on retrograde accessory pathway refractoriness. Thus, it may be more efficacious for arrhythmias dependent on anterograde accessory pathway conduction than for arrhythmias dependent on retrograde accessory pathway conduction...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{underlying}} {{mechanisms of}} the differences in sex distribution of patients with atrioventricular (AV) nodal re-entrant tachycardia and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome are poorly understood. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine potential gender differences in the electrophysiological properties of the normal AV conduction system that may be attributable to differences in sex distribution. DESIGN: The AV conduction properties were studied in 96 patients (52 men and 44 women) who underwent electrophysiological testing, 32 patients with atrial tachycardia, 39 with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and 25 with unexplained palpitations or syncope. RESULTS: The AH (83 +/- 15 ms) and His-ventricular intervals in men (42 +/- 6 ms) were significantly longer than in women (78 +/- 14, 38 +/- 6 ms, p < 0. 05, respectively), as was the PR interval (160 +/- 17 vs 152 +/- 13 ms, p = 0. 02). The effective refractory period of AV node in men (349 +/- 75 ms) was longer than in women (297 +/- 45 ms, p = 0. 03). However, no significant difference was observed between men and women with respect to the incidence of AV nodal dual pathway and the maximum AH interval achieved during premature stimulation or incremental pacing. The AV <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length was significantly longer in men (371 +/- 76 ms) than in women (330 +/- 52 ms, p = 0. 02). A longer ventriculoatrial <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length was also found in men than in women although not at a significant level (436 +/- 107 vs 384 +/- 90 ms. p = 0. 08). In addition, men (23 %) were twice as likely to have ventriculoatrial dissociation during ventricular pacing as women were (11 %, p = 0. 2).

OBJECTIVES: To determine electrophysiological variables that predict inducibility, divided doses of class I antiarrhythmic drugs were given and their effects were analysed, particularly {{the ability of the}} final dose to suppress inducibility. METHODS: The excitable gap was estimated by the zone of entrainment, which was defined as the difference between the cycle length of VT and the longest paced cycle length that interrupted VT during entrainment of VT with rapid pacing at paced cycle lengths in decrements of 10 ms. The cycle length of VT, the <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length, and the zone of entrainment were measured in the drug free state and after intermediate and final doses of procainamide, disopyramide, cibenzoline, and mexiletine. RESULTS: Sustained monomorphic VT with a mean (SD) cycle length of 285 (43) ms was induced in 8 patients. It was entrained and interrupted at the <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length of 231 (31) ms. The width of the zone of entrainment was 54 (23) ms. In 8 studies VT was not inducible at final doses of procainamide in 4, cibenzoline in 1, and mexiletine in 3. In another 10 studies (procainamide in 4, disopyramide in 1, cibenzoline in 2, and mexiletine in 3), VT remained inducible at the intermediate dose and at the final dose. The cycle length of VT was prolonged to a similar degree in studies of effective and ineffective drugs, but the cycle length that blocked VT was longer at the intermediate dose of the effective drugs. Consequently, the width of the zone of entrainment was significantly narrowed at the intermediate dose of effective drugs and the width of the zone of entrainment was narrower than when ineffective drugs were given (22 (13) ms v 76 (18) or 75 (37) ms at the intermediate and final doses respectively (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Drugs that narrowed the zone of entrainment were associated with non-inducibility of VT after the final dose of the drug was given.

Our objective in {{this study was to examine}} the involvement of anionic ion channels in cardiac arrhythmia. We used a transgenic mouse model to overexpress the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. We used RNase protection and in situ hybridization assays to determine the level of CFTR expression, and radiotelemetry and in vivo electrophysiological study in combination with pharmacological intervention to analyse the cardiac function. Cardiac CFTR overexpression leads to stress-related sudden death in this model.

None of them had spontaneous SVTA, and 24 -h Hotter monitoring showed no SVTA. The atrial stimulation programme used one and two extra stimuli delivered during sinus rhythm and atrial pacing (600 ms and 10 % less than the sinus cycle length). A sustained (S) (> 30 s) supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) (atrialflutter, fibrillation, tachycardia) wasinducedin 17 patients in group I (11 %) andin 120 patients in group II (40 - 5 %). In group II inducible S VTA could not be correlated with the occurrence of a S VT during acute MI, the location of Ml, the value of LV ejection fraction (EF), the incidence of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), or fibrillation (VF). However, inducible SVTA could be correlated with a significantly shorter effective atrial refractory period (197 ± 23 msvs 220 ± 35 ms,P< 0001) and a shorter retrograde <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length (518 ± 215 vs 585 ± 215 ms, P< 0 - 03).

The extent of modification required thus remains unclear. High recurrence {{rates have been}} reported when single AV nodal echos (AVNe) remain inducible. We, therefore, prospectively evaluated the characteristics of AVNe pre and post AV nodal modification. ResultsAblation was deemed successful when sustained AVNRT could not be induced on isoproternol (ISO). After successful ablation, AVNe was inducible in 24 pts and noninducible in 72 pts. Other electrophysiologic parameters in these two groups were comparable with similar increases in 1 : 1 AV <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> lengths (356 to 413 and 368 to 400 msec, p< 0. 005) and AVNERP (258 to 317 and 264 to 313 msec, p< 0. 001) pre to post ablation. In Group 1 patients, persistent AVNes following successful ablation (good echoes) were associated {{with an increase in}} AH interval in all but one patient as compared to AVNes seen either preablation or during ablation attempts when tachycardia was still inducible (bad echoes) (366. 9 ± 113 vs 279. 6 ± 80 msec, p< 0. 001). In Group 2 patients, when the AH interval of AVNes was unchanged from baseline, further ablation attempts were required to achieve noninducibility and also resulted in abolition of dual physiology. During a mean follow-up of 11 ± 4 months, only one of the 96 patients had a recurrence.

The PR (166 +/- 25 ms) and AH (88 +/- 20 ms) intervals obtained 30 minutes after ablation in manifest WPW patients were significantly longer than in concealed WPW patients (149 +/- 20, 76 +/- 15 ms, P <. 0001). The PR (146 +/- 20 ms) and AH intervals (75 +/- 15 ms) measured before ablation in AVNRT patients were shorter than those obtained before ablation in concealed WPW patients (154 +/- 21, 80 +/- 17 ms, P <. 05) and after ablation in manifest WPW patients (P <. 0001). The PR interval in AVNRT patients was also shorter than those measured during follow-up in concealed (153 +/- 21 ms, P <. 05) and manifest WPW patients (165 +/- 23 ms, P <. 0001). The ventriculoatrial <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length in AVNRT patients was significantly shorter than in manifest and concealed WPW patients. When age-matched patients were assigned to each group, significant differences in PR interval were observed between men and women (159 +/- 22 vs. 151 +/- 22 ms, P <. 0001). Differences in sex distribution exist among patients with manifest and concealed WPW and AVNRT. The atrioventricular conduction properties required for the manifestation of pre-excitation and induction of AVNRT and gender differences in atrioventricular conduction may account for the differences in sex distribution...|$|E
40|$|Depressed {{parasympathetic}} {{activity has}} been proposed {{to be associated with}} an increased risk of sudden death. Parasympathetic effects (PE) on cardiac electrophysiology during exercise and recovery have not been studied in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. We performed noninvasive electrophysiological studies (NI-EPS) and characterized the electrophysiological properties of the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) node, and ventricle in subjects with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction and dual-chamber defibrillators. NI-EPS were performed during rest, exercise, and recovery at baseline and after parasympathetic blockade with atropine to assess PE (the difference between parameter values in the 2 conditions). Ten subjects (9 men: age, 60 ± 9 yr; and left ventricular ejection fraction, 29 ± 8 %) completed the study. All NI-EPS parameters decreased during exercise and trended toward rest values during recovery. PE at rest, during exercise, and during recovery, respectively, were on sinus cycle length, 320 ± 71 (P = 0. 0001), 105 ± 60 (P = 0. 0003), and 155 ± 82 ms (P = 0. 0002); on AV <b>block</b> <b>cycle</b> length, 137 ± 136 (P = 0. 09), 37 ± 19 (P = 0. 002), and 61 ± 39 ms (P = 0. 006); on AV interval, 58 ± 32 (P = 0. 035), 22 ± 13 (P = 0. 002), and 36 ± 20 ms (P = 0. 001); on ventricular effective refractory period, 15. 8 ± 11. 3 (P = 0. 02), 4. 7 ± 15. 2 (P = 0. 38), and 6. 8 ± 15. 5 ms (P = 0. 20); and on QT interval, 13 ± 12 (P = 0. 13), 3 ± 17 (P = 0. 6), and 20 ± 23 (P = 0. 04). In conclusion, we describe {{for the first time the}} changes in cardiac electrophysiology and PE during rest, exercise, and recovery in subjects with left ventricular dysfunction. PEs are preserved in these patients. Thus the role of autonomic changes in the pathophysiology of sudden death requires further exploration...|$|E
40|$|Two cases which {{exhibited}} a Wenckebach form of exit conduction between an electrical pacemaker and the ventricular myocardium are presented. This manifests with increasing latency (stimulus to QRS intervals) and ultimate stimulus failure (<b>block).</b> The <b>cycle</b> then repeats itself. The QRS duration also increases progressively within each cycle. The phenomenon connotes an adverse prognosis. Several postulates regarding the mechanism are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the demands of wider issue processors, fetch {{mechanisms}} will need to fetch multiple basic <b>blocks</b> per <b>cycle.</b> The trace cache supplies several basic <b>blocks</b> each <b>cycle</b> by storing logically contiguous instructions in physically contiguous storage. When a particular basic block is requested, the trace cache can potentially respond with the requested block along with several blocks that followed it when the block was last encountered. In this technical report, we examine some critical features of a trace cache mechanism designed for a 16 -wide issue processor and evaluate their effects on performance. We examine features such as cache associativity, storage partitioning, branch predictor design, instruction cache design, and fill unit design. We compare the performance of our trace cache mechanism with that of the design presented by Rotenberg et al [19] and show a 23 % improvement in performance. In our final analysis, we compare our trace cache mechanism with an aggressive s [...] ...|$|R

Flow cytometric studies demonstrated that stimulation with antigen resulted in a cell <b>cycle</b> <b>block</b> that was most evident at the G 1 /S border, and mixing studies revealed that bystander T cells of different antigen specificities were not affected. For at least the large majority of T cells, the G 1 /S cell <b>cycle</b> <b>block</b> appeared to be irreversible after 24 h of exposure to antigen. This cell <b>cycle</b> <b>block</b> may be useful as a rapid and quantitative measure of T cell hybridoma activation, as a means of selecting T cell hybridomas that have functional alterations in the reception of stimulatory signals, and may serve as a model of the induction of tolerance in immature T cells...|$|R
