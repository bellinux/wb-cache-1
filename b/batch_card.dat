50|$|Once no more {{moves are}} possible, a new <b>batch</b> of 16 <b>cards</b> are dealt from the stock, {{one on each}} pile, filling any gaps in the process. Therefore, an empty pile is not filled until the next deal. In between deals, cards are moved onto the {{foundations}}. The dealing of new <b>batches</b> of <b>cards</b> and moving cards to the foundations continue until the stock runs out. From that point, a new special process of dealing begins.|$|R
5000|$|Commerce {{is usually}} played by 3-10 players, {{although}} any number can play. The {{game is played}} with a complete pack of 52 cards ranking A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. After the dealer is determined and before the play begins, the players contribute equally to a [...] "pool". The players are dealt, singly or in just one <b>batch,</b> three <b>cards</b> each and another <b>batch</b> of three <b>cards</b> are dealt {{face up to the}} table to form the [...] "widow".|$|R

50|$|Three players use a 32-card pack, with cards {{normally}} ranking A 10 K O U 9 8 7. The first dealer {{is chosen}} by any agreed means and thereafter the turn to deal and play passes to the right. The dealer deals a <b>batch</b> of five <b>cards</b> to each player, seven {{to the first}} player on his right, and then another <b>batch</b> of five <b>cards</b> {{to each of the}} players.|$|R

50|$|The Acekard 2 {{earned a}} 90-percent on DS-Scene.net and a Golden Award on GBAtemp.net. It {{features}} 99-percent game compatibility, skinnable download-play support, micro-SD/SDHC memory card support, quick loading and Action Replay cheat support. Users reported freezing {{problems with the}} first <b>batch</b> of <b>cards,</b> but the Acekard 2.1 revision (released in December 2008) addressed these issues. The newer cards have 2.1 on their stickers, and may also be identified {{by the lack of}} a microchip bulge under the sticker.|$|R
50|$|Cards in {{the stock}} are dealt onto the reserve three at a time, one for each pile. In effect, gaps on the reserve are filled during the deal; therefore, when a reserve pile becomes empty, it is not filled until the next <b>batch</b> of three <b>cards</b> is dealt.|$|R
50|$|The top {{cards in}} the reserve are in play and can {{be placed on the}} foundations, or be placed on a row (if it is a 2, 3, or 4), but empty piles are not filled until a new <b>batch</b> of eight <b>cards</b> are dealt every time no more moves are possible.|$|R

50|$|Poems in the Waiting Room (PitWR) is a U.K.-based and {{registered}} arts in health charity. The main {{aim of the}} charity is to supply short collections of poems for patients in National Health Service General Practice waiting rooms to read while waiting to see their doctor. The aim is to promote poetry, {{and to make the}} paient's wait more pleasant. The service is free to the waiting rooms and general practice managers, and is supported by grants and donations. The poems are presented as A4 sized three-fold cards typically reproducing between six and eight poems. <b>Batches</b> of <b>cards</b> are printed and distributed to waiting rooms four times a year. Patients are invited to take the cards away with them.|$|R
5000|$|There is a deck {{of cards}} that players draw from. Once the deck is depleted, a new <b>batch</b> of <b>cards</b> (and some of the used cards) are shuffled in and the game {{progresses}} to the second epoch. Once the deck is depleted again, more new cards (and again some of the used cards) are shuffled to form a new deck for the third epoch. Once the deck is depleted a third time, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. Score is determined by adding up the values of a player's advances and cash, less a penalty for the [...] "misery" [...] of their people. The rules also suggest shorter versions of the game that end after either one or two epochs.|$|R
50|$|Botifarra {{is played}} with a Spanish 48-card deck of Coins, Cups, Swords and Batons running from 1 to 12. The card order is 9 (high), Ace, King, Horse, Jack, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (low). The dealer deals the whole deck {{counterclockwise}} in <b>batches</b> of four <b>cards.</b> After each hand the turn to deal and play always passes to the right. Usually, dealer's right hand opponent shuffles the deck and the left hand opponent cuts.|$|R
50|$|Blind: While having dealt the 1st {{batch of}} the deck and {{displayed}} the trump, the dealer can then choose to make 2 tricks or more without knowing his deck, but receiving the trump card displayed, so basically knowing 1 of his cards. He will then deal the 2nd <b>batch</b> of 2 <b>cards,</b> thus having 5 cards {{in his hand and}} having to decide which card he drops to reach the allowed deck of 4 cards. Exchanging of the cards (even all 4) still being possible.|$|R
50|$|Administrator’s Plus is {{a student}} {{information}} system that manages school data on students and staff. Schools can use the system to track attendance, write reports cards, record disciplinary action and build student schedules. Teachers can maintain a class webpage and calculate and record grades in the program. Administrators can create digital portfolios for each student and staff member. The system allows users to <b>batch</b> e-mail report <b>cards</b> and other documents to parents. Parents can log into the system from home to see their children’s grades and other information, including school announcements.|$|R
50|$|The first Christmas {{cards were}} {{commissioned}} by Sir Henry Cole {{and illustrated by}} John Callcott Horsley in London on 1 May 1843. The central picture showed three generations of a family raising a toast to the card's recipient: on either side were scenes of charity, with food and clothing being given to the poor. Allegedly {{the image of the}} family drinking wine together proved controversial, but the idea was shrewd: Cole had helped introduce the Penny Post three years earlier. Two <b>batches</b> totaling 2,050 <b>cards</b> were printed and sold that year for a shilling each.|$|R
50|$|Shuffling is {{the process}} of {{bringing}} the cards of a pack into a random order. There are a large number of techniques with various advantages and disadvantages. Riffle shuffling is a method in which the deck is divided into two roughly equal-sized halves that are bent and then released, so that the cards interlace. Repeating this process several times randomizes the deck well, but the method is harder to learn than some others and may damage the cards. The overhand shuffle and the Hindu shuffle are two techniques that work by taking <b>batches</b> of <b>cards</b> {{from the top of the}} deck and reassembling them in the opposite order. They are easier to learn but must be repeated more often. A method suitable for small children consists in spreading the cards on a large surface and moving them around before picking up the deck again. This is also the most common method for shuffling tiles such as dominoes.|$|R
5000|$|A batch fee (also {{known as}} a batch-header fee) can be charged to a {{merchant}} whenever the merchant [...] "settles" [...] their terminal. Settling a terminal, also known as [...] "batching", is when a merchant sends their completed transactions for the day to their acquiring bank for payment. Some providers perform this automatically. It is important to close a batch every 24 hours or a higher rate will be assessed by Visa, Discover or MasterCard. The term [...] "batch header" [...] originally came from processing pre-electronic terminal era, when each <b>batch</b> of credit <b>card</b> receipts was turned into the merchant's local bank for deposit. The batch header was a mini report summarizing those receipts bundled within.|$|R
50|$|There were {{a variety}} of reasons why batch {{processing}} dominated early computing. One reason is that the most urgent business problems for reasons of profitability and competitiveness were primarily accounting problems, such as billing or payroll; this priority of accounting in early use of information technology is ancient: see history of writing and history of accounting. Billing may conveniently be performed as a batch-oriented business process, and practically every business must bill, reliably and on-time. While accounting is time-sensitive, it can be done daily (particularly overnight, after close of business), and does not require interaction. Also, every computing resource was expensive, so sequential submission of <b>batches</b> on punched <b>cards</b> matched the resource constraints and technology evolution at the time.|$|R
50|$|Batch {{processing}} {{dates to}} the late 19th century, in the processing of data stored on decks of punch card by unit record equipment, specifically the tabulating machine by Herman Hollerith, used for the 1890 United States Census. This was the earliest use of a machine-readable medium for data, rather than for control (as in Jacquard looms; today control corresponds to code), and thus the earliest processing of machine-read data was <b>batch</b> processing. Each <b>card</b> stored a separate record of data with different fields: cards were processed by the machine one by one, {{all in the same}} way, as a batch. Batch processing continued to be the dominant processing mode on mainframe computers from the earliest days of electronic computing in the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Litone {{black-and-white}} printing {{was introduced}} for some customer preferences in 1957 and eventually {{black and white}} replaced the sepia until colour became the norm. Gradually a niche market was carved out with Judges continuing to trade on its past reputation producing high quality cards of the more select tourist locations and increasingly <b>batches</b> of <b>cards</b> to specific order for many unusual organisations but primarily religious locations. Modern cards exist of small villages, country houses, retirement homes etc. Disaster did though almost strike in the early 1980s. The company was purchased by Peter Pugh of Burwood Ltd who were the selling agents for the Francis Frith Collection. However, the failure of an unrelated venture led to the company being placed {{in the hands of}} the receiver on 31 January 1984. Disaster though was averted and the company reformed as Judges Postcards Limited with the Wolford Family and former director Ernest C. Bartholomew taking control. Since then the company has developed from a niche producer, continuing producing cards to special order, but now producing larger quantities of cards of larger tourist locations for general sale and also developing cards of general interest such as the Thomas the Tank Engine Series. In 1995 postcards were only 30% of the company’s turnover and the percentage has decreased further since then.|$|R
50|$|Seating and {{the banker}} is decided through drawing the highest card, or by dice. The banker decides what {{the stakes are}} for the hand (it should be an even number {{so it can be}} split and within the margins agreed by consensus). The player to the banker's left shuffles then passes the deck to the banker's right who becomes the dealer. The dealer cuts and reveals a card. If the card is a 4 or 8, he deals first to himself. If it's a 3 or 7, the banker is dealt first. If it's a 2 or 6, the {{shuffler}} is dealt first. If it's a 1, 5, 9, Zero Cash, Half Cash, Hundred Myriad, Thousand Myriad, or Myriad Myriad, the banker's opposite gets dealt first. Each player is dealt 8 cards counter-clockwise, first as a <b>batch</b> of four <b>cards</b> then singles. The remaining eight cards form the stock which is flipped to reveal the bottom card.|$|R
40|$|The author {{looks at}} {{the context of the}} {{articles}} published in World Patent Information's first volume, in 1979, in the light of subsequent developments over the ensuing 25 years. He provides examples of articles from 1979 and from recent years to illustrate his comments. Amongst themes that continue to be significant throughout this period, are patent classification schemes, patent information for techno-commercial intelligence and policy analysis, and the less than optimal take up of patent information by actual and potential users. By contrast, the author notes that microfilm, punch <b>cards</b> and <b>batch</b> computer searching, key themes of 1979, have given way to Internet technology. In conclusion he emphasises both the massive changes brought about by technology changes and the substantially unchanging situation in many other respects, for example in the major players in the provision of patent information databases and in the importance of effective patent searching.

40|$|Transcription begins] 1 December 1944 Somewheres [sic] in Germany My Sweetie-pie, Just to {{show you}} how “screwed” up the mail could be, I {{received}} today an air mail letter dated Oct. 26. Don’t worry about the Christmas cards[. ] [S]end them out the way they are. After all, darling, it’s the sentiment behind the card that counts anyway. I’m sending out a <b>batch</b> of Christmas <b>cards,</b> too. The Army PX gave us a bunch of inexpensive picture Xmas cards and I am sending these to all of our friends. A lot of the people (i. e.) Altman, etc. have changed addresses and the cards should catch up with them by the coming summer at the latest. Darling, I adore you. I love you with every fibre [sic] of my being. I only wish I could put my words into actions. Today the weather was bleak and rainy, but this did not daunt us for Shelton and I went into town and took our shower-baths nevertheless. They were just as elegant as ever! Imagine 2 baths in 3 days—isn’t war hell? You know, the favorite tune of this ETO, don’t you? It’s “I’m Going to Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter” and make believe it came from you. With the mail set-up generally in these pars the song has much significance. Fortunately, I do not fall in this category. God bless you, darling! Last night I took all my letters and read them all over again. They were thrilling and made my heart skip a bit as well as getting me all “hot 2 ̆ 6 bothered” even when reading them for a second time. Honey, I counted the letters— 66 of them! I’ve got a few books[,] actually pictorial manuscripts[,] written in German which I plan to send you when I send the copies of “Stars and Stripes” 2 ̆ 6 “Yank” to you. One book is entitled the “Rheinland” or Rhineland country which portrays the country along the Rhine and the other book is “Germany Awake,” a book of Nazi propaganda beautifully illustrated which shows the rise of the Nazi party. One of the men has presented the battery Comdr. With a cross-bow he found. It was a weapon used in the 1400 s but I think this particular cross-bow is a copy of an original. At the present time we are listening to a news broadcast from the United States. It burns our guts to hear them mention towns as being captured when they usually change hands about 2 times. Always keep in mind that a lot goes on before a town is captured, including the loss of many lives. People have a tendency to look at the names of towns captured in an impersonal manner. I know I did the same thing before I came over here. Don’t conclude from the last paragraph that I’m becoming embittered or callous because I’m not. I’m still your loving husband who loves to “kid 2 ̆ 6 fool around” with the best of them. My morale is excellent and I am really happy and not nearly as “noivice in the soivece” (nervous in the service) as I imagined I’d be. Naturally, there are situations where I’d probably be a bit “ruffled,” too. Are you getting letters from any of the wives lately? Capt. Shaw sends you his regards and mentions frequently that he’d like to have a plat[e] of cabbage 2 ̆ 6 meat balls [sic]—pigs in the blanket. ” He got quite a kick visiting us in Alexandria and Lawton. I’m happy to hear that you’re getting along OK with the Sokols and Speerts and hope the attitude continues at least until I get home—then let whatever happens. I’ve got you and you got me! The radio is playing “I Walk Alone” so I’ll say good-night, my beloved darling. Sweet dreams—forever Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R
