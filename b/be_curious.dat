25|$|Tame {{reindeer}} {{are known}} to <b>be</b> <b>curious,</b> but even wild reindeer can <b>be</b> <b>curious</b> in some situations. The wild reindeer is a shy animal and it reacts very quickly to sudden sounds or movements {{as well as the}} smell of strangers. In spite of this, inexperienced animals may even approach quite closely to a hunter and curiously observe while the hunter is field dressing a downed animal. They have good hearing and a good sense of smell, but have poor eyesight. They may react to a hunter's movements, but not necessarily to his form if he doesn't move. Under the right conditions, a stealthy hunter may be able to approach surprisingly close to a reindeer, even when the hunter is in full sight of the animal. Many animals are shot at relatively close range (10–50 meters).|$|E
25|$|During his childhood, Langmuir was {{influenced}} by his older brother, Arthur Langmuir. Arthur was a research chemist who encouraged Irving to <b>be</b> <b>curious</b> about nature and how things work. Arthur helped Irving set up his first chemistry lab {{in the corner of}} his bedroom, and he was content to answer the myriad questions that Irving would pose. Langmuir's hobbies included mountaineering, skiing, piloting his own plane, and classical music. In addition to his professional interest in the politics of atomic energy, he was concerned about wilderness conservation.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where it had gone. When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to <b>be</b> <b>curious</b> as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

500|$|It Takes a Church has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Tom Conroy of Media Life enjoyed the premiere episode, {{arguing that it}} may even attract a secular audience: [...] "Even secular viewers will <b>be</b> <b>curious</b> to see which one Angela picks, and they’ll get a glimpse into a subculture that is largely invisible on TV. Members of that subculture, on the other hand, will watch It Takes a Church and say, 'Amen!'". Contrastly, Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times called the series [...] "utterly frivolous," [...] and called into question the [...] "state of America's spiritual health" [...] after watching an episode. Genzlinger also argued that the show was a {{not much more than}} a [...] "desperate" [...] effort to find something the conservative Christian audience will watch. Carrie Grosvenor of About Entertainment added that viewers should [...] "pass" [...] on the series, calling GSN's The American Bible Challenge a better [...] "solid game format." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} his hopes for fan {{reaction to the}} second season's emphasis on the Kazon, Piller said: [...] "I'll <b>be</b> <b>curious</b> {{to know what the}} audience's perception is, if our investing in the Kazon this season worked." [...] In response to fans' concerns that Voyager did not incorporate as many science fiction elements as previous Star Trek installments, he believed that the growing focus on the Kazon would serve as the solution. Piller believed the alien species accentuated the show's futuristic storylines, explaining: [...] "There {{are a lot of people}} who don't consider a lot [...] science fiction." [...] He followed this up by saying: [...] "But certainly you can make a case that facing the Kazon in battle is futurist storytelling." [...] Taylor viewed the second season as focused on [...] "character-driven, introspective" [...] stories, with a majority of the [...] "action-adventure" [...] aspects being conducted through the appearances of the Kazon.|$|E

Lo danced with until saying “I do” is her second husband Cris Judd, a professional dancer and choreographer. The lyrics go on to reference two more men, who {{would seem to be}} Ben Affleck (“went nowhere but kept the ring”) and Lopez’s current husband, Marc Anthony (“he sang to me.”)" [...] Allison Stewart from The Washington Post said that [...] "One Love" [...] examines all of her high-profiled relationships, and commented that Lopez is not [...] "trying to gin up controversy with these red-meat tidbits about her personal life. She honestly thought you might <b>be</b> <b>curious</b> about Ben Affleck and whatever happened to that huge engagement ring he gave her all those years ago, during Bennifer’s dark reign." ...|$|E

500|$|Kyra first {{appears in}} the season seven episode [...] "Cheaper by the Coven", when she helps Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause) uncover the {{identity}} of a masked demon attacking his son Wyatt Halliwell. She is shown as possessing the powers of precognition and divination {{through the use of a}} magical pool. She later works with the half-demon Sirk on his plans to track down and kill his mortal relatives in order to seal his transformation as a full demon. As a demon, Kyra cannot feel emotions, but she is shown to <b>be</b> <b>curious</b> about the world of mortals. Longing to experience the emotions she sees in her visions, she contacts the Elders (a council of whitelighters which governs the forces of good) to make a deal where she would trade her information on the then unknown threat, the Avatars, if she is made human. The Avatars are later revealed to a group of magical beings capable of warping reality who devote themselves to creating a world without good or evil. As word of Kyra's betrayal spreads across the Underworld, Leo is sent by the Avatars to save her and bring her to the Halliwell Manor during the negotiations.|$|E

The album features I'm Going Home from Arlo Guthrie and Here Before from Vashti Bunyan. It also contains guitar pieces by Andrés Segovia and Shin-Ichi Fukuda. Talking about the music, Kent said that [...] "You know it’s simple to compose happy or sad music, but {{to create something}} simple yet sophisticated, that calls the listener to <b>be</b> <b>curious</b> and yet uncertain and perhaps a little unnerved, well it called me to forget everything I knew about composition and discover a whole new musical language.

2500|$|On {{the topic}} of {{possible}} changes in behaviour did Ricky Spencer commented {{that it is not}} predictable how the interbreeding will affect the behaviour of the dingoes; he assumed that there could be potential problems since supposedly only dingoes are not accustomed to humans. According to David Jenkins, the claims stating that hybrids are bigger, more aggressive and a risk to public safety have so far not been supported by data and personal experience. He mentioned that there are reports of one or two unusually big dogs captured each year, but that most hybrids are close to what's considered to be the normal weight range of dingoes. In addition, Jenkins has encountered wild dingoes and hybrids and reported that [...] "there's something really going on in that hard-wired brain", but also that the dogs [...] "tend to <b>be</b> <b>curious,</b> rather than aggressive." ...|$|E
