40|$|To realign {{supervisory}} {{and market}} incentives, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) adjusts two principal features of federal banking supervision. First, it requires regulators to examine insured institutions more frequently {{and makes them}} accountable for exercising their supervisory powers. Second, the Act empowers regulators to wind up the affairs of troubled institutions before their accounting net worth is exhausted. Using 1984 – 2003 data {{on the outcome of}} individual <b>bank</b> <b>examinations,</b> this paper documents that the frequency of rating transitions and the character of insolvency resolutions have changed substantially under FDICIA. The average interval between <b>bank</b> <b>examinations</b> has dropped for low-rated banks in the post-FDICIA era. Examiner upgrades have become significantly more likely in the post-FDICIA era even after controlling for the state of the economy. However, in recessions managers are slower to correct problems that examiners identify. As a result, during downturns upgrades become less likely and absorptions become more likely. Giving the FDIC authority to wind up troubled banks before their tangible net worth is exhausted has reduced the role of government in the insolvency-resolution process. Consistent with an hypothesis that FDICIA has improved incentives, our data show that a markedly larger percentage of troubled banks now search for a merger partner rather than trying to stay in business until the regulators force them to fail. This greater reliance on quasi-voluntary mergers is observable both within and across various stages of the business cycle. These findings suggest that supervisory interventions became more effective at banks during the post-FDICIA era. ...|$|R

40|$|Certain nonrecurring {{circumstances}} {{associated with}} the passage of the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999 have created a unique opportunity for the market to obtain <b>bank</b> <b>examination</b> ratings of management quality. We utilize this natural experiment in order to determine how the market views this heretofore private information. We find that the stock market utilizes <b>bank</b> <b>examination</b> ratings in order to reveal regulatory intent, rather than simply as information about management quality. Revelation of unsatisfactory M ratings (denoted “bad news”) causes BHC stock returns and market risk betas to increase, whereas revelation of acceptable M ratings (“good news”) causes BHC stock returns and market risk betas to decrease. The market thrives on “bad news” because unsatisfactory M ratings indicate that regulatory intervention is likely to occur, possibly benefiting both shareholders and creditors. On the other hand, revelation of acceptable M ratings (“good news”) indicates that bank regulators are unprepared to intervene in the near future. Moreover, we find lower bond spreads for a subsample of FHCs with satisfactory M ratings revealed upon conversion. ...|$|E

The Federal Reserve has taken actions responsive to most of the 1996 report's recommendations. The Federal Reserve has retained its structure but has sought to consolidate operations and bring common management practices to the 12 Federal Reserve District Banks. In particular, the Federal Reserve now manages the payment services it provides to banks on a systemwide basis. The Federal Reserve has also changed its budgeting, internal oversight, and cost accounting processes in an effort to increase accountability. It has taken other steps to decrease costs in areas identified by the 1996 report. Specifically, the Reserve Banks have consolidated their purchase of some services, such as prescription drug coverage, to take advantage of volume discounts, rather than continuing with the former practice of each individual Reserve Bank purchasing services separately. The Federal Reserve, however, continues not charging for <b>bank</b> <b>examinations.</b> Federal Reserve officials explained that they continue to believe that charging for <b>bank</b> <b>examinations</b> would tip the current balance against state charter banks, and thus be inconsistent with maintaining the dual banking system of state and nationally charter banks. Although a strong argument exists for industry funding of federal supervision and regulation, GAO recognizes the benefits of the dual banking system.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of recent studies {{concluding}} that financial markets effectively demand risk premia on noninsured bank securities, the debate has intensified over whether we should place greater reliance on markets and less reliance on direct regulatory oversight. This study contributes to the debate by investigating {{the interaction between the}} market's pricing of bank equity securities and the regulatory examination process during the early stages of New England's banking crisis in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. It addresses the concern that reducing regulatory oversight may adversely affect the market's ability to price bank securities effectively. The author finds that the <b>bank</b> <b>examination</b> process contributed significantly to the market's understanding of financial problems at New England banks. Bank examiners appear to have uncovered problems that bank management was unwilling to disclose publicly., since accounting performance measures were significantly different in exam quarters that resulted in supervisory downgrades than they were in all other quarters. In addition, market participants appeared to find this information useful, driving down stock prices in the quarter after the exam, the period when the poor performance measures associated with the exam are generally disclosed. The author suggests caution in considering market discipline as a substitute for regulatory oversight; the results of his study suggests it should more appropriately be considered as a complement.

40|$|One major {{purpose of}} federal and state {{regulation}} of banks is to ensure that institutions maintain safe-and-sound business practices. The main tool used to achieve this goal is bank supervision in general—and <b>bank</b> safety-and-soundness <b>examinations</b> in particular. Regulators conduct on-site examinations to ensure that bank operations are consistent with sound banking practices. When on-site examinations identify unsafe, unsound, or illegal banking practices, regulators use a variety of supervisory enforcement actions to require institutions to take corrective measures. These enforcement actions are intended to accomplish several things, including: bringing about alterations in the practices and behavior that caused the problems, stabilizing the institutions, and averting potential losses to the deposit insurance fund. Violations of enforcement agreements are a serious matter—noncompliance often carries heavy penalties, including the termination of deposit insurance. This article investigates the effects of <b>bank</b> <b>examinations</b> and enforcement actions on the behavior of problem banks. We provide information on the effectiveness of supervision of distressed institutions through the issuance of formal enforcement actions during the 1980 s and 1990 s, a period of greater stress and turmoil for U. S. financial institutions than any other since the Great Depression. The first section discusses the legal and regulatory framework for the application of formal enforcement actions.

40|$|Locating the {{function}} of bank supervision in the central bank has been a contentious issue, both domestically and internationally. Most discussions {{of the role of}} bank supervision in central banking have focused on crisis management and the responsibilities of the central bank as a lender of last resort. However, recent research by the authors has shown that confidential supervisory information garnered through <b>bank</b> <b>examinations</b> potentially can improve the forecasts of key macroeconomic variables and thus the conduct of monetary policy. Forecasting macroeconomic variables is essential to the conduct of monetary policy, since the long lags in the effect of monetary policy ensure that changes in monetary policy today alter the economy only in the future. This article explores further the robustness of the results reported earlier. It examines the pattern of the forecast errors of the individual private forecasters studied, and confirms the earlier results. Thus, the article concludes that an important reason for central banks to have access to confidential supervisory information, and possibly to participate in its collection, is that such information can improve macroeconomic forecasts and in this way improve monetary policy decision-making.
