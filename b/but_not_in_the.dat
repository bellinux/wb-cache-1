5|$|A small parrot ulna {{found on}} the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, {{an island in the}} Guadeloupe region, was {{assigned}} to the Lesser Antillean macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001. In 2008, the ornithologists Storrs Olson and Edgar Maíz López cast doubt upon this identification, and proposed that the bone instead belonged to the extant imperial amazon (Amazona imperialis). The size and robustness of the bone was similar to ulnae of the imperial amazon, and though it was worn, the authors identified {{what appeared to be a}} notch, which is also present on ulnae of the genus Amazona, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Ara. Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw. The species was recognized by Birdlife International and the IUCN Red List until 2013, but was not considered valid thereafter.|$|E

Kinks frontman Ray Davies constructed the concept album as the soundtrack to a Granada Television play and developed the storyline with novelist Julian Mitchell; however, the television programme was cancelled and never produced. The rough plot revolved around Arthur Morgan, a carpet-layer, who {{was based on}} Ray and guitarist Dave Davies' brother-in-law Arthur Anning. A mono version was released in the UK, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US. It is now available on the 2011 deluxe-edition re-issue.|$|E

5|$|In the Permian period, the Zion and Kolob {{area was}} a {{relatively}} flat basin near sea level on the western margin of the supercontinent Pangaea. Sediments from surrounding mountains added weight to the basin, keeping it at relatively the same elevation. These sediments later lithified (turned to rock) to form the Toroweap Formation, now exposed in the Grand Canyon to the south <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Zion and Kolob area. This formation is not exposed in the park, though it does form its basement rock.|$|E

5|$|Seattle in {{this period}} {{attracted}} widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, {{as well as through}} the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention—hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999—garnered visibility, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself. The city was further shaken by the Mardi Gras Riots in 2001, and then literally shaken the following day by the Nisqually earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and boiling (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727°C), <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boiling point (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E
