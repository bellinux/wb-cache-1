40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{differentiate}} hop pellets by essential oil analysis. Volatile compounds of five aromatic cultivars (Styrie, Saaz, Lublin, Mount Hood, and Hallertau) and seven bitter cultivars (Northern Brewer, Nugget, Pride of Ringwood, Northdown, Galena, Target, and Challenger) were extracted with a Likens-Nickerson simultaneous solvent extractor. The extracts had a strong hop aroma that varied according to the type of hop. Approximately 100 compounds were separated by gas chromatography (GC) and identified by GC-mass spectrometry. An identification flowchart including seven terpenic compounds, four esters, and one methyl ketone was established to discriminate between fresh samples of the 12 investigated cultivars. High amounts of bergamotene and farnesene were found only in Saaz, Lublin, and Styrie samples. Quantification of 4 -decenoic acid methyl ester and 3 -methyl <b>butyl</b> <b>isobutyrate</b> proved a quick means of distinguishing non-European and European bitter hops from aromatic cultivars...|$|E
40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{coefficients of}} oligomeric radicals in monomer-polymer systems {{have a major}} influence on properties such as polymerization rates and molecular weight distributions. The present work reports the results of an extensive set of studies of diffusion coefficients of rubbery ternary systems comprising polymer, diluent, and oligomer, determined by pulsed-field-gradient NMR, at 25 and 40 degrees C. Oligomers of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and of butyl methacrylate (BMA) were synthesized by using a catalytic cobalt chain transfer agent to produce macromonomers with a terminal double bond. Where necessary, these were fractionated by preparative GPC to obtain samples ranging from dimeric to decameric; typical polydispersities were 1. 08. Pulsed-field gradient NMR is facilitated by being able to monitor the proton NMR of the CH 2 hydrogens on the double bond. Matrixes used were high molecular weight polyMMA and polyBMA, the weight fraction of polymer (w(p)) being varied by adding appropriate amounts of diluent (the saturated equivalents of MMA and BMA, viz., methyl isobutyrate and <b>butyl</b> <b>isobutyrate).</b> Above c* (the concentration at which chains start to overlap), all data for diffusion coefficients Di of an oligomer of degree of polymerization i could be fitted with acceptable accuracy by D- 1 (w(p)) /D-i(w(p)) = i(0. 664 + 2. 02 wp), for both BMA and MMA oligomers in both MMA and BMA matrixes; the same relation also fits earlier data on styrene oligomers in polystyrene. If more accurate scaling parameters are obtained experimentally for smaller oligomers, these can be used to predict data for higher oligomers with even better reliability. For MMA monomer in pMMA, where free-volume parameters are available, the predicted dependences of monomer diffusion coefficient on w(p) and temperature are in accord with experiment...|$|E
40|$|Inside a live {{butterfly}} exhibit, {{we conducted}} bioassays {{to determine whether}} the presence of color would facilitate the location of attractants by the butterflies. It was found that color facilitated odor attraction in some species that feed on flowers (Parthenos silvia, Heraclides thoas, Dryas julia, and Idea leuconoe), but not in the exclusively fruit-feeding species, such as Morpho helenor, hence demonstrating that species with different natural diets use different foraging cues. Green, ripe, and fermented bananas were evaluated for their attractiveness to butterflies together with honey and mangoes. The fermented bananas were determined to be the most attractive bait, and the electrophysiological responses to their volatiles were studied in Morpho helenor and Caligo telamonius. During GC-EAD evaluation, fifteen different aliphatic esters, such as isobutyl <b>isobutyrate,</b> <b>butyl</b> acetate, ethyl butanoate, and butyl butanoate (both fermentation products and fruit semiochemicals) were shown to be detected by the butterfliesâ€™ sensory apparatus located in the forelegs, midlegs, proboscis, labial palpi, and antennae. Legs, proboscis, and antennae of Morpho helenor and Caligo telamonius showed similar sensitivity, reacting to 11 chemicals, while labial palpi had a lower signal-to-noise ratio and responded to seven chemicals, only three of which produced responses in other organs...|$|R
