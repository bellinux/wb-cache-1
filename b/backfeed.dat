50|$|The Rectiverter has {{a unique}} {{electronic}} <b>backfeed</b> protection which has passed an extensive test program in order to comply with international UPS standards. The UL standard prescribes the following requirement regarding so called <b>backfeed</b> protection.|$|E
50|$|Power grid loads may <b>backfeed</b> if {{they also}} have {{distributed}} generation installed, such as a grid-connected photovoltaic solar power system or a microturbine-based power generator. It is also possible for an electric motor to temporarily <b>backfeed</b> if it is mechanically driven (see regenerative braking).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Backfeeding</b> is flow of {{electrical}} {{energy in the}} reverse direction from its normal flow. For example, <b>backfeeding</b> may occur when electrical power is injected into the local power grid from a source other than a utility company generator.|$|R
50|$|A {{generator}} interlock kit (or just interlock kit) is {{a device}} {{designed to allow}} safe <b>backfeeding</b> of a home through a portable generator during power outages, thereby eliminating illegal and/or unsafe generator <b>backfeeding</b> situations that could potentially electrocute power linemen or destroy the generator.|$|R
50|$|By definition, <b>backfeeding</b> causes {{electrical}} power to {{flow in the}} opposite direction from its usual flow. When studying <b>backfeeding,</b> engineers must understand the transfer of {{electrical power}}, and not confuse this with momentary AC voltages or current flows viewed in isolation from the overall situation.|$|R
50|$|A {{generator}} interlock kit {{is installed}} on the front cover of the home's breaker panel. It consists of two sliding steel or plastic (depending on the brand) plates held together by three bolts. When moved down, the plate blocks the generator <b>backfeed</b> circuit breaker and allows the main breaker to remain on; when moved up, the generator <b>backfeed</b> circuit breaker may be turned on, but the main circuit breaker is blocked and will remain off. The generator <b>backfeed</b> circuit breaker is connected to a generator inlet installed (preferably) {{on the outside of}} the structure. A short cord connects the generator to the house inlet, usually through the use of twistlock plugs and sockets.|$|E

5000|$|... "A UPS {{shall be}} {{provided}} with <b>backfeed</b> protection to prevent involving a risk of electric shock from being present on its input AC terminals during interruption of the input power." ...|$|E
50|$|Because it {{involves}} transfer of {{significant amounts of}} energy, <b>backfeeding</b> must be carefully controlled and monitored. Personnel working on equipment subject to <b>backfeeding</b> {{must be aware of}} all possible power sources, and follow systematic protocols to ensure that equipment is fully de-energized before commencing work, or use special equipment and techniques suitable for working on live equipment.|$|R
50|$|It is {{generally}} {{required that the}} closed transition, or overlap time, be less than 100 milliseconds. If either source is not present or not acceptable (such as when normal power fails) the switch must operate in a break-before-make mode (standard open transition operation) to ensure no <b>backfeeding</b> occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, it is {{important}} to prevent <b>backfeeding</b> when using a portable engine generator, which can harm utility workers or people in other buildings. Before turning on a diesel- or gasoline-powered generator, users should make sure that the main breaker is in the [...] "off" [...] position, to ensure that the electric current does not reverse.|$|R
50|$|Rota vector is a {{gear set}} {{used in the}} {{robotics}} and machine tool industry for a large gear reduction in a confined space {{with little or no}} backlash or <b>backfeed</b> interference.|$|E
5000|$|Removing the {{electrical}} panel's cover could allow the generator <b>backfeed</b> breaker {{to be turned}} on while the main is on, potentially energizing power lines or overloading the generator, if the generator is connected.|$|E
5000|$|Power grid {{generators}} normally {{pump energy}} into the grid, making it available for others to use. A power station will typically <b>backfeed</b> (and thus consume power) when it is shut down, due to its own local loads (e.g. lights or repair equipment).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the main}} {{reservoir}} pipe is kept constantly pressurized by the locomotive, the car reservoirs can be charged independently of the brake pipe, this being accomplished via a check valve to prevent <b>backfeeding</b> into the pipe. This arrangement helps to reduce the above described pressure loss problems, and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release, since the brake pipe only has to recharge itself.|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} three turbines in operation. One smaller turbine runs off high pressure steam which then <b>backfeeds</b> {{into the main}} intermediate pressure system that feeds the two main units. Condensers on {{the back end of}} the main turbines are fed cooled water from the cooling tower to condense the steam back into water. Additional condensate gained in this process is reinjected back into the ground.|$|R

50|$|For cost reasons, many of {{the circuit}} (overcurrent) {{protection}} and power quality control (voltage regulation) devices used by electric utility companies are designed {{with the assumption that}} power always flows in one direction. An interconnection agreement can be arranged for equipment designed to <b>backfeed</b> between an electric utility customer with distributed generation and their power company. This type of interconnection can involve nontrivial engineering, and possibly equipment upgrade costs to keep the distribution circuit properly protected. Such costs may be minimized by limiting distributed generation capacity to less than is locally consumed, and guaranteeing this condition by installing a reverse-power cutoff relay that opens if backfeeding occurs.|$|E
40|$|Instructions and labels {{supplied}} with listed PV modules and {{the requirements of}} the National Electrical Code (NEC) dictate that a series fuse shall be used to protect the module against <b>backfeed</b> currents. Few of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} low-voltage (12, 24, and 48 -volt) stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) power systems use series fuses on each module or string of modules. Tests and simulations at the Southwest Technology Development Institute (TDI) and at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) have established that the absence of these fuses can pose significant fire and safety hazards even on 12 -volt PV systems. If the system has sufficient <b>backfeed</b> voltage and current, it is possible that a ground fault in the wiring or inside a module can result in the destruction of a PV module...|$|E

The system provides 13. 8 kV power to Main Injector accelerator (accelerator and conventional loads) and is capable of providing power {{to the rest of}} the laboratory (<b>backfeed</b> system). Design criteria, and features including simulation results are given...|$|E
40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) power systems, {{like other}} {{electrical}} systems, {{may be subject}} to unexpected ground faults. Installed PV systems always have invisible elements other than those indicated by their electrical schematics. Stray inductance, capacitance and resistance are distributed throughout the system. Leakage currents associated with the PV modules, the interconnected array, wires, surge protection devices and conduit add up and can become large enough to look like a ground-fault. PV systems are frequently connected to other sources of power or energy storage such as batteries, standby generators, and the utility grid. This complex arrangement of distributed power and energy sources, distributed impedance and proximity to other sources of power requires sensing of ground faults and proper reaction by the ground-fault protection devices. The different dc grounding requirements (country to country) often add more confusion to the situation. This paper discusses the ground-fault issues associated with both the dc and ac side of PV systems and presents test results and operational impacts of <b>backfeeding</b> commercially available ac ground-fault protection devices under various modes of operation. Further, the measured effects of <b>backfeeding</b> the tripped ground-fault devices for periods of time comparable to anti-islanding allowances for utility interconnection of PV inverters in the United States are reported...|$|R
50|$|As {{satellite}} dishes became {{smaller and more}} affordable, most satellite signal providers adopted various forms of encryption in order to limit reception to certain groups (such as hotels, cable companies, or paid subscribers) or to specific political regions. Early encryption attempts such as Videocipher II were common targets for pirate decryption as dismayed viewers saw large amounts of formerly-unencrypted programming vanishing. Nowadays some free-to-air satellite content in the USA still remains, {{but many of the}} channels still in the clear are ethnic channels, local over-the-air TV stations, international broadcasters, religious programming, <b>backfeeds</b> of network programming destined to local TV stations or signals uplinked from mobile satellite trucks to provide live news and sports coverage.|$|R
5000|$|An open {{transition}} {{transfer switch}} is also called a break-before-make transfer switch. A break-before-make transfer switch breaks contact with {{one source of}} power before it makes contact with another. It prevents <b>backfeeding</b> from an emergency generator back into the utility line, for example.One example is an open transition automatic transfer switch (ATS). During the split second of the power transfer the flow of electricity is interrupted. Another example is a manual three position switch or circuit breaker, with utility power on one side, the generator on the other, and [...] "off" [...] in the middle, which requires the user to switch through the full disconnect [...] "off" [...] position before making the next connection.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis article {{explores the}} {{potential}} of blockchain technology in enabling {{a new system of}} value that will better support the dynamics of social sharing. Our study begins with a discussion of the evolution of value perceptions in the history of economic thought. Starting with a view on value as a coordination mechanism that defines meaningful action within a certain context, we associate the price system with the establishment of capitalism and the industrial economy. We then discuss its relevance to the information economy, exhibited as the techno-economic context of the sharing economy, and identify new modalities of value creation that better reflect the social relations of sharing. Through the illustrative case of <b>Backfeed,</b> a new system of value is envisioned, comprising three layers: (a) production of value; (b) record of value; and (c) actualisation of value. In this framework, we discuss the solutions featured by <b>Backfeed</b> and describe a conceptual economic model of blockchain-based decentralised cooperation. We conclude with a tentative scenario for blockchain technology that can enable the creation of commons-oriented ecosystems in a sharing economy...|$|E
