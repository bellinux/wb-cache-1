5000|$|A {{parallel}} later ancient {{measurement of}} the size of the Earth was made by another Greek scholar, Posidonius. He is said to have noted that the star Canopus was hidden from view in most parts of Greece but that it just grazed the horizon at Rhodes. Posidonius is supposed to have measured the elevation of Canopus at Alexandria and determined that the angle was 1/48 of circle. He assumed the distance from Alexandria to Rhodes to be 5000 stadia, and so he computed the Earth's circumference in stadia as 48 times 5000 = 240,000. Some scholars see these results as luckily semi-accurate due to cancellation of errors. But since the Canopus observations are both mistaken by over a degree, the [...] "experiment" [...] may be not much more than a recycling of Eratosthenes's numbers, while altering 1/50 to the correct 1/48 of a circle. Later, either he or a follower appears to have altered the <b>base</b> <b>distance</b> to agree with Eratosthenes's Alexandria-to-Rhodes figure of 3750 stadia since Posidonius's final circumference was 180,000 stadia, which equals 48×3750 stadia. The 180,000 stadia circumference of Posidonius is suspiciously close to that which results from another method of measuring the earth, by timing ocean sunsets from different heights, a method which is inaccurate due to horizontal atmospheric refraction.|$|E

So far, display designers still have a relative lack of knowledge about the relevant subjective attributes of crosstalk and how they are combined in an overall 3 D viewing experience model. The aim of the current experiment is to investigate three perceptually important attributes influencing the overall viewing experience: perceived image distortion, perceived depth, and visual strain. The stimulus material used in this experiment consisted of two natural scenes varying in depth (0, 4, and 12 cm camera <b>base</b> <b>distance)</b> and crosstalk level (0, 5, 10, and 15 %). Subjects rated the attributes according to the ITU BT. 500 – 10 in a controlled experiment. Results show that image distortion ratings show a clear increase with increasing crosstalk and increasing camera <b>base</b> <b>distance.</b> Especially higher crosstalk levels are more visible at larger camera base distances.

Recent excavation work on a heritage listed site in the Townsville hinterland has revealed a possible smith dating to the mid- 1860 s that also deviates from Light's criteria, hinting that other factors, such as the customer <b>base,</b> <b>distance</b> from a main town and the experience of the smithy himself, may be important for the shop’s design and layout.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} the mathematical synthesis of the method of passive location of a seismic wave source. The method employs measurements of regular attenuation of seismic oscillation amplitudes. If it is impossible to determine {{the location of a}} seismic event by means of direct measurements, indirect measurements are needed. A priori information for the mathematical synthesis was obtained from functional equations showing inverse proportions of measured amplitudes, arbitrary effective attenuation coefficients and corresponding coordinates. An original method was applied to process the data. The method providing for passive location of seismic waves sources has been developed; it is called the radial basic method. In the one-dimensional case, a distance is determined on the basis of seismic oscillation amplitudes measured by two seismographs that are located at a known <b>base</b> <b>distance</b> coinciding with the direction to the source of seismic waves. The distance is calculated from the receiver that is nearest to the source. If the <b>base</b> <b>distance</b> and the direct line between the seismograph and the seismic wave source do not coincide, a projection of the distance between the receivers to the given straight line is taken into account. Three seismographs were placed at mutually perpendicular base distances in a plane (i. e. the two-dimensional space).  This allowed us to obtain an analytical equation for determining the direction to the seismic wave source using measured amplitudes. The value of the angle is taken into account when calculating the distance. For the seismic wave source located in the three-dimensional space, transition equations for combined coordinate systems (i. e. the Descartes (Cartesian)), at the axes of which the seismographs were placed, and the spherical coordinate systems were applied, and analytical equations were obtained for determination of coordinates, such as distance/polar radius, elevation angle/latitude, and bearing angle/longitude. To analyze the application of the radial basic method of passive location, an absolute error resulting from indirect measurement was calculated. This method is a special case of determining the statistical characteristics of the sought function (coordinates) out of random values, which are the measured amplitudes of seismic oscillations. In the obtained analytical expressions for determination of the mean square deviation of the distance and direction to the seismic wave source, noise from seismographs is taken into account, as well as external noise manifested as microseisms and other interfering seismic waves. For the three-dimensional space, equations are derived for calculation of RMS distance, elevation and bearing angles. In cases where distances to seismic wave sources, directions, coefficients that factor properties of the medium, and base distances are known, the radial basic method allows us to determine effective coefficients of seismic wave attenuation and capacities of seismic wave sources. </p...|$|E

The objective {{of this paper is to}} show how the PSA can be used for improving the design of the coupled plants.

The results of the PSA show that the average frequency of an accident at this complex that could affect the population is 7 × 10 − 8 year− 1 which is divided into the various end states. The dominant sequences are those that result in a methane explosion and occur with a frequency of 6. 5 × 10 − 8 year− 1, while the other sequences are much less frequent. The health risk presents itself if there are people in the vicinity who could be affected by the explosion.

Here, we examine a possible role of these hair receptors in three-dimensional (3 -D) path integration of the (formicine) desert ant, Cataglyphis fortis. Cataglyphis judge the ground distance when travelling over hills, allowing correct homing even in (unpredictably) uneven terrain. We eliminated the function of these hair sensors in graviception either by shaving the hairs or by immobilising the joints monitored by the hair plates. With that major component of their sense of graviception eliminated, one would expect the ants to disregard, or at least misgauge, the ascents and descents performed across hills during outbound journey. The ants should thus consider the (much longer) actual walking trajectory, instead of the <b>base</b> <b>distance,</b> when calculating their homing distance. Surprisingly, neither shaving nor immobilisation of the hair sensillae affected correct path integration, across both uneven terrain (3 -D) and level surface. If anything, the ants underestimated homing distance, which may reflect a general, safety-oriented navigation strategy. Animals that had performed the outbound journey with their gaster fixed in a horizontal position underestimated their homing so dramatically that this latter explanation cannot hold...|$|E

However, when mapping is about assigning reads to a set of RNA variants, in the case of simultaneous sequencing,the task become hard to handle. Many algorithms have been developed to overcome the issue of mapping readsagainst a set of homologous sequences at one time but the problem is not fully resolved, particularly when dealingwith short reads. The issue addressed in our study is much more challenging; In addition to the parallel assignmentissue in the presence of short reads, RNA variants molecules, used for the library sequencing preparation step,undergo a specific experimental treatment SHAPE causing the formation of mutations at the level of structurallyunpaired nucleotides.

DEMs are regular or irregular planimetric grid points with associated elevation values: they are three-dimensional ground surface digital reconstructions. Digital models can be obtained by means of several geodetic techniques like digital aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry, airborne and terrestrial laser scanning, SAR satellite interferometry and GPS kinematic. DEMs internal precisions are strictly related to the selected surveying method, to the operative working conditions and to morphological features of the studied area. The digital approach for measurement of points from photogrammetric stereopairs make use of image correlation processes which are based on well defined shape comparison techniques or on the grey level distribution in the corrisponding zones of the images. The precision of a photogrammetric DEM depends on the morphology of the terrain, on the inclination, on the images quality, on the presence of break-lines and vegetation, on the resolution at ground (and therefore on the scale of aerial photograph and pixel dimension), on the ratio between the distance (camera-terrain) and the <b>base</b> (<b>distance</b> between the two acquisition points). 3 D data derived by digital photogrammetric processing have recently demonstrated remarkable potentialities for the study of landslides and volcanic areas; models generated at different epochs can be differenced in order to determine displacements and large morphological variation...|$|E
