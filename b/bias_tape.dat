5000|$|<b>Bias</b> <b>tape</b> or {{bias binding}} is a {{narrow strip of}} fabric, cut on the bias. The strip's fibers, being at 45 degrees {{to the length of}} the strip, makes it stretchier as well as more fluid and more drapeable {{compared}} to a strip that is cut on the grain. Many strips can be pieced together into a long [...] "tape." [...] The tape's width varies from about 1/2" [...] to about 3" [...] depending on applications. <b>Bias</b> <b>tape</b> is used in making piping, binding seams, finishing raw edges, etc. It is often used on the edges of quilts, placemats, and bibs, around armhole and neckline edges instead of a facing, and as a simple strap or tie for casual bags or clothing.|$|E

25|$|Notches {{on top of}} the {{cassette}} shell indicate the type of tape. Type I cassettes have only write-protect notches, Type II have an additional pair next to the write protection ones, and Type IV (metal) have a third set near the middle of the top of {{the cassette}} shell. These allow later cassette decks to detect the tape type automatically and select the proper bias and equalization. Virtually all recent hi-fi systems (with cassette decks) lack this feature; only a small niche of cassette decks (hi-fi separates) have the tape type selector. Playing Type II and IV tapes on a player without detection will produce exaggerated treble, {{but it may not be}} noticeable because such devices typically have amplifiers that lack extended high-frequency output. Recording on these units, however, results in very low sound reproduction, and sometimes distortion and noise is heard. Also, these cheaper units cannot erase high bias or metal <b>bias</b> <b>tapes.</b> Attempting to do so will result in an incomplete erasure. This is due to the fact that the bias levels for high and metal position require greater levels.|$|R
50|$|In {{magnetic}} tape recording, the term bias {{is also used}} for a high-frequency signal added to the audio signal applied to the recording head, {{to improve the quality}} of the recording on the tape. This is called <b>tape</b> <b>bias.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} for solving efficiently the catenary problem encountered in surveying with tapes is presented. The {{theory of the}} catenary solution is outlined, and our technique is shown to solve correctly the catenary for all conditions. Analysis of error that compared the catenary correction to the more commonly used parabolic correction indicated that for slopes over 10 degrees and taped distances greater than 200 feet, systematic error inherent in the parabola may preclude the accuracy required for second- or even third-order surveys. An analysis of tension-gauge <b>bias</b> on <b>taping</b> errors is similar, but here the error is found to depend almost entirely upon taping distance...|$|R

5000|$|Petersham ribbon, {{also called}} Petersham facing or simply Petersham, is a thick, stiff, {{flexible}} corded ribbon usually {{made out of}} either cotton, rayon, viscose, or a cotton/ rayon or viscose blend of fibers and used as facing by milliners and tailors. Petersham is frequently watered {{on both sides and}} comes with a scalloped edge. It is woven so that once steamed, it will take on and support a particular curve of fabric. This makes it useful for obtaining a smooth edge on the brim of a hat, for example, without forming puckers or wrinkles which would result from the use of traditional flat ribbon or other flat fabric. [...] It is also useful as an alternative to <b>bias</b> <b>tape</b> for making fabric conform closely to the shape of the body wearing it— in a corset, for example, or along the waistline of a pair of trousers or a skirt. Petersham is very similar to grosgrain ribbon in appearance: both have closely spaced horizontal ridges, but Petersham has a flexible picot edge allowing it to be shaped with an iron, whereas grosgrain cannot be shaped this way.|$|E

40|$|This look is {{inspired}} by my artwork called, 2 ̆ 2 Hi-ro-eh-rok, 2 ̆ 2  which consists of four paintings that each represents the feelings of happiness, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. This design mainly focuses on emotion of anger and sorrow. Originally the artwork was more colorful, however, black and gray tones are used throughout to emphasize the deep and dark feelings. The abstract faces showing emotions in the painting were transferred onto the fabric using low impact digital textile printing on organic cotton. During the process of transferring print from painting onto the fabric, the pattern was slightly altered to resemble camouflage to convey a more fashionable look, but individual faces of expression can still be seen. The organza blazer is layered over the print top allowing the layering of sheer fabric to create new shades of the print on the fabric to expand range of emotion and its depth. The use of organza fabric in a men 2 ̆ 7 s suit is unexpected. All the seams are bound with satin <b>bias</b> <b>tape,</b> so it looks clean on the inside {{as well as the}} outer appearance.

50|$|<b>Tape</b> <b>bias</b> is {{the term}} for two techniques, AC bias and DC bias, that improve the {{fidelity}} of analogue <b>tape</b> recorders.

40|$|During {{phenolic}} liner manufacture, resin-impregnated (pre-preg) <b>bias</b> <b>tape</b> of silica, glass, or {{carbon cloth}} is tape-wrapped, cured, machined, and then wiped with 1, 1, 1 tri-chloroethane (TCA) to remove contaminants {{that may have}} been introduced during machining and handling. Following the TCA wipe, the machined surface is given a resin wet-coat and over-wrapped with more prepreg and cured. A TCA replacement solvent for these wiping operations must effectively remove both surface contaminants, and sub-surface oils and greases while not compromising the integrity of this interface. Selection of a TCA replacement solvent for phenolic over-wrap interface cleaning began with sub-scale compatibility tests with cured phenolics. Additional compatibility tests included assessment of solvent retention in machined phenolic surfaces. Results from these tests showed that, while the candidate solvent did not degrade the cured phenolics, it was retained in higher concentrations than TCA in phenolic surfaces. This effect was most pronounced with glass and silica cloth phenolics with steep ply angles relative to the wiped surfaces...|$|E

50|$|One {{significant}} advantage {{offered by}} DASH recorders over the analog recorders {{of the day}} was that 'proper' <b>tape</b> <b>biasing</b> was unimportant, as there is no means for the tape to 'color' the sound of the recorded data. This was a nice advantage, and routine maintenance amounted to not much more than keeping the tape guides clean. Due to this fact, the formulation of tape does not change the sound quality, unlike analog machines which must be set for specific formulae.|$|R
50|$|Later models {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} AC <b>tape</b> <b>bias,</b> and thereby improved the sound quality by largely eliminating background hiss. The resulting reproduction was so great an advance on any existing recording method that even those well acquainted with the industry could not tell the recordings from live play. Adolf Hitler used these machines to perform {{what appeared to be}} live broadcasts from one city while he was in another. A cache of 350 of these tapes was released years later when they were found in Koblenz.|$|R
50|$|DASH {{recorders}} (as well as {{any other}} type of digital recorder using magnetic tape) require the use of metal-particle formulation magnetic tape. Given the correct <b>bias,</b> professional analog <b>tape</b> recorders could possibly benefit from the use of metal particle tape as consumer cassette decks had; but the headstacks will wear at a significantly accelerated pace compared to oxide-based material, and therefore outweighing any benefits. Due to this fact, open reel tape of this type was previously not widely available before or after these digital machines were in fashion. Some examples of metal particle tape compatible with DASH machines are 3M Scotch 275, Ampex / Quantegy 467, EMTEC 931, and Sony's own tape formulation. These tape formulations are not directly compatible with any analog open-reel tape recorder.|$|R
