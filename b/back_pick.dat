50|$|Some {{units are}} {{mounted on a}} vehicle, usually a truck {{or it can be}} mounted on a flat <b>back</b> <b>pick</b> up van known as a self drive, though other {{vehicles}} are possible, such as railway cars. This vehicle provides mobility, and may also help stabilize the unit — though outrigger stabilizers are still typical, especially as vehicle-mounted AWPs are amongst the largest of their kind. The vehicle may also increase functionality by serving as mobile workshop or store.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, you {{can take}} <b>back</b> (<b>pick</b> up) a don't pass or don't come bet after the first roll, but this cannot be recommended, because you already endured the {{disadvantaged}} part of the combination - the first roll. On that come-out roll, you win just 3 times (2 and 3), while losing 8 of them (7 and 11) and pushing once (12) out of the 36 possible rolls. On the other 24 rolls that become a point, your don't pass bet is now to your advantage by 6:3 (4 and 10), 6:4 (5 and 9) and 6:5 (6 and 8). If a player chooses to remove the initial don't come and/or don't pass line bet, {{he or she can}} no longer lay odds behind the bet and cannot re-bet the same don't pass and/or don't come number (players must make a new don't pass or come bets if desired). However, players can still make standard lay bets odds on any of the point numbers (4,5,6,8,9,10).|$|E

6000|$|... 'Indeed, your lordship,' he sneered, {{with the}} devil peeping out through his eyes. With a violent wrench he freed himself from my grasp, and {{springing}} <b>back,</b> <b>picked</b> up the sword which he had dropped.|$|R
50|$|After {{missing the}} first 11 {{weeks of the}} 2015 season, Lane {{returned}} to the Seahawks in their Week 12 matchup against the Steelers. Lane recorded an interception in his first quarter <b>back,</b> <b>picking</b> off backup quarterback Landry Jones on a fake field goal attempt.|$|R

He arrived in the boat with four spear thrusts, got his Winchester, and with it got a man for every shot. Then we pulled aboard the schooner, and doctored up.|$|R

50|$|In the fumblerooski, {{the quarterback}} takes the snap and {{immediately}} places the ball, unseen by the defense, on the ground. This is technically a fumble, {{and thus the}} name of the play. The quarterback then moves away from the ball, faking a pass or setting up for a fake hand-off {{to one side of the}} line. Meanwhile, one of the <b>backs</b> <b>picks</b> up the ball and starts a rush in the opposite direction. In general terms the play is very similar to the Statue of Liberty, although it gives the quarterback more room for motion.|$|R
50|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Marcus Raboy and was filmed at the Brooklyn Bridge and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. It begins with K'naan walking across the bridge and he buys a vinyl record at the Pass Out Records store. While K'naan is walking along a street, Chubb Rock drives up in a 1965 Pontiac Catalina with two large speakers in the <b>back,</b> <b>picks</b> up K'naan, {{they go to a}} party. K'naan then walks along a street, under an elevated Subway. America's Best Dance Crew Season 2 Champions Super Cr3w make an appearance.|$|R

60|$|The {{school of}} largest fish was {{farther to the}} west. The breeze lulled. We could not fly the kite except with the motion and {{direction}} of the boat. It was exasperating. When we got close the kite flopped down into the water. Captain Dan used language. We ran <b>back,</b> <b>picked</b> up the kite. It was soaked, of course, and would not fly. While Dan got out a new kite, a large silk one which we had not tried yet, we ran down to the eastward of the second school. To our surprise and delight this untried kite flew well without almost any wind.|$|R
60|$|Now {{they had}} reached us and there began the most terrible battle that was told of {{in the history of}} that land. Wave after wave of them rolled up against us, but our battalions which I had not trained in vain stood like rocks and slew and slew and slew till the dead could be counted by the thousand. Again and again they strove to storm the hill on which I stood, hoping to kill me, and each time we beat them <b>back.</b> <b>Picking</b> out their generals I loosed shaft after shaft from my long bow, and seldom did I miss, nor could their cotton-quilted armour turn those bitter arrows.|$|R

25|$|In March 2013, on {{the return}} journey from a defeat at Accrington Stanley, Davids sent the Barnet team coach <b>back</b> to <b>pick</b> up 36 {{supporters}} whose coach had broken down on the motorway {{and take them to}} the next service station.|$|R
60|$|Here Kagax {{was more}} deliberate. Left and right, {{up and down}} he went with deadly patience, from the lowest branch to the top, a hundred feet above, {{following}} every cross and winding of the trail. A dozen times he stopped, went <b>back,</b> <b>picked</b> up the fresher trail, and went on again. A dozen times he passed within {{a few feet of}} his victim, smelling him strongly, but scorning to use his eyes till his nose had done its perfect work. So he came to the last turn, followed the last branch, his nose to the bark, straight to the crevice under the broken branch, where Meeko crouched shivering, knowing it was all over.|$|R

50|$|Her {{first two}} children, Joseph (Frenchie) and Cora, were fathered by Charlie Dupree, whom Hunter {{said she did}} not marry. Dupree died around 1914. Later she married Emmanuel Hunter, a woodchopper at Melrose, in 1924. The two lived and worked at Melrose Plantation for many years. Hunter worked as a field hand in her early years and as a cook and {{housekeeper}} beginning in the late 1920s. Hunter bore seven children, two stillborn. On the morning before giving birth to one of her children, she picked 78 pounds of cotton, went home and called for the midwife. She was <b>back</b> <b>picking</b> cotton a few days later. Hunter lived her entire life in rural, northwest Louisiana, never going more than 100 miles from home.|$|R

Bugs sees a storm cloud approach, lightning hits the kite and travels down the string and electrocutes him. Ben runs <b>back,</b> <b>picks</b> up Bugs who is flashing off and on like a lightbulb, exclaiming [...] "I discovered electricity! I discovered electricity!" [...] Bugs looks at the camera and says: [...] "Heh ... He discovered electricity!" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{in taking}} them {{with so little}} ceremony, Mr Carker dropped one on the floor, and did not see what he had done; neither did Mr Dombey observe the letter lying near his feet. Walter hesitated for a moment, {{thinking}} that one or other of them would notice it; but finding that neither did, he stopped, came <b>back,</b> <b>picked</b> it up, and laid it himself on Mr Dombey's desk. The letters were post-letters; and it happened that the one in question was Mrs Pipchin's regular report, directed as usual--for Mrs Pipchin was but an indifferent penwoman--by Florence. Mr Dombey, having his attention silently called to this letter by Walter, started, and looked fiercely at him, as if he believed that he had purposely selected it from all the rest.|$|R
60|$|Then Otoo arrived--Otoo the manhandler. In {{some way}} he had got hold of a heavy war club, and at close {{quarters}} it was a far more efficient weapon than a rifle. He {{was right in the}} thick of them, so that they could not spear him, while their tomahawks seemed worse than useless. He was fighting for me, and he was in a true Berserker rage. The way he handled that club was amazing. Their skulls squashed like overripe oranges. It was not until he had driven them <b>back,</b> <b>picked</b> me up in his arms, and started to run, that he received his first wounds. He arrived in the boat with four spear thrusts, got his Winchester, and with it got a man for every shot. Then we pulled aboard the schooner and doctored up.|$|R
