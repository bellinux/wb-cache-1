No one discredits today the fact that faults in our nutrition result in emergence and further development of illnesses. On the contrary there is enough evidence on a very positive effect of changes in nutrition on a single person, group of people or the whole generation. The objective of my diploma thesis was {{to find out the}} quality of food consumed by school-age pupils. I used quantitative research for my diploma work. Data aquisition was carried out in the form of question-forms in order to address as many respondents as possible. Questions { [...] }forms were alloted for pupils at primary schools. There were three hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 : Czech pupils consume fuel food overly rich in sugars. This hypothesis was proved [...] Hypothesis 2 : Czech children consume less than 30 g of fibre a day. The hypothesis was also proved. Hypothesis 3 : In pupils´ ingestion of food there is more than 300 mg of cholesterol a day. This hypothesis was not proved at all. It is obvious from the results that Czech pupils do not consume recommended healthy food. The results of my diploma thesis {{could be used as a}} basis for improvement in <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> of school-age children. Bad parental approach to healthy nutrition is one of the key factors that contribute to the growth of obesity and other serious deseases. Parents should be informed about <b>bad</b> and wrong <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> of their children and at the same time they should be advised how to make a healthy and suitable daily menu for their children. Parents could be kept informed by various informative leaflets distributed at schools or there might be held special lectures aimed at this broad issue.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the current status}} of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in an enterprise in Xi′an, China, and to provide a scientific basis for further studies on NAFLD in Shanxi. MethodsA total of 415 employees who underwent health examination in The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi′an Medical University from June to July, 2014 were enrolled. All the patients underwent physical examination, abdominal ultrasound, and serological examination, and completed related questionnaires. The t-test was applied for comparison of continuous data, and the Pearson correlation analysis was applied for correlation analysis. ResultsOf all the 415 patients, 86 (20. 7 %) had NAFLD, consisting of 70 patients (16. 9 %) with mild NAFLD and 16 patients (3. 8 %) with moderate NAFLD. The population with an age of 50 - 58 years had the highest prevalence rate (30. 8 %, 16 / 52). Of all the 86 patients with NAFLD, 57 (66. 3 %) had obesity, and 76 (88. 4 %) had abdominal obesity. The employees with moderate NAFLD had a significantly higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, a significantly higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level, a significantly larger abdominal circumference, and a significantly higher body mass index (BMI) than those with mild NAFLD (t=- 4. 140, - 3. 512, - 4. 405, and - 5. 051, respectively, all P＜ 0. 05). In the employees with NAFLD, BMI and abdominal circumference were correlated with AST level (r= 0. 283 and 0. 271, both P＜ 0. 05) and ALT level (r= 0. 325 and 0. 316, both P＜ 0. 05). Most employees in this enterprise had a <b>bad</b> <b>eating</b> <b>habit,</b> a sedentary lifestyle, and a lack of physical exercise. ConclusionThis enterprise has a high prevalence rate of NAFLD.

40|$|Background: Mental disorders, {{including}} eating disorders, mostly begin during youth. Moreover, negative {{body image}} {{is found to}} cause unhealthy <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> {{in the context of}} several cross-cultural settings. This study aimed to examine the correlation between health perception and body image with <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> among high school students. Methods: A structured, anonymous questionnaire was distributed to students of a private high school in Bandung, Indonesia in June-October 2014. The questionnaire included questions about health perception, body image, <b>eating</b> <b>habits,</b> body weight and height, and also other demographic parameters. The school was selected as the study object through purposive sampling, and 140 high school students (72 male and 68 female) were ramdomly selected. Results: Male and female did not show considerable differences in health perceptions. Out of 13 statements, 12 statements of male respondents showed better body image than female. While in <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> statements, female respondents seemed to maintain healthier <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> than male respondents. No significant correlation was observed between body image and <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> (r=- 0. 015, p= 0. 858). There was significant correlation between health perception and <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> (r= 0. 374, p< 0. 001). Correlation between sex and <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> was found (p= 0. 020), there was not significant relationship between <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> and Body Mass Index (BMI) (p= 0. 368). Conclusions: The negative relationship between body image and <b>eating</b> <b>habits</b> is not significant.
