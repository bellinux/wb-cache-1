25|$|At {{the time}} of the Emancipation reform of 1861, there were no credit {{facilities}} available to landowners. The State Bank of the Russian Empire (predecessor of the Central Bank of Russia) was founded in 1862 but did not deal in mortgages. A new law was passed in May 1872 which allowed the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Empire to approve new banks with less than 5 million rubles in capital. That greatly simplified approval procedures as new banks no longer needed approvals from the State Council or the Tsar. However, Finance Minister Mikhail Reytern was afraid that a rapid expansion of the <b>banking</b> <b>network</b> could cause banks to fail. He prohibited from establishing new banks in cities where one already existed and limited the number of banks to two per province. Therefore, entrepreneurs hurried to establish new banks in various regional centers. In total, eleven land banks were established in 1871–1873. Their initial combined equity was 13.5 million rubles.|$|E

Testing our hypothesis on branch-level loan productivity per employee at the Banche di Credito Cooperativo (BCCs), Italy’s network of mutual cooperative banks, we find that BCC monopoly always dominates BCC duopoly. Moreover, productivity is generally higher in situations of either BCC monopoly or BCC facing only outer competition vis-à-vis situations exhibiting (also) inner competition. The policy implication is that limits to inner rivalry seem efficiency improving in cooperative <b>banking</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
