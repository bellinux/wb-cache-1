25|$|He {{managed to}} escape from the Verviers prison on 4 July 1979. Although Ražnatović was apprehended in the Netherlands on 24 October 1979, the few months he was free were enough for at least two more armed robberies in Sweden and three more in the Netherlands.

Wasting no time, more robberies followed, this time in Germany, where after less than a month of freedom he was arrested in Frankfurt on 5 June 1981 following a jewellery store stickup. In the ensuing shootout with police he was lightly wounded, resulting in his placement in the prison hospital ward, where looser security allowed him to escape again only four days later, on 9 June, supposedly by jumping from the window, <b>beating</b> <b>up</b> the first bystander and stealing his clothing before disappearing.|$|E

Beezel seems to detest Amy {{and anyone who}} comes between him and Anson, but Anson only sees Beezel as innocent. One day, Amy witnesses Beezel masturbating to summer vacation photos of Anson in a swimsuit. Beezel attacks her and violently urinates on her. Anson still finds his pet innocent but Amy threatens to leave if he doesn't get rid of Beezel. Caring more about his relationship, Anson agrees {{to find a new}} home for him. That night, from a closet, Beezel tearfully watches the couple make love (whilst sodomizing himself with a hairbrush and dry humping a stuffed teddy bear). The next day {{when it comes time to}} take Beezel away, he is nowhere to be found. Amy goes outside to look. Beezel then runs her over with a truck and attempts to shoot her to death with a shotgun, but she chases him into the street and begins beating him with a shovel, which is witnessed by a group of children attending a birthday party at a neighboring house.

500|$|The subplot with Stan getting <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> by {{his sister}} Shelley came from Parker's real-life {{experiences}} getting <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> {{as a child}} by his sister, also named Shelley, who is three years his elder. Parker said although his sister would later deny it, she regularly <b>beat</b> him <b>up</b> or locked {{him out of the}} house for hours; Parker stated that the scene when Stan says [...] "You're my sister and I love you" [...] in order to try to avoid a beating, but was subsequently beat even harder, was based on an actual experience with his sister. The scene in which Stan asks the giant mutant Stan to attack Shelley is based on Parker's childhood fantasy of having a larger version of himself <b>beat</b> <b>up</b> his sister. The resolution to the subplot, in which Shelley takes the blame for Stan's mistakes, and then <b>beats</b> <b>up</b> Stan when he tries to thank her, was also based on experiences Parker had when his sister would bail him out of trouble.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Abu Simbel the heroes {{are joined by}} Iggy, a Boston Terrier and the user of The Fool, a simple but powerful Stand of sand. They are immediately attacked by the blind Stand user N'Doul, who attacks with Geb, a Stand of water and {{the first of the}} nine Egyptian god Stands; he is able to slash through Kakyoin's corneas before he is defeated by Jotaro and Iggy. Afterwards, Kakyoin is taken to a hospital to recuperate. Oingo and Boingo, users of the face-altering Stand Khnum and the future-predicting comic book Thoth respectively, attempt to defeat the heroes, but Oingo (in disguise as Jotaro) is incapacitated without the heroes even knowing he was there. Anubis, a sword with a Stand, possesses a farmer named Chaka, a barber named Khan, and then Polnareff, nearly killing Jotaro before being thrown in a river to rust away. Mariah, the user of Bast, magnetizes Joseph and Avdol causing problems for them before they overcome her attacks and crush her between themselves. Meanwhile, Polnareff and Silver Chariot are reduced to children by Seth, the shadow Stand of the sadistic child-abuser Alessi. Polnareff outsmarts Alessi before he is attacked by a de-aged Jotaro; Polnareff and Jotaro return to their old selves before <b>beating</b> <b>up</b> Alessi. Later, the group encounters Daniel J. D'Arby, who offers information if they gamble with him, but when Polnareff and Joseph lose, D'Arby's Stand Osiris transforms their souls into poker chips. Only by betting everyone's souls and bluffing his way through D'Arby's rigged game can Jotaro defeat him. In Cairo the group meets Hol Horse again, who has partnered himself with Boingo, but the duo are defeated through their own incompetence. Later, Iggy battles Pet Shop, DIO's pet falcon and the user of the ice-slinging Stand Horus. Kakyoin returns soon afterwards, his eyesight mostly recovered.|$|E
25|$|Callum, who was {{battling for}} custody over Max, {{attacked}} David and the Platt family for months {{until one day}} when, after the Platt's return from a week-long holiday, Sarah Platt was babysitting Max. Whilst they were watching a scary movie, Gemma Winter, Callum's friend, came {{knocking at the door}} of Callum's flat. She had been beaten up by a thug. When Max was playing in his room, he found Callum's gun. Callum threatened Sarah that if she told anyone about the gun then he would release a video of Bethany dealing and taking drugs to the police. Sarah flees with Max, refused to speak to anyone about it and told Bethany to stay away from him. However, he continued threatening the Platts. Sarah confided in Jason Grimshaw to finish him off. He attacked Callum in the Rovers and told him to stay away. He was then arrested for possession of the gun but was released without charge due to lack of evidence. When Callum arrived at the Platts' house to collect Max, David and Jason prevented him. Furious, Callum and two of his thugs lead Jason into the ginnel and beat him up. Sarah found Jason and called an ambulance. Jason's parents Eileen and Tony were told that he might not walk or talk again. Max, who had witnessed the attack on Jason, told David and Kylie what he saw after he appeared terrified when Callum came to collect him. Max gave a statement to the police. Before Callum was arrested, he spiked Sarah's drink and knocked her unconscious. He threatened Bethany that he would kill Sarah if she did not lie for him. The day after, on Lily Platt's 2nd birthday, Bethany revealed to the Platts that she made a statement against Max. The family was disgusted as they knew she was lying. Sarah informed Tony about Callum and the following day, he took matters into his own hands by <b>beating</b> <b>up</b> Callum in the ginnel, only to be stopped by Liz. Callum continued to attack the Platts because he needed money to pay off a dangerous drug dealer. Sarah lures him to the house and records what he is saying. Callum finds her 'phone and starts attacking Sarah, and Kylie comes in and beats him over the head with a wrench, killing him.
