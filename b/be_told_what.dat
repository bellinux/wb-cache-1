5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds nothing wrong with reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does not like to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> she can and cannot do. After {{it is confirmed that}} she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E

25|$|The crucial private Dáil {{session on}} 6 January was {{informed}} {{that it could not}} be told about a private conference of nine TDs that had reached a compromise agreement on almost all points the night before. Most TDs wanted at least to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> matters were still not agreed on, and from this point onwards the pro-treaty members insisted that all sessions should be held in public.|$|E

25|$|Without {{waiting to}} <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> {{to do by}} the Senate, Appius Claudius began bold public works to address the supply problem. An {{aqueduct}} (the Aqua Appia) secured the water supply {{of the city of}} Rome. By far the best known project was the road, which ran across the Pontine Marshes to the coast northwest of Naples, where it turned north to Capua. On it, any number of fresh troops could be sped to the theatre of operations, and supplies could be moved en masse to Roman bases without hindrance by either enemy or terrain. It is no surprise that, after his term as censor, Appius Claudius became consul twice, subsequently held other offices, and was a respected consultant to the state even during his later years.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January Derby told Haig that {{he saved}} Robertson from the sack by {{threatening}} resignation. He also hinted to Haig {{that the government}} wanted the removal of Launcelot Kiggell (“a tired man”) as BEF Chief of Staff, and that General Butler, Haig’s preferred choice, was not acceptable. Haig had {{an interview with the}} King (2 January) to pick up his Field Marshal’s baton. Haig appears to have been placing too much faith in recent German peace feelers ("Germany is now ready, we are told, to give all we want in these respects"), now known not have been seriously intended. He told the King that British soldiers (who, in a large conscript army, now included men from “all classes in the nation, and many are most intelligent”) needed to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> they were fighting for. In Haig’s view, Britain should keep to her original war aims - the defence of France and liberation of Belgium - not try to gain Alsace-Lorraine for France or Trieste for Italy. In Haig's view the “democratising of Germany”, about to be publicly reiterated by Lloyd George as a British aspiration in his Caxton Hall speech (5 January), was likely to destabilise Germany, as the fall of the Tsar in March 1917 had destabilised Russia, and was not “worth the loss of an Englishman” (like many Scots of his era, Haig often referred to Britain or even the British Empire as “England”).|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the track}} {{is about a}} girl who is tired of being {{manipulated}} by people around her and doesn't need to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> to do, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "You're gonna have to see through my perspective/ I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am/ And I don't want to be so damn protected". Dana Alice Heller, author of Makeover television: realities remodelled (2007), said that, with [...] "Overprotected", [...] "Spears addresses the problem of being a teen star whose personal and professional are handled by others." [...] She also compared [...] "Overprotected" [...] with the singer's first reality show, [...] (2005), saying that [...] "Britney frames her makeover as a move toward to independence, a rebellion against overly controlling parents and their stand-ins." ...|$|E

500|$|As [...] fascism and militarism {{advanced}} in Europe, Lansbury's pacifist stance drew {{criticism from the}} trades union elements of his party—who controlled the majority of party conference votes. Walter Citrine, the TUC general secretary, commented that Lansbury [...] "thinks the country should be without defence of any kind... it certainly isn't our policy." [...] The party's 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October, {{under the shadow of}} Italy's impending invasion of Abyssinia. The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, [...] which Lansbury opposed [...] as a form of economic warfare. His speech—a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism—was well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin, the Transport and General Workers' Union leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a [...] policy, agreed by all the party's main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression, and accused him of [...] "hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> to do with it". Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later.|$|E
500|$|The group's [...] "golden rule", {{according}} to Field, {{was to make}} the content of their songs and shows [...] "developmentally appropriate and fun". [...] Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as The New York Times reported, [...] "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". [...] They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. [...] As Field said, [...] "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". [...] The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. [...] They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1930s, {{with the}} Labour Party split and weakened, Bevin co-operated with the Conservative-dominated {{government}} on practical issues. But {{during this period}} he became increasingly involved in foreign policy. He was a firm opponent of fascism and of British appeasement of the fascist powers. In 1935, arguing that Italy should be punished by sanctions for her recent invasion of Abyssinia, he made a blistering attack on the pacifists in the Labour Party, accusing the Labour leader George Lansbury at the Party Conference of [...] "hawking his conscience around" [...] asking to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> to do with it.|$|E

2500|$|On October 19, 1953, {{near the}} end of his morning radio show— {{deliberately}} waiting until after the television portion had ended— after lavishing praise on LaRosa in introducing the singer's performance of [...] "Manhattan," [...] Godfrey thanked him and then announced that this was LaRosa's [...] "swan song" [...] with the show, adding, [...] "He goes now, out on his own— as his own star— soon to be seen on his own programs, and I know you'll wish him godspeed as much as I do". Godfrey then signed off for the day saying, [...] "This is the CBS Radio Network". LaRosa, who had to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> the phrase [...] "swan song" [...] meant, was dumbfounded, since he had not been informed beforehand of his departure and contract renegotiations had yet to happen. In perhaps a further illumination of the ego that Godfrey had formerly kept hidden, radio historian Gerald Nachman, in Raised on Radio, claims that what really miffed Godfrey about his now-former protege was that LaRosa's fan mail had come to outnumber Godfrey's. It is likely that a combination of these factors led to Godfrey's decision to discharge LaRosa. It is not likely Godfrey expected the public outcry that ensued, a result of the incident running directly counter to Godfrey's avuncular image.|$|E
2500|$|... "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)" [...] {{was another}} {{emotional}} plea, {{this time to}} the environment. Funk Brother musician Earl Van Dyke once mentioned that Berry Gordy didn't know of the word [...] "ecology" [...] and had to <b>be</b> <b>told</b> <b>what</b> it was. The song featured a memorable tenor saxophone riff from Detroit music legend Wild Bill Moore. [...] "Right On" [...] was a lengthy seven-minute jam influenced by funk rock and Latin soul rhythms that focused on Gaye's own divided soul in which Gaye later pleaded in falsetto, [...] "if you let me, I {{will take you to}} live where love is King" [...] after complying that [...] "true love can conquer hate every time". [...] "Wholy Holy" [...] follows [...] "God Is Love" [...] as an emotional gospel plea advising people to [...] "come together" [...] to [...] "proclaim love [...] salvation". The final track, [...] "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)", focuses on urban poverty, backed by a minimalist, dark blues-oriented funk vibe, with its bass riffs composed and performed by Bob Babbitt, who also performed on [...] "Mercy Mercy Me" [...] (Jamerson played {{on the rest of the}} album). The entire album's stylistic use of a song cycle gave it a cohesive feel and was one of R's first concept albums, described as [...] "a groundbreaking experiment in collating a pseudo-classical suite of free-flowing songs." ...|$|E
