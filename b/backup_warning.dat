40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the findings of}} three experiments that concern driver reaction to acoustic signals that might be used for <b>backup</b> <b>warning</b> devices. Intelligent warning devices are under development that will use vehicle-based sensors to warn backing drivers {{of the presence of}} objects behind the vehicle. The research described here {{is part of a larger}} project concerned with the human factors of these warning devices. Specifically, the questions of interest center around what warning information to provide, when to present it, and how to display it. Based on previous work (Lerner, Kotwal, Lyons, and Gardner-Bonneau, 1996; Huey, Harpster, and Lerner, 1996), this research focuses on acoustic signals, which are seen as more suitable for backup warnings than are visual displays. The three experiments were conducted dealing with different aspects of driver perception and response to <b>backup</b> <b>warning</b> signals, with the objective of contributing to the development of a set of recommendations f [...] ...|$|E
3000|$|Ultrasonic, {{inspired}} by the ability of bats to navigate the darkness or of dolphins and whales underwater, is a detection system based on transmitting/receiving acoustic (sound) {{energy in the form}} of waves with a frequency above the human hearing range. Operation is similar to radar but high-frequency acoustic waves are sent and received. These sensors provide accurate short-range data (1 – 10 m). Given the relatively low cost, ultrasonic capabilities are instrumental in <b>backup</b> <b>warning</b> systems and parking assistance systems [7, 107, 108, 109].|$|E

50|$|Hurricane Andrew made {{landfall}} {{in southern}} Miami-Dade County on August 24, 1992. Overnight, strong winds blew the WSR-57 radar off the roof. The NWS office in Melbourne, Tampa, and West Palm Beach, all provided forecasting issuance and <b>backup</b> <b>warnings.</b> The new radar, NEXRAD, {{was installed in}} April 1993 near the Miami MetroZoo, ahead of schedule. NEXRAD was commissioned on April 20, 1995. The next month, NWS Miami and the NHC moved to the campus of Florida International University. As part of an organizational restructuring plan in the 1990s, NWS West Palm Beach merged with NWS Miami in 1993. In 1997, there was a proposal to merge NWS Key West into NWS Miami. However, by March 1998, after consideration from Congress and the NWS headquarters, {{it was decided that}} NWS Key West would remain a separate office.|$|R

40|$|Reporting Technology) failure {{prediction}} system is currently implemented in disk drives. Its {{purpose is to}} predict the near-term failure of an individual hard disk drive, and issue a <b>backup</b> <b>warning</b> to prevent data loss. Two experimentally tests of SMART showed only moderate accuracy at low false alarm rates. (A rate of 0. 2 % of total drives per year implies that 20 % of drive returns would be good drives, relative to ≈ 1 % annual failure rate of drives). This requirement for very low false alarm rates {{is well known in}} medical diagnostic tests for rare diseases, and methodology used there suggests ways to improve SMART. Two improved SMART algorithms are proposed here. They use the SMART internal drive attribute measurements in present drives. The present warnin...|$|E

40|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>warning</b> system {{devices were}} {{evaluated}} {{to determine if}} they would alert winter maintenance snow plow drivers to obstacles directly behind the trailer and out of view of the driver when a unit is backed up. When the sensors {{on the back of the}} tow plow were covered with snow during plowing operations, the sensor would go off in the cab and continue going off, which would result in drivers turning the volume of the unit way down. One shop stated that the wireless transmitted signal would be hit or miss depending on the winter weather that they were operating in. The sensors on the back of the tow plow trailer would come in contact with salt brine and in this situation one of the sensors did go bad. The weatherproof box that was designed to keep the system waterproof did not fully keep the moisture out. It was found that the system did alert drivers of items behind the unit and there were no backup accidents reported during the research period...|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} safety-enhancing {{automobile}} features can be enabled by microsystems that can sense {{and analyze the}} dynamic 3 D environment {{inside and outside the}} vehicle. It is desirable to directly sense the 3 D shape of the scene, since the appearance of objects in a 2 D image is confounded by illumination conditions, surface materials, and object orientation. To overcome the disadvantages of 3 D sensing methods such as stereovision, radar, ultrasound, or scanning LADAR, we present Electronic Perception Technology, an advanced range camera module based on measuring the time delay of modulated infrared light from an active emitter, using a single detector chip fabricated on standard CMOS process. This paper overviews several safety applications and their sensor performance requirements, describes the principles of operation of the range camera, and characterizes its performance as configured for airbag deployment occupant sensing and <b>backup</b> obstacle <b>warning</b> applications. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{self-contained}} {{breathing apparatus}} with automatic redundant fluid pressure controls and a facemask mounted low pressure whistle alarm is described. The first stage of the system includes pair of pressure regulators connected in parallel with different outlet pressures, both of which reduce {{the pressure of the}} stored supply gas to pressures compatible with the second stage breathing demand regulator. A primary regulator in the first stage delivers a low output pressure to the demand regulator. In the event of a failure closed condition of the primary regulator an automatic transfer valve switches on the <b>backup</b> regulator. A <b>warning</b> that the supply pressure has been depleted is also provided by a supply pressure actuated transfer valve which transfers the output of the first stage pressure regulators from the primary to the backup regulator. The alarm is activated in either the failure closed condition or if the supply pressure is reduced to a dangerously low level...|$|R
40|$|A {{human factors}} {{experiment}} employed a hemi-anechoic sound {{field in which}} listeners were required to localize a vehicular <b>backup</b> alarm <b>warning</b> signal (both a standard and a frequency-augmented alarm) in 360 -degrees azimuth in pink noise of 60 dBA and 90 dBA. Measures of localization performance included: (1) percentage correct localization, (2) percentage of right [...] left localization errors, (3) percentage of front-rear localization errors, and (4) localization absolute deviation in degrees from the alarm′s actual location. In summary, the data demonstrated that, with some exceptions, normal hearing listeners′ ability to localize the backup alarm in 360 -degrees azimuth did not improve when wearing augmented hearing protectors (including dichotic sound transmission earmuffs, flat attenuation earplugs, and level-dependent earplugs) as compared to when wearing conventional passive earmuffs or earplugs of the foam or flanged types. Exceptions were that in the 90 dBA pink noise, the flat attenuation earplug yielded significantly better accuracy than the polyurethane foam earplug and both the dichotic and the custom-made diotic electronic sound transmission earmuffs. However, the flat attenuation earplug showed no benefit over the standard pre-molded earplug, the arc earplug, and the passive earmuff. Confusions of front-rear alarm directions were most significant in the 90 dBA noise condition, wherein two types of triple-flanged earplugs exhibited significantly fewer front-rear confusions than either of the electronic muffs. On all measures, the diotic sound transmission earmuff resulted in the poorest localization {{of any of the}} protectors {{due to the fact that}} its single-microphone design did not enable interaural cues to be heard. Localization was consistently more degraded in the 90 dBA pink noise as compared with the relatively quiet condition of the 60 dBA pink noise. A frequency-augmented backup alarm, which incorporated 400 Hz and 4000 Hz components to exploit the benefits of interaural phase and intensity cues respectively, slightly but significantly improved localization compared with the standard, more narrow-bandwidth backup alarm, and these results have implications for the updating of backup alarm standards...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this decade, a {{hard disk}} {{has become an}} {{essential}} key component of a personal computer system. It preserves important information which is frequently updated. In case the hard disk fails, we may possibly lose such important information. This is called a hard disk failure. One of the simplest methods for coping with such a possibility of a hard disk failure is to periodically make {{a copy of the}} information to another secondary medium. This is called a backup operation. This study discusses an efficient <b>backup</b> <b>warning</b> policy which gives us a warning to back up files at the prespecified time Tw measured by the elapsed time since the previous backup operation or the recovery from a hard disk failure, whichever occurs first. For the purpose of determining the value of Tw, this study formulates the efficiency as a criterion, which is defined by the long-run average ratio of 1. (i) the time spent in processing jobs effectively in the sense that their accomplishments are successfully backed up, to 2. (ii) the total time spent in processing jobs ineffectively as well as effectively, and spent in backup or recovery operations. We then clarify the conditions under which an optimal warning time exists. A numerical example is also presented...|$|E
