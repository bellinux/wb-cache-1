25|$|He {{ended his}} {{participation}} {{by saying that}} under the circumstances he felt he could be of no further use to the Convention in the matter. His final word in the Convention was the tragic one – <b>Better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> never to have met than to have met and failed. Late in February the malady from which he was suffering grew worse. He left Dublin for London knowing that a settlement from the Convention was impossible. An operation in March 1918 to remove an intestinal obstruction appeared to progress well at first, but then he suffered heart failure. He died {{a few hours later}} at a London nursing home on 6 March 1918. One of the last things he said to the Jesuit Father who was with him to the end, was, Father, I am a broken hearted man. At the Convention, his last move was an adoption of O’Brien’s policy of accommodating Unionist opposition in the North and in the South. It was too late. Had he joined O’Brien ten years before and carried the Irish Party with him, it is possible that Ireland’s destiny would have been settled by evolution.|$|E
500|$|After {{the album}} {{came out in}} February, the band began a four-week tour of the United States {{starting}} with Los Angeles. On February 4, the band played at the Nassau Coliseum with Blue Öyster Cult, and played with Suicide {{the next day at}} CBGB. A week after this, the band played with Blue Öyster Cult again in Poughkeepsie, to which Johnny relates: [...] "Those arena shows were a little <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> although we would have more bad experiences in those big places. I never really enjoyed playing them." [...] The band used their newly designed logo as a backdrop at concerts. They also had more advanced lighting techniques, but still only used white lights.|$|E

Matt Stone stated [...] "If they hadn't put this episode back on the air, we'd have had serious issues, and we wouldn't be doing {{anything}} else with them." [...] After the episode {{was scheduled to be}} rebroadcast, Trey Parker and Matt Stone were interviewed on CNN's Showbiz Tonight, where they stated that all of the controversy increased publicity for the episode. Parker was quoted: [...] "But it's really like a publicist couldn't have orchestrated this any <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us.</b> You know what I mean? It's like it's been phenomenal. Tom Cruise has done more for South Park than anyone I think in the world." ...|$|E

500|$|The two composers {{ceased to}} be on {{friendly}} terms {{in the middle of}} the first decade of the 1900s, for musical and possibly personal reasons. Their admirers began to form factions, with adherents of one composer denigrating the other. Disputes arose about the chronology of the composers' works and who influenced whom. Prominent in the anti-Ravel camp was Lalo, who wrote, [...] "Where M. Debussy is all sensitivity, M. Ravel is all insensitivity, borrowing without hesitation not only technique but the sensitivity of other people." [...] The public tension led to personal estrangement. Ravel said, [...] "It's probably <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> after all, to be on frigid terms for illogical reasons." [...] Nichols suggests an additional reason for the rift. In 1904 Debussy left his wife and went to live with the singer Emma Bardac. Ravel, together with his close friend and confidante Misia Edwards and the opera star Lucienne Bréval, contributed to a modest regular income for the deserted Lilly Debussy, a fact that Nichols suggests may have rankled with her husband.|$|E
500|$|Chartwell {{remained}} a haven {{in times of}} acute stress – Churchill {{had spent the night}} there just before the fall of France in 1940. Summoned back to London by a desperate plea from Lord Gort for permission to retreat to Dunkirk, Churchill broadcast the first of his wartime speeches to the nation; [...] "Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valour...for it is <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation..." [...] He returned again on 20 June 1941, after the failure of Operation Battleaxe to relieve Tobruk, and determined to sack the Middle East commander, General Wavell. John Colville recorded Churchill's deliberations in his diary; [...] "spent the afternoon at Chartwell. After a long sleep the P.M. in a purple dressing gown and grey felt hat took me to see his goldfish. He was ruminating deeply about the fate of Tobruk and contemplating means of resuming the offensive". Churchill continued to pay occasional, short, visits to the house; on one such, on 24 June 1944, just after the Normandy landings, his secretary recorded that the house was [...] "shut up and rather desolate".|$|E
2500|$|In filings {{unsealed}} {{two days}} before the merger approval in a New York federal court, Citigroup argued that its own deal was <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S</b> taxpayers and Wachovia shareholders. It said that it had exposed itself to [...] "substantial economic risk" [...] by stating its intent to rescue Wachovia after less than 72 hours of due diligence. Citigroup had obtained an exclusive agreement in order to protect itself. Wachovia suffered a $23.9 billion loss in the third quarter.|$|E

Prior to the talks, Lu Su's subordinates feared that Guan Yu might try to harm Lu Su, so they advised Lu Su against meeting Guan Yu. However, Lu Su replied, [...] "It's <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to settle this issue in a peaceful manner. Liu Bei may have acted against our lord's interests, but we've yet to agree on who's right and who's wrong. Do you think Guan Yu will dare to do something rash, such as killing someone, {{at this point in}} time?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Weir and Marjoribanks {{posed the}} {{following}} question {{in one of their}} first messages to London in 1952: [...] "…whether we have determined in our own minds that we want the [...] integration movement to succeed... If we do want it to succeed, we should surely put behind it the full force of our influence. If we want to cut it short and prevent its development to a political authority which might eventually become a federal state, it would surely be <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> not to wish it success". [...] The Foreign Office replied that European integration would never succeed.|$|E

[...] CBS News executive editor Steve Capus argued that [...] "given the number of sports overruns and out-and-out pre-emptions, it would be <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> as a news organization {{to come up with}} what I think is a smarter, 24-hour approach to covering the world, and making sure we've got all the bases covered." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a late-night}} {{television}} address Morsi {{declared that he}} would [...] "defend the legitimacy of his elected office with his life." [...] He added that [...] "there {{is no substitute for}} legitimacy" [...] as he vowed not to resign. Morsi accused supporters of Hosni Mubarak of exploiting the wave of protests to topple the government and fight democracy. After Morsi's statement, an official Facebook page of the Egyptian Armed Forces wrote a post under the title [...] "The Last Hours" [...] saying in response to Morsi: [...] "The Supreme Commander in Chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces had mentioned before that it's <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to die rather than seeing the Egyptian People being threatened or horrified, and we swear that we would sacrifice our lives and our blood for Egypt against every terrorist or extremist or ignorant.

2500|$|Alonso {{believed}} {{the timing of}} the safety car and not a strategy error prevented him from achieving a podium finish, saying if Ferrari had Mercedes's pace, they would remain on track: [...] "The moment of the safety car was probably not good, but sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn't help. Today it didn't help." [...] Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci defended his team's strategy and did not believe anything specific prevented his team from finishing on the podium: [...] "Definitely the safety car didn't do any <b>better</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> but the race is made of 60 laps. We squeezed the car as much as we could; the strategy from the pits was excellent. There were other variables we know we cannot control. We did our best." [...] Boullier suggested Red Bull used coded messages to assist Ricciardo when they told Ricciardo to remain off the kerbing but stressed it was the FIA's task to investigate. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner spoke to Whiting for clarification because Ricciardo had battery damage from going over the kerbing. The sport's governing body confirmed they were satisfied with Red Bull's radio messages and stated the team abided by the regulations.|$|E
