5000|$|The {{symptoms}} of urethritis can include pain or a burning sensation upon urination (dysuria), a white/cloudy discharge {{and a feeling}} that one needs to pass urine frequently. For men, the signs and symptoms are discharge from the penis, <b>burning</b> or pain <b>when</b> <b>urinating,</b> itching, irritation, or tenderness. In women, the signs and symptoms are discharge from vagina, <b>burning</b> or pain <b>when</b> <b>urinating,</b> anal or oral infections, abdominal pain, or abnormal vaginal bleeding, which may be {{an indication that the}} infection has progressed to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of A. baumannii {{infections in}} turn range from fevers and chills, rash, {{confusion}} and/or altered mental states, pain or <b>burning</b> sensations <b>when</b> <b>urinating,</b> strong urge to urinate frequently, sensitivity to bright light, nausea (with or without vomiting), muscle and chest pains, breathing problems, and cough (with or without yellow, green, or bloody mucus). In some cases, A. baumannii may present no infection or symptoms, as with colonizing an open wound or tracheostomy site.|$|R
50|$|In men, {{those with}} a chlamydial {{infection}} show symptoms of infectious inflammation of the urethra in about 50% of cases. Symptoms that may occur include: a painful or <b>burning</b> sensation <b>when</b> <b>urinating,</b> an unusual discharge from the penis, testicular pain or swelling, or fever. If left untreated, chlamydia in men can spread to the testicles causing epididymitis, which in rare cases can lead to sterility if not treated. Chlamydia is also a potential cause of prostatic inflammation in men, although the exact relevance in prostatitis is difficult to ascertain due to possible contamination from urethritis.|$|R
50|$|Most commonly, chlamydial infections do {{not cause}} symptoms. However, for men, a <b>burning</b> {{sensation}} <b>when</b> <b>urinating</b> is often probable. For women, odor and itching are possible symptoms. Both sexes may notice more sebum production as the infection escalates, all which produces greasy sweat, more oily complexion, {{and can be}} misdiagnosed as acne eruptions rather than the whole body's hidden fight to defend itself from an STD. All people who have engaged in sexual activity with potentially infected individuals may be offered one of several tests to diagnose the condition.|$|R
50|$|After the test, {{patients}} {{often have}} some <b>burning</b> feeling <b>when</b> they <b>urinate</b> and often see {{small amounts of}} blood in their urine. Procedures using rigid instrumentation often result in urinary incontinence and leakage from idiopathic causes to urethral damage. Occasionally, patients may feel some lower abdominal pains, reflecting bladder muscle spasms, {{but these are not}} common.|$|R
50|$|NGU is {{more common}} in men than women. Men may have a {{discharge}} (strange liquid) from the penis, pain <b>when</b> <b>urinating,</b> and itching, irritation or tenderness around the opening of the penis. Women might not have any symptoms and may not know they have NGU until severe problems occur. Women might have discharge from the vagina, <b>burning</b> or pain <b>when</b> <b>urinating,</b> pain in the abdominal (stomach) area, or bleeding from the vagina that is not from a monthly period. (This may be an sign that NGU has become worse and turned into Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, or PID).|$|R

25|$|As in {{most other}} canids, male bush dogs lift their hind legs <b>when</b> <b>urinating.</b> However, female bush dogs use a kind of handstand posture, which is less common in other canids. When male bush dogs urinate, they create a spray instead of a stream.|$|R
2500|$|Voiding {{position}} <b>when</b> <b>urinating</b> {{may influence}} urodynamic parameters (urinary flow rate, voiding time, and post-void residual volume).

25|$|Coyotes {{mark their}} territories by urinating on bushes, trees, or rocks. All male coyotes lift their legs <b>when</b> <b>urinating.</b> However, females {{sometimes}} also raise their legs, and males sometimes squat. Urine marking is {{also associated with}} pair bonding in coyotes Coyotes sometimes urinate on their food, possibly to claim ownership over it.|$|R
25|$|All canids (with the {{possible}} exception of dholes) use urine (combined with preputial gland secretions) to mark their territories. Many species of canids, including hoary foxes, cape foxes, and golden jackals, use a raised-leg posture <b>when</b> <b>urinating.</b> The scent of their urine is usually strongest in the winter, before the mating season.|$|R

25|$|Hyenas do {{not raise}} their legs as canids do <b>when</b> <b>urinating,</b> as {{urination}} serves no territorial function for them. Instead, hyenas mark their territories using their anal glands, a trait found also in viverrids and mustelids, but not canids and felids. Unlike other female mammals, female spotted hyenas urinate, copulate, and give birth through an organ called the pseudo-penis.|$|R
50|$|The Prince Albert healing {{time can}} take from 4 weeks to 6 months. A fresh PA {{piercing}} may cause bleeding, swelling and inflammation. In rare cases, {{it can lead}} to local infections. Some men find that the dribble caused by the PA <b>when</b> <b>urinating</b> necessitates sitting down to urinate. With practice, some men can control the stream while standing.|$|R
50|$|Because of its diet, the Crawford's gray shrew must expel a {{large amount}} of {{nitrogenous}} waste from its body, which has a potential for a large loss of water <b>when</b> <b>urinating.</b> However, it is able to reduce water loss from urine, as well, by concentrating urea in the urine. The urine is four times more concentrated than that of a human, thus saving a huge amount of water.|$|R
50|$|Caused by {{increased}} intravascular volume, elevated GFR (glomerular filtration rate), and compression of the bladder by the expanding uterus. It may appear rather suddenly by head engagement {{of the fetus}} into cephalic presentation. Patients are advised to continue fluid intake despite this. Urinalysis and culture should be ordered to rule out infection, which can also cause increased urinary frequency but typically is accompanied by dysuria (pain <b>when</b> <b>urinating).</b>|$|R

50|$|Problems {{that can}} arise include {{a small hole}} in the urinary channel below the meatus, called a fistula. The head of the penis, which is open at birth in {{children}} with hypospadias and is closed around the urinary channel at surgery, sometimes reopens, known as glans dehiscence. The new urinary opening can scar, resulting in meatal stenosis, or internal scarring can create a stricture, either of which cause partial blockage to urinating. If the new urinary channel balloons <b>when</b> <b>urinating</b> a child is diagnosed with a diverticulum.|$|R

50|$|Adrenal disease, {{a growth}} of the adrenal glands that can be either {{hyperplasia}} or cancer, is most often diagnosed by signs like unusual hair loss, increased aggression, constant grooming of owner or other ferrets as well as themselves, difficulty urinating (caused by an enlarged prostate) or defecating, or agitation <b>when</b> <b>urinating,</b> and (in the case of females) an enlarged vulva. Signs of an enlarged prostate should be considered an emergency; even if the growth is benign, it can still cause a hormonal imbalance which can have devastating effects on the ferret's health.|$|R
25|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the {{development}} of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate {{to other parts of the}} body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or <b>when</b> <b>urinating.</b> A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells.|$|R

25|$|Chlamydia is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. In women, symptoms may include abnormal vaginal discharge, burning during urination, and bleeding in between periods, although most women do not experience any symptoms. Symptoms in men include pain <b>when</b> <b>urinating,</b> and abnormal discharge from their penis. If left untreated in both men and women, Chlamydia can infect the urinary tract and potentially lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause serious problems during pregnancy and even {{has the potential to}} cause infertility. It can cause a woman to have a potentially deadly ectopic pregnancy, in which the egg implants outside of the uterus. However, Chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics.|$|R

Her symptoms were consistent with urinary tract infection (UTI, commonly referred to by some as cystitis) for which she was prescribed antibiotics and painkillers. During her visit to the hospital, she vomited, became shaky, muddled and had difficulty talking. It transpired that she had consumed several litres of water throughout the day based on medical advice to drink lots of fluids that she recalled from previous experience of UTIs.
