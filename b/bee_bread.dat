50|$|A C. pallida female {{will find}} a spot for her nest. She will then dig diagonally down about 12 in. At {{the end of this}} tunnel, she will dig an 1 in long {{vertical}} chamber where the egg will be laid. The chamber will be about 8 in below the surface. In this chamber, the female will form a brood pot lined with wax. The brood pot will contain nectar and pollen similar to the <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> in other bees; however, unlike other bees, the <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> is the consistency of molasses instead of being solid. The egg is laid on top of the <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> and sealed in with wax, and the tunnel is partially filled with dirt to protect the egg. A female can create several of the burrows during her lifetime.|$|E

50|$|Four {{varieties}} of bacteria {{have been found}} in the <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> of the larva: Bacillus circulans, B. coagulans, B. firmus, and B. megaterium. Only the Bacillus genus has been found in the samples taken. Together, these four species were able to hydrolyze starch, ferment glucose, convert nitrates to nitrites, and produce dihydroxyacetone from glycerol. This group of bacteria also lowers the pH of the <b>bee</b> <b>bread.</b> These functions serve not only to protect the larva from other bacteria, but they also digest complex molecules which allow the larva to easily absorb nutrients without expending a lot of energy. The bacteria, in turn, receive a supply of food which results in a mutualistic relationship.|$|E
5000|$|... == Ontogenesis == Eggs {{are laid}} on <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> in short tunnels in the nest, each {{containing}} 1-3 progeny each. When the larvae emerge from their eggs, they {{feed on the}} <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> and go through two stages of molting before the pre-pupal stage. The first progeny to emerge will push its siblings father into the tunnel and take over the vacated space. The pre-pupal stage lasts several days before pupation. All pupae begin white and grow darker with time before turning into adults. Abdominal glands in females are white when they are young and grow more yellow as they mature. Total developmental time from egg to adult is around 45-49 days, lasting somewhat less in the summer.|$|E
50|$|A major {{pollinator}} for Parkinsonia {{species in}} the southwestern United States and western Mexico is Centris pallida, a solitary bee known as the digger or pallid bee. C. pallida obtains nectar and pollen from this plant to fill a brood pot so that their larvae will have food when they hatch. The nectar and pollen give its <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> a strong orange color.|$|E
50|$|In Apis species, {{a single}} hair {{functions}} as a pin that secures {{the middle of the}} pollen load. Either Honey or nectar is used to moisten the dry pollen, producing the product known as bee pollen or <b>bee</b> <b>bread.</b> The mixing of the pollen with nectar or honey changes the color of the pollen. The color of the pollen can help identify the pollen source.|$|E
50|$|Centris pallida {{typically}} feed on {{flowers that}} can withstand the hot temperatures of its habitat. These plants include palo verde (Cercidium microphyllum and Cercidium floridium), ironwood (Olnyea tesota), and creosote bush (Larrea divaricata). The palo verde pollen {{is the most}} common, and it gives the <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> a strong orange color. Due to the large expenditure of energy by males during hovering and/or patrolling, they must consume about 3.5 times their body weight in nectar each day.|$|E
50|$|X. pubescens is polylectic, so it forages on {{many species}} of plants. It forages on some plants for nectar when {{preparing}} <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> during ontogenesis and forages on others for pollen to feed offspring. Pheromones from Dufour's gland are vital to mark flowers previously visited and also to mark nests so that the foraging bees know where to return.

50|$|Apitherapy is {{the medical}} use of {{honeybee}} {{products such as}} honey, pollen, <b>bee</b> <b>bread,</b> propolis, royal jelly and bee venom. One of the major peptides in bee venom, called Melittin, {{has the potential to}} treat inflammation in sufferers of Rheumatoid arthritis and Multiple sclerosis. Melittin blocks the expression of inflammatory genes, thus reducing swelling and pain. It is administered by direct insect sting, or intramuscular injections. Bee products demonstrate a wide array of antimicrobial factors and in laboratory studies and have been shown to kill antibiotic resistant bacteria, pancreatic cancer cells, and many other infectious microbes.|$|E
50|$|The egg {{will then}} hatch within two weeks, and the grub will eat the {{nourishment}} {{that the mother}} left. The amount of <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> provided will directly affect {{the size of the}} offspring (more food = larger size). When the food has been eaten and the grub has fully developed, the grub will turn into a prepupa. Over the course of eleven months, the prepupa will undergo metamorphosis to become an adult bee. The adult bee will then dig to the surface in late April or early May, and will live for about a month. By late July, virtually no C. pallida can be found.|$|E
50|$|Larger {{females are}} able to better control {{the size of their}} offspring. As stated in the Life Cycle section, more <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> leads to larger offspring. Larger females {{are able to}} gather more pollen and nectar in a shorter amount of time when {{compared}} to smaller females. This means that during rich conditions, the larger females can have larger offspring with greater fitness, or if conditions are poor, the females can simply choose to have smaller offspring. There is a lower limit to how small offspring can be, and thus, smaller females can’t make this reduction or increase in size in response to the environment. Smaller females are still able to exist since larger females can’t take advantage of having larger offspring when the density of nesting grounds is low. To put it another way, larger male offspring are less effective in low density nesting grounds since they don’t have as many opportunities to use their size to fight off other males; thus, in low density nesting grounds, small and large males have similar fitness which means that the extra <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> which the larger male received served no purpose. Smaller males actually do better in low density areas because they don’t have to fight with larger males as much, and by extension, expend less energy. This lack of a reason to produce larger offspring reduces the fitness of the larger females since they have to dig larger tunnels to fit in, but still produce the same size offspring as smaller females.|$|E

50|$|X. sulcatipes visits {{flowers for}} both pollen and nectar collection. In the Arava Valley, Calotropis procera, Retama raetam, Acacia tortilis, and A. raddianna are native plants most {{commonly}} visited by this bee. Depending {{on the season}} of the year, certain plants are preferred. For example, C. procera, only gives nectar to the bees and blooms from March to September, so only during these months do X. sulcatipes visit this plant species. This flower is very popular among the bees. Retama raetam blooms for only {{a short period of}} time from March to April. The way this bee species collects nectar is by settling on a flower and inserting its proboscis. X. sulcatipes mixes the nectar and pollen it gathers at irregular intervals and thus, there is great variability in <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> sizes. This leads to different adult bee sizes.|$|E
50|$|Bee pollen is {{the pollen}} ball {{that has been}} packed by worker honeybees into pellets. <b>Bee</b> <b>bread</b> is also the bee pollen with added honey and bee {{secretions}} and stored in brood cells, chambers of honeybees or of wood and mud created by female ground-nesting (such as the Leafcutting Bee) bees. With the Leafcutting Bee, when the pollen ball is complete, a single female lays an egg {{on top of the}} pollen ball, and seals the brood cell. Pollen balls are harvested as food for humans. Bee pollen is sometimes referred to as ambrosia., whereas with honey bees, the thing {{to keep in mind is}} that the forager bees that gather pollen do not eat it themselves, since when they transition to foraging, they stop producing the proteolytic enzymes necessary to digest it. So the foragers unload the pollen they’ve gathered directly into open cells located at the interface between the brood and stored honey, creating a typical band of what is called beebread - the substance which is the main food source for honey bee larvae and workers.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{honey and}} propolis, other {{well-known}} honey bee {{products that are}} gathered rather than secreted (i.e., in contrast to royal jelly and beeswax), the exact chemical composition depends on the plants the worker bees gather the pollen from, and can vary from hour to hour, day to day, week to week, colony to colony, even in the same apiary, with no two samples of bee pollen exactly identical. Accordingly, chemical and nutritional analyses of bee pollen apply only to the specific samples being tested, and cannot be extrapolated to samples gathered in other places or other times. Although there is no specific chemical composition, the average composition {{is said to be}} 40-60% simple sugars (fructose and glucose), 20-60% proteins, 3% minerals and vitamins, 1-32% fatty acids, and 5% diverse other components.

40|$|Herson, Diane S. In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{dramatic}} worldwide increase in the loss of honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies (1). This decline has received much attention due to the important ecosystem service they provide; pollination. The bacterial flora in colonies has important roles including protecting honey bees from pathogens by preventing their colonization and producing antimicrobial compounds as well as aiding in the conversion of pollen to <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> (2, 3, 4). These findings suggest that the bacterial flora in <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> is important for honey bee colony health. Antibiotics used in honey bee colonies and on plants pollinated by honey bees include Oxytetracycline HCl, Streptomycin, Tylosin Tartrate, and Fumagillin-B. However, the mode of action of these antibiotics is not specific towards pathogens; therefore commensal organisms can also be affected. The goal of this research was to determine if the bacterial flora of <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> in honey bee colonies reflects the health of the colony. <b>Bee</b> <b>bread</b> was sampled from 15 colonies in the University of Delaware Research Apiary from May to October 2013. Colony characteristics including total number of bees, total number of brood, brood pattern, and the amounts of honey, pollen, and nectar were also determined. Polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) were used as a bacterial fingerprinting technique to get a profile of all the culturable and nonculturable bacteria present. Culturable bacteria were isolated from the <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> samples and identified using fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis. Bacterial isolates from <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> were also tested for susceptibility to Oxytetracycline HCl, Streptomycin, Tylosin Tartrate, Fumagillin-B, and Ampicillin. FAME analysis identified some of the same core organisms reported by other researchers as well as diverse organisms, which may be environmental bacteria transferred into the colony. Principal component analysis was done on the bacterial banding patterns produced by PCR-DGGE, which suggested that the bacterial flora of <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> is one of multiple factors involved in the survival of honey bee colonies after the winter season. Some Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to Oxytetracycline HCl and Streptomycin, which suggests that their roles in the colony should be further researched.

40|$|Sufficiently {{diverse and}} {{abundant}} resources {{are essential for}} generalist consumers, and form {{an important part of}} a suite of conservation strategies for pollinators. Honey bees are generalist foragers and are dependent on diverse forage to adequately meet their nutritional needs. Through analysis of stored pollen (<b>bee</b> <b>bread)</b> samples obtained from 26 honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) hives across NW-England, we quantified <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> nutritional content and the plant species that produced these stores from pollen. Protein was the most abundant nutrient by mass (63 %), followed by carbohydrates (26 %). Protein and lipid content (but not carbohydrate) contributed significantly to ordinations of floral diversity, linking dietary quality with forage composition. DNA sequencing of the ITS 2 region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA gene identified pollen from 89 distinct plant genera, with each <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> sample containing between 6 and 35 pollen types. Dominant genera included dandelion (Taraxacum), which was positively correlated with <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> protein content, and cherry (Prunus), which was negatively correlated with the amount of protein. In addition, proportions of amino acids (e. g. histidine and valine) varied as a function of floral species composition. These results also quantify the effects of individual plant genera on the nutrition of honey bees. We conclude that pollens of different plants act synergistically to influence host nutrition; the pollen diversity of <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> is linked to its nutrient content. Diverse environments compensate for the loss of individual forage plants, and diversity loss may, therefore, destabilize consumer communities due to restricted access to alternative resources...|$|E

40|$|Honey {{bees are}} pollinators, {{accounting}} for around 90 % of commercial pollination of animal-pollinated plants and approximately 35 % of global food production. Global populations of honey bees have declined significantly recently with heavy losses attributed to Colony Collapse Disorder, pesticides, parasites and pathogens. One {{of the factors}} that may be contributing to an increase in susceptibility to these stresses is the quality of food available in a hive. This thesis focuses on the interactions between honey bee nutrition, microbial communities and fitness. In Chapter 2 the nutritional composition of <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> (pollen stored inside hives) was studied. The composition in terms of protein and reducing sugar was found to vary both spatially and temporally; lipid and starch content was found to vary temporally through the season. The spatial trends in protein content were found to be associated with changes in landscape composition, as estimated by the Countryside Survey database. The implications for these findings are that certain landscape types may produce higher quality diets for honey bees. In Chapter 3, the link between nutritional composition of <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> and the species of plant that comprise it was investigated. Previous research indicates that pollens vary in their nutritional content and using molecular tools, we investigated the impact of complex plant communities in this system. The number of plant species in <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> was positively correlated with increasing protein levels, and specifically certain individual plant species were found to be driving this pattern. These results indicate that a more diverse diet of plants will benefit honey bees by increasing their dietary protein intake. The conversion of pollen to <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> requires the activity of certain microorganisms. In chapter 4, we again used molecular tools to study the microbial community found associated with <b>bee</b> <b>bread.</b> We found a community that was not significantly different between hives located in different areas, but which varied significantly in is composition through the beekeeping season. This suggests that the environment does not determine the bacterial communities in honey bee hives; rather it is being determined by seasonal changes. Finally, in chapter 5 the relationship between the nutritional composition of <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> and the immunocompetence of larval and adult honey bees was examined. The results showed that dietary protein and carbohydrate is significantly correlated with the overall fitness of a hive in terms of expression a constituent immune response. The link between landscape composition and nutrition established in chapter 2 was used to predict honey bee nutrition across the UK, and then was used to predict immune response for all UK bees. These predictions were comparable to honey bee disease records maintained by UK government. This thesis provides a detailed examination of the effects of landscape composition on honey bee nutrition and immunity. The results presented here have implications for understanding spatial patterns in bee fitness and bee disease epidemiology...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Biosurfactants are amphipathic {{molecules}} {{with both}} hydrophilic and hydrophobic moieties {{that allow them}} to reduce surface tension. Biosurfactants have several advantages over the chemical surfactants, such as lower toxicity, higher biodegradability and better environmental compatibility. A promising group of glycolipid biosurfactants are sophorolipids that are produced by a group of yeasts. So the aim of this study was isolation of yeasts from <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> of honey bees. Materials and Methods: The samples were prepared from <b>bee</b> <b>bread</b> of honey bee, Apis mellifera. The yeasts were isolated on YMG culture medium. Hemolysis and oil spreading techniques were performed for screening of biosurfactant-producing isolates. The extracted biosurfactants were characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results: From a total of 35 isolated yeast strains, 10 isolates had positive oil spreading test. The HG 12 isolate showed the highest level of oil spreading character. The TLC and FTIR examinations of the purified Glycolipid biosurfactant confirmed its structure as sophorolipid. Conclusions: This is the first report of production of a sophorolipid biosurfactant from yeast in Iran...|$|E
