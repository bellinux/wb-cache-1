5|$|The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> (Tyto alba) is {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} species of owl {{and one of the}} most widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the common <b>barn</b> <b>owl,</b> to distinguish it from other species in its family, Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae). The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> is found almost everywhere in the world except polar and desert regions, Asia north of the Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific islands.|$|E
5|$|Other {{research}} tools include using GPS trackers fitted {{onto the}} <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> allowing precise location tracking of the owl.|$|E
5|$|The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This {{improves}} {{detection of}} sound position and distance {{and the bird}} does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown {{by the fact that}} with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in azimuth but fails to do so in elevation. Hunting nocturnally or crepuscularly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> has a much higher metabolic rate, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as pests by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> habitation by providing nest sites.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two chapters describing my investigations of roadway mortality and ornamentation of <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> (Tyto alba) in southern Idaho. My research objectives were to (1) quantify roadway mortality of <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> along a 248 -kilometer stretch of Interstate 84, (2) examine {{the factors that influence}} roadway mortality of <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> in this area, (3) refine my estimates of roadway mortality by performing bias experiments, and (4) investigate the potential relationships between ornamentation (in the form of ventral spottiness) and quality in North American <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> (T. a. pratincola) and compare my results to similar studies of European <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> (T. a. guttata and T. a. alba). I performed my research from July 2004 to December 2007. Information contained in this thesis should be of interest to individuals investigating human- induced mortality of wildlife, roadway mortality of birds, or sexual selection and ornamentation in avian species, as well as to biologists involved with general research and conservation of <b>barn</b> <b>owls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Visual {{search is}} the process of searching for {{something}} interesting in a cluttered environment. It is well studied in humans, but not in non-primate species. This study provides a comprehensive overview of visual search in <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> using a novel methodology: the OwlCam. The OwlCam is a tiny, lightweight camera that can be mounted onto the head of <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> to record first person videos from these birds. Due to the very limited eye movements of <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> this provides an easy method of gaze tracking with only one camera in these birds which is not possible in most other species. Six experiments to investigate overt visual search processes in <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> are described. Experiment 1 investigates basic overt attentional processes in <b>barn</b> <b>owls.</b> The question was, whether <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> are attracted to the same conspicuous stimuli as humans? This was shown by confronting <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> with arrays of differently oriented stimuli containing one odd target among similar distracters. <b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> were attracted to the odd stimulus, as humans are. Experiments 2 and 3 prove that <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> have a pop-out effect. Pop-out is the ability of visual systems to detect and localize certain visual targets equally efficiently regardless of the complexity of visual distraction. This was tested by training the owls to search for a unique target in feature-search arrays. These feature searches contained several quantities of uniform distracters and one odd target, different from the distracters in either orientation (experiment 2) or intensity (experiment 3). The search time and number of saccades until the target was found did not change at different set sizes, showing that <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> have a pop-out effect. Experiment 4 was similar to experiment 3 but with inverted target and distracters to test whether <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> have search asymmetries. That may be the case, if a search task’s difficulty changes when the target and distracters are inverted. The data showed that this was the case. Finally, experiment 5 and 6 were conjunction-search tasks. These are difficult search tasks, in which the target is a unique combination of two features, orientation and intensity, and the distracters are the other feature combinations. The owls could learn to do these tasks, and indeed it took them much longer to find the targets than in the simples feature searches, and search time depended on array size. Thus, this study shows that <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> match human performance in several visual searches. Therefore, a pop-out effect or complex visual searches do not require the elaborate cortical structure found in mammalian brains. Furthermore, this study shows that <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> wearing OwlCams could be a model system to study visual search and overt attention in non-primate species...|$|R
40|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> (Tyto alba javanica) {{have been}} widely {{introduced}} in Malaysian oil palm plantations to control rodent pests. However, their effectiveness in regulating rodent populations is unknown. We investigated whether <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> selected prey with respect to size and sex classes {{based on data from}} 128 pellets of <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> compared to 1292 live-trapped rats in an oil palm plantation in Malaysia. The birds mostly fed on Rattus rail as diardii, the most commonly trapped species. Body mass of prey consumed was predicted based on models derived from measurements from trapped rats. Sex of prey was determined by pelvic measurements with reference to those taken from specimens of known gender. There was no clear selection of prey by <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> in relation to size or sex of prey, and no difference in the body mass of prey between the owls 2 ̆ 7 breeding and nonbreeding seasons. The absence of differential predation in <b>Barn</b> <b>Owls</b> may partly explain the lack of dear evidence that they regulate rodent populations and thus act as successful biological control agents...|$|R
5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysia, {{large areas}} of {{rainforest}} were felled {{to make way for}} oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished. The provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw almost one hundred percent occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of barn owls in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.|$|E

50|$|<b>Barn</b> <b>owls</b> are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas as they used to be. In the USA, <b>barn</b> <b>owls</b> are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states.|$|R

5|$|Many animals prey on marsh rice rats. The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> (Tyto alba) {{is among}} the most important; one study found that 97.5% of {{vertebrate}} remains in <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> pellets were marsh rice rats. Other predators include birds (marsh hawks, Circus cyaneus; and barred owls, Strix varia), snakes (cottonmouth moccasins, Agkistrodon piscivorus; and others), alligators, and carnivorans (raccoons, Procyon lotor; red foxes, Vulpes vulpes; minks, Neovison vison; weasels of the genus Mustela; and striped skunks, Mephitis mephitis). Many parasites have been recorded on the marsh rice rat, including various ticks and mites, lice, and fleas among external parasites and many nematodes and digeneans, a pentastomid, and several coccidians among internal parasites (see parasites of the marsh rice rat).|$|E

5|$|Small prey {{is usually}} torn into chunks and eaten {{completely}} including bones and fur, while prey {{larger than about}} 100g (4oz), such as baby rabbits, Cryptomys blesmols, or Otomys vlei rats, is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, the <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> does not eat domestic animals on any sort of regular basis. Regionally, non-rodent foods are used as per availability. On bird-rich islands, a <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> might include some fifteen to twenty percent of birds in its diet, while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming termites, or on Orthoptera such as Copiphorinae katydids, Jerusalem crickets (Stenopelmatidae) or true crickets (Gryllidae). Bats and even frogs, lizards and snakes may make a minor but {{significant contribution to the}} diet; small Soricomorpha like Suncus shrews may be a secondary prey of major importance.|$|E
5|$|The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> hunts {{by flying}} slowly, {{quartering}} {{the ground and}} hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E
5|$|The <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> is nocturnal {{over most}} of its range, but in Britain and some Pacific islands, it also hunts by day. Barn owls specialise in hunting animals {{on the ground and}} nearly all of their food {{consists}} of small mammals which they locate by sound, their hearing being very acute. They mate for life unless one of the pair gets killed, when a new pair bond may be formed. Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality, with a clutch, averaging about four eggs, being laid in a nest in a hollow tree, old building or fissure in a cliff. The female does all the incubation, and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food. When large numbers of small prey are readily available, <b>barn</b> <b>owl</b> populations can expand rapidly, and globally the bird is considered to be of least conservation concern. Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened.|$|E
