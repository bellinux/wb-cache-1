5000|$|The {{function}} of a vapor barrier is to retard the migration of water vapor, which are not typically intended to retard the migration of air. This is the {{function of}} <b>air</b> <b>barriers.</b> [...] <b>Air</b> is mixed with water vapor. When air moves from location to location due to an air pressure difference, the vapor moves with it. This {{is a type of}} migration of water vapor. In the strictest sense <b>air</b> <b>barriers</b> are also vapor barriers when they control the transport of moisture-laden air. [...] It must be mentioned that the designated perm ratings do not reflect the diminished permeability of a given vapor retarder medium when affected by temperature differences on opposing sides of the medium. A discussion about the differences between vapor <b>barriers</b> and <b>air</b> <b>barriers</b> can be found in Quirouette.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically-attached membranes, {{also known}} as housewraps, usually a polyethylene-fiber or {{spun-bonded}} polyolefin, such as Tyvek is a generally accepted moisture <b>barrier</b> and an <b>air</b> <b>barrier</b> (ASTM E2178).|$|R
40|$|Air leakage in {{buildings}} located in {{hot and humid}} climates can result in excessive energy costs. Additionally, if uncontrolled moisture carried on air currents condenses within building components, it can potentially lead to material deterioration or mold problems. The incorporation of <b>air</b> <b>barriers</b> into the building construction can help control air leakage. This paper reviews {{the potential benefits of}} residential <b>air</b> <b>barrier</b> construction in hot and humid climates and the efficacy of housewraps as <b>air</b> <b>barriers...</b>|$|R

50|$|Tauranga Airport is {{also served}} by 2 {{regional}} airlines, Sunair operating scheduled flights to Claris, Gisborne, North Shore, Motiti Island and Whitianga, and <b>Barrier</b> <b>Air</b> operating flights to Claris, In addition to this, {{there are several}} scenic and charter airlines based at the airport, as well as extensive skydiving, glider and helicopter operations. The airport {{is also home to}} a large number of general aviation aircraft, with the majority of them being stored in the rows of hangars to the east and northwest of the terminal.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} the {{introduction}} of the air fence. The air fence performs a function similar to the air bag in a commercial passenger vehicle, except that rather than inflating upon impact, it is pre-inflated. By acting as a softer, energy-absorbing <b>barrier,</b> <b>air</b> fences can be placed over hard obstacles around tracks that racers might encounter in the course of an accident. With an air fence in place the racer has a much better chance of sustaining fewer injuries than if he were to simply hit the object without any buffer. They are especially important (and more widely used) in motorcycle road racing.|$|E
50|$|Kaitaia Airport is {{the most}} {{northern}} airfield in New Zealand that has fuel available. Kaitaia airport has a long and smooth runway, {{it also has the}} longest runway in Northland and is used by light aircraft, as well as private (such as the Gulfstream V) and a regular <b>Barrier</b> <b>Air</b> Cessna Caravan service from Auckland Airport. 852 km (460 nautical miles) to the North West of Kaitaia is Norfolk Island Airport from which it is 754 km (407 nautical miles) to Noumea in New Caledonia, or 900 km (486 nautical miles) to Lord Howe Island which {{can be used as a}} stepping stone to the Australian mainland.|$|E
50|$|Medium-density {{closed-cell}} {{foam insulation}} {{is often referred}} to as two pound (2 lb) foam. It is a rigid insulating material with a Long Term Thermal Resistance (LTTR) R-value that ranges between 5.1 - 6 per inch When the required minimum thickness of 50 mm is installed, ccSPF is both a vapour <b>barrier</b> and an <b>air</b> <b>barrier.</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>air</b> <b>barrier</b> {{technique}} {{is to apply}} the special airflow through window fan to improve the thermal environment near the windows in winter and summer, and especially in winter, to simplify the air conditioning system of perimeter zone of office building and avoid condensation {{on the surface of}} window. By using numerical simulation, the paper analyzed the thermal environment of the office building, both applied the <b>air</b> <b>barrier</b> technique or not. The paper also compared the two different methods in winter and summer respectably. According to the results, we may obtain the key control strategy of this technology. It can be validated that the <b>air</b> <b>barrier</b> technique, instead of heating-supply in the perimeter zone of office building, can simplify the machine plant and the duct system of air conditioning. It can also be concluded that, by using the <b>air</b> <b>barrier</b> system, condensation symptom in winter can be avoided and the thermal environment near the windows is improved...|$|R
50|$|Walls are not {{subjected}} to standing water, and the water-resistant membranes used as housewraps {{are designed to}} be porous enough to let moisture escape. Walls also have vapor <b>barriers</b> or <b>air</b> <b>barriers.</b> Damp proofing is another aspect of waterproofing. Masonry walls are built with a damp-proof course to prevent rising damp, and the concrete in foundations needs to be damp-proofed or waterproofed with a liquid coating, basement waterproofing membrane (even under the concrete slab floor where polyethylene sheeting is commonly used), or an additive to the concrete.|$|R
