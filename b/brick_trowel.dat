5000|$|Tile setter: a <b>brick</b> <b>trowel</b> with an {{extra-wide}} {{blade to}} hold more mortar than a standard <b>brick</b> <b>trowel.</b> It {{is ideal for}} smoothing mortar on large bricks and blocks.|$|E
5000|$|Pointing trowel: {{a smaller}} {{version of the}} <b>brick</b> <b>trowel.</b> Useful for filling in small {{cavities}} and repairing crumbling mortar joints.|$|E
5000|$|In {{archaeology}} <b>brick</b> or pointing <b>trowels</b> (usually 4" [...] or 5" [...] steel trowels) {{are used}} to scratch the strata in an excavation and allow the colours of the soil to be clear, so that the different strata can be identified, processed and excavated. In the United States, there are several preferred brands of pointing trowels, including the Marshalltown trowel; while in the British Isles the WHS 4" [...] pointing trowel is the traditional tool.|$|R
50|$|For {{efficient}} {{handling and}} laying, bricks must be small enough and {{light enough to}} be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the <b>trowel).</b> <b>Bricks</b> are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about four inches (about 100 mm). In most cases, the length of a brick is about twice its width, about eight inches (about 200 mm) or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid bonded in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in English bond, at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of stretchers, bricks laid longways, and headers, bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of English bond called English cross bond where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true English bond, the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other.|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to build}} my chimney I studied masonry. My bricks, being {{second-hand}} ones, {{required to be}} cleaned with a trowel, so that I learned more than usual of the qualities of <b>bricks</b> and <b>trowels.</b> The mortar on them was fifty years old, and {{was said to be}} still growing harder; but {{this is one of those}} sayings which men love to repeat whether they are true or not. Such sayings themselves grow harder and adhere more firmly with age, and it would take many blows with a trowel to clean an old wiseacre of them. Many of the villages of Mesopotamia are built of second-hand bricks of a very good quality, obtained from the ruins of Babylon, and the cement on them is older and probably harder still. However that may be, I was struck by the peculiar toughness of the steel which bore so many violent blows without being worn out. As my bricks had been in a chimney before, though I did not read the name of Nebuchadnezzar on them, I picked out as many fireplace bricks as I could find, to save work and waste, and I filled the spaces between the bricks about the fireplace with stones from the pond shore, and also made my mortar with the white sand from the same place. I lingered most about the fireplace, as the most vital part of the house. Indeed, I worked so deliberately, that though I commenced at the ground in the morning, a course of bricks raised a few inches above the floor served for my pillow at night; yet I did not get a stiff neck for it that I remember; my stiff neck is of older date. I took a poet to board for a fortnight about those times, which caused me to be put to it for room. He brought his own knife, though I had two, and we used to scour them by thrusting them into the earth. He shared with me the labors of cooking. I was pleased to see my work rising so square and solid by degrees, and reflected, that, if it proceeded slowly, it was calculated to endure a long time. The chimney is to some extent an independent structure, standing on the ground, and rising through the house to the heavens; even after the house is burned it still stands sometimes, and its importance and independence are apparent. This was toward the end of summer. It was now November.|$|R
