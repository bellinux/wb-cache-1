40|$|Abstract—Geographic routing {{has been}} {{addressed}} in many literatures of ad hoc sensor networks {{due to its}} efficiency and scalability. Void areas (holes) bring Geographic routing several problems such as excessive energy consumption and data congestion of hole boundary nodes. Holes are hardly avoided in wireless sensor networks because of various actual geographical environments, e. g., puddles, buildings or obstacles, or uneven energy consumption, even physical destruction. To <b>bypass</b> <b>holes,</b> most existing geographic routing protocols tend to route data packets along the boundaries of holes by perimeter routing scheme. This scheme consumes more energy of the nodes on the boundaries of holes, thus possibly enlarging the holes, we call this hole diffusion problem.

In this paper, we propose and analyse spatial aware geographic forwarding (SAGF), a new approach that proactively avoids constant topology holes caused by spatial constraints while still preserving the advantage of stateless forwarding. Geographic source routes (GSR) based on intermediate locations are selected to <b>bypass</b> topology <b>holes.</b> Proactive route selection based on the spatial knowledge is a general approach, and thus can be used with any geographic forwarding algorithms.

The key attack identified in such a network is Compromised Node (CN) attack which has the ability to create black hole, thereby intercepting the active information delivery. In this paper, we develop an effective routing mechanism that can with high probability, circumvent the black hole formed by this attack. The Purely Random Propagation (PRP) algorithm developed generates randomized dispersive routes so that the routes taken by the shares of different packets changes over time. Besides randomness, the generated routes are also highly dispersive and energy efficient, making them quite capable of <b>bypassing</b> black <b>hole.</b> Also, the energy constraint is highly optimized in the entire routing mechanism leading to minimal energy consumption.

40|$|Attacks in {{wireless}} sensor {{networks are}} Compromised-node and denial-of-service (DOS). In the Compromised-node attack (CN attack); an adversary physically compromises a subset of nodes to eavesdrop information, whereas in the denial-of-service attack, the adversary interferes with the normal operation of the network by actively disrupting, changing, or even paralyzing the functionality of a subset of nodes. These two attacks are similar {{in the sense that}} they both generate black holes areas within which the adversary can either passively intercept or actively block information delivery. Due to the unattended nature of WSNs, adversaries can easily produce such black holes. Severe CN and DOS attacks can disrupt normal data delivery between sensor nodes and the sink, or even partition the topology. In general we study routing mechanisms that circumvent (<b>bypass)</b> black <b>holes</b> formed by these attacks. We argue that existing multi-path routing approaches are vulnerable to such attacks, mainly due to their deterministic nature. So once an adversary acquires the routing algorithm, it can compute the same routes known to the source, and hence endanger all information sent over these routes.

The present configuration with can annular combustors differs substantially from the aircraft engines which typically use a 360 degree annular combustor. Experiments were conducted in a one-third scale, annular 360 -degree model using several can combustors equispaced around the turbine axis. A 3 -D computational fluid dynamics analysis employing the multidomain procedure was performed to supplement the flow measurements. The measured data correlated well with the computations. The airflow in the dump diffuser adversely affected the prediffuser flow by causing it to accelerate in the outer region at the prediffuser exit. This phenomenon {{referred to as the}} sink-effect also caused a large fraction of the flow to bypass much of the dump diffuser and go directly from the prediffuser exit to the <b>bypass</b> air <b>holes</b> on the combustor casing, thereby, rendering the dump diffuser ineffective in diffusing the flow. The dump diffuser was occupied by a large recirculation region which dissipated the flow kinetic energy. Approximately 1. 2 dynamic head at the prediffuser inlet was lost in the combustor-diffuser system; much of it in the dump diffuser where the fluid passed through the narrow gaps and pathways.

The analysis of a joint subjected to search combined bearing and bypass loads {{is complicated by the}} usual clearance between the hole and the fastener. A simple analysis method for such clearance-fit joints subjected to bearing-bypass loading has been developed in the present study. It uses an inverse formulation with a linear elastic finite-element analysis. Conditions along the bolt-hole contact arc are specified by displacement constraint equations. The present method is simple to apply and can be implemented with most general purpose finite-element programs since it does not use complicated iterative-incremental procedures. The method was used to study the effects of bearing-bypass loading on bolt-hole contact angles and local stresses. In this study, a rigid, frictionless bolt was used with a plate having the properties of a quasi-isotropic graphite/epoxy laminate. Results showed that the contact angle as well as the peak stresses around the hole and their locations were strongly influenced by the ratio of bearing and bypass loads. For single contact, tension and compression bearing-bypass loading had opposite effects on the contact angle. For some compressive bearing-bypass loads, the hole tended to close on the fastener leading to dual contact. It was shown that dual contact reduces the stress concentration at the fastener and would, therefore, increase joint strength in compression. The results illustrate the general importance of accounting for bolt-hole clearance and contact to accurately compute local bolt-hole stresses for combined bearings and bypass loading...|$|R
40|$|A new {{category}} of intelligent sensor network applications emerges where motion {{is a fundamental}} characteristic of the system under consideration. In such applications, sensors are attached to vehicles, or people that move around large geographic areas. For instance, in mission critical applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sinks can be associated to first responders. In such scenarios, reliable data dissemination of events is very important, {{as well as the}} efficiency in handling the mobility of both sinks and event sources. For this kind of applications, reliability means real-time data delivery with a high data delivery ratio. In this article, we propose a virtual infrastructure and a data dissemination protocol exploiting this infrastructure, which considers dynamic conditions of multiple sinks and sources. The architecture consists of `highways' in a honeycomb tessellation, which are the three main diagonals of the honeycomb where the data flow is directed and event data is cached.

40|$|It {{is known}} that two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) cannot merge in a spherical galaxy within a Hubble time; an {{emerging}} picture is that galaxy geometry, rotation, and large potential perturbations may usher the SMBH binary through the critical three-body scattering phase and ultimately drive the SMBH to coalesce. We explore the orbital content within an N-body model of a mildly- flattened, non-rotating, SMBH-embedded elliptical galaxy. When used {{as the foundation for}} a study on the SMBH binary coalescence, the black <b>holes</b> <b>bypassed</b> the binary stalling often seen within spherical galaxies and merged on Gyr timescales (Khan et al. 2013).

We quantified the set of orbits that could be scattered by the SMBH binary, and found that the axisymmetric model contained nearly seven times the number of these potential loss cone orbits compared to our equivalent spherical model.

40|$|Generally {{traffic and}} the sensor network {{security}} have many {{challenges in the}} transmission of data in the network. The existing schemes consider homogeneous sensor networks which have poor performance and scalability. Due to many-to-one traffic pattern, sensors may communicate with small portion of its neighbours. Key management is the critical process in sensor nodes to secure the data. Most existing schemes establish shared keys for all the sensors no matter whether they are communicating or not. Hence it leads to large storage overhead. Another problem in sensor network is compromised node attack and denial of service attack which occurs because of its wireless nature. Existing multi path routing algorithms are vulnerable to these attacks. So once an adversary acquires the routing algorithm, it can compute the same routes known to the source, and hence endanger all information sent over these routes. If an adversary performs node compromise attack, they can easily get the encryption/ decryption keys used by that node and hence they can intercept the information easily. In this paper we are proposing a key management scheme which only establishes shared keys with their communicating neighbour and a mechanism to generate randomized multipath routes for secure transmission of data to the sink. Here we are adopting heterogeneous sensor networks and we are utilizing elliptic curve cryptography for efficient key management which is more efficient, scalable, and highly secure and reduces communication overhead.

40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industry, {{pipeline}} {{networks are}} used to transport the production fluids from wells to production plants. During normal operation, the pipelines need regular cleaning and inspection. Typically, the pipeline maintenance is performed by pigging, which refers to using devices known as “pigs ”(Pipeline Inspection Gauges) to perform various maintenance operations of the pipeline. In order to describe the motion of the pig in the pipeline, detailed understanding of the flow around the pig is required. In this research, a CFD (computational fluid dynamics) approach was applied to model fully turbulent flow (Re ¼ 107) around various types of bypass pigs. We especially focused on the relation between the overall pressure drop, which was represented by a dimensionless pressure loss coefficient, and various dimensionless parameters describing the flow and the configuration. The pressure loss coefficient is caused by the fluid that passes through the bypass area. If the pressure loss coefficient is known, together with the friction between the moving pig and the pipe wall, the motion of the pig can be described. Moreover, often the flow in the pipeline is in multiphase (stratified flow) condition. Therefore, in this research the effect of multiphase flow around a bypass pig was also investigated. For the single phase study, two types of bypass pigs were investigated: the disk pig and the complex bypass pig. The disk pig has a fixed and relatively simple geometry, and {{it is based on the}} conventional bypass pig, with a deflector plate in front of the pig body. The complex bypass pig geometry is based on the disk pig, though now the bypass area is created by holes which can be adjusted. In reality, for these complex bypass pigs, the bypass pig velocity is controlled by adjusting the bypass area. For the conventional bypass pig, previous studies have shown that the Idelchik’s correlation for thick orifices can predict the pressure loss coefficient accurately. Thus a similar approach was applied in the disk pig study in order to obtain a theoretical correlation to predict the pressure loss coefficient for the disk pig. Indeed such a correlation was found which gives an accurate prediction for a certain parameter regime. In the complex bypass pig study, we mainly focused on the influence of the bypass area fraction on the pressure loss coefficient. Two correlations based on two approaches were suggested. It was found that these correlations can predict the overall pressure drop across the complex bypass pig accurately, especially when the opening fraction of the <b>bypass</b> adjusting <b>holes</b> was relatively large. Furthermore, for the multiphase study, the simpler pig models were investigated. First of all, the flow in front of a pig without bypass region was investigated. One of the practical purposes of this study is that we want to investigate under which condition the full pipeline perimeter gets wetted with liquid. This is important for the distribution of corrosion inhibitors. Moreover, the multiphase flow around a (conventional) bypass pig was investigated, to obtain a better understanding of the multiphase flow behaviour for bypass pigs.
