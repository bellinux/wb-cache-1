40|$|Background: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an {{important}} eukaryotic workhorse in traditional and modern biotechnology. At present, only a few S. cerevisiae strains have been extensively used as engineering hosts. Recently, an astonishing genotypic and phenotypic diversity of S. cerevisiae was disclosed in natural populations. We suppose that some natural strains can be recruited as superior host candidates in bioengineering. This study engineered a natural S. cerevisiae strain with advantages in inulin utilization to produce ethanol from inulin resources by consolidated <b>bioprocess.</b> Rational <b>engineering</b> strategies were employed, including secretive co-expression of heterologous exo-and endo-inulinases, repression of a protease, and switch between haploid and diploid strains...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of bulk enzymes used in food industry or organic chemistry constitutes {{an important part}} of industrial biotechnology. The development of production processes for novel proteins comprises a variety of biological <b>engineering</b> and <b>bioprocess</b> reaction <b>engineering</b> factors. The combinatorial explosion of these factors can be effectively countered by combining high-throughput experimentation with advanced algorithms for data analysis and experimental design. We present an experimental optimization strategy that merges three different techniques: (1) advanced microbioreactor systems, (2) lab automation, and (3) Kriging-based experimental analysis and design. This strategy is demonstrated by maximizing product titer of secreted green fluorescent protein (GFP), synthesized by Corynebacterium glutamicum, through systematic variation of CgXII minimal medium composition. First, relevant design parameters are identified in an initial fractional factorial screening experiment. Then, the functional relationship between selected media components and protein titer is investigated more detailed in an iterative procedure. In each iteration, Kriging interpolations are used for formulating hypotheses and planning the next round of experiments. For the optimized medium composition, GFP product titer was more than doubled. Hence, Kriging-based experimental analysis and design has been proven to be a powerful tool for efficient process optimization...|$|R

40|$|Good {{physiological}} {{performance of}} industrial microbes {{is crucial for}} successful <b>bioprocesses.</b> Conventional metabolism-oriented <b>engineering</b> strategies often fail to obtain expected phenotypes owing to focusing narrowly on targeted metabolic capabilities while neglecting microbial physiological responses to environmental stresses. To meet the new challenges posed by the biotechnological production of fuels, chemicals and materials, microbes should exert strong physiological robustness and fitness, in addition to strong metabolic capabilities, {{to enable them to}} work efficiently in actual bioprocesses. Here, we address the importance of engineering physiological functionalities into microbes and illustrate the operation procedure. We believe that this physiology-oriented engineering strategy is a promising approach for improving the physiological performance of industrial microbes for efficient bioprocesses. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, as petrochemical sources of isoprene increase in price and become more scarce, bioproduction routes through microbial processes are becoming more attractive.

40|$|Macroscopic {{modelling}} of bioprocesses {{requires the}} determination of a biological reaction scheme and a kinetic model. The a priori selection of an appropriate kinetic model structure is usually made difficult {{by the lack of}} detailed bioprocess knowledge and the profusion of apparently similar biological kinetic laws. Moreover, parameter identification is made arduous and time-consuming by the strong non-linearities involved in kinetic laws. In most cases, these kinetic structures are non-linearizable and no first parameter estimation can be deduced easily. In order to avoid such identification problems, Bogaerts et al. [Bogaerts, Ph. Castillo, J. Hanus, R. 1999. A general mathematical modelling technique for <b>bioprocesses</b> in <b>engineering</b> applications. Syst. Anal. Model. Simul. 35, 87 - 113] have developed a general linearizable kinetic structure which allows the representation of activation and/or inhibition effects of each component in the culture. This paper further generalizes this structure in order to improve the way saturation effects are taken into account, and in turn, improve the biological interpretation of the model parameters. The main advantage of the proposed structure lies in an associated systematic estimation procedure. The usefulness of the proposed model is tested with simulated as well as with experimental data.
