5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood.

Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} the battle saw four {{divisions}} (9th Australian, 51st Highland, 2nd New Zealand and 1st South African) in {{the assault on the}} north of the Axis positions. RWY was in support of the 5th New Zealand Brigade (Brigadier Howard Kippenberger); the aim was for infantry to secure the Miteiriya Ridge during darkness, with the armour to pass beyond them at first light to establish a screen. By now, the regiment was equipped with a mix of M4 Sherman, Crusader and Grant (M3 Lee) tanks. On the morning of 24 October 1942, A and C squadrons were ahead of the infantry on the western slopes of the ridge. B squadron had been delayed in the devil's gardens minefields and had lost numerous tanks. Throughout that day, A and C Squadrons engaged German panzers on the plain below, and were in turn hit by anti-tank fire. Initially, the heavier Sherman tanks were not vulnerable to this, but, when the German 88mm anti-tank guns joined in, they took severe casualties. By midday, the two squadrons were reduced to one Sherman and three Grants and the commanding officer had been badly wounded and evacuated. The 10th Armoured Division, under the command of Major-General Alexander H. Gatehouse, was at this stage supposed to pass through and onwards to start the break-out, <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> to be reluctant to do so.|$|E

25|$|Recognition {{memory is}} {{sometimes}} {{divided into two}} functions by neuroscientists: familiarity and recollection. A strong sense of familiarity can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of deja vu. The temporal lobe, in particular the perirhinal cortex, responds differently to stimuli which feel novel than to things which feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected {{with the sense of}} familiarity in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar. Specifically, stimulation at 30–40Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one; but it did not lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty. Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones — they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, but the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.|$|E

While Cibernético recovered, Chessman and Charly Manson kept wrestling La Legión but without as much success as they had {{initially}} due {{to a series of}} unfortunate incidents where Chessman would cause the team to lose by accident. In the spring of 2008 Charly Manson suffered a serious injury and was forced to take some time off just as Cibernético made his return to the ring and won the AAA Mega title. At Triplemania XVI, Chessman teamed up with La Parka and Silver King in a losing effort to the La Legión team of Bobby Lashley, Electroshock and Kenzo Suzuki. when Vampiro was brought in to take Manson's place rumors of a break-up of Los Hell Brothers began circulating. the rumors seemed to be reinforced when Chessman won an elimination match to earn a shot at the AAA Mega title. At first Cibernético congratulated his partner <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> reluctant to actually set a date for Chessman's title match. The tension came to a head in September when Cibernético came to the ring to congratulate Chessman on a recent win, Manson came to the ring to try and mediate between the two but when he could not pick sides the Hell Brothers officially disbanded.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{theories}} {{about the origins of}} the Piraeus Athena. Because the room the statue was found in was very close to the main harbor, many scholars believe that the statue had been stored in a harbor’s stoa and were just about to be shipped. Additionally, the Piraeus Athena and other statues were not in random order <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> to be packed. A coin found near the statues had a date equivalent to 87/86 BC on it, along with a picture of King Mithridates VI. Because it is known that Piraeus was captured by Sulla in 86 BC, many have further speculated two theories. One theory is that the statues were going to be shipped in order to save them from the Roman attack. The second theory is that the statues were being shipped by the Romans to Italy as part of their spoils. It is thought that the statue may have originally come from the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira in Piraeus. This is because the peplos in the statue is similar to the drapery of the peplos in the statue of Eirene by Cephisodotus the Elder, who was also known to have made a statue of Athena that resided in the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira. Other scholars believe that the statue may have come from Delos, since three of the statues found with the Piraeus Athena were of Artemis, and Delos was considered the birthplace of Artemis. Additionally, the Romans had captured Delos in 88 BC and therefore the statues could {{have been part of the}} scared funds Mithradates’ general had sent to Delos. Due to the dating, it has been estimated that the Piraeus Athena probably dates back to 360-340 BCE.|$|E
