For example, the 1961 Pickup kit box illustrated both the Ford and the Chevy, but the kit inside the box was identified by a label affixed to the outside. In the early 1960s AMT's 3-in-1 Trophy kit instructions usually came with short biographies of popular customizers of the day such as Bill Cushenberry, Dean Jeffries, Alex Kraus, Gene Winfield, the Alexander Brothers and of course George Barris, {{most of whom were}} employed by AMT. Gene Winfield even closed his California shop to work with AMT (Cawthon 2002). Also, instruction sheets for some kits had a section with customizing hints by George Barris exclusively. An extreme example was the 1957 Ford Thunderbird kit. The instructions included five pages devoted to “stylizing”, a practice of adding parts by using <b>body</b> <b>putty</b> and sanding which went beyond ordinary customizing. Included in the '57 T-Bird kit were additional street rod, drag and Bonneville styling ideas all suggested by George Barris.|$|E

Fiberglass mats and resins for marine vehicle repair complemented the original market in automotive maintenance. There are Bondo sealants {{for use on}} roads. In addition to its consumable products, 3M has a line of Bondo tools intended {{to be used with}} the putties and fillers.|$|R
50|$|To achieve reduced drag in the {{transonic}} phase, Whitcomb {{realized that}} the wing's pressure distribution must be modified to delay and weaken the shock wave created on the upper surface where the high-velocity flow decelerated to subsonic. Using intuition rather than mathematics, he built a 2 ft chord wing section and tested it repeatedly in the Langley high-speed wind tunnel, adding (with auto <b>body</b> <b>putty)</b> or removing (with a file and sandpaper) material until the desired flows were achieved.|$|E

5000|$|.....as {{the members}} {{began to get}} tired of medieval games, and I wasn't, I decided to add fantasy {{elements}} to the mix, such as a dragon that had a fire-breath weapon, a hero that was worth four normal warriors, a wizard who could cast fireballs, had the range and hit diameter of a large catapult, and lightning bolts, had the range and hit area of a cannon, and so forth. I converted a plastic stegosaurus into a pretty fair dragon, as there were no models of them around in those days. A 70 mm Elastolin Viking figure, with doll's hair glued to its head, and a club made from a kitchen match and auto <b>body</b> <b>putty,</b> and painted in shades of blue for skin color made a fearsome giant figure. I haunted the dime stores looking for potential additions and eventually found figures to represent ogres, elementals, etc. The players loved the new game, and soon we had twenty or more players showing up for every session.|$|E
40|$|Impressions are {{important}} sources of cross contamination between patients and dental laboratories. As {{a part of}} infection control impressions contaminated with variety of micro-organisms via blood and oral secretions should be cleaned and disinfected or sterilized before being handled in dental laboratory. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of autoclaving on dimensional stability of elastomeric impression material (polyvinyl siloxane—Affinis). In this in vitro study standardized stainless steel die as per ADA specification number 19 was fabricated. Polyvinyl siloxane (Affinis) light <b>body</b> and <b>putty</b> viscosity elastomeric impression materials were used. A total of 40 impressions of the stainless steel die were made and numeric coding system was used to identify the samples. Measurements were made using a measuring microscope. Distance between the cross lines CD and C′D′ reproduced in the impression were measured before autoclaving, immediately after autoclaving and 24  hours after autoclaving and dimensional change was calculated. The data obtained was subjected to statistical analysis. The mean difference in dimensional change between the three groups was not statistically significant (P >  0. 05). However the results revealed that there was higher mean dimensional change immediately after autoclaving when compared to the other 2 time intervals. It is desirable to delay the casting of an autoclavable elastomeric impression material by about 24  hours. Though disinfection of impression is routinely followed autoclaving of impression is an effective method of sterilization...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{suggest a}} custom bar {{supported}} overdenture treatment modality for prosthodontic management {{of patients with}} severe gag reflex. Background: Some patients have a severe gag reflex and cannot tolerate conventional maxillary complete dentures with maximum palatal coverage and extensions of all borders. The condition further gets complicated in patients suffering from respiratory problems along with severe gag reflex. Severe gagging acts {{as a barrier to}} treat such patients with accepted clinical procedures and prevent patients from wearing the prosthesis. By saving some of the remaining natural teeth and fabricating, a horse shoe shape palateless simple tooth or bar supported overdenture can be successfully used for treating such patients. Materials and Methods: The remaining maxillary right and left canines were prepared with the tapered round end diamond bur to receive copings of custom bar after intentional root canal treatment of same teeth. Impression was made with light <b>body</b> and <b>putty</b> of the polyvinyl siloxane elastomer with double step putty wash technique. Impression was poured with die stone. Wax pattern of copings with bar was fabricated with inlay wax which was invested and casted. After retrieving the bar, it was finished and its fit was evaluated. The coping-bar assembly was finally cemented with the glass ionomer cement. Palateless overdenture was fabricated by conventional technique used for the fabrication of complete denture. Conclusion: Palateless custom bar supported overdenture procedure can be successfully used for the management of patients with severe gag reflex with improved denture retention, stability, chewing efficiency and comfort of the patient...|$|R
50|$|Unlike promotional models, {{which had}} sealed hoods, no engine detail, and {{suspension}} detail molded {{right into the}} chassis, kits usually had opening hoods, and many parts to construct engines, interiors, and suspensions. Earlier kits had less chassis detail, and featured promo-like interiors, metal axles, whitewall tires, and metal screws to attach body to chassis. Later kits often had more detail, but metal parts such as axles, chassis screws, and hood clips, were deleted or made in plastic. Eventually, miniature whitewall tires, once a regular feature of kits, fell out of style and were eschewed for plain blackwalls.Some of the early boxes were designed to house more than one model like the 1961 Pickup kit that illustrated both Ford and Chevy on the lid, but affixed a label to distinguish which model was found inside. AMT's 3 in 1 'Trophy' kit instructions in the early 1960s usually came with mini-biographies of popular customizers of the day such as Bill Cushenberry, Dean Jeffries, Alex Kraus, Gene Winfield, the Alexander Brothers, and, of course, George Barris, {{most of whom were}} employed by AMT. Gene Winfield even closed his California shop to work with AMT (Cawthon 2002). Further, on the sheets there was often a separate section on 'customizing hints' by George Barris exclusively. An extreme example was the 1957 Ford Thunderbird kit. Instructions gave 5 whole pages to 'stylizing', a practice of adding parts using <b>body</b> <b>putty</b> and sanding which went beyond mere 'customizing'. These were all tips besides the normal assembly instructions. Included in the '57 'Bird kit were additional 'street rod', 'drag bird', and 'Bonneville' styles all suggested by George Barris.|$|E
