40|$|Diesel engine {{lubricant}} contamination is a {{major cause}} <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> component wear, leading to loss <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> performance and life. In addition, contamination accelerates <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> the <b>engine</b> lube oil, reducing its useful service life. Contaminant particles the size of or larger than the dynamic lubricant oil films separating moving component surfaces cause a major portion <b>of</b> diesel <b>engine</b> wear. The size of these harmful particles is 20 microns and smaller. This paper reviews the nature <b>of</b> diesel <b>engine</b> lubricant contamination, the primary modes of lubrication, and the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>engine</b> wear. The relationship between contamination and wear <b>of</b> several major <b>engine</b> components is then discussed. In addition, the highlights <b>of</b> important diesel <b>engine</b> contamination studies are reported. The diesel engine is receiving increasing attention as a power plant because of its fuel efficiency and life advantages.

40|$|Crack {{initiation}} and propagation in the bladed disks of aero-engines {{caused by}} high-cycle fatigue under cyclic loads {{could result in}} the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> the <b>engines</b> if not detected at an early stage. Although a number of fault detection methods {{have been reported in the}} literature, it still remains very challenging to develop a reliable online technique to accurately diagnose defects in bladed disks. One of the main challenges is to characterize signals contaminated by noises. These noises caused by very dynamic engine operation environment. This work presents a new technique for engine bladed disk crack detection, which utilizes advanced analysis of clearance and time-of-arrival signals acquired from blade tip sensors. This technique involves two stages of signal processing: 1) signal pre-processing for noise elimination from predetermined causes; and 2) signal post-processing for characterizing crack initiation and location. Experimental results from the spin rig test were used to validate technique predictions...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{diesel engines}} {{are subject to}} both {{stresses}} and vibration due to {{the environment in which}} they operate, thereby impeding their performance. The essence of this project is to enunciate a proactive solution to any catastrophic breakdown a marine diesel engine may suffer as a result of environmental factors and vibration. In this paper therefore a method to optimize the performance of the marine diesel engine towards effective condition monitoring is carried out. A four stroke caterpillar 3516 B series marine diesel engine with 16 -VTS marine diesel engine was used to actualize the work. The theoretical evaluation and analysis were used to calculate the values of pressure, volume and temperature under different speeds and power output at the beginning of ignition. These evaluation and analyses helped to find the different power outputs <b>of</b> the <b>engine</b> at different speeds. A computer program code named MDEPEA written in Visual-Basic programming language was developed. The results obtained show that the value of 42. 952 KW to 1647. 84 KW of power output and 239. 01 kN/m 2 to 1791. 13 kN/m 2 for mean effective pressure should be maintained to avoid a <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> the <b>engine.</b> _________________________________________________________________________________________...|$|R
40|$|Today diesel {{engine-driven}} standby generators for {{backup power}} supply have been adopted for residential, commercial, and industrial use [...] especially in some developing countries where power from the utility company is highly erratic. Although many of these generators function well in operation, certain engine conditions, such as low oil pressure, high oil and water temperature, abnormally high speed, etc., could lead to malfunction, failure, or complete <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> the <b>engine.</b> Therefore, {{the focus of this}} work is to present the implementation of a simple, but effective electronic protection unit (EPU) capable of mitigating the adverse effect which may arise {{as a result of these}} conditions. It is composed of two major sub-circuits-the main protective sub-circuit and the timing sub-circuit-realized using a combination of passive and active components. Unlike the common electrical relay-based protection system, this unit has an additional advantage of being able to keep the faultindicating system of the generator working even after engine shutdown, thereby facilitating fault tracking. The unit has been tested on a diesel engine-driven generator and found to function satisfactorily. The test results are shown...|$|R
50|$|On 11 February, G-3 {{proceeded}} to New London, Connecticut, for initial shakedown operations. Aside from {{a brief period}} alongside submarine tender Tonopah (ex-Nevada) to repair damaged screws in March, she spent the next five months conducting trial runs, dive tests and training operations out of New London. Following another yard period at Bridgeport in mid-July to replace defective lube pumps, the boat moved to New York City on 30 August for final acceptance trials. Unfortunately, the <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> G-3s port <b>engine</b> disrupted her standardization trials in late September, prompting her move into the Navy Yard for repairs on 3 October. Difficulties in working in tight engine room spaces necessitated removing the port engine for repair and the boat remained immobile through the following spring. She finally put to sea on 1 June 1917 and returned to New London that same day.|$|R
40|$|Image {{analysis}} of wear particles is a suitable support tool for detail analysis <b>of</b> <b>engine,</b> gear, hydraulic and industrial oils. It allows {{to obtain information}} not only of basic parameters of abrasion particles but also data {{that would be very}} difficult to obtain using classical ways of evaluation. Based on the {{analysis of}} morphological or image characteristics of particles, the progress of wearing the machine parts out can be followed and, as a result, possible <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> the <b>engine</b> can be prevented or the optimum period for changing the oil can be determined. The aim of this paper is to explore the possibilities of using the image analysis combined with the method of analytical ferrography and suggest a tool for automated particle classification. Current methods of wear particle analysis are derived from the evaluation that does not offer an exact idea of processes that take place between the friction surfaces in the engine system. The work is based upon the method of analytical ferrography which allows to evaluate the state of the machine. The benefit of use of classifiers defined in this wirk is the possibility of automated evaluation of analytical ferrography outputs; the use of them eliminates the crucial disadvantage of ferrographical analysis which is its dependence on the subjective evaluation done by the expert who performs the analysis. Classifiers are defined as a result of using the methods of machine learning. Based on an extensive database of particles that was created in the first part of the work, the classifiers were trained – as a result, they make the evaluation of ferrographically separated abrasion particles from oils taken from lubricated systems possible. In the next stage, experiments were carried out and optimu...|$|R

The first wave of {{infantry}} crossed at 02.00 aboard Buffalo tracked landing vehicles manned by 11th Royal Tank Regiment of 79th Armoured Division. Storm boats manned by the Kent RE field companies were held back until it was known that the Buffalo crossings had been successful. Word to start crossing with 6th Battalion King's Own Scottish Borderers was received at 02.45 and from then on the storm boats kept up a continuous ferrying operation, despite <b>breakdowns</b> <b>of</b> the unreliable <b>engines.</b> The 6th KOSB crossed without a casualty. At 03.30, rafting equipment was moved down to the river bank on sledges and by 06.30 the Kent RE had two of these in operation (two others were destroyed by shellfire before they could be completed and had to be replaced later from reserves). These rafts took over surfacing material for the exits on the far bank, which was laid under RE supervision by German prisoners. The rafts worked continuously {{for two and a half}} days, transporting across 611 vehicles among other loads. The RE History records that the rafting troops received an unsolicited testimonial for their watermanship from a captured German officer who was being ferried back.|$|R

40|$|Following the {{victories}} of François Hollande in {{the presidential}} election and the Socialist Party in the parliamentary election, the existing model of relations between Germany and France as symbolised by the Merkel-Sarkozy duo is undergoing a transformation. Along with the defeat for Sarkozy, who had fostered close cooperation with the German Chancellor, we are witnessing a change in the German-French modus operandi, which was based on making confidential agreements concerning the anti-crisis measures in the eurozone and then presenting ready-made solutions to other EU members (as {{in the case of the}} successive versions of the document currently known as the fiscal pact). However, a conflict in bilateral relations, which would mean a total <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> the Franco-German <b>engine,</b> is rather unlikely. In fact, François Hollande’s proposals have diminished the appearance of the two states’ exceptional compatibility, and have restored the specific relationship affected by the natural rivalry between two states, who because of their economies’ different orientation have divergent interests. Nevertheless, both sides are destined to reach a compromise, as neither can attain its goals in the face of the other’s opposition. In the long term, Hollande is likely to maintain a common front with Germany in fighting the crisis, while at the same time trying (with his allies from the south of the EU) to limit Berlin’s political and economic superiority...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation, which at present is unknown. Results A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce <b>breakdown</b> <b>of</b> accommodation when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold.
