50|$|In 1992, Oriole Park at Camden Yards {{opened in}} Baltimore. Going in a {{different}} direction from the multi-purpose and modern <b>ballparks,</b> Camden Yards harkened back to the old jewel box parks. This began the building of a series of parks known as the retro-classic <b>ballparks,</b> or, simply, retro <b>ballparks.</b>|$|R

5|$|The <b>ballpark</b> {{became the}} 11th MLB {{facility}} to have LED field lights installed, which was done {{prior to the}} start of the 2017 season. Wi-Fi was also installed throughout the <b>ballpark</b> {{prior to the start}} of the 2017 season.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ballpark</b> {{opened for}} its first game on April 3, 2003, a RoughRiders loss to the Tulsa Drillers. The RoughRiders earned their first victory in the <b>ballpark</b> the next day, with the RoughRiders' Kurt Airoso hitting the park's first home run.|$|E
5000|$|As fans {{became more}} affluent, and {{especially}} {{as they moved}} to the suburbs and bought cars, the lack of parking became an important issue. Some <b>ballparks</b> remedied this problem {{through the construction of}} parking garages in the vicinity, or building new <b>ballparks</b> with ample parking. Others built <b>ballparks</b> in the suburbs, typically with large parking areas. The ballpark/stadium thus became an [...] "island" [...] in an [...] "ocean" [...] of parking space.|$|R

5|$|Dr Pepper/Seven Up <b>Ballpark</b> {{was renamed}} Dr Pepper <b>Ballpark</b> on March 31, 2006. On that date, the RoughRiders' Major League affiliate, the Texas Rangers, {{defeated}} the Florida Marlins {{in an exhibition}} game played at Dr Pepper <b>Ballpark.</b> The sold-out game was the ballpark's first major-league game of any kind. Overall attendance {{ranked in the top}} 10 in all classes of minor league baseball during the RoughRiders' first nine seasons. The stadium ranked first in all of Class AA for attendance from 2006-2011. Average attendance at RoughRiders games is 8,000. On average, there are 30 sell-out games per season.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} in 2003, the Dr Pepper <b>Ballpark</b> received the Texas Construction award for Best Architectural Design for 2003 {{and the surrounding}} sports complex received the Best Sports and Entertainment award for 2003. It was named the best new <b>ballpark</b> in the country by BaseballParks.com. MinorLeagueNews.com has also named the park No. 2 on its top ten minor league ballparks for 2004 and No. 7 for 2005.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{construction}} of newer, relatively luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer Stadium had fallen below the standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball in 1990. At the time, team president Larry Schmittou tried to convince the city to approve a new <b>ballpark,</b> but was unsuccessful. Throughout the 2000s, the team continued in its attempts to gather approval and financing for a new <b>ballpark</b> to replace Greer. At one point, a new stadium, First Tennessee Field, was planned for construction {{on the west bank}} of the Cumberland River in downtown. Disagreements over who would pay for the <b>ballpark</b> repeatedly pushed back opening day at the stadium, and eventually resulted in the cancellation of the project altogether. In the meantime, numerous upgrades and repairs, including over $2.5million worth of improvements from 2008 to 2009, were made to Greer in order to preserve its functionality until a new stadium could be built. A deal for such a new <b>ballpark</b> was achieved in late 2013. The Sounds played their final game at Greer on August 27, 2014.|$|E
5000|$|Some <b>ballparks</b> {{have banned}} pepper {{games because of}} the danger of balls landing in the stands and {{injuring}} spectators or because its concentrated play damages the grass on the field. Many <b>ballparks</b> display [...] "NO PEPPER" [...] warnings behind or near home plate.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ballparks</b> {{occupied}} by professional baseball teams have often featured high fences {{to hide the}} field from external viewers, particularly behind open areas of the outfield where bleacher seating is low-lying or non-existent. The wall might also {{reduce the number of}} [...] "cheap" [...] home runs due to the barrier's relatively close distance to home plate. Fenway's wall serves both purposes. Past <b>ballparks</b> of Fenway's era or even later which featured high fences in-play included Baker Bowl, Washington Park, Ebbets Field, League Park, Griffith Stadium, Shibe Park, and more recently, Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Fenway is the last of the exceptionally high-walled major league <b>ballparks.</b> Relatively high walls in modern <b>ballparks</b> have been constructed for their novelty rather than by necessity, as Fenway's wall had been.|$|R

5|$|In 2001, a {{few hundred}} feet of the easternmost portion of the North Shore Branch were reopened west to the Richmond County Bank <b>Ballpark</b> station to provide {{passenger}} service to the new Richmond County Bank <b>Ballpark,</b> home of the Staten Island Yankees minor-league baseball team. This service was discontinued in 2010, but the tracks and station remain in place.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office {{began working}} toward a new stadium, with the city {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first <b>ballpark</b> (Sulphur Dell), and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the <b>ballpark</b> into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown <b>ballpark</b> at Sulphur Dell. Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new <b>ballpark</b> opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 Insight Bowl {{kicked off}} at 8:30p.m. EST on December 26, 2003 at Bank One <b>Ballpark</b> in Phoenix, Arizona. Though {{normally}} a baseball stadium, Bank One <b>Ballpark</b> hosted the Insight Bowl from 2000 to 2005 with seating reconfigured {{from the standard}} used during baseball games. 42,364people attended the game, which was just 511 short of a sellout and was the largest crowd to attend an Insight Bowl game since the game moved to Bank One <b>Ballpark</b> in 2000. In exchange for participating in the game, each team received $750,000. On December 24, {{two days before the}} game, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by three points.|$|E
5|$|The <b>ballpark</b> {{was built}} to {{withstand}} a 100-year flood because it is located on a flood plain. Before its redevelopment, the area, including the original Sulphur Dell <b>ballpark,</b> was prone to regular flooding from the nearby Cumberland River and it flooded during the 2010 Tennessee floods. To prevent water damage, the grandstand has an acrylic floor covering and the field-level suites are equipped with detachable floor boards, food-service tables mounted on casters, and raised floor outlets and electrical switches.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1999, the St. Louis Cardinals began {{pushing for the}} {{construction}} of a new Busch Stadium as part of a broader trend in Major League Baseball toward stadium building. In early 2002, plans for a new park were settled among state and local leaders and Cardinals owners. According to an agreement in which the state and city would issue bonds for construction, the Cardinals agreed to build a multipurpose development known as St. Louis <b>Ballpark</b> Village on part of the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. The new stadium opened in 2006, and groundbreaking for <b>Ballpark</b> Village took place in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|Before {{heading out}} to a {{baseball}} game at a nearby <b>ballpark,</b> sports fan Mr. Brown drinks several highball cocktails. He arrives at the <b>ballpark</b> to watch the game, but has become so inebriated that the game appears to him in reverse, with the players running the bases backwards and the baseball flying back into the pitcher's hand. After the game is over, Mr. Brown is escorted home {{by one of his}} friends. When they arrive at Brown's house, they encounter his wife who becomes furious with the friend and proceeds to physically assault him, believing he is responsible for her husband's severe intoxication.|$|E
