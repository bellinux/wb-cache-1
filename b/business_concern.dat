One {{way is to}} rely on extrinsic motivation, such as a payment, a fee waiver, or a request for friends to sign up. A more natural strategy {{is to build a}} system that has enough value without network effects, at least to early adopters. Then, as the number of users increases, the system becomes even more valuable and is able to attract a wider user base.|$|E
25|$|While the Tasmanian Government {{supported}} the project, believing the Direct Factory Outlet would drive retail trade growth, the Hobart City Council {{and a large}} amount of retail shop owners in the Hobart Central Business District expressed fears of losing <b>business.</b> <b>Concern</b> was also expressed about the big box being built on commonwealth land and therefore escaping the state planning laws. In 2008, plans for the project were submitted to the Federal Government for assessment. Federal Transport Minister Warren Truss gave approval on condition the outlet centre was cut by almost half to , prompting Austexx {{to walk away from the}} proposal. In February 2008, Austexx' chief executive Geoff Porz confirmed the Direct Factory Outlet and Homemaker Hub project was back on, however Austexx went into receivership in 2010, and as of 2014 the site remains undeveloped.|$|E
2500|$|The first Cardiacs release {{featuring}} the [...] "classic" [...] line-up was their third album, The Seaside (although Cawthra featured throughout on drums, keyboards and voice; and Simmonds and Johnson also appeared on several tracks). The album {{was released on}} Cardiacs own record label, Alphabet (which later became Alphabet <b>Business</b> <b>Concern).</b> The bizarre and sinister [...] "Alphabet Business Concern" [...] mythology now began to become {{a significant part of}} Cardiacs' artistic presentation, and the band members would promote and add to it at every opportunity. The band evolved an elaborate and theatrical stage show, involving [...] "bandsmen's uniforms, make-up, Sarah's music stand, (and) Tim's mile-wide grin". The finale included sprayed champagne, confetti cannons, appearances by The Consultant and Miss Swift (on behalf of the Alphabet <b>Business</b> <b>Concern)</b> and a mock-heroic/distressed exit for Tim Smith.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2017, the Alphabet <b>Business</b> <b>Concern</b> {{released}} the long-awaited [...] "Some Fairytales from the Rotten Shed" [...] DVD {{to the public}} [...] It features Cardiacs rehearsing early songs (mixed with surrealist comedy similar to the [...] "Mare's Nest" [...] DVD) in preparation of [...] "The Special Garage Concerts"-era live shows. Prior to this, only four clips had been {{available to the public}} via the [...] "abcglobus" [...] YouTube channel , with a nearly-complete version of the DVD having been screened at the 2013 Alphabet Business Convention.

2500|$|Cardiacs {{are also}} renowned for their startling {{performance}} style, {{which has been}} historically integrated (via video work, publicity, interviews and onstage presentation) with a vague and oppressive band mythology. The latter involves Cardiacs' record label and supposed management company, the Alphabet <b>Business</b> <b>Concern</b> - a repressive, controlling organisation (with a marked Edwardian character) which supervises (and restricts) Cardiacs' recording work and live appearances (as well as communicating band news and statements to the band's mailing list in florid and archaic corporatese). Several early 1980s video releases by Cardiacs – in particular The Consultant's Flower Garden and the clip for To Go Off and Things – provided video [...] "evidence" [...] that Alphabet ran Cardiacs' internal affairs {{in the manner of}} an Edwardian children's home (complete with behavioural problems and bullying).|$|E
2500|$|The Alphabet <b>Business</b> <b>Concern</b> shares some {{similarities}} with [...] the [...] "Cryptic Corporation" [...] supposedly {{responsible for}} managing The Residents. As with the Cryptic Corporation, {{there is a}} strong probability that the Alphabet mythology is entirely fictional and that the band (often hailed as archetypal independent musicians) control all aspects of their work themselves. Alphabet's original representatives - or representative characters - were Cardiac's [...] "sordid, waxy" [...] manager The Consultant (real name James Stevens) and his assistant and band advisor [...] "Miss Swift", both of whom made onstage appearances with Cardiacs during the 1980s. In the late 1980s both The Consultant and Miss Swift left the Cardiacs organisation and were replaced by Mark Walmsley, who played a less public role (but did appear for inserts in the Maresnest concert video, expressing contempt for his charges and their music).|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{departure}} of Hayes, Cardiacs had recorded an album called Heaven Born and Ever Bright (which featured several of Hayes' guitar and vocal parts, plus a track he had co-written called [...] "Goodbye Grace"). This was released as the new Cardiacs album {{in the summer of}} 1992, the first fruit of a new distribution deal with Rough Trade Records. However, disaster struck when Rough Trade ceased trading shortly after the release of the album. This ensured that Heaven Born and Ever Bright could neither be stocked nor ordered by record shops, with the result that Cardiacs were left thousands of pounds in debt and unable to recoup their recording expenses. (The album was eventually reissued on a revived Alphabet <b>Business</b> <b>Concern</b> in 1995 – it featured a picture of Jon Poole on the cover, although he had not actually played on the album when it was recorded.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 April 1985, {{an attempt}} was made to film Cardiacs at a live concert at the Surbiton Assembly Rooms. The band had been {{approached}} by film-maker Mark Francombe (later a member of Cranes) and his colleague Nick Elborough, both of whom were at that time students at Portsmouth College of Art and Design. Francombe and Elborough offered to film the band for free as part of their coursework project. However, when the band viewed the resultant footage, they decided against releasing it. Instead, they retained Francombe and Elborough for a new video project which would become Seaside Treats, named after the 12" [...] single that was released at the same time. As well as containing three music videos, Seaside Treats [...] contained a ten-minute film named The Consultant’s Flower Garden. The latter featured Cardiacs (and various people connected with them) in bizarre, comedic situations which continued to propagate the absurdist Alphabet <b>Business</b> <b>Concern</b> mythology which surrounded the band.|$|E
2500|$|After the SEC and PCAOB issued their guidance, the SEC {{required}} smaller {{public companies}} (non-accelerated filers) with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2007 to document a Management Assessment of their Internal Controls over Financial Reporting (ICFR). [...] Outside auditors of non-accelerated filers however opine or test internal controls under PCAOB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) Auditing Standards for years ending after December 15, 2008. [...] Another extension was {{granted by the}} SEC for the outside auditor assessment until years ending after December 15, 2009. [...] The reason for the timing disparity was to address the House Committee on Small <b>Business</b> <b>concern</b> {{that the cost of}} complying with Section 404 of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 was still unknown and could therefore be disproportionately high for smaller publicly held companies. On October 2, 2009, the SEC granted another extension for the outside auditor assessment until fiscal years ending after June 15, 2010. The SEC stated in their release that the extension was granted so that the SEC's Office of Economic Analysis could complete a study of whether additional guidance provided to company managers and auditors in 2007 was effective in reducing the costs of compliance. They also stated {{that there will be no}} further extensions in the future.|$|E

Among other updates, an amendment to the 'History' section of the site humorously addressed Tim Smith's accident, subsequent incapacitation and the band's hiatus: [...] And so for five years, history ceased to be created by Cardiacs. Unless we consider the undignified shenanigans of Tim Smith who ‘fell’ into a pool filled with shit and is still crawling and scratching his way out of it. The ALPHABET <b>BUSINESS</b> <b>CONCERN</b> wishes it to be known that, whilst maintaining complete control of his artistic output, they disassociate themselves ENTIRELY with his recent illness and, in fact, fail to recognise it as an excuse for not fulfilling his duties.

I have been bowled over and knocked back by the outpourings of love, posted on here. Every one of them. You have no idea what this means. Really though.
