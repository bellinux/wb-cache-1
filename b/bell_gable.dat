25|$|The primary facade is {{particularly}} exemplary of {{the combination of}} North-American and Hispanic influences. This facade consists of a vertical rectangular frontispiece, surmounted by a <b>bell</b> <b>gable</b> with a bell in each of its two slender Roman arches, and a cross at the ridge, resulting in a composition {{similar to that of}} many of the colonial churches found on the island. Nonetheless, the frontispiece is flanked by buttresses and is punctured by a circular window at a second-floor height, reminiscent of the neo-gothic church architecture common throughout the United States.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2014, the {{interior}} plaster {{on the west}} wall has been replaced several times due to dampness possibly caused by inadequate flashing between the <b>bell</b> <b>gable</b> and roof tiles, together {{with the fact that}} the bell rope must pass through a hole in the roof. This means that any original stencils beneath the later paint on the west wall are now gone.|$|E

2500|$|The {{complex is}} {{surrounded}} by a wall with pointed merlons which separates it from the main plaza of the city. The atrium is very large, with most of the space located in front of the two chapels. There are two portals on the west atrium wall, one that leads into the main atrium space and chapels, probably used for the indigenous and common people in the very early colonial period and the other {{directly in front of the}} main church. In three corners of the atrium, there are chapels, called [...] "capillas posas", with pinnacle roofs and simple arches which are closed off by railings. The atrium cross was sculpted in 1668 and is identical to that in the atrium of the Nuestra Señora de los Remedios sanctuary. The façade of the main church is smooth and its corners are reinforced with diagonal buttresses. This façade has been altered over time with the additions of a <b>bell</b> <b>gable</b> and a Baroque tower. The tower contains arched windows, columns and a small dome topped by an iron cross. The main portal is sculpted in sandstone in Renaissance style. The main doors are of wood and contain metal studs with different designs. The north portal has richer ornamentation.|$|E

50|$|The missions' {{style of}} {{necessity}} and security evolved around an enclosed courtyard, using massive adobe walls with broad unadorned plaster surfaces, limited fenestration and door piercing, low-pitched roofs with projecting wide eaves and non-flammable clay roof tiles, and thick arches springing from piers. Exterior walls were coated with white plaster (stucco), which with wide side eaves shielded the adobe brick walls from rain. Other features included long exterior arcades, an enfilade of interior rooms and halls, semi-independent <b>bell</b> <b>gables,</b> and at more prosperous missions curved 'Baroque' gables on the principal facade with towers.|$|R
50|$|After {{the arrival}} of Augustinian monks shortly after the Spanish Conquest of Mexico, this church and its now former monastery were built by Fray Andrés de la Mata de Barrios in 1550. The church is {{dedicated}} to the Archangel Michael and was built using Indian labor pressed into service by the monks. This church is typical of the fortress-style churches built by the Augustinians in the 16th century. The facade is Plateresque style with paired columns and with a window in the choir area.

50|$|The town of Ixmiquilpan is {{the center}} of the Mezquital Valley, {{especially}} its Otomi population. The center of this town is its parish church, named after the Archangel Michael. It is noted for its large series of murals done in the 16th century by native artists depicting Eagle and Jaguar warriors in battle, along with other pre-Hispanic imagery. This parish church is typical of the fortress-style churches built by the Augustinians in the 16th century. The facade is Plateresque style with paired columns and with a window in the choir area. The bell tower is annexed and joined with the facade. It has a crown and <b>bell</b> <b>gables.</b> Imagery that is repeated here is that of holy war with Eagle and Jaguar warriors, as well as images associated with the sun and moon gods. The Jaguar and Eagle warriors were some of the armies that the Spanish fought during the Conquest; they wore resplendent apparel. Few explicit pictorial references to these warriors were permitted afterwards. The murals at Ixmiquilpan are an exception. The murals here appear in a series of polychrome frescos, which have structure in a large and coherent way. The parish church was declared a national monument in 1933.|$|R
50|$|A gable is an {{architectural}} element {{that is usually}} built on the façade and used, instead of a tower, to house the bells. The bell-gable (referred to as espadaña in the Iberian peninsula) was built as a vertical continuation of {{the wall and the}} spans were opened to receive the <b>bells.</b> The <b>gable</b> was easier and cheaper to build. In Spanish Romanesque they were very numerous especially in smaller rural Romanesque churches. They were made of a single span or several terraced storeys. They usually had pointed or pinion tops.|$|R

50|$|The cathedral's eclectic facade is a {{combination}} of Spanish mission and Neoclassical styles. Spanish mission features include curving <b>bell</b> <b>gables,</b> limited fenestration, clay roof tiles, a semicircular tympanum, prominent statuary niche, and comparatively unadorned walls. Neoclassical details surround the entry door; an entablature embellished with triglyphs is topped with a broken pediment above and supported by pairs of Doric columns below.In 1887, just as fire had plagued the cathedral in the past, the structure burned once again. The damage was not total, however, and the exterior shell of the building was still salvageable because the coquina and cement used to build the masonry walls were fireproof. Reconstruction was started through donations from Henry Flagler and funds from the congregation. At this time the congregation hired New York architect James Renwick, Jr. to restore the burned cathedral. Upon restoration, many improvements were made; to start the church was enlarged, particularly the addition of a transept to give the church a more European style. Also, as the truss system before was somewhat plain, Renwick devised a roof system that still relied on timber, but decided to decorate the timbers and leave an exposed ceiling, which today makes for a beautiful view upon entering the church seeing the decorated and varnished chords in the upper portion of the structure.|$|R

500|$|In {{the general}} election, Carroll faced Republican Robert E. Gable, a coal company owner. The main {{issue of the}} {{campaign}} was the imposition of desegregation busing on the city of Louisville. Both candidates opposed the busing, but Gable did so more vehemently and criticized the sitting governor for not [...] "doing something about it". In a televised debate with Carroll, Gable insisted on using {{what he called a}} [...] "truth bell". <b>Gable</b> rang the <b>bell</b> every time that he perceived that Carroll was not telling the truth. Eventually, the moderator of the debate, newspaper publisher Al Smith, ordered Gable to put the <b>bell</b> away, and <b>Gable's</b> credibility suffered in the eyes of voters. Carroll won the general election by a vote of 470,159 to 277,998, representing a record margin of victory in the Kentucky governor's race. He carried every congressional district including Jefferson County, where a Democrat had not won a race in 20 years.

5000|$|The Church of Saint Mary (12th century) is {{registered}} as an historical monument. It {{is one of}} the finest examples of Romanesque churches in Aude. It is located south of the present town after having once been at the centre. The oldest documents mentioning the church date back to 1207.

The building is oriented east to west. It consists of an apse and a nave flanked by two chapels. These chapels in the transept are additions from the 19th century. A <b>bell</b> tower with <b>gables</b> surmounts the west wall with the entrance being to the south of the nave.
