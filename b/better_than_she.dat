500|$|Knight Ridder {{music critic}} Howard Cohen {{called it a}} [...] "creamy" [...] duet. Ramiro Burr of the San Antonio Express-News {{described}} it as a [...] "a glorious ballad on the moment love is born". The Dallas Morning News editor Mario Tarradell praised the track noting that Fernández and Estefan [...] "works not only as an ideal pairing - there's palpable chemistry in their voices - but the cut's sexy mix of acoustic guitar, trumpet and maracas capture the intoxicating allure of a private paradise." [...] Eliseo Cardona of El Nuevo Herald felt that Estefan's performance with Fernández made her sound <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> should be on her albums.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Michelle Erica Green {{reviewed}} the episode on behalf of TrekNation in September 2007, comparing certain elements of the episode to Casablanca and the series finale [...] "". These included the ending where time distortions caused Data to be replicated three times in [...] "We'll Always Have Paris" [...] compared to the similar situation with three Picards in [...] "All Good Things...". Overall she thought that the episode was <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> recalled previously. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] described the episode as too simple, especially the ending which he said was [...] "they give Data a canister, which he sticks into a hall of mirrors; problem solved".|$|E

500|$|Classic Coronation Street was a {{recreation}} of 1960s Coronation Street. It starred Wood as the show's gossiping Ena Sharples, with Julie Walters as Martha Longhurst and Lill Roughley as Minnie Caldwell, with Ena telling them the [...] "gossip" [...] she has {{heard about the}} show's plotlines {{for the next two}} decades. The sketch was written with a detailed knowledge of the soap opera's past: [...] "That stuck up Ida Barlow, who's no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> should be... it'll not be too long before she falls under a bus! That Harry Hewitt'll likely get crushed under the axle of 'is own van, and as for Valerie Barlow – and if this isn't judgement for setting 'erself up in 'er own front parlour as a so-called 'air stylist then my name isn't Ena Sharples – from what I 'ear, it's two clogs to a threpenny bit that she'll electrocute 'erself with 'er own 'airdryer." [...] This sketch's accuracy earned Wood praise from Doris Speed, who had played Annie Walker in Coronation Street from 1960 to 1983.|$|E
500|$|Benigno called [...] "The Most Wonderful Day of the Year" [...] a [...] "perfectly {{pleasant}} {{opening that}} the Gleeks sing while they decorate their tree". Canning deemed it [...] "the episode's most successful song" [...] {{and added that}} it [...] "would {{have been a great}} tone setter if the rest of the episode hadn't focused on heartbreak, hate and grinches". Harper said that the song [...] "got the episode off on the right holiday foot", and Stack gave it a [...] "B" [...] and wrote that its performance [...] "almost felt like the beginning of a real holiday musical. It was a little cheesy but also kind of charming and sweet." [...] The next song, [...] "We Need a Little Christmas", Benigno declared [...] "fun but too short". He added, [...] "If there's one thing this number teaches us, it's that Mercedes is being woefully misused on this show and can carry a number as well, if not <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> can finish one." [...] Stack said that the [...] "little taste" [...] included in the show [...] "sounded promising", and Harper [...] "totally loved this song".|$|E
500|$|Swift became {{inspired}} to write [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] after she overheard a male {{friend of hers}} speaking to his girlfriend through a phone call. He acted defensive as his girlfriend yelled at him, and said to her, [...] "No, baby...I had {{to get off the}} phone really quickly... I tried to call you right back... Of course I love you. More than anything! Baby, I’m so sorry." [...] Out of the sympathy she felt towards him in the situation, Swift developed a concept for a song. In a writing session with co-writer Liz Rose, Swift explained the situation along with her idea and conceived the song's opening line, [...] "You’re on the phone with your girlfriend / she’s upset / she's going off about something that you said." [...] Together, they developed a story line, which described Swift being in love with the male friend and her having the desire for him to break up with his current girlfriend for her. Swift described the song's concept as [...] "basically about wanting someone who is with this girl who doesn't appreciate him at all. Basically like 'girl-next-door-itis.' You like this guy who you have known for your whole life, and you know him <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> does but somehow the popular girl gets the guy every time." [...] Swift recalled, [...] "It was really fun for us to write the line, 'She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts'." [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] was first released as a promotional single from Fearless on November 4, 2008, as part of Countdown to Fearless, an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; the song was then released as the third single from Fearless on April 18, 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Victor Hugo was {{a fervent}} admirer of Bernhardt, praising her [...] "golden voice". Describing her {{performance}} in his play, Ruy Blas in 1872, {{he wrote in}} his Carnets, [...] "It is the first time this play has really been played! <b>She</b> is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> an actress, <b>she</b> is a woman.

500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by film-maker Brett Ratner in Los Angeles, and features a cameo appearance from 30 Rock's Jack McBrayer. Prior to filming the video, or releasing the single, Carey had toned her body, and lost a reported twenty pounds. Due to her slim-down, she and Ratner wanted to flaunt Carey's new figure {{as much as possible}} throughout the video: [...] "Mariah looks <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> has ever looked. It's ridiculous. Mariah has an incredible body, but she was always kind of very voluptuous. Now she's just like, fit. And we were like, we've got to show this body." [...] As the pair came up with the video's plot, Ratner contacted McBrayer to play a male leading role, alongside Carey. After receiving the call, McBrayer claimed he was so shocked by the proposal, that he didn't believe it at first. He only met with the producers after Ratner personally called him and assured him the authenticity of the offer. In an interview with MTV News, McBrayer joked [...] "I'm always worried now that somebody is pranking me, so at first I was very leery. But when I heard it was legit, and then later on we {{got a phone call from}} Brett Ratner, who directed it. I was like, 'This is either a very elaborate prank, or this is the real deal.'" [...] In the fantasy-themed story, he recalled what he considered the video's most memorable scene, in which he and Carey, dressed in medieval attire, were walking with a unicorn. Additionally, he described the filming process as very simple, as they were given very loose directions and pointers. McBrayer claimed that during one take, they were meant to play Frisbee on the mansion lawn, and he accidentally threw it at Carey's face, jokingly adding [...] "by the time she spins back around — bonk, right in her face. I threw a Frisbee in Mariah Carey's face! I'm like, I'm fired!." [...] When questioned by critics regarding the song and video, Carey responded [...] "Have you seen the 'Touch My Body' video? C'mon. Clearly you must see the humour in that. Even the lyrics, 'I will hunt you down'. If anyone doesn't get the joke by this time then they are an idiot." [...] In an interview with Reuters, Carey described working with Ratner, and her experience filming the video: ...|$|E

2500|$|The rehearsals were endless, and the {{preparations}} for Don Carlos kept Verdi in Paris {{for nearly a}} year. By {{the time of the}} premiere on 11 March 1867, [...] "all spontaneity had been lost." [...] The production was not a success, although it did achieve 43 performances before disappearing from the repertoire until modern times. Some reviews specifically mentioned that the voice of Morère in the role of Don Carlos was inadequate for the part and characterized Mme Sass's portrayal as [...] "bored" [...] and [...] "listless". Verdi later wrote to Du Locle (14 March 1868): [...] "Ah, if only Sasse could be persuaded that the part is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> believes. In Italy Stolz turned it into the main role." [...] However, it should also be remembered that in 1867 Marie Sasse's marriage fell apart, and she divorced Armand Castelmary.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} her father died in 1924, Caspary was fully {{supporting}} her mother, who was impressed that her daughter could pound money out of a typewriter. [...] She moved to Greenwich Village in [...] New York as Dance Lovers Magazines new editor, achieving a Bohemian lifestyle. [...] Here she met lifelong friend and collaborator Samuel Ornitz, then editor of Radio Lovers Magazine. Once again leaving a job to write her own material, Caspary wrote her first published novel Ladies and Gents which would not be published for two years due to a publishers delay. When her mother fell ill, she took still another job writing a Charm and Beauty correspondence course. [...] While living in Greenwich village she was inspired to write The White Girl, published in January 1929. Its plot was reminiscent of Fannie Hurst's Imitation of Life, about a Southern black woman who moves North and passes as white. The reviews were <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> had hoped and some people speculated that {{it was written by}} a black woman who was indeed passing.|$|E
2500|$|Eight years later, in 1908, Bernhardt made {{a second}} motion picture, L'Assassinat de Duc de Guise (The {{assassination}} of the Duke de Guise). This film was 20 minutes long, written by Henri Levedan of the Académie française, with supporting roles played by three prominent French stage actors; Henri Le Bargy, Albert Lambert, and Gabrielle Robinne, all from the Comédie Française. The film was silent, but had no action, and the actors looked absurd gesturing and pantomiming words. After seeing it, Bernhardt herself asked that they destroy the film. She told journalists, [...] "I find it awful that they record everything, except the most beautiful things, the words!" [...] Her next film, with her co-star and lover Lou Tellegen, was a recording of a scene from La Dame aux Camelias, called [...] "Camille". The film was a success in the United States, and in France, the young French artist and later screenwriter Jean Cocteau wrote, [...] "What actress can play a lover <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>she</b> does in this film? No one!" [...] Bernhardt received $30,000 for her performance.|$|E
