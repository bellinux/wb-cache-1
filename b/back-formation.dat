25|$|Some words spelled with -ize in American English are {{not used}} in British English, etc., e.g., the verb burglarize, {{regularly}} formed on the noun burglar, where the equivalent in British, and other versions of, English is the <b>back-formation</b> burgle and not burglarise.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 13th century, {{the river was}} being called the Plym (Plyme, in 1238), as a <b>back-formation</b> from Plympton and Plymstock (first {{recorded}} as Plemestocha in 1086). The earliest records of the name Plymouth date from around this time (as Plymmue in 1230, Plimmuth in 1234).|$|E
25|$|The term, from Latin, for {{the main}} upper arm flexor in the {{singular}} is the biceps muscle (from biceps brachii); however, many English speakers take {{it to be a}} plural and refer to the muscle of only one arm, by <b>back-formation,</b> as a bicep. The correct —although very seldom used— Latin plural is bicipites.|$|E
50|$|<b>Back-formations</b> {{frequently}} {{begin in}} colloquial use and only gradually become accepted. For example, enthuse (from enthusiasm) is gaining popularity, {{though it is}} still generally considered nonstandard today.|$|R
50|$|Such words - and {{particularly}} the <b>back-formations,</b> used as nonce words - find occasional use in wordplay, particularly light verse. There {{are a handful of}} notable examples in modern English.|$|R
50|$|As English {{place names}} are often British, {{and hence the}} study of Celtic scholars, <b>back-formations</b> have {{occurred}} in many ways over the centuries due to English-speaking interpretations. For example the River Chelmer in Essex is named for the town of Chelmsford (Chelmeresford) which {{is derived from the}} Saxon personal name Cēolmǣr.|$|R
25|$|These {{words are}} {{interchangeable}} {{with a pair}} of scissors, a pair of trousers, and so forth. In the American fashion industry it is common to refer to a single pair of pants as a pant —though this is a <b>back-formation,</b> the English word (deriving from the French pantalon) was originally singular. In the same field, one half of a pair of scissors separated from the other half is, rather illogically, referred to as a half-scissor. Tweezers used {{to be part of this}} group, but tweezer has come into common usage since the second half of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|The name Wycombe {{appears to}} come from the river Wye and the old English word for a wooded valley, combe, but {{according}} to the Oxford English Dictionary of Place-Names the name, which was first recorded in 799-802 as 'Wichama', {{is more likely to be}} Old English 'wic' and the plural of Old English 'ham', and probably means 'dwellings'; the name of the river was a late <b>back-formation.</b> Wycombe appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 and was noted for having six mills. The town once featured a Roman villa (built 150–170 AD) which has been excavated three times, most recently in 1954. Mosaics and a bathhouse were unearthed at the site on what is now the Rye parkland. High Wycombe was the home of 19th-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.|$|E
25|$|The legend {{as a whole}} encapsulates Rome's {{ideas of}} itself, its origins and moral values. For modern scholarship, it {{remains one of the}} most complex and {{problematic}} of all foundation myths. Ancient historians had no doubt that Romulus gave his name to the city. Most modern historians believe his name is a <b>back-formation</b> from the name of the city. Roman historians dated the city's foundation to between 758 and 728 BC, and Plutarch reports the calculation of Varroʻs friend Tarutius that 771 BC was the birth year of Romulus and his twin. A tradition that gave Romulus a distant ancestor in the semi-divine Trojan prince Aeneas was further embellished, and Romulus was made the direct ancestor of Rome's first Imperial dynasty. It's unclear whether or not the tale of Romulus or that of the twins are original elements of the foundation myth or whether both or either were added.|$|E
50|$|Dorchester's {{position}} {{close to}} the navigable Thames and bounded on three sides by water made it strategic for both communications and defence. The Romans built a vicus here, with a road linking the settlement to a military camp at Alchester, 16 miles (25 km) to the north. The settlement's Roman name is unclear; <b>back-formations</b> from Bede's Dorcic are unsupported.|$|R
50|$|Many English places derive part {{of their}} name from the river upon which they were built, but in the 16th century many English rivers were renamed with <b>back-formations</b> from towns on their banks. Cambridge, perhaps uniquely, {{illustrates}} both effects: originally Grontabricc, a bridge on the Granta, the name became Cantebruge and then Cambrugge, from which the river was renamed Cam.|$|R
2500|$|The word polyomino and {{the names}} of the various orders of polyomino are all <b>back-formations</b> from the word domino, a common game piece {{consisting}} of two squares, with the first letter d- fancifully interpreted as a version of the prefix di- meaning [...] "two." [...] The name domino for the game piece is believed to come from the spotted masquerade garment domino, from Latin dominus.|$|R
2500|$|The plural of {{mongoose}} is mongooses. Mongeese is a <b>back-formation</b> by mistaken {{analogy to}} goose / geese {{and is often}} used in a jocular context. The form meese is sometimes also used humorously as the plural of moose — normally moose or mooses — or even of [...] mouse.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "burger", a <b>back-formation,</b> is {{associated}} with {{many different types of}} sandwiches, similar to a (ground meat) hamburger, but made of different meats such as buffalo in the buffalo burger, venison, kangaroo, turkey, elk, lamb or fish like salmon in the salmon burger, but even with meatless sandwiches as is the case of the veggie burger.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{words have}} unusually formed {{singular}}s and plurals, but develop [...] "normal" [...] singular-plural pairs by <b>back-formation.</b> [...] For example, pease (modern peas) was in origin a singular with plural peasen. [...] However, pease {{came to be}} analysed as plural by analogy, from which a new singular pea was formed; the spelling of pease was also altered accordingly, surviving only {{in the name of}} the dish pease porridge or pease pudding. [...] Similarly, termites was the three-syllable plural of termes; this singular was lost, however, and the plural form reduced to two syllables. [...] Syringe is a <b>back-formation</b> from syringes, itself the plural of syrinx, a musical instrument. Cherry is from Norman French cherise. [...] Phases was once the plural of phasis, but the singular is now phase. The nonstandard, offensive, and now obsolete Chinee and Portugee singulars are back-formations from the standard Chinese and Portuguese.|$|E
40|$|Shortening is {{considered}} a very productive word-building process. It is the dropping of {{the part of a}} word so as to produce a new and shorter word of the same or different meaning. In English, shortenings may be presented by acronyms, abbreviations, initialisms, clippings, blends, and <b>back-formations.</b> Each of them has its own pattern, but it is sometimes difficult to identify a given shortening. The following paper concentrates on the specific word-formation processes “clipping” and “blending”...|$|R
50|$|Synthetically {{conjugated}} verbs like come {{can also}} be conjugated periphrastically (etortzen naiz). In some such cases the synthetic/periphrastic contrast is semantic (e.g. nator and etortzen naiz are not generally interchangeable); in others the contrast is {{more a matter of}} style or register, or else of diachrony (some synthetic forms of conjugation are archaic or obsolete). A few synthetic forms occurring in twentieth-century Basque literature are even a posteriori extrapolations or <b>back-formations</b> of historically unattested forms, created for stylistic, poetic or puristic purposes.|$|R
50|$|Ghost {{words and}} similar errors and creations, {{certainly}} including <b>back-formations,</b> usually {{are at least}} troublesome to philologists {{as a source of}} neologisms and linguistic confusion. More philosophically, one might as well regard them as a source of linguistic challenge and entertainment; probably most of them disappear harmlessly, and those that enter common use might well gain general acceptance simply because they express something comfortably, or otherwise meet a need. The ultimate origins of most words in any language are in essence no more respectable.|$|R
2500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that the name may derive from , or [...] "Gwenhwy the Great", as a contrast to , or [...] "Gwenhwy the less". Gwenhwyfach (also spelled Gwenhwyach) appears in Welsh literature as a sister of Gwenhwyfar, but Welsh scholars Melville Richards and Rachel Bromwich both dismiss this etymology (with Richards suggesting that Gwenhwyfach was a <b>back-formation</b> derived from an incorrect interpretation of Gwenwhy-far as Gwenhwy-fawr).|$|E
2500|$|One {{special case}} is the verb to prise (meaning [...] "to force" [...] or [...] "to lever"), which is spelled prize in the US and prise {{everywhere}} else, including Canada, although in North American English it is almost always replaced by pry, a <b>back-formation</b> from or alteration of prise. A topsail schooner built in Australia in 1829 was called Enterprize, whereas there have been US ships and spacecraft named [...] "Enterprise".|$|E
2500|$|The U50 is {{sometimes}} inaccurately {{referred to as}} the U50D, a <b>back-formation</b> from the U50C name given to the six-axle units. [...] The name is incorrect and was never used by the manufacturer or the railroad. [...] The U50 did not ride on D trucks in any case. It is also sometimes {{referred to as the}} U50B, but this is incorrect as well. Some references erroneously give the wheel arrangement as B-B+B-B.|$|E
50|$|Noun endings such as -ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster) and -cian (beautician) {{are also}} {{particularly}} productive. Some verbs ending in -ize are of U.S. origin; for example, fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, weatherize, winterize, Mirandize; {{and so are}} some <b>back-formations</b> (locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve and enthuse). Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are as of (with dates and times), outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to, not about to and lack for.|$|R
40|$|In specialized, {{scientific}} and technical discourse, {{there is a general}} tendency towards the use of complex noun phrases and nominalizations referring back to previously introduced ideas and concepts (Altieri Biagi 1974; Halliday 1988; Cortelazzo 1990; Gotti 1991, 2003, 2005; Williams 2004; Álvarez de Mon y Rego 2006; Garzone 2008; Mattiello 2010). By contrast, due to the increasing popularization of some forms of scientific discourse, there seems to be also an opposite tendency to use initialisms (e. g. GFP ← Green Fluorescent Protein), acronyms (e. g. CRIIGEN ← Committee for Research & Independent Information on Genetic ENgineering), clippings (e. g. combo ← combination), <b>back-formations</b> (e. g. to lase/lasing ← laser), and related items to condense information into smaller units, especially when they are highly accessible to the whole community or even lexicalized (DNA, HIV, lab, laser, NASA). This latter tendency obeys two general principles. One is the well-known Principle of Linguistic Economy (Martinet 1955), after Zipf’s (1949) Principle of Least Effort, according to which shorter and simpler communication is favoured over redundancy. The other is the Principle of Naming (Mattiello 2013), according to which scientists often encounter or create new objects or concepts and are compelled to name them. This study investigates the terminology used in two renowned scientific journals – Nature and Science – whose primary audience comprises research scientists, but which also {{have an impact on the}} educated general public, especially in their circulation on the Web. The aim is to show that scientific language often makes use of abbreviatory operations: 1) to assign concepts, phenomena and processes more efficient and specific labels which can circulate internationally, and 2) to avoid textual redundancy, while maintaining the lexical cohesion of the text. The socio-pragmatic effects of the use of these operations are: 3) to achieve professional closeness among in-group experts, and 4) especially in news headlines, to catch the attention of readers and excite their curiosity. These functions and effects are chiefly evident in Internet versions of scientific journals, as corroborated by a comparison between paper versions of Nature (January 1972, January 2002) and the articles of Nature published online in January 2012. Theoretically, it will be shown that word-formation phenomena that are generally neglected by morphologists (Aronoff 1976; Scalise 1984; Spencer 1991; Haspelmath 2002), or marginalized to extra-grammatical morphology (Dressler and Merlini Barbaresi 1994; Conti and Mattiello 2008; Mattiello 2008, 2013), deserve attention on account of their strong impact on the receiver, and of their frequency and wide exploitation in specialized discourse (Mattiello 2012). Although they do not change meaning and therefore do not form new words, they result in a change at the stylistic level (Bauer 1983), often becoming more specialized than their bases (Bat-El 2000; Fradin 2003) ...|$|R
2500|$|Both the latinized genus name, Uncia, and the {{occasional}} English name ounce are derived from the Old French once, originally used for the European lynx. Once itself {{is believed to have}} arisen by <b>back-formation</b> from an earlier variant of lynx, lonce– the [...] "l" [...] of lonce was construed as an abbreviated la ('the'), leaving once to be perceived as the animal's name. This, like the English version ounce, came to be used for other lynx-sized cats, and eventually for the snow leopard.|$|E
2500|$|The {{name of the}} {{population}} was often used for the state of Lacedaemon: the Lacedaemonians. This epithet utilized the plural of the adjective Lacedaemonius (Greek: Latin: Lacedaemonii, but also Lacedaemones). If the ancients wished to refer to the country more directly, instead of Lacedaemon, they could use a <b>back-formation</b> from the adjective: Lacedaemonian country. As most words for [...] "country" [...] were feminine, the adjective was in the feminine: Lacedaemonia ( [...] , Lakedaimonia). Eventually, the adjective came to be used alone.|$|E
2500|$|The {{etymology}} originates from Anglo-Saxon or Old English, {{one of the}} Germanic languages. According to one textbook, [...] "The word burglar {{comes from}} the two German words , meaning [...] "house", and , meaning [...] "thief" [...] (literally [...] "house thief"). Another suggested etymology is from the later Latin word , [...] "to break open" [...] or [...] "to commit burglary", from , meaning [...] "fortress" [...] or [...] "castle", with the word then passing through French and Middle English, with influence from the Latin , [...] "thief". The British verb [...] "burgle" [...] is a late <b>back-formation.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The word patriation {{was coined}} in Canada as a <b>back-formation</b> from {{repatriation}} (returning to one's country). Prior to 1982, the Canadian constitution was held by, and modified by, the United Kingdom (on {{request from the}} Parliament of Canada); hence some have felt that the term patriation was more suitable than the term repatriation (returning something). The term was first used in 1966 by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson {{in response to a}} question in parliament: [...] "We intend to do everything we can to have the constitution of Canada repatriated, or patriated." ...|$|E
2500|$|These derivations of {{the word}} bikini were created through {{inappropriate}} analogy with words like bilingual, bifocal and bilateral, which contain the Latin prefix [...] "bi-" [...] (meaning [...] "two" [...] in Latin), the word bikini was first back-derived as consisting of two parts, [...] by Rudi Gernreich when he designed the monokini in 1964. [...] Later swimsuit designs like the tankini and trikini were also named based on the erroneous assumption that the [...] "bi-" [...] in bikini denotes a two-piece swimsuit. [...] These new coinages falsely presumed that the <b>back-formation</b> [...] was purposeful.|$|E
2500|$|The {{belief in}} a [...] "twin" [...] world, Terra, is {{widespread}} on Antiterra {{as a sort of}} fringe religion or mass hallucination. (The name [...] "Antiterra" [...] may be a <b>back-formation</b> from this; the planet is [...] "really" [...] called [...] "Demonia".) One of Van's early specialties as a psychologist is researching and working with people who believe that they are somehow in contact with Terra. Terra's alleged history, so far as he states it, appears to be that of our world: that is, the characters in the novel dream, or hallucinate, about the real world.|$|E
2500|$|Technical terms from Sanskrit were {{converted}} into Pali {{by a set}} of conventional phonological transformations. [...] These transformations mimicked a subset of the phonological developments that had occurred in Proto-Pali. [...] Because of the prevalence of these transformations, it is not always possible to tell whether a given Pali word {{is a part of the}} old Prakrit lexicon, or a transformed borrowing from Sanskrit. [...] The existence of a Sanskrit word regularly corresponding to a Pali word is not always secure evidence of the Pali etymology, since, in some cases, artificial Sanskrit words were created by <b>back-formation</b> from Prakrit words.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} the name seems obvious: in {{classical}} Greek the word should mean [...] "children of Homer". An analogous name, Asclepiadae, identified a clan or guild of medical practitioners as [...] "children of Asclepius". However, since {{the existence of the}} Homeridae is authenticated while that of Homer is not, and since Greek homeros is a common noun meaning [...] "hostage", it was suggested even in ancient times that the Homeridae were in reality [...] "children (or descendants) of hostages". The natural further step is to argue that Homer, the supposed founder, is a mythical figure, a mere <b>back-formation,</b> deriving his name from that of the later guild.|$|E
2500|$|Like another {{indirect}} German borrowing, fraŭlo (bachelor), which {{derives from}} fraŭlino (Miss, from [...] "fräulein") less the feminine suffix -in-, edzo {{appears to be}} a <b>back-formation</b> of edzino (wife). Zamenhof said the latter derives from kronprincedzino (crown princess), borrowed from the German Kronprinzessin, and then internally analyzed as kron- (crown) princ- (prince) edzino (wife). [...] However, Vilborg's Etimologia Vortaro argues that edzino is more likely to have come from Yiddish רביצין rebbetzin (rabbi's wife, Mrs.), reanalysed as rebb-etzin, and that Zamenhof made up the German etymology after the fact to avoid anti-Semitic prejudice against Esperanto. That would mean that edz- ultimately derives from the Slavic feminine suffix -its(a). Regardless, few words have histories this convoluted.|$|E
2500|$|The river has {{captured}} the imagination of several authors and poets, particularly since in very hot summers the river channel can become dry between Dorking and Leatherhead (most recently during the 1976 drought). [...] In John Speed's 1611 map of Surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend [...] "The river runneth under". [...] However the river's name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour: The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names suggests that Mole either comes from the Latin mola (a mill) or is a <b>back-formation</b> from Molesey (Mul's island). Domesday Book lists twenty mills on the river in 1086, of which Sidlow Mill was the oldest, dating from Saxon times.|$|E
2500|$|The name Mole {{does not}} appear until the 16th century, first {{occurring}} as Moule in Harrison's Description of Britain of 1577. The antiquarian William Camden uses the Latinized form Molis in the 1586 edition of Britannia and Michael Drayton {{is the first to}} use Mole in his poem Poly-Olbion published in 1613. In John Speed's 1611 map of Surrey this stretch of the river is denoted by a series of hills accompanied by the legend [...] "The river runneth under". [...] However the river's name is unlikely to have derived from this behaviour: The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names suggests that Mole either comes from the Latin mola (a mill) or is a <b>back-formation</b> from Molesey (Mul's island). In John Rocque's 1768 map of Surrey, the name Moulsey River is used.|$|E
2500|$|They also {{introduced}} the word [...] "methylène" [...] to organic chemistry, forming it from Greek methy = [...] "alcoholic liquid" [...] + hȳlē = [...] "woodland, forest", with a Greek language error: xylon = [...] "wood as a material" [...] {{would have been}} more suitable. [...] "Methylène" [...] designated a [...] "radical" [...] that was about 14% hydrogen by weight and contained one carbon atom. This would be CH2, but at the time carbon was thought to have an atomic weight only six times that of hydrogen, so they gave the formula as CH. They then called wood alcohol (l'esprit de bois) [...] "bihydrate de méthylène" [...] (bihydrate because they thought the formula was C4H8O4 = (CH)4(H2O)2!). The term [...] "methyl" [...] was derived in about 1840 by <b>back-formation</b> from [...] "methylene", and was then applied to describe [...] "methyl alcohol". This was shortened to [...] "methanol" [...] in 1892 by the International Conference on Chemical Nomenclature. [...] The suffix -yl used in organic chemistry to form names of carbon groups, was extracted from the word [...] "methyl".|$|E
2500|$|The river has two sources, {{both in the}} low {{ridge of}} Jurassic rocks in {{the west of the}} county. The East Glen rises as a number of small streams near to Ropsley and Humby, close to the [...] contour. It flows in a southerly direction, passing to the east of Ingoldsby and to the west of Bulby, to arrive at Edenham. The East Glen is {{sometimes}} called the River Eden, derived as a <b>back-formation</b> from its passing through the parish of Edenham. It continues south through Toft, where a Grade II listed bridge built in the early 1800s crosses, and Manthorpe, where there is another listed bridge with a single elliptical arch built in 1813, before turning east to join the West Glen at Wilsthorpe, Lincolnshire. The West Glen also has a number of sources, near to the [...] contour at Old Somerby and Boothby Pagnall. It flows more or less parallel to the East Glen, passing through Bitchfield, Burton-le-Coggles, Corby Glen and Creeton to reach Essendine, where it turns east towards Greatford. In the village, a two-arched stone bridge built in the late 1700s carries Church Lane over the river.|$|E
