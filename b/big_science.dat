5|$|The wartime Manhattan Project left {{a legacy}} {{in the form}} of the network of {{national}} laboratories: the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Argonne National Laboratory and Ames Laboratory. Two more were established by Groves soon after the war, the Brookhaven National Laboratory at Upton, New York, and the Sandia National Laboratories at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Groves allocated $72million to them for research activities in fiscal year 1946–1947. They would be in the vanguard of the kind of large-scale research that Alvin Weinberg, the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, would call <b>Big</b> <b>Science.</b>|$|E

5|$|Chadwick {{was himself}} {{a critic of}} <b>Big</b> <b>Science</b> in general, and Lawrence in particular, whose {{approach}} he considered careless and focused on technology {{at the expense of}} science. When Lawrence postulated the existence of a new and hitherto unknown particle that he claimed was a possible source of limitless energy at the Solvay Conference in 1933, Chadwick responded that the results were more likely attributable to contamination of the equipment. While Lawrence rechecked his results at Berkeley only to find that Chadwick was correct, Rutherford and Oliphant conducted an investigation at the Cavendish that found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, thereby causing the effect that the Lawrence had observed. This was another major discovery, but the Oliphant-Rutherford particle accelerator was an expensive state-of-the-art piece of equipment.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Chadwick {{carried out}} {{research}} {{as part of}} the Tube Alloys project to build an atomic bomb, while his Liverpool lab and environs were harassed by Luftwaffe bombing. When the Quebec Agreement merged his project with the American Manhattan Project, he became part of the British Mission, and worked at the Los Alamos Laboratory and in Washington, D.C. He surprised everyone by earning the almost-complete trust of project director Leslie R. Groves, Jr. For his efforts, Chadwick received a knighthood in the New Year Honours on 1 January 1945. In July 1945, he viewed the Trinity nuclear test. After this, he served as the British scientific advisor to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. Uncomfortable with the trend toward <b>Big</b> <b>Science,</b> Chadwick became the Master of Gonville and Caius College in 1948. He retired in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, as {{evolutionary}} theorists {{explored the}} possibility of multiple units of selection, ecologists turned to evolutionary approaches. In population ecology, debate over group selection was brief but vigorous; by 1970, most biologists agreed that natural selection was rarely effective above the level of individual organisms. The evolution of ecosystems, however, became a lasting research focus. Ecology expanded rapidly {{with the rise of}} the environmental movement; the International Biological Program attempted to apply the methods of <b>big</b> <b>science</b> (which had been so successful in the physical sciences) to ecosystem ecology and pressing environmental issues, while smaller-scale independent efforts such as island biogeography and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest helped redefine the scope of an increasingly diverse discipline.|$|E
30|$|The eight Triple Helix games {{studied in}} this paper {{presented}} two patterns as regards the Triple Helix spheres’ outputs. For the ones, university is the <b>biggest</b> <b>science</b> producer; for the others, government is the top science producer; as a result, industry is at the third place. Due to this change in the ranking of the Triple Helix actors by their output, the rank of coalitions according to their payoff also changes: coalitions that university is involved in are ranked first in countries where university is the top science producer, and coalitions government {{is a member of}} are ranked first in countries where government is the top science producer. This result prefigures the ranking of players by the Shapley value: university has the highest Shapley value in countries where it is the <b>biggest</b> <b>science</b> producer and government has the highest Shapley value in countries where it is the <b>biggest</b> <b>science</b> producer. The result confirms the one of Mêgnigbêto (Mêgnigbêto 2018) where university, the <b>biggest</b> <b>science</b> producer in South Korea and West Africa, has the highest Shapley value. Note that the production share and the Shapley value are linked; indeed, mathematically, the Shapley value is the expected utility of player (Roth 1988 a); in other words, it is the average of utilities of an actor; consequently, the larger an actor’s utility, the higher its Shapley value. In summary, the Triple Helix actor that has the largest share to publications has more strength to lead to and create synergy because it has more power to bind agreements and form coalitions.|$|R

25|$|Livingston {{returned}} to MIT {{soon after the}} end of the war, but in 1946 a consortium of universities including MIT banded together to create the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island, New York, as a facility for carrying out <b>Big</b> <b>Science</b> research activities that were beyond the resources of a single academic institution. Morse was appointed as Brookhaven's first director, and he asked Livingston to take charge of building an accelerator for the new national laboratory. It was decided that it should be a new type of accelerator known as synchrotron that had been proposed by Edwin McMillan in 1945. Isidor Isaac Rabi in particular argued that it should be more powerful than any planned by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.|$|E
500|$|Freeman also {{provided}} {{advice to the}} Australian Government {{on the problem of}} access to [...] "big science" [...] facilities. [...] This included making major contributions to the report Small Country - <b>Big</b> <b>Science</b> in his work for the Australian Science and Technology Council. [...] The report emphasised the need for Australian researchers to have access to facilities such as synchrotron X-ray and high intensity neutron sources, and led directly to the formation of the Australian Synchrotron Research Programme (ASRP) to fund access to such facilities. [...] Freeman served as {{a board member of the}} ASRP until its functions were subsumed under the newly commissioned Australian Synchrotron in 2008. [...] The Australian expertise developed as a consequence of ASRP-supported research led to the Australian Synchrotron being built a decade sooner than would have otherwise been the case.|$|E
500|$|After the war, Lawrence campaigned {{extensively}} {{for government}} sponsorship of large scientific programs. He was a forceful advocate of <b>Big</b> <b>Science</b> with its requirements for big machines and big money, and in 1946 {{he asked the}} Manhattan Project for over $2 million for research at the Radiation Laboratory. Groves approved the money, but cut a number of programs, including Seaborg's proposal for a [...] "hot" [...] radiation laboratory in densely populated Berkeley, and John Lawrence's for production of medical isotopes, because this need could now be better met from nuclear reactors. One obstacle was the University of California, which was eager to divest its wartime military obligations. Lawrence and Groves managed to persuade Sproul to accept a contract extension. In 1946, the Manhattan Project spent $7 on physics at the University of California for every dollar spent by the University.|$|E

500|$|The {{last major}} {{advertising}} campaign {{before and during}} Halo 3s release {{was a series of}} videos marketed with the tagline [...] "Believe", beginning September 11, 2007.

500|$|The Second World War {{demonstrated}} that science, and physics in particular, now required considerable financial and material resources. To avoid a brain drain to the United States, twelve European countries {{banded together to}} create CERN, a research organisation {{along the lines of}} the national laboratories in the United States, designed to undertake <b>Big</b> <b>Science</b> projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. Questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. Bohr and Kramers felt that the Institute in Copenhagen would be the ideal site. Pierre Auger, who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both Bohr and his Institute were past their prime, and that Bohr's presence would overshadow others. After a long debate, Bohr pledged his support to CERN in February 1952, and Geneva was chosen as the site in October. The CERN Theory Group was based in Copenhagen until their new accommodation in Geneva was ready in 1957. Victor Weisskopf, who later became the Director General of CERN, summed up Bohr's role, saying that [...] "there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of CERN. The enthusiasm and ideas of the other people would not have been enough, however, if a man of his stature had not supported it." ...|$|E

Controversy surrounding DNA barcoding stems not so much from the method itself, but rather from extravagant claims that it will supersede or radically transform traditional taxonomy. Other critics fear a [...] "big science" [...] initiative like barcoding will make funding even more scarce for already underfunded disciplines like taxonomy, but barcoders respond that they compete for funding not with fields like taxonomy, but instead with other <b>big</b> <b>science</b> fields, such as medicine and genomics.
