50|$|Coriolis density meters, {{also known}} as mass flow meters or {{inertial}} flow meters, work {{on the principle of}} vibration to measure phase shifts in the vibration of a bent thin walled tube. The bent thin walled tube is rotated around a central axis. When there is no mass in the <b>bent</b> <b>section,</b> the tube remains untwisted. However, when the density inside the <b>bent</b> <b>section</b> increases, the inbound flow portion of the bent pipe drags behind the out flow portion. This twisting causes phase shifts which result in changes in the resonant frequency of the thin walled tube. Therefore, the resonant frequency is directly affected by the density. Higher density media causes a larger coriolis effect if the volumetric flow rate is constant. Flowing media causes a frequency and a phase shift of the bent pipe, which are proportional to the mass flow rate of the sample.|$|E

Polarization of the short wavelengths is achieved in a <b>bent</b> <b>section</b> of about 8 m and radius 160 m, with a m = 3 FeSi multilayer coating. Due to the total reflection of Fesi, longer wavelengths (lambda similar or equal to 10 - 20 (A) over circle) pass unpolarized and need an additional short polarizer {{at the entrance of}} the instrument. After the <b>bent</b> <b>section</b> within a 10 m straight guide section a turn of vertical polarization to longitudinal guide field is performed and a selector is inserted.

Roller <b>bent</b> wide flange <b>sections</b> are manufactured from straight hot-rolled wide flange sections by a process called roller bending.

To achieve this, the magnetic field is generated by a magnet placed outside the subject. Thus, only the electrodes and a minimal supporting structure have to be introduced into the blood vessel {{to pick up the}} electromotive force induced in the blood streaming at right angles to the magnetic field. To suppress induction of a transformer electromotive force in the electrode leads, the latter form a co-axial lead system of small gauge. One electrode is {{at the tip of the}} insulated external tube of this lead system (a gauge no. 28 hypodermic tube) and is insulated from it. The other electrode is a bare section of the external tube about 2 cm from its tip. The tube is bent at an angle of about 30 ° just below the second electrode. Thus, this <b>bent</b> <b>section</b> places the two electrodes near two diametrically opposite wall sections of the blood vessels after insertion of the fine catheter via a hollow catheter through a branch blood vessel into the main vessel.

The potential difference between the two electrodes measures the volume rate of flow through the blood vessel.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of structural wide flange steel sections introduces residual stresses in the material. These stresses due to hot-rolling or welding influence the inelastic buckling response of structural steel members {{and need to}} be taken into account in the design. Based on experimental data standardized residual stress models have been proposed for inclusion in inelastic buckling analyses. By incorporating these residual stress models their effect on the resistance of beams and columns can be obtained. Residual stress models for roller <b>bent</b> steel <b>sections</b> are currently not available. Roller <b>bent</b> wide flange <b>sections</b> are manufactured by curving straight members at ambient temperature.

40|$|Abstract: If ground {{subsidence}} or {{seismic load}} acts on piping that includes bent pipes, the highest stress often occurs {{not in a}} straight section but in a <b>bent</b> <b>section.</b> The author has therefore developed a method of estimating the stress generated by a change in diameter by adding an equation for the diameter change and bending moment to the bent pipe stress calculation equations proposed by Rodabaugh and George. To investigate the validity of this method, two kinds of bent pipe made using typical bent pipe manufacturing methods and having representative section wall thickness distributions were tested to determine {{the relationship between the}} diameter change and the stress generated when in-plane bending moment is applied. As a result, it was confirmed that the stress estimated from the diameter change closely agrees with the measured value. Introduction: It is essential to determine the stress generated in pipelines in order to maintain their safety against external forces, and to do so by non-destructive diagnosis for pipelines that are in service. However, the method involves measuring deformation after installing strain gauges, so it is impossible to diagnose stress over time unless strain gauges are installed when the pipelines are laid.

Caliper log runs carried out by ConocoPhillips revealed that the production tubing in a <b>bent</b> <b>section</b> contained local scars with a wall thickness reduction up to 47 %. In order to ensure a sufficient well integrity, a accurate prediction of the de- rated tubing strength is important. Today, the most common methods to estimate the de-rated burst and collapse pressures of a damaged tubing are the API models, which assume a uniform wear. In this thesis the Finite Element Method have been applied in order to investigate if the API models also are applicable for a locally worn tubing. Three different local wear shapes have been simulated, referred to as crescent, wedge and rectangular shaped. The results shows that as the wear depth increases up to 50 %, the deviation between the FEM results and the API model for burst reaches up to 71 %, 114 % and 147 %, respectively. The models for collapse showed a similar trend, but with a significantly lower deviation compared to the burst model. According to the FEM results the API models can not be applied for a tubing with a local wear. The overall results proves the need to perform a FEM based analysis for a locally damaged tubular {{in order to ensure}} sufficient well integrity...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} the transport line between the main ring (MR) and the energy doubler (ED). The transport line is designed {{on the basis of}} the following three assumptions: (1) The ED is located at the apex of the same tunnel which encloses the MR. The relative locations of the two rings are shown in Fig. 1. The ED line is 3 feet to the inside and 4 feet above with respect to the MR line. Watching Fig. 1 the beam moves toward the page and the center of the rings is to the right. The continuous outer curve is the cross section of the tunnel in a typical long-straight section, the dashed inner curve is the cross section of the tunnel in the <b>bent</b> <b>section.</b> (2) The beam has to be extracted from one long-straight section of the MR (BO) and injected in the next medium-straight section of the ED (B 17). The two rings are assumed to have the same identical lattice structure. (3) To keep the aisle-way in the tunnel as clear as we can it is advisable to extract the beam horizontally but displaced first vertically upward and second horizontally inward. The beam is then injected vertically. To avoid problems associated with trapped flux at low fields, it is advisable to inject at an energy substantially higher than 100 GeV. On the other hand, the last two assumptions limit the maximum energy to about 200 GeV. For higher energy one has, at the same time, to transfer the beam from one long-straight section to the next long-straight section and to obstruct a good fraction of the tunnel with Ragnets. Thus, the transport line we are going to describe here, has been designed for the transfer energy of 200 GeV. The transport line is divided in three parts: (a) The beam is extracted from the MR and, with alternate series of horizontal and vertical bendings, transferred to a line which is 2 feet and 7 inches inside and 3 feet above the MR line. In Fig. 1, A is the location of the MR line, B that of the ED line and C is the location of the intermediate line. (b) The C line begins in correspondence to the first end of the first bending magnet after the long-straight section and terminates in correspondence of the first end of the fourth bending magnet before the next medium-straight section. Of course the C line runs parallel to the ED line at a distance of 1 foot below and 5 inches to the outside. (c) The beam, after having been bent first horizontally and then vertically, is finally vertically injected in correspondence to the first magnet after the medium-straight section...|$|E

Tree growth through a bent tape can lead to a significantly shorter time to breakdown.
