500|$|In 1956 Holloway {{created the}} role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the {{original}} [...] Broadway production of My Fair Lady. The librettist, Alan Jay Lerner, remembered in his memoirs that Holloway was his first choice for the role, even before it was written. Lerner's only concern was whether, after so long away from the musical stage, Holloway still had his resonant singing voice. Holloway reassured him over a lunch at Claridge's: Lerner recalled, [...] "He put down his knife and fork, threw <b>back</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> unleashed a strong baritone note that resounded through the dining room, drowned out the string quartet and sent a few dozen people off to the osteopath to have their necks untwisted." [...] Holloway had a long association with the show, appearing in the original 1956 Broadway production at the Mark Hellinger Theatre, the 1958 London version at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and the film version in 1964, which he undertook instead of {{the role of}} Admiral Bloom in Mary Poppins that he had been offered the same year. [...] In The Manchester Guardian, Alistair Cooke wrote, [...] "Stanley Holloway distils into the body of Doolittle the taste and smell of every pub in England." [...] Also in 1964, he appeared as Bellomy in the Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of The Fantasticks.|$|E
