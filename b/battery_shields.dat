50|$|On 30 November the Russian {{squadron}} {{entered the}} harbor {{from the northwest}} in a triangular formation. Nakhimov arranged his force between the Ottomans and the shore <b>batteries</b> <b>shielding</b> his own force and exposing the Ottomans to potential friendly fire. Nakhimov spaced his battleships evenly in two lines covering the entire harbor with interlocking fields of fire. Russian gunners began to score hits {{on all of the}} Ottoman targets. The shells fired by Russian guns immediately set Ottoman ships on fire. Panic-stricken Ottoman sailors found firefighting efforts difficult amidst continued fire and almost constant shrapnel. After about thirty minutes of combat the Ottoman frigate was full of shot-holes and ran aground when her cable was cut. Imperatritsa Maria then attacked the forty-four gun frigate Fazli Allah which caught fire and grounded. Meanwhile, the other Russian ships engaged the Nizamie and Damiad, which were grounded. The Ottoman frigate Navek Bakhri exploded and sank along with the corvette Guli Sephid.|$|R

50|$|Codename MAT II, {{also written}} by Brewster, was {{published}} later in 1984 by Domark for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC. It featured a new ship, the Centurion II, which had two different weapons {{and a more}} complex damage system - on-board droids could be assigned repair tasks by the player.

5|$|Wisconsin arrived off Songjin, Korea on 15 March and {{concentrated}} her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, {{when one of}} four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun <b>battery</b> struck the <b>shield</b> of a starboard 40mm mount; Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured. Wisconsin subsequently destroyed that battery with a full 16-inch (406mm) salvo before continuing her mission.

50|$|In {{the last}} days of April, General Hatry renewed the offer for the city to surrender, but this was {{declined}} again. He then started constructing a <b>shielded</b> <b>battery</b> on a nearby height, equipped with mortars, in order to bombard the city. Faced with this threat, the Austrians attempted a massive sortie on the night of 15 to 16 May, but were repulsed with heavy losses. Now convinced of the futility of such actions, the governor ordered the continuous bombardment of the French artillery positions. The firing lasted 12 days, but the French batteries retaliated and caused numerous casualties, {{to the extent that the}} residents asked Bender to capitulate.|$|R

5000|$|The 16-inch {{guns were}} only the top end of the World War II program, which {{eventually}} replaced almost all previous coast defense weapons with newer (or remounted) weapons. Most of the 12-inch long-range batteries were casemated and served {{through the end of}} the war. Generally, each harbor defense command was to have two or three 16-inch or 12-inch long-range batteries, plus 6-inch guns on new mountings with protected magazines, and 90 mm Anti Motor Torpedo Boat (AMTB) guns, which were supplemented with 37 mm or 40 mm anti-aircraft guns. In addition to the proposed 38 new 16-inch (406 mm) batteries with a range of 25 mi, eleven new 8-inch (203 mm) batteries with a range of 20 mi and 87 new 6-inch (152 mm) <b>batteries</b> on high-angle <b>shielded</b> mountings with a range of 15 mi were projected. All of these batteries had two guns each with heavily protected magazines and plotting rooms and casemated guns (except the 6-inch guns had shielded mountings). Additionally, about 32 8-inch MkVIM3A2 railway guns were deployed. In most cases replacing existing harbor defenses, with wartime changes noted, fortifications were planned for the harbor defenses of: ...|$|R
30|$|Scientific and {{technological}} interest in studying nanomaterials has spurred to develop conducting polymeric nanostructures, using reliable and scalable synthetic methods to provide better performance {{of these materials}} in the established areas of corrosion, sensors, <b>batteries,</b> and EMI <b>shielding</b> [1 â€“ 4]. Chemical oxidative polymerization of aniline is the traditional method for preparing polyaniline in bulk [5]. In the aniline polymerization reaction, an acidic solution is needed to enhance the head-to-tail coupling between aniline monomers. Typically a strong mineral acid such as hydrochloric, sulphuric, nitric, perchloric or phosphoric acid is used at a high concentration (1.0 M) for the preparation of Polyaniline (PANI) [5]. It {{has been reported that}} the diameter of the nanofibres so formed is strongly influenced by the dopant used in the polymerization [5]. Polyaniline prepared by using HCl is highly aggregated and contains mostly irregularly shaped agglomerates which deteriorate the desired properties of the polymer. Substituted polyanilines continues to be an emerging research area of great interest since these polymers hold the potential to improve upon the properties of polyaniline. Scarce literature is available on the chemical synthesis of poly (1 -naphthylamine) (PNA)â€”a polyaniline derivative. Moon et al. [6] first reported the chemical synthesis of poly (1 -aminonaphthlaene) and poly (aminoanthracene) using H 2 O 2 /Fe 2 + system. Shaffie et al. [7] carried out the chemical oxidative polymerization of poly (1 -naphthylamine) using potassium persulphate, and the conductivity of the polymer was reported to be in the range of âˆ¼ 0.83 Scmâˆ’ 1. Recently, Shan et al. [8] synthesized PNA via enzymatic polymerization using horse dish peroxidase. Surprisingly, none of the studies mentioned above have reported the nanoscale synthesis of PNA.|$|R

40|$|Conjugated {{polymers}} {{have been}} used in various applications (<b>battery,</b> supercapacitor, electromagnetic <b>shielding,</b> chemical sensor, biosensor, nanocomposite, light-emitting-diode, electrochromic display etc.) due to their excellent conductivity, electrochemical and optical properties, and low cost. Polyaniline has attracted the researchers from all disciplines of science, engineering, and industry due to its redox properties, environmental stability, conductivity, and optical properties. Moreover, it is a polymer with fast electroactive switching and reversible properties displayed at low potential, which is an important feature in many applications. The thin oriented polyaniline films have been fabricated using self-assembly, Langmuir-Blodgett, in-situ self-assembly, layer-by-layer, and electrochemical technique. The focus of this thesis is to synthesize and characterize polyaniline thin films with and without dyes. Also, the purpose of this thesis is to find the fastest electroactive switching PANI electrode in different electrolytic medium by studying their electrochemical properties. These films were fabricated using two deposition techniques: in-situ self-assembly and electrochemical deposition. The characterization of these films was done using techniques such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). FTIR and UV-spectroscopy showed similar results {{in the structure of the}} polyaniline films. However, for the dye incorporated films, since there was an addition in the synthesis of the material, peak locations shifted, and new peaks corresponding to these materials appeared. The 1 layer PANI showed compact film morphology, comparing to other PANI films, which displayed a fiber-like structure. Finally, the electrochemical properties of these thin films were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry (CA), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in different scenarios. These scenarios included the study in different acid based electrolytes and different gel based electrolytes. The ultra-thin self-assembled PANI films were shown to have a faster switching time, especially for the 1 layer PANI, whereas the color contrast could be observed for the film containing the dye molecule. Also, HCl based electrolyte gave the best electrochemical reversibility compared to other acids used. For the gelatin and PVA based electrolytes, having the same concentration, the results were similar. Hence, the change in the electrolyte consistencies, from liquid to semi-solid, did not change the electrochemical properties of the films. Finally, in the EIS, it was shown that these PANI thin films exhibit a pseudo-capacitance behavior, and as the film thickness grew, the capacitance increased...|$|R
