25|$|People {{are more}} likely to {{cooperate}} on a task if they can communicate with one another first. This may be due to better assessments of cooperativeness or due to exchange of promises. They are more cooperative if they can gradually <b>build</b> <b>trust,</b> instead of being asked to give extensive help immediately. Direct reciprocity and cooperation in a group can be increased by changing the focus and incentives from intra-group competition to larger scale competitions such as between groups or against the general population. Thus, giving grades and promotions based only on an individual's performance relative to a small local group, as is common, may reduce cooperative behaviors in the group.|$|E

25|$|Women are not {{necessarily}} sympathetic to female complainants who have been sexually harassed. If the harasser was male, internalized sexism (or jealousy over the sexual attention towards the victim) may encourage some women to react with as much hostility towards the complainant as some male colleagues. Fear of being targeted for harassment or retaliation themselves may also cause some women to respond with hostility. For example, when Lois Jenson filed her lawsuit against Eveleth Taconite Co., the women shunned her both at work and in the community—many of these women later joined her suit. Women may even project hostility onto the victim in order to bond with their male coworkers and <b>build</b> <b>trust.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, Slovenian {{authorities}} {{have attempted to}} rectify this discrimination by introducing a two day training programme on policing in a multi-ethnic community.

The Roma were made aware of their rights, and the police were educated about national and international standards regarding treatment of minorities. The programme involved teaching police about Roma culture and their language which served to break down some of the stereotypes that caused tension.

25|$|Within {{one week}} of being sworn into office, Baxley had {{researched}} original police files into the bombing, discovering {{that most of}} the original police documents were lackluster and inefficient. Nonetheless, Baxley formally reopened the case into the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1971. Baxley was able to corroborate with and <b>build</b> <b>trust</b> with key witnesses, some of whom had been reluctant to testify in the first trial. Other witnesses obtained were able to identify Chambliss as the individual who had placed the bomb beneath the church. Baxley also gathered evidence proving Chambliss had purchased dynamite from a store in Jefferson County less than two weeks before the bomb was planted, upon the pretext the dynamite was to be used to clear land the Ku Klux Klan had purchased near Highway 101. In addition, he also obtained testimony from witnesses who were able to place Robert Chambliss and his car {{in the vicinity of the}} church on the day of the bombing. This testimony and evidence was used to formally construct a case against Robert Chambliss.|$|E

500|$|On {{the second}} measure, {{the number of}} {{complaints}} dealt with by the committee has been limited. A 2008 assessment for the UK government found that the protocol had hardly been used by NGOs as originally expected, that the reasoning of the Committee was unpredictable, {{and that it had}} not affected policy-making. [...] It found that there had been some limited success in highlighting the importance of effective policies to protect women from domestic violence and forced sterilization, but that outside these areas, the protocol [...] "has not led to a breakthrough in advancing women's rights." [...] It concludes that unless greater efforts are made to highlight awareness of the Optional Protocol and <b>build</b> <b>trust</b> in the rulings of the Committee, the complaints mechanism will remain under-utilized.|$|E

2500|$|Shields {{introduced}} {{a number of}} procedural and technological reforms in the JCF which were credited with increasing the arrest and conviction rate, including systematic digitisation of fingerprints taken from arrested suspects, increased introduction of closed-circuit television cameras, and further use of DNA evidence. From 2005 to 2006, the number of murders in Jamaica fell by 20percent, from 1,680 to 1,340. He also stressed getting the community involved through neighbourhood watch programs and independent advisory groups who would liaise with the police and <b>build</b> <b>trust</b> between the two groups. There was some concern over whether British policing methods would be effective in the different culture and situation of Jamaica. Shields described Jamaica as presenting different challenges than his native Britain, noting that while the crime rate was higher in Jamaica, there were far fewer people committing those crimes; in simple words, his solution was [...] "to target the gunmen". He also sought to fight corruption in the JCF.|$|E
