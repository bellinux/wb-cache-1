5000|$|It is an anadromous, migratory fish, which {{closely resembles}} the Atlantic salmon in its form and lifestyle. In the sea, it makes long {{journeys}} and also swims upstream into small rivers {{in order to}} spawn. Spawning occurs in winter on gravelly river beds in the grayling zone to the <b>barbel</b> <b>zone.</b> Their eggs are laid in troughs or redds. The young fish remain in freshwater for one to five years and then {{make their way to}} the sea. The [...] "inner clock" [...] signals to the fish when they need to make their return journey to the sea. During this migration, they can cover up to 40 km per day.|$|E
40|$|A multimetric fish Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was {{composed}} {{to assess the}} biotic integrity of Flandrian water bodies. As fish communities differ substantially between standing waters, running waters of the bream zone and running waters of the <b>barbel</b> <b>zone,</b> eight candidate metrics {{for each of these}} water types or zones were identified, representing three major classes of biological attributes. These are species richness and composition, fish condition and abundance, trophic composition. The metrics were tested and modified where needed. The IBI was applied throughout Flanders on 104 locations in standing waters, 500 locations in waters of the bream zone and 257 locations in waters of the <b>barbel</b> <b>zone.</b> Standing waters scored substantially different from running waters. Standing waters rarely contained no fish at all, but their fish communities were very often poor to very poor. Waters of the bream and <b>barbel</b> <b>zone</b> were often fishless (respectively 40 % and 35 % of all locations contain no fish), but the locations with fish usually scored reasonable to poor. Only 18. 5 % of all locations were classified as reasonable to excellent (IBI classes 4 or lower on a scale from 1 to 9) and were considered to satisfy the basic ecological quality demands. The Leie-, Dijle-, Dender- and Schelde-basins had a very poor quality (more than 50 % of the locations contained no fish). The Maas-, Grote and Kleine Nete-basins scored rather well, with respectively, 44 %, 48 % and 68 % of the locations achieving an IBI of 4 or lower. The IBI is a valuable and complementary tool to assess the ecological quality of water bodies as suggested in the proposal for a Water Framework Directive by the European Commission. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the ichthyofauna in {{the upper part of}} the Croatian section of the Sava river, the so called <b>barbel</b> <b>zone,</b> showed that very frequent and quite numerous fish species were chub (Leuciscus cephalus (L., 1758)), bleak (Alburnus alburnus (L., 1758)), spirlin (Alburnoides bipunctatus (Bloch, 1782)), barbel (Barbus barbus (L., 1758)) and stream barbel (Barbus meridionalis petenyi Heckel, 1847). There are very few published papers on the biology of these fish species, and even less on their natural feeding in the open waters. Although these fish species economically less important, is play an important role in the open waters ecological niche. One of the most important factors for the ecological niche is food web. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to revise the research and written documentation collected on the feeding of chub, bleak, spirlin, barbel and stream barbel in Croatia and in Europe. More important results on recent research done for each fish species in various waters in Europe are also presented in this paper...|$|E
50|$|B. barbus is native {{throughout}} {{northern and}} eastern Europe, ranging {{north and east}} from the Pyrénées and Alps to Lithuania, Russia and the northern Black Sea basin. It is an adaptable fish which transplants well between waterways, and has become established as an introduced species in several countries including Morocco and Italy. Its favoured habitats are the so-called <b>barbel</b> <b>zones</b> in fast-flowing rivers with gravel or stone bottoms, although it regularly occurs in slower rivers and has been successfully stocked in stillwaters.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of river alteration, ecologists are asked to develop tools for the {{assessment}} of river integrity. Fish are known to be good bioindicators of the ecological condition of rivers. The Loire basin (France) is often considered as relatively little impacted compared to most other large European systems. But curiously, no study clearly addressed the question of fish assemblages patterns in this system in order to assess this status. Thus, we studied fish assemblages along the river network in the Loire basin using self-organizing maps (SOMs) and we built a fish typology. Four basic assemblages were described and indicator species were identified. These assemblages varied in terms of individual species patterns as well as in terms of flow preference guilds and species richness. A discriminant analysis carried out on environmental variables revealed that they could be mainly determined by the slope, temperature and depth. Finally, fish assemblages were arrayed along a longitudinal gradient and roughly fitted the theoretical zonation expected in European rivers with the succession of brown trout (Salmo trutta fario), grayling (Thymallus thymallus), barbel (Barbus barbus) and bream (Abramis brama) zones in a downstream direction. Such patterns are still rarely observed in large European systems. However, the fish assemblage characteristic of the bream zone occurred more frequently than predicted on the basis of environmental variables. Such deviations between field data and theory suggest lotic-to-lentic shifts probably due to anthropogenic disturbances, especially in the grayling and <b>barbel</b> <b>zones.</b> In these river sectors, eurytopic and limnophilic species tend to replace rheophilic ones. Finally, the method used in this study to investigate fish patterns may be helpful to detect disturbances and may serve as a tool for the establishment of management plans...|$|R
40|$|In {{the south}} {{east of the}} Massif central, the Cevennes National Park covers the area along the {{dividing}} line between the Atlantic and Mediterranean catchment areas. The climatic conditions of these medium-sized mountains are very varied, {{with a high degree}} of seasonnality affecting the hydrologic regime of the rivers. The otter seems to have disappeared from that region around the 1960 's. Some years ago, evidence was found again ona regular basis in some of these rivers. From 1990, the evolution of this otter population has been monitored by systematic observation of their signe in the principal watercourses covering an area of about 3000 km². At the same time, a preliminary study of the diet (spraint analysis) has been undertaken. Otter signs have been first evidenced on the upper reaches of the rivers Tarn and Lot. In subsequent years, signs have been disovered on some tributaries and on a watercourse flowing to the Mediterranean side: the river Luech. In the river Tarn (upper <b>barbel</b> <b>zone),</b> the most frequent prey is the gudgeon, reaching more than 50 % of the total number of prey. However, when the biomass intake is considered, the barbel appears to play the major role, accounting for 46 % of the total food intake. The occurrence of the brown trout (11 %) and its relative biomass (18 %) are weak when compared with the composition of the river fish fauna (25 to 43 % of the estimated fish biomass) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the annual {{activity}} cycle and reproductive ecology of northern pike (Esox lucius L.) in the River Ourthe (Belgian Ardenne), 6 fish (579 - 742 mm FL, 1605 - 4090 g, 2 females and 4 males) were captured by electric fishing in November 2000 and January 2001. They were surgically implanted with a radio-transmitter and tracked for 149 to 349 days in a 30 -km river stretch. During the pre-spawning period in winter, most movements were between distinct holding areas spaced from 40 to 550 m. All the pike began the upstream spawning migration between 8 February and 30 March 2001, when the mean water temperature varied from 6. 7 °C to 8. 7 °C and the water flow from 52 to 199 m 3 s- 1. The six pike travelled upstream, over distances ranging from 0. 75 km to 15. 7 km to reach their potential spawning sites. Pike arrived on their potential spawning sites between the 13 February and the 02 April 2001 and remained there from 5 to 25 days when the daily mean water temperature ranged from 2. 9 to 10. 0 °C. The six pike moved downstream after spawning and showed similar behaviour to those observed prior to spawning, but the distances between holding areas were more extended than during the winter pre-spawning period. When considering the entire tracking period, the longitudinal extension of the activity domains ranged 1 421 to 24 798 m (mean 12, 050 m). This exploratory study provided original observations on northern pike movements in a <b>barbel</b> <b>zone</b> of the River Meuse basin. Results contrasted with the widely established view of pike being a sedentary predator and provides data on its behaviour throughout the annual cycle. Peer reviewe...|$|E
