5|$|At the Falls of Arcadia, {{a fictional}} planned {{community}} in San Diego County, California, disgruntled homeowner Dave Kline arrives {{at home to}} find a package from an unknown person. The package contains a tacky whirligig, which Kline puts on his roof to annoy the neighbors. While in <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> Kline hears an intruder in the house. He goes to investigate while his wife, Nancy, stays in bed. A mysterious creature attacks and kills the Klines.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before. He called the governors of Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi to warn them {{of the severity of}} the coming storm. He issued a special warning to Mayor Ray Nagin, telling him that some levees in the greater New Orleans area could be overtopped. Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News that he went to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W. Bush at his farm in Crawford, Texas about the severity of the storm.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> I overheard {{the three}} doctors {{tell my parents}} {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
60|$|It {{was rough}} but health-giving, {{as well as}} enjoyable, work, and sent us to our {{respective}} <b>beds</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> in a condition of readiness to fall promptly {{into a state of}} absolute oblivion.|$|R
60|$|They {{slept in}} {{comfortable}} <b>beds</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> although an empty twin bed stood beside each one they occupied. And {{in the morning}} they were served another excellent meal, after which the captains escorted them again to the twin palaces of the Ki and the Ki-Ki.|$|R
6000|$|I {{approached}} {{one of the}} Mexican {{women and}} asked if the senorita had risen. The woman started, and looked covertly round before she replied. Did not Don Pancho know that Miss Mannersley and her maid had not slept in their <b>beds</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> but had gone, none knew where? ...|$|R
25|$|Entwistle died in Room 658 at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 27 June 2002, one {{day before}} the {{scheduled}} first show of the Who's 2002 United States tour. He had gone to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> with a stripper/groupie, who woke that morning to find Entwistle cold and unresponsive. The Clark County medical examiner determined that his death was due to a heart attack induced by a cocaine overdose. His funeral was held at St Edward's Church in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, England, on 10 July 2002. He was cremated and his ashes were buried privately. A memorial service was held on 24 October at St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, London. Entwistle's huge collection of guitars and basses was auctioned at Sotheby's in London by his son, Christopher, to meet anticipated taxes on his father's estate.|$|E
2500|$|We {{had to keep}} a {{close watch}} on our actions... When one of us left a sneaker or pair of {{underpants}} lying around, he had to tie the offending object on a string and wear it around his neck until {{he went off to}} <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> Dad called it [...] "the Crosby lavalier". At the time the humor of the name escaped me...|$|E
2500|$|Phil {{tries to}} explain his {{situation}} to Rita, for whom he has feelings. To demonstrate his plight to Rita, he points out all the trivial actions of the various townsfolk he has memorized due to being stuck in the loop. Rita takes sympathy and they spend the entirety of one loop together, ending up falling asleep on Phil's <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> However, Phil still wakes up alone {{at the start of}} February 2. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to try to better himself and the lives of the townsfolks. Over many loops, he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French. After finding himself unable to prevent the death of a homeless man over several loops, he starts to arrange his actions throughout the day to avert similar [...] accidents and disastrous situations that otherwise would have occurred to the other Punxsutawney residents.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Kate, as we {{curled up}} on our brush <b>beds</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> [...] "there {{certainly}} is a special Providence for unprotected females. I'd forgive Peter Crow for deserting us {{for the sake of}} those Indians, if he hadn't stolen our lovely ham into the bargain. That was altogether unpardonable." ...|$|R
50|$|The English and French {{joined forces}} and {{attacked}} the Carib at night. The colonists killed between 100 and 120 Caribs in their <b>beds</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> {{with only the}} most beautiful Carib women spared to serve as slaves. The French and English set about fortifying the island against the expected invasion of Carib from other islands.|$|R
60|$|Very {{different}} {{were the}} feelings with which those two young girls stretched {{themselves in their}} <b>beds</b> <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> Margaret Rivers's innocent, happy little heart was taken up in one contemplation. Admiration, sympathy, and the exultation for him, which he would not feel for himself, drew little Meta entirely out of herself--a self that never held her much. She was proud of the slender thread of connection between them; she was confident that his vague fancies were but the scruples of a sensitive mind, and, as she fell sound asleep, she murmured broken lines of Decius, mixed with promises not to look.|$|R
60|$|As he {{was going}} to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> Dunstable met the house-master on the stairs.|$|E
60|$|So Elma went to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> {{trembling}} {{most for}} {{the result of}} Sir Gilbert's illness.|$|E
60|$|When Freda went to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> {{her mind}} was made up. She would adopt Jordan Slade's grave.|$|E
60|$|He went to <b>bed,</b> however, <b>that</b> <b>night</b> {{with the}} {{comfortable}} reflection {{that any such}} nonsense would be dissipated by the morning. But when the morning came--his morning, one P.M.--his feeling he found was the same. He could not see Miss Baker that day.|$|R
5000|$|All of the {{seriously wounded}} marchers were arrested, {{and many were}} chained to their {{hospital}} <b>beds.</b> <b>That</b> <b>night,</b> the offices of many Communist and Communist front organizations were raided in the Detroit area, and their leaders were arrested. There was a nationwide search for William Z. Foster, {{but he was not}} arrested. No law enforcement or Ford security officers were arrested, although all reliable reports showed that they were responsible for all of the gunfire. The New York Times reported that [...] "Dearborn streets were stained with blood, streets were littered with broken glass and the wreckage of bullet-riddled automobiles, and nearly every window in the Ford plant's employment building had been broken".|$|R
60|$|Una {{was living}} her boarding-school days now, at twenty-six. The {{presence}} {{of so many}} possible friends gave her self-confidence and self-expression. She went to <b>bed</b> happy <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> home among her own people, among the women who, noisy or reticent, slack or aspiring, were joined to make possible a life of work in a world still heavy-scented with {{the ideals of the}} harem.|$|R
6000|$|As {{she went}} to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> Marjorie looked at the red bank, the pretty picture, and the daisy crown, saying to herself,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Prince Otto of Saxe-Pfennig went to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> comfortably {{conscious}} {{of a good}} work well done. He saw his way now clear before him.|$|E
60|$|When Lucy went to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night</b> she did {{not doubt}} that Mr. Hamel had called, {{and that he had}} been turned away from the door.|$|E
60|$|You {{must not}} let the new idea of poor dear Landor efface the former image of the fine old man. I wouldn't blot him out, in his tender gallantry, as he sat upon <b>that</b> <b>bed</b> at Forster's <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> for a million of wild {{mistakes}} at eighty years of age.|$|R
5000|$|On November 1897, as {{her husband}} was on an {{expedition}} looking for gold, she had a premonition of her own death. When French returned on November 16, {{the next day she}} was fixing breakfast and said [...] "I don't feel too well" [...] and suffered a heart attack. A crowd of businessmen, Navajos and prostitutes kept vigil outside her home as she lay in <b>bed</b> dying <b>that</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{hotel was}} {{located on the}} {{northwest}} corner of Louisiana and Preston Streets and occupied the upper two floors of a three-story brick building, with a variety of businesses occupying the first floor. It was an inexpensive hotel near the city's bus depot, and reportedly had 87 beds, most divided from one another by thin wooden partitions, and 50 cots available for half the price of a <b>bed.</b> [...] <b>That</b> <b>night</b> the guest log showed 133 names registered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Liddy," [...] said Bathsheba, {{on going}} to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> [...] "I want you to call me at seven o'clock to-morrow, In case I shouldn't wake." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{slept in}} the dead sailor's <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> {{the only man in}} the fo'c's'le who did sleep properly, and turned out heavily and lumpishly in the morning for breakfast.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the night}} of 15 April 1998, {{two days before the}} 23rd anniversary of the Khmer Rouge {{takeover}} of Phnom Penh, the Voice of America, of which Pol Pot was a devoted listener, announced that the Khmer Rouge had agreed to turn him over to an international tribunal. According to his wife, he died in his <b>bed</b> later <b>that</b> <b>night</b> while waiting to be moved to another location. Ta Mok claimed that his death was due to heart failure.|$|R
5000|$|Smith died at {{his home}} in Horten {{of a heart attack in}} the early hours of May 1, 1943. His last words were, [...] "Yes, thanks and praise" [...] as he was {{retiring}} to <b>bed</b> earlier <b>that</b> <b>night.</b> Smith's funeral was by far the biggest seen in Horten, despite stringent travel restrictions that were in place due to the German occupation of Norway. In his eulogy, Smith's son, Aksel Johan Smith stated that he had never seen his father unrestful or impatient.|$|R
60|$|The acquaintanceship might, however, {{have ended}} in a slow forgetting, but for an {{incident}} which occurred {{at the end of}} the same week. One afternoon it began to freeze, and the frost increased with evening, which drew on like a stealthy tightening of bonds. It was a time when in cottages the breath of the sleepers freezes to the sheets; when round the drawing-room fire of a thick-walled mansion the sitters' backs are cold, even whilst their faces are all aglow. Many a small bird went to <b>bed</b> supperless <b>that</b> <b>night</b> among the bare boughs.|$|R
60|$|When Mr. Britling went to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> {{after a long}} gossip with Carmine {{about the}} Bramo Samaj and modern {{developments}} of Indian thought generally, the squirrel was still undiscovered.|$|E
60|$|That was {{an uncomfortable}} hour; {{for there was}} a big {{audience}} on the hurricane deck. When I went to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> I killed Brown in seventeen different ways--all of them new.|$|E
60|$|Ere Torfrida went to <b>bed</b> <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> {{there was}} a violent knocking. Angry as she was, she was yet anxious enough to hurry out of her chamber, and open the door herself.|$|E
5000|$|The {{creature}} approaches Frankenstein and begs him {{to create}} a female companion for him. Frankenstein agrees, but ultimately destroys this creation, aghast {{at the idea of}} a race of monsters. Enraged, the creature swears revenge; he kills Henry Clerval, Frankenstein's best friend, and promises Frankenstein, [...] "You have denied me my wedding night - I will be with you on yours!" [...] The creature keeps his promise by strangling Elizabeth on her matrimonial <b>bed.</b> <b>That</b> same <b>night,</b> Frankenstein's father dies of grief. With nothing else left to live for, Frankenstein dedicates his life to destroying the creature.|$|R
50|$|William Marble is a bank clerk {{living in}} south London, desperately worried {{about money and}} unable to control his wife Annie's spending. One evening without warning they are visited by his {{recently}} orphaned and very rich young nephew, James Medland, who has {{a large amount of}} cash on him. Unable to resist the opportunity put in his way, William Marble sends his wife to <b>bed</b> early <b>that</b> <b>night,</b> saying <b>that</b> he wants to talk business and suggests she pleads a headache so as not to seem unsociable. He then slips poison in his nephew's drink, the latter dies and William buries him in the back garden under cover of darkness <b>that</b> <b>night.</b>|$|R
60|$|Before {{the couple}} went to <b>bed,</b> <b>that</b> first <b>night</b> <b>that</b> they were rich, {{they had decided}} that they must celebrate. They must give a party--that was the idea. But how to explain it--to the daughters and the neighbors? They could not expose {{the fact that they}} were rich. Sally was willing, even anxious, to do it; but Aleck kept her head and would not allow it. She said that {{although}} the money was as good as in, it would be as well to wait until it was actually in. On that policy she took her stand, and would not budge. The great secret must be kept, she said--kept from the daughters and everybody else.|$|R
