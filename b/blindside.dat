5|$|McCaw {{predominantly}} {{played in}} the openside flanker position for the New Zealand, Crusaders and Canterbury teams, but also played as a <b>blindside</b> flanker and no. 8. During McCaw's career, Canterbury won the NPC (later ITM Cup) five times, and the Crusaders won four Super Rugby titles. As well as two world cups, the All Blacks won seven Tri-Nations titles, completed three successful Grand Slam tours and won the Bledisloe Cup eight times.|$|E
25|$|The flanker's role is {{to tackle}} the {{opposition}} and try to steal the ball. The openside flanker binds {{to the side of}} the scrum that covers the greatest area, while the <b>blindside</b> covers the side nearest the side-line. They bind loosely {{to the side of the}} scrum, but still play an important role in keeping the props tight by pushing at an angle. They should be the first forward to a breakdown from a scrum or line-out and are expected to link with the backline or secure the ball at the tackle. Both positions have a high workrate, meaning the players need to be fit, fast and good at reading the opposition's attacking plays. During open play if they have not made the tackle they usually stand in the loose next to the ruck or maul. This allows them to arrive quickly at the next tackle. The <b>blindside</b> is generally the larger of the two and usually acts as a third jumping option at the line-out. The openside flanker is usually faster than the <b>blindside,</b> with good opensides excellent at turning over the ball at the tackle. Teams often use their openside flankers to 'charge' the opposition fly-half, putting pressure on him and forcing him to rush his decision making, kicking or passing. <b>Blindside</b> flankers also have the task of stopping any attempt by the opposition eighth-man to run with the ball around the <b>blindside</b> of a scrum.|$|E
25|$|Following Flett's missed opportunity, the All Blacks went downfield. John Kirwan {{ran down}} the <b>blindside,</b> and fended Campese off at fullback, before {{slipping}} a pass to New Zealand halfback Graeme Bachop, who slipped under a Campese tackle-attempt to score the final try of the Test.|$|E

25|$|He was an {{outstanding}} openside flanker, and scored 13 international tries. Later in his career, {{and after his}} injuries had reduced the speed which characterised his early career, he played predominantly as a <b>blindside</b> flanker or number eight.

25|$|Tasman {{gained the}} halftime lead with a try and {{conversion}} from Andrew Goodman while Auckland could only score a penalty goal by Ash Moeke. Soon {{after the break}} Tasman scored their second try when Blair Cook took advantage of a <b>blindside</b> which Auckland failed to cover. Tasman were out 12 â€“ 3 with five minutes before winger Atieli Pakalani made a break through the Tasman defense then passed to hooker Pat Leafa to score the try. The conversion was missed and Tasman held on to win 12 points to 8 with their best defensive performance of the season.|$|E
25|$|Noctis' companions, while {{controlled}} by the game's artificial intelligence, can perform contextual commands. When Noctis successfully parries an enemy attack, or performs a Side Strike or <b>Blindside,</b> cooperative attacks {{between him and his}} companions called Link-strikes can be triggered. During battle, a meter called the Tech Bar fills. When full, Noctis can command his companions to perform special moves called Techniques: Gladiolus performs a sweeping attack with his sword, Ignis uses his daggers to mark enemies so Noctis can perform a warp strike attack, and Prompto uses his firearm to launch a flare that distracts enemies and damages Daemons. After each of these, Noctis can initiate a follow-up attack. Noctis can also trigger an Armiger Chain, where he splits his Royal Arms between his companions before launching a single attack.|$|E

25|$|The scrum-half is {{the link}} between the {{forwards}} and the backs. They receive the ball from the line-out and remove the ball {{from the back of the}} scrum, usually passing it to the fly-half. They also feed the scrum and sometimes have to act as a fourth loose forward. Along with the fly-half, they make many of the tactical decisions on the field. During general play, the scrum-half is generally the player who receives the ball from the forwards and passes it to the backs. They are good communicators, especially at directing the forwards around, and their aim is to provide the backs with clean ball. Good scrum-halves have an excellent pass, a good tactical kick and are deceptive runners. At defensive scrums they put pressure on the opposition scrum-half or defend the <b>blindside.</b> On defence in open play they generally cover for deep kicks after the ball has been passed wide. Traditionally, scrum-halves have been the smallest players on the team, but many modern scrum-halves are a similar size to the other players in the team.|$|E
500|$|Truthless Heroes was {{released}} in September 2002 and peaked at No.146 on the Billboard 200. Their first and only single, [...] "Hollow Again", peaked at No.35 on Mainstream Rock Tracks.

While lauded by critics for its pounding criticism {{of the media and}} entertainment industry, the album proved to be controversial, particularly the promotional website. The group performed with Taproot on their self-titled tour in fall 2002. In addition, they played shows with Thirty Seconds to Mars, Trapt, <b>Blindside,</b> Trust Company, Sevendust, and Finger Eleven.|$|E
500|$|The {{most notable}} {{omissions}} {{from the team}} were Dan Carter, Richard Loe, and Reuben Thorne. Daniel Carter was omitted due {{to the strength of}} Andrew Mehrtens and Aaron Mauger who occupied the first and second five-eighth positions respectively, and because he was regarded as [...] "the star of the next decade". Despite being considered one of Canterbury's best ever props, Richard Loe missed out as he was only in the team for the unsuccessful 1996 season. The former All Black captain Reuben Thorne was omitted due the quality of players in the lock and <b>blindside</b> flanker positions. The most unlikely inclusion was for Norm Berryman at right wing. Berryman was picked over Marika Vunibaka and Afato So'oalo due to his crucial tries late in the 1998 and 1999 seasons that helped the Crusaders qualify for the semi-finals. The team: ...|$|E

In 2008, McCaw told the IRB:"My main role as a flanker is, defensively, to tie in with the back line to ensure that the defence works well. On attack I think my primary role at first phase is to look after our ball. You attack the back line and I'm usually the first person there to make sure we secure that ball. Thirdly I put pressure on break downs and make sure I disturb their ball and try to turn their ball over." ...|$|E

Sonny Sandoval, lead singer of nu metal group P.O.D., appeared as a guest performer. The album was released in June 1998 and was well received. It sold over 50,000 copies to date and gained mainstream exposure on MTV shows Road Rules and The Real World. Project 86 was observed by Allmusic to be the [...] "most daring album at the time for its genre". The success of their debut made Project 86 a top seller for BEC/Tooth and Nail.

500|$|The [...] "Loser Must Bow" [...] {{match between}} the Junkyard Dog and Harley Race (with Bobby Heenan and [...] "The Queen of Wrestling" [...] The Fabulous Moolah) followed. Prior to the match [...] "Mean" [...] Gene Okerlund interviewed Heenan, Race, and Moolah backstage, where Moolah {{predicted}} that Junkyard Dog {{would have to}} bow to the King as {{he is supposed to}} do. Bobby then gave Moolah the crown and told her {{to put it on the}} King's head after the match, [...] "As only the Queen of Wrestling can do". Junkyard Dog came out to the ring to a big ovation in the Silverdome. During the match, the two battled back and forth, with Race even trying unsuccessfully to give the prone Dog a falling headbutt which naturally failed. Following this Race recovered enough to give the Junkyard Dog a belly to belly suplex when he was distracted by Bobby Heenan to get the win. Due to the pre-match stipulation, JYD did a little bow and then hit Race from the <b>blindside</b> with a steel chair to a rousing ovation from the crowd. After attacking Race, Junkyard Dog took the King's royal robe and left the ring with it in hand to a standing ovation.|$|E
500|$|In August 2005, Long {{suffered}} an ankle injury and was sidelined as the 2005 Michigan Wolverines football team's season began. [...] The injury had been caused {{in training camp}} when he was zone blocking alongside center Mark Bihl, who got tangled up with nose tackle Gabe Watson. [...] The two fell against the outside of Long's leg and rolled over it. [...] The injury required surgery. Long {{did not return to}} the lineup until October 22 on the third possession against the Iowa Hawkeyes. He was the lead blocker on the game-winning overtime touchdown. He started the game the subsequent week against the Northwestern Wildcats. [...] Two weeks later, following a bye week, Long got injured during the first half against the Indiana Hoosiers, and his foot was put in a protective boot. [...] The second foot injury was expected to end his season. [...] He appeared in the subsequent rivalry game against the Ohio State Buckeyes, and during the first play, he opposed Bobby Carpenter and Carpenter got a broken leg. After the game, Long appeared to need immediate surgery, which would have caused him to miss the 2005 Alamo Bowl. By the time of the game on December 28, though, he was ready to play. [...] As the team prepared for 2006 spring practice, the left-handed Long was moved from right tackle to left tackle where he would be protecting the <b>blindside</b> of right-handed quarterbacks.|$|E
500|$|Later in the season, Torres was {{suspended}} four games for a hit {{to the head}} of Edmonton Oilers forward Jordan Eberle during a game on April 6, 2011. Canucks general manager Mike Gillis told media that he [...] "strongly disagree with it", while Torres argued that he did not stick out his elbow or leave his feet to make the hit and that Eberle raised his hand in defence of the oncoming check, indicating {{that it was not a}} <b>blindside</b> hit. Eberle was not injured on the play. The suspension ended Torres' regular season as the Canucks had two games remaining. He finished with 14 goals and 29 points in 80 games. Returning for game 3 of the opening playoff round against the Chicago Blackhawks, Torres received further scrutiny around the league for a hit on defenceman Brent Seabrook. Although he received a minor penalty on the play, Torres did not receive further suspension from the league. Later in the game, Torres hit Seabrook a second time, taking the defenceman out of the next two games. Vancouver went on to win the series in seven games, before defeating the Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks en route to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. In the opening game of the fourth round, Torres scored the game-winner against the Boston Bruins with 19 seconds remaining in regulation. The Canucks eventually lost the series in seven games.|$|E

500|$|With 20 seconds {{remaining}} in the Lone Star Showdown versus the Aggies, McCoy was injured by a [...] "vicious, stadium-hushing tackle" [...] as Aggie defensive end Michael Bennett connected with his helmet against McCoy's upper body after McCoy had thrown an incomplete pass. Replays showed both {{on television and in}} the stadium revealed the hit might have included [...] "helmet-to-helmet" [...] contact which is illegal in NCAA football only if done intentionally, but no flag was thrown. When the replay was shown in the stadium, the Longhorn fans erupted in boos before lapsing back into silence as McCoy lay on the ground writhing for ten minutes before being taken off the field on a cart. Mack Brown said after the game [...] "I didn't see it, but it sounded like 88,000 (fans) thought it was dirty". Fellow Longhorn Selvin Young said he thought the hit was a clean [...] "textbook" [...] hit. McCoy was taken to University Medical Center Brackenridge where he spent more than three hours undergoing an evaluation that included an X-Ray, MRI, and a CAT scan. Longhorns trainer Kenny Boyd said the injury was a severe pinched nerve in McCoy's neck. Boyd said that McCoy was expected to make a full recovery, but no timetable was set for McCoy to return to play. The injury to McCoy came one game-clock minute after an A player, #91 Kellen Heard had been ejected from the game for vicious <b>blindside</b> block on McCoy after he threw an interception, which was ruled excessive. An X-Ray, MRI exam and CT scan showed [...] "no structural damage to McCoy's neck or shoulder".|$|E
