The former dense forests {{consisted}} mostly in Brazilian walnuts, Cedars, Cinnamons, Yerba maté, and the exuberant <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Pines.</b> These forests still represent the typical Southern Brazilian landscape in spite of ruthless deforestation in the past decades. A significant turnover in the economy took place due to the shortage of wood, implementation of Brazilian environmental laws and environmental consciousness. As a result, agriculture became the predominant source of wealth alongside the production of paper, cellulose, and furniture derived from extensive reforestation areas.

50|$|Several {{ecoregions}} cover {{portions of}} the state. In the northeastern corner of the state, between the Serra do Mar/Serra Geral and the Atlantic, lies the southern extension of the Serra do Mar coastal forests, a belt of evergreen tropical moist forests that extend north along the coastal strip as far as Rio de Janeiro state. The high plateau behind the Serra do Mar is occupied by the Araucaria moist forests, a subtropical forests characterized by evergreen, laurel-leaved forests interspersed with emergent <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Pines</b> (Araucaria angustifolia). The Paraná-Paraíba interior forests lie on the lower slopes of the plateau south and east of the Araucaria forests, including much of the lower basin of the Jacuí and its tributaries.

40|$|<b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine</b> (Araucaria angustifolia (Bert) O. Ktze) is {{the only}} native conifer species with {{economic}} importance in Brazil. Recently, due to intensive exploitation <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine</b> {{was included in the}} official list of endangered Brazilian plants, under the "vulnerable" category. Biotechnology tools like somatic embryogenesis (SE) are potentially useful for mass clonal propagation and ex situ conservation strategies of commercial and endangered plant species. In spite of that, numerous obstacles still hamper the full application of SE technology for a wider range of species, including <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine.</b> To enhance somatic embryogenesis in <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine</b> and {{to gain a better understanding}} of the molecular events associated with somatic embryo development, we analyzed the steady-state transcript levels of genes known to regulate somatic embryogenesis using semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (sqRT-PCR). These genes included Argonaute (AaAGO), Cup-shaped cotyledon 1 (AaCUC), wushel-related WOX (AaWOX), a S-locus lectin protein kinase (AaLecK), Scarecrow- like (AaSCR), Vicilin 7 S (AaVIC), Leafy Cotyledon 1 (AaLEC), and a Reversible glycosylated polypeptide (AaRGP). Expression patterns of these selected genes were investigated in embryogenic cultures undergoing different stages of embryogenesis, and all the way to maturation. Up-regulation of AaAGO, AaCUC, AaWOX, AaLecK, and AaVIC was observed during transition of somatic embryos from stage I to stage II. During the maintenance phase of somatic embryogenesis, expression of AaAGO and AaSCR, but not AaRPG and AaLEC genes was influenced by presence/ absence of plant growth regulators, both auxins and cytokinins. The results presented here provide new insights on the molecular mechanisms responsible for somatic embryo formation, and how selected genes may be used as molecular markers for <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine</b> embryogenesis.

40|$|The {{main task}} is to apply in the Araucaria angustifolia (<b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine)</b> biome, the multi-temporal change {{detection}} algorithm “RCNA multi-spectral”, using TM/Landsat- 7 and CCD/CBERS- 2 images. The study area is located in Central-South Paraná State, characterized by remnants of Mixed Ombrophilous Forest formations and by a traditional agricultural and cattle raising activities. The approach of change detection {{is based on the}} multivariate analysis (two spectral bands), with data from two sensor systems TM/Landsat image (8 th Aug., 1999) and CCD/CBERS- 2 (8 th Aug., 2006). The multi-spectral RCNA is based in angular parameters, those angles are calculated in function of the axis formed by the straight line of regression of those points labeled in the field survey as no-change. The image for detection was transformed from a continuous image (floating-point) to thematic, through a slicing and labeling process. Hence it is possible to discriminate five thematic classes: two related to degradation, two referring to regeneration and one of no-change. The change detection map shows: in the timeframe studied 10. 6 % of all area under study presents degradation patterns, derived from the clearcut activity, followed by changes of land use, with the complete removal the Mixed Ombrophilous Forest. In conclusion, we found out that the application of both multi-sensor and multi-spectral RCNA technique in <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Pine</b> landscape is robust and that the complex radiometric correction is not necessary. This simplifies the operational use of RCNA technique, demonstrating that the results can be adapted, considering the complexity of the area under study. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} MC on longitudinal, radial, and {{tangential}} ultrasonic wave velocity {{and on the}} respective terms of the stiffness matrix were examined for <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine</b> (Araucaria angustifolia) and cupiúba (Goupia glabra). The ultrasonic wave velocity tended to increase with a decrease in MC, {{and the effect of}} MC on the ultrasonic wave velocity below the FSP was greater than above. Below the FSP, the stiffness terms tended to decrease with increasing MC, but above the FSP, they increased with increasing MC because of the influence of water on the bulk density. This result may be corrected by using the effective density above FSP, which depends on the mobility of free water and differs for the two species...|$|E

50|$|There {{are various}} {{introduced}} plants within the Florida Keys. Many {{of these plants}} outcompete the original plants of the Keys, such as mangroves and seagrass. The animals who rely on native plants for food and habitat are also at risk by invasive plants. There are four main exotic plant species that have become so invasive in the Florida Keys that they threaten and endanger 42 native plant species and 27 animal species {{to the point of}} extinction.

50|$|Exotic {{plant species}} have also {{significantly}} affected tropical hardwood hammocks. At least 162 species of exotic plants are now known to invade tropical hardwood hammocks in South Florida (Appendix E). Impacts of exotic plant {{species have been}} particularly severe in hammocks on the Miami Rock Ridge. In some cases, exotic plants now compose 50 percent of the flora of hammock fragments on the Ridge. Vines, such as Gold Coast jasmine (Jasminum dichotomum), air-potato (Dioscorea bulbifera), and nephthytis (Syngonium podophyllum), have decimated many hammocks on the Miami Rock Ridge. Exotic trees and shrubs such as Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) are problematic in hammocks throughout South Florida, including undisturbed areas in Everglades NP. Coastal berm hammocks along the shores of Florida Bay have been heavily impacted by the sprawling vine-like shrub latherleaf (Colubrina asiatica). Recent GIS mapping of invasive exotics throughout the Florida Keys shows that approximately 2,833 ha of susceptible upland habitat have been invaded by exotic plants, especially Australian <b>pine,</b> <b>Brazilian</b> pepper and latherleaf (Kruer et al. 1998). Areas of disturbed substrate within and adjoining Keys hardwood hammocks are often heavily infested with exotic plants that are rapidly spreading into and displacing the natural plant community. Detailed exotics mapping projects (1:2400 scale) have been completed by the Florida Keys Environmental Restoration Trust Fund on North Key Largo and in the National Key Deer Refuge in the lower Keys. The EPPC (1997) has identified the most invasive plants in Florida, many of which occur in tropical hardwood hammocks. Hybrids between native and exotic plant species have also begun to appear (Hammer 1996, Sanders 1987), ultimately threatening native species with extirpation or extinction.|$|R
40|$|The {{germination}} {{of seeds}} of Araucaria angustifolia (<b>Brazilian</b> <b>Pine)</b> is generally {{a slow and}} fastidious process that causes loss of many seeds because of the incidence of pathogens.

The experimental design was completely randomized design with 100 pre-cut and 100 non-treated seeds. The experiment was installed twice, in 1998 and 1999, from fresh seeds. Pre-cut seed germination was higher: 92 and 95 % respectively, whereas whole seed germination was 60 and 64 % in the two experiments.

40|$|This {{study has}} shown that Eucalyptus tar and {{creosote}} {{can be used in}} phenolic adhesive formulations (resols) for wood products bonding. Some adhesives were prepared substituting 0; 17. 7; 35. 0 and 67. 0 % of the phenol by anhydrous tar and 0; 15. 0 e 28. 5 % by creosote. In gluing <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine</b> veneers, eucalypt tar and creosote based adhesives required longer pressing times for curing than conventional phenol-formaldehyde adhesives. By using 13 C NMR, the number of carbons in side chains and hydroxyl, carbonyl, carboxyl and methoxyl groups related to 100 aromatic rings could be estimated in tar and creosote. In creosote, after reaction with excess formaldehyde in alkaline medium, only 0, 28 hydroxymethyl groups was detected per phenolic ring. This low amount of hydroxymethylation explains the lack of reactivity in curing observed when creosote was introduced in a standard adhesive formulation...|$|E

40|$|GeLC-MS/MS based label free proteomic {{profiling}} {{was used}} in the large scale identification and quantification of proteins from <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine</b> (Araucaria angustifolia) embryogenic cell (EC) lines that showed different propensities to form somatic embryos. Using a predicted protein sequence database that was derived from A. angusafolia RNA-Seq data, 2398 non-redundant proteins were identified. The log(2) of the spectral count values of 858 proteins of these proteins showed a normal distribution, and were used for statistical analysis. Statistical tests indicated that 106 proteins were significantly differentially abundant between the two EC lines, and that 35 were more abundant in the responsive genotype (EC line SE 1) and 71 were more abundant in the blocked genotype (EC line SE 6). An increase in the abundance of proteins related to cell defense, anti-oxidative stress responses, and storage reserve deposition was observed in SEL Moreover, in SE 6 we observed an increased abundance of two proteins associated with seed development during the embryogenic cell proliferation stage, which we suggest is associated with genotypes showing a low responsiveness to embryo formation. Differences in protein abundance between the EC lines are discussed in terms of carbohydrate metabolism, cell division, defense response, gene expression, and response to reactive oxygen species.

40|$|<b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine</b> or araucaria (Araucaria angustifolia) is a {{coniferous}} tree with great economic, {{social and environmental}} importance in southern Brazil, being exploited for both wood production and for its edible pine nuts. However, no efficient cloning techniques are available and, therefore, {{the purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the effectiveness of vegetative rescue methods for cuttings propagation of the species. Shoots/cuttings were generated in two ways: 26 years old trees underwent coppicing and 20 years old trees had the primary branches on the upper third of crown pruned at 2, 20 and 50 cm from the main trunk. Orthotropic shoots were rooted after application of indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) at 0, 2, 4 and 6 g. L- 1. Coppicing produced 47 cuttings per plant with 90 % orthotropic shoots, while pruning resulted in 182 cuttings per plant with 44 % orthotropic shoots. Rooting success indexes were low with no influence of IBA, although they are slightly superior to the ones available in the literature for the species, ranging from 12 to 30 % for the coppice shoots and from 0 to 28 % for the branches shoots. We conclude that both vegetative rescue techniques are viable and have potentially important applications. Coppicing is recommended for the propagation aiming the production of wood, while shoots derived from the side branches of the crown are more appropriate for seeds orchards formation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Araucaria angustifolia (<b>Brazilian</b> <b>Pine</b> or Araucaria) is a {{potential}} native species to Brazilian forestry. However, a number of challenges and technical restraints still persist, making difficult its expansion as a species for forest plantations, among which the lack of cloning technologies evaluation in field conditions. So the present study aimed to evaluate the potential use of Araucaria plants produced by cuttings and grafting for wood production in comparison to those produced by seeds, by assessing field vigor and establishing a form factor for plantations with equivalent age. Plants from cuttings and seeds were planted in a 3 x 3 m spacing, {{being part of the}} last intended to be rootstocks for grafting. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three treatments and plots of a plant (one tree plot). Plants from cuttings had higher growth in diameter at breast height (7. 4 ± 2. 41 cm) and total height (4. 2 ± 1. 08 m) at 74 months after planting, followed by grafted plants and from seeds, with similar results. We conclude that cuttings and grafting are potential techniques for Araucaria plants formation for wood production, and, in particular, grafting is recommended by the easiness of in its application, besides the fact that it can be used for seed orchards formation and presents volumetric increase and form factor similar to seedlings...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{functional}} properties of native and acid-thinned pinhão (seeds of Araucária angustifolia, <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine)</b> starches were evaluated and {{compared to those}} of native and acid-thinned corn starches. The starches were hydrolyzed (3. 2 mol. L- 1 HCl, 44 ºC, 6 hours) and evaluated {{before and after the}} hydrolysis reaction in terms of formation, melting point and thermo-reversibility of gel starches, retrogradation (in a 30 -day period and measurements every three days), paste freezing and thawing stability (after six freezing and thawing cycles), swelling power, and solubility. The results of light transmittance (%) of pastes of native and acid-thinned pinhão starches was higher (lower tendency to retrogradation) than that obtained for corn starches after similar storage period. Native pinhão starch (NPS) presented lower syneresis than native corn starch (NCS) when submitted to freeze-thaw cycles. The acid hydrolysis increased the syneresis of the two native varieties under storage at 5 ºC and after freezing and thawing cycles. The solubility of NPS was lower than that of native corn starch at 25, 50, and 70 ºC. However, for the acid-thinned pinhão starch (APS), this property was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) when compared to that of acid-thinned corn starch (ACS). From the results obtained, {{it can be said that}} the acid treatment was efficient in producing a potential fat substitute from pinhão starch variety, but this ability must be further investigated...|$|E

40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} (SE) is {{a method}} for producing embryos in vitro and is considered a highly promising approach for micropropagation and germplasm conservation. However, the application of SE for genetic breeding and ex situ conservation of certain species, such as <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine,</b> faces several technical challenges, including the difficulty of inducing embryogenic cultures using tissues of mature trees, the loss of embryogenic competence of cell cultures and incomplete development of somatic embryos. In {{order to understand the}} genetic factors governing embryogenesis, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed to elucidate differences between distinct cell cultures, early zygotic and somatic embryos and, unorthodox seed developmental stages. A total of 64 GB of sequence derived from high-throughput Illumina RNA-seq profiling was used for de novo transcriptome assembly. The reference transcriptome resulted in 112, 772 predicted unigenes with an average length of 825 bp and an N 50 of 1, 638 bp. Sequence similarity searches using a public protein database revealed 19, 947 unigenes that could be annotated with gene descriptions and gene ontology terms. Analysis of differential gene expression allowed pinpointing of genes whose products are predicted to be involved in cell line embryogenic potential, early somatic embryo formation and unorthodox seed development. The results expand our understanding of the complex molecular events that control embryogenesis suggesting that the regeneration impairment of Araucaria angustifolia cultures is consequence of the auxin signaling failure. The generated data lay the foundation for future functional genomic and evolutionary studies that will advance the understanding of conifer biology and unorthodox seed physiology. P.

40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} is {{an important}} biotechnological tool in the large-scale propagation of elite genotypes and ex situ conservation of conifer species. Protocols for the induction and proliferation of embryogenic cultures (ECs) of <b>Brazilian</b> <b>pine</b> (Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze) are well established, although the proper formation of mature somatic embryos (SEs) is still problematic. Thus, the identification of molecular markers for the screening of ECs {{able to respond to}} maturation conditions (abscisic acid and osmotic agents) is highly desirable. To develop molecular markers for the early detection of ECs able to develop well-formed SEs under maturation conditions, we analyzed the proteins found during the proliferation phase of A. angustifolia cell lines with different embryogenic capabilities, with one cell line being responsive to maturation conditions (R cell line), and one cell line that presented blocked development of SEs (B cell line). In addition, based on the peptides identified, polyamine levels (free and conjugate), ethylene production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission were analyzed using both EC lines (R and B cell lines). A marked difference in the biochemistry of ECs between these two cell lines was observed. Eleven proteins that were differentially expressed in the cell lines were identified by the combination of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) and MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. Among these, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, the enzyme associated with polyamines and ethylene biosynthesis, was observed exclusively in the R cell line, while a protein linked to the oxidative stress subunit F of NADH dehydrogenase was observed exclusively in the B cell lines. Additionally, B cell lines showed higher levels of diamine putrescine and lower levels of ethylene. Higher values of ethylene and ROS were observed for the cell line that showed normal development of SEs. Altogether, our results open new perspectives in the optimization of culture conditions for A. angustifolia somatic embryogenesis, as well as establishing biochemical markers for the early selection of ECs during maturation trials.

40|$|A Floresta Ombrófila Mista vem sofrendo desde meados do século XIX uma drástica redução {{territorial}} no Brasil. Estima-se que esta fitofisionomia ocupe atualmente cerca de 1 a 4 % da sua cobertura original. Além disso o conhecimento acerca da estrutura, composição e dinâmica das florestas de araucária paulistas ainda é incipiente, tornando a conservação destes ecossistemas bastante crítica. Este trabalho encontra-se estruturado em três capítulos. O primeiro deles teve como objetivos avaliar a efetividade do reflorestamento puro de Araucaria angustifolia como estratégia de restauração florestal e os efeitos do fogo na composição florística e na estrutura deste reflorestamento. Para tanto, foram selecionados dois reflorestamentos com Araucaria angustifolia, de idade e condições ambientais semelhantes, denominados Reflorestamentos I e II (RI e RII). Em RI, não há histórico de perturbação por fogo a partir do plantio inicial em 1959 (testemunha). Já RII, implantado em 1958, foi submetido à queima acidental em julho de 2001. Para amostragem do estrato superior (CAP > 15 cm) foram alocadas 17 e 8 parcelas permanentes de 20 x 10 m nos reflorestamentos RI e RII, respectivamente. Em cada uma destas parcelas foram lançadas aleatoriamente cinco sub-parcelas de 1 x 1 m, para amostragem do estrato inferior (altura > 30 cm e CAP 15 cm), 17 and 8 permanent {{plots of}} 10 x 20 m was established on reforestations RI and RII, respectively. In {{each one of}} these plots five sub-plots of 1 x 1 m was randomly placed, in order to survey the under strata (total height > 30 cm and CBH < 15 cm). On reforestation RI was surveyed 836 trees and shrubs, belonging to 64 species, 44 genera and 31 families. On reforestation RII was sampled 175 individuals, belonging to 24 species, 20 genera and 16 families. The reforestation RI present significant highly values related to RII, on both strata, for density, dominance, richness and diversity. The diametric structure followed J-invert pattern, in both areas. Nevertheless, the fire reduced significantly the number of individual on the first&# 8217;s diameter classes. Then, the reforestation RII clearly still expresses the effect of burn, which was more severe to under strata. On the second chapter, the interests were to evaluate the floristic composition, diversity and structure of the upper and under stratas on a secondary forest stretch under Araucaria angustifolia, in Bananal Ecological Station, São Paulo, Brazil; and also avaliate the catalytic potential of this specie on colonization of human disturbed areas located in a well conserved forest matrix. The same previously described methodology was done, with a larger sample area, composed by 43 plots containing 5 subplots each one. Further more, the floristic survey was performed along the principals tracks inside the station, walking and on a pickup truck. On upper strata were surveyed 1856 trees and shrubs, belonging to 129 species, 79 genera and 45 families. On under strata were sampled 1024 trees and shrubs, belonging to 95 species, 58 genera and 33 families. Regarding the floristic and phytossociologic surveys, 200 species, belonging to 105 genera and 53 families was recorded. The Shannon Diversity Index (H´) was 3, 65 and 3, 55; estimated for upper and under stratas, respectively. They presented floristic similarity themselves (0, 29 e 0, 57 for Jaccard and Sorensen indices, respectively), sharing 64 species. The diametric structure of the community follows J-invert pattern, wich was not observed for <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Pine</b> population, pointing out the threathness of its maintanence on the community. In both areas under secondary succession evaluated, the species demonstrated potential for being used on restoration projects of human disturbed areas immersed on a well forest conserved matrix, even by monospecific plantations, refuting the norms established on resolution n° 08 / 2007 of the São Paulo Stadual Environmental Secretary. The autoecoloy of the species support the catalization of the secondary succession under its crown. The last chapter aimed to evaluate the floristic composition, diversity and structure of the upper and under stratas on a Mixed Ombrophyllous Forest stretch in Itaberá Ecological Station, Itaberá, SP, Brazil; and also avaliate the condition of Araucaria angustifolia population in terms of its conservation on the fragment and its relationships with the succesional stage. The same previously described methodology was done, with 50 plots containing 5 subplots each one. On upper strata were surveyed 1429 trees and shrubs, belonging to 135 species, 93 genera and 47 families, occupying a basal area estimated on 33, 97 m². On under strata were sampled 758 trees and shrubs, belonging to 93 species, 66 genera and 39 families. Regarding the floristic and phytossociologic surveys, 178 species, owned by 106 genera and 52 families was recorded. The Shannon Diversity Index (H´) was 4, 12 and 3, 5; estimated for upper and under stratas, respectively. They presented high floristic similarity themselves (0, 40 and 0, 57 for Jaccard and Sorensen indices, respectively), sharing 65 species. The cluster analysis signalized the stronger floristic influence of the close forest formations on the study area, related to the other Mixed Ombrophyllous Forests in south Brazil and Mantiqueira mountain range. The diametric structure of the community follows J-invert pattern. The extremely low density and multi-interruption of the Brazilian Pine´s diametric distribution hindered the adjust and test of the exponencial model. By floristic and structural criteria, the fragment was classified on advanced succesional stage. The absence of regenerating individuals, associated with scarce members on the smallers diameter classes and also the limited landscape conditions, point out the impossibility of this population to self-sustain on long term, inducing the local´s ecotype extinction, breaking the actual Brazilian official vegetation classification of the unit as Mixed Ombrophyllous Forest due to the loss of its definer species...|$|E
