40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} and understand the switching <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> magnetic <b>grains</b> in high density magnetic recording media, 1 Tbit per square inch and above, and by doing so to overcome the discrepancies between simulation and experimental results associated with the quantitative switching field and its applied field angle. This work will {{bridge the gap between}} the experiments and simulation results, by considering a realistic micromagnetic model of CoCrPt media thin films to study their magnetization reversal dynamicsat finite temperatures as a function of magnetic structure, interlayer coupling and thermal activation. The utility of a simplified one-grain model was investigated in describing the switching field of such media at finite temperatures. Together with experiments it is shown that thermal activation modifies the Stoner-Wohlfarth angle dependency of the switching field by reducing the depth of the minimum that occurs at 45 degrees. Whereas inter/intra granular exchange coupling introduces a clear shift in the angle of applied field at which the minimum switching field occurs. For the first time ever grain interface layers and grain boundaries interactions are explicitly considered in a descriptive micromagnetic model, the overall magnetization switching <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> such <b>grains</b> shows a deviation from Stoner-Wohlfarth like behaviour, highlighting their importance on the quantitative and qualitative value of the switching field.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the mechanical response of modern engineering alloys to complex loading conditions {{is essential for the}} design of load-bearing components in high-performance safety-critical aerospace applications. A detailed knowledge <b>of</b> how material <b>behaviour</b> is modified by fatigue and the ability to predict failure reliably are vital for enhanced component performance. Unlike macroscopic bulk properties (e. g. stiffness, yield stress, etc.) that depend on the average <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> many <b>grains,</b> material failure is governed by `weakest link'-type mechanisms. It is strongly dependent on the anisotropic single-crystal elastic-plastic behaviour, local morphology and microstructure, and grain-to-grain interactions. For the development and validation of models that capture these complex phenomena, the ability to probe deformation behaviour at the micro-scale is key. The diffraction of highly penetrating synchrotron X-rays is well suited to this purpose and micro-beam Laue diffraction is a particularly powerful tool that has emerged in recent years. Typically it uses photon energies of 5 - 25  keV, limiting penetration into the material, so that only thin samples or near-surface regions can be studied. In this paper the development of high-energy transmission Laue (HETL) micro-beam X-ray diffraction is described, extending the micro-beam Laue technique to significantly higher photon energies (50 - 150  keV). It allows the probing of thicker sample sections, with the potential for grain-level characterization of real engineering components. The new HETL technique is used to study the deformation <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>grains</b> in a large-grained polycrystalline nickel sample during in situ tensile loading. Refinement of the Laue diffraction patterns yields lattice orientations and qualitative information about elastic strains. After deformation, bands of high lattice misorientation can be identified in the sample. Orientation spread within individual scattering volumes is studied using a pattern-matching approach. The results highlight the inability of a simple Schmid-factor model to capture the <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>grains</b> and illustrate the need for complementary mechanical modelling...|$|R

Samples of the entire concentrate ingredients (WHO ingredients) and their different fractions (NWF, ISWF and SWF) were subjected to three processes (Retsch-milled (R), expander-treated (E) and expander-pelleted (EP) samples) and their fermentation characteristics were evaluated using an in vitro gas production technique. RESULTS: The E process increased {{the size of the}} NWF and decreased that of the SWF compared with the R process. The ISWF of R samples was very rich in starch. The maximum fractional rate of substrate degradation and maximum rate of gas production were higher in EP samples than in R samples (P < 0. 05). In maize and milo the E and EP processes shifted the pattern of fermentation towards a more glucogenic fermentation, as represented by a lower non-glucogenic/glucogenic ratio (NGR). In all grains the ammonia concentration (NH 3 -N) and branched chain ratio (BCR) of E and EP samples were significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than those of R samples.

The dynamic-to-static wall load ratio on the corrugated-wall bin was observed in a range from 1. 0 to 1. 14 which was lower than similar values for the smooth-wall bin which ranged from 1. 08 to 1. 3. No slip-stick frictional effects or upward friction force, which were observed for the smooth-wall bin, occurred in the corrugated-wall bin. Resultant moments of force showed similar characteristics in both bins with maximum values occurring for a discharge orifice eccentricity ratio of about 0. 7. The resultant moments for the corrugated-wall bin were approximately 3 times smaller than those measured for the smooth wall bin...|$|E

During mechanical loading, all four grains rotate and the mean rotation angle increases with austenite deformation.

40|$|Hot torsion {{testing of}} a C–Mn–V steel {{was used to}} study the {{evolution}} of  ultrafine ferrite (UFF) formation by dynamic strain-induced transformation (DSIT) in conjunction with air-cooling for two prior austenite grain sizes. This study evaluated not only the evolution of DSIT ferrite during straining, but also the <b>grain</b> growth <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> DSIT ferrite <b>grains</b> during post-deformation cooling. For both austenite grain sizes, the DSIT ferrite initially nucleated on/or near prior austenite grain boundaries {{at an early stage}} of transformation followed by the grain interiors. The prior austenite grain size affected the distribution of DSIT ferrite nucleation sites at an early stage of transformation and the subsequent coarsening <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> boundary (GB) and the intragranular ferrite (IG) grains during post-deformation cooling. For the fine prior austenite grain size, the distribution <b>of</b> DSIT ferrite <b>grains</b> was more homogenous compared with the coarse austenite and the coarsening occurred not only in the GB ferrite grains but also in the IG ferrite grains. However, the ferrite coarsening mostly occurred for the IG ferrite rather than the GB ferrite grains in the coarse austenite. The result suggests that normal grain growth occurred during the overall transformation in the GB ferrite grains for the coarse initial austenite grain size. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The {{substructure}} <b>of</b> {{a single}} <b>grain</b> in an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data map is studied, {{focusing on the}} influence <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> boundary configuration on the misorientation to the average <b>grain</b> orientation <b>of</b> data points close to the grain boundary. For most grain boundary segments {{a certain degree of}} linking between the misorientations to the average orientation <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> exists and large deviations from the average orientation <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> are observed close to the triple junctions of the boundary segments. Changes of the misorientation over one boundary segment are analysed and possible explanations for these variations are discussed.

Also the tendency <b>of</b> the <b>grain</b> boundary to lower its surface energy might have a significant influence on the misorientation profile and therefore on the subdivision <b>behaviour</b> <b>of</b> the <b>grains.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
