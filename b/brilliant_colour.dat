25|$|In the 20th century, it {{also became}} {{possible}} to own your own colour of blue. The French artist Yves Klein, {{with the help}} of a French paint dealer, created a specific blue called International Klein blue, which he patented. It was made of ultramarine combined with a resin called Rhodopa, which gave it a particularly <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour.</b> The baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers developed its own blue, called Dodger blue, and several American universities invented new blues for their colours.|$|E
25|$|Alma-Tadema's {{works are}} {{remarkable}} {{for the way}} in which flowers, textures and hard reflecting substances, like metals, pottery, and especially marble, are painted – indeed, his realistic depiction of marble led him to be called the 'marbellous painter'. His work shows much of the fine execution and <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour</b> of the old Dutch masters. By the human interest with which he imbues all his scenes from ancient life he brings them within the scope of modern feeling, and charms us with gentle sentiment and playfulness.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, {{bridging}} the gap between International Gothic and the Renaissance are the paintings of Fra Angelico, many of which, being altarpieces in tempera, show the Gothic love of elaboration, gold leaf and <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour.</b> It is in his frescoes at his convent of Sant' Marco that Fra Angelico shows himself the artistic disciple of Giotto. These devotional paintings, which adorn the cells and corridors inhabited by the friars, represent episodes {{from the life of}} Jesus, many of them being scenes of the Crucifixion. They are starkly simple, restrained in colour and intense in mood as the artist sought to make spiritual revelations a visual reality.|$|E

500|$|Wallace's main criticism, occupying {{half his}} lengthy review, was of Poulton's {{acceptance}} of sexual selection. He begins by stating [...] "Mr. Poulton fully accepts Darwin's theory of female choice {{as the source}} of the greater part of the <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour,</b> delicate patterns, and ornamental appendages that exist among animals, and especially among birds and insects." [...] Wallace then cites Poulton on the courtship behaviour of spiders: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a picture book for children, with the art {{dominating}} the text rather than illustrations supplementing the text, was an invention of the mid-19th century. According to Judith Saltman of the University of British Columbia, Evans' work as a printer of children's picture-books is particularly notable; she believes he printed the [...] "most memorable body of illustrated books for children" [...] in the Victorian era, and the three illustrators, whose works he printed, {{can be regarded as}} the [...] "founders of the picture-book tradition in English and American children's books". He considered full-colour printing a technique well-suited to the simple illustrations in children's books. Evans reacted against crudely coloured children's book illustrations, which he believed could be beautiful and inexpensive if the print run was large enough to maintain the costs. In doing so, Evans hired Walter Crane, Kate Greenaway and Randolph Caldecott as illustrators, all of whom became successful because of Evans' [...] "recognition, encouragement, and <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour</b> reproduction".|$|E

60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the throng in the Forum {{had become more}} and more dense.

60|$|Hermione Roddice came up, in a {{handsome}} gown of white lace, trailing an enormous silk shawl blotched with great embroidered flowers, and balancing an enormous plain hat on her head. She looked striking, astonishing, almost macabre, so tall, with {{the fringe of}} her great cream-coloured vividly-blotched shawl trailing on the ground after her, her thick hair coming low over her eyes, her face strange and long and pale, and the blotches of <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour</b> drawn round her.|$|E

50|$|Like the Rainbow and Itcha-Ilgachuz Ranges at {{the western}} end of the Chilcotin Plateau farther south, the range's name derives from the <b>brilliant</b> <b>colours</b> that are {{symptomatic}} from heavy mineralization comprising the material forming the range.|$|R
60|$|In {{the shady}} forest paths were many fine butterflies, most {{conspicuous}} among {{which was the}} shining blue Papilio ulysses, one of the princes of the tribe, though at that time so rare in Europe, I found it absolutely common in Amboyna, though not easy to obtain in fine condition, {{a large number of}} the specimens being found when captured to have the wings torn or broken. It flies with a rather weak undulating motion, and from its large size, its tailed wings and <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour,</b> {{is one of the most}} tropical-looking insects the naturalist can gaze upon.|$|E
60|$|Honor had truly been uneasy, {{fearing that}} Lucilla was walking, sitting down, or fasting imprudently; but the <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour,</b> the joyous eyes, and lively manner spoke wonderfully {{for the effects}} of native air. Mr. Prendergast had become more absent and awkward than ever, but his extra shyness passed unremarked, and Lucilla's tact and grace {{supplied}} all deficiencies without obtrusiveness. Always at home in the vicarage, she made none of her former bantering display of familiarity, but only employed it quietly to secure the guests having what they wanted, and to awaken the host to his duties, when he forgot that any one save herself needed attention.|$|E
60|$|She found them, an hour later, just {{finishing}} a rubber. Their languid post-mortem upon a curiously played hand was broken off upon her entrance. They made {{remarks about the}} storm and her ill-luck--had she been far from shelter? was she not terrified by the lightning? Lady Peggy remembered her gown. Deyes alone was silent. She felt him watching her all the time, taking cold note of her <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour,</b> the softer light in her eyes. She felt that he saw her as she was--a woman suddenly set free, even though for a few short hours. She had broken away from them all, and she gloried in it.|$|E

50|$|Erik Schmidt is {{a gifted}} portraitist, he also paints scenes {{and people from}} rural areas busy with their {{everyday}} toils. Erik Schmidt paints with Rubens' medium, based on the black oil and mastix solution, which allowed him to use paints with <b>brilliant</b> <b>colours</b> that blended well and had good drying qualities and which he has used ever since. His colours, which until his time in Paris had been the greys and ochres of the coastal scenes of his childhood in Estonia, plus the changing colours {{of the sky and}} the sea, are now enriched by more <b>brilliant</b> <b>colours</b> used by his fellow-students from India and from Arabic countries.|$|R
50|$|These {{are large}} noisy and {{conspicuous}} birds, but lack the <b>brilliant</b> <b>colours</b> of their relatives. They are mainly grey, {{with a long}} tail and an erectile head crest. They feed on fruit, especially figs, seeds and other vegetable matter.|$|R
60|$|In children, {{and even}} in adults who are not {{restrained}} by regard for appearances, a highly agreeable taste {{is followed by a}} smacking of the lips. An infant will laugh and bound in its nurse's arms {{at the sight of a}} <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour</b> or the hearing of a new sound. People are apt to beat time with head or feet to music which particularly pleases them. In a sensitive person an agreeable perfume will produce a smile; and smiles will be seen on the faces of a crowd gazing at some splendid burst of fireworks Even the pleasant sensation of warmth felt on getting to the fireside out of a winter's storm, will similarly express itself in the face.|$|E
60|$|We have endeavoured {{slightly}} to sketch St. Geneviève {{as it appeared}} to our friends from Beaumanoir, winding into the valley the day after Mr. Lyle had dined with them. The valley opened for about half-a-mile opposite the mansion, which gave to the dwellers in it a view over an extensive and richly-cultivated country. It was through this district that the party from Beaumanoir had pursued their way. The first glance at the building, its striking situation, its beautiful form, its <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour,</b> its great extent, a gathering as it seemed of galleries, halls, and chapels, mullioned windows, portals of clustered columns, and groups of airy pinnacles and fretwork spires, called forth a general cry of wonder and of praise.|$|E
60|$|So {{while the}} bees with their honey-bags, like the {{financier}} with his money-bags, are storing up {{profit for the}} composite community, the butterfly, on the contrary, lays himself out for an agreeable flutter, and sips nectar where he will, over large areas of country. He flies rather high, flaunting his wings in the sun, {{because he wants to}} show himself off in all his airy beauty: and when he spies a bed of bright flowers afar off on the sun-smitten slopes, he sails off towards them lazily, like a grand signior who amuses himself. No regular plodding through a monotonous spike of plain little bells for him: what he wants is <b>brilliant</b> <b>colour,</b> bold advertisement, good honey, and plenty of it. He doesn't care to search. Who wants his favours must make himself conspicuous.|$|E
50|$|About 900 mummy portraits {{are known}} at present. The {{majority}} {{were found in}} the necropoleis of Faiyum. Due to the hot dry Egyptian climate, the paintings are frequently very well preserved, often retaining their <b>brilliant</b> <b>colours</b> seemingly unfaded by time.|$|R
