500|$|Noise testing during 1996 and 1997 {{found that}} the {{hydrodynamic}} noise signature—the noise made by a submarine passing through the water—was excessive, particularly at high speed. The shape of the hull was the main cause: although a scale model of the design had been tested during the funded study and {{was found to have}} a minimal signature, the hull shape was changed after the contract was signed, primarily by a [...] lengthening of the submarine and a redesign of the bow dome to accommodate the larger-than-expected main sonar and reduce its blind spot (the baffles). The design had not been retested, as who would pay for this could not be agreed on. Propeller cavitation, caused by water flow over control surfaces onto the propeller at certain speeds, was the other main noisemaker. Cavitation had not been a problem with earlier Swedish submarine designs or during early testing of the Type 471 design, but the propeller had to be redesigned late in the process to provide more power, and like the redesigned hull, was not retested. During the years 2000, an unusual meeting took place with a next door neighbor (Francis 'Frank' Smith)of the then HMAS Stirling Naval Base commander. He was an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (originally trained at Government Aircraft Factories Fisherman's bend) who had been aware of the fluid dynamics issues of the Collins class for some time, purely by interest and observation on television. After a lengthy discussion, he was invited to discuss and demonstrate where possible, his observations at the Stirling Naval Base with Navy and DSTO staff who were there at that time as part of an investigative group. He showed on a white board, the aerofoil issue with the Dorsal – Sail conning tower structure showing that the Cord ratio (Length to Width) was too short and that severe turbulence / cavitation would be generated by such a design. This was demonstrated again on the white board using Aircraft aerofoil wing shapes as a basis for the discussion. That the turbulence / cavitation generated would, by natural rearward flow, move down the rear upper surface deck of the hull and be drawn into the propeller. He was also able to demonstrate that the design of the bow section would not pass a flow test for generated turbulence / cavitation, with the change in shape from circular bow section to long hull, being ill-conceived. He made several recommendations during the lecture that would be cost effective and possible. 1) To lengthen and taper the dorsal fin and create a more streamlined integration of the Dorsal to Flat upper Hull deck section. and 2) To 'fill in' the hollow section of hull aft of the bow curvature. Both these could be achieved with Carbon Fibre or Fibreglass covers as no load <b>bearing</b> <b>strength</b> would be required. Subsequent studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organization showed that the submarine's hull shape, particularly the redesigned sonar dome, the fin, and the rear of the submarine, focused the displaced water into two turbulent streams; when the seven propeller blades hit these streams, the propeller's vibration was increased, causing cavitation. These problems were fixed by modifying the casing of the submarine with fiberglass fairings.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation on}} single shear bolted connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures {{is described in}} this paper. A non-linear finite element model (FEM) is developed and verified against test results. It is shown that the FEM can accurately predict the <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> and failure modes of the tested specimens. A parametric study on the <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of 182 single shear bolted connections at 7 different temperatures was performed using the verified FEM. Bearing factors that included the effects of elevated temperatures were proposed for the <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of single shear bolted connections with and without considering bolt hole deformation. The <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of single shear bolted connections of thin sheet steels obtained from the tests and finite element analysis (FEA) were compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the deterioration of material properties at elevated temperatures.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on bolted and screwed connections of thin sheet steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for bolted and screwed connections of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear bolted connections, double shear bolted connections and single shear screwed connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of bolted connections as well as the tilting and <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of bolted connections as well as design equations for tilting and <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of screwed connections were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of bolted connections as well as the tilting and <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of screwed connections obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of bolted connections as well as the tilting and <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures than the current design rules. The reliability of the current and proposed design rules was evaluated using reliability analysis.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} projects had a {{layer of}} streambed stones arranged as a foundation, upon which the adobes were placed. Later, stone and masonry were used for foundation courses, which greatly added to the bearing capacity of the brickwork. [...] Aside from superficial leveling, no other ground preparation was done before construction started. There is some evidence {{to indicate that the}} initial structures at some of the outposts were produced by setting wooden posts close together and filling the interstitial spaces with clay. At completion, the building would be covered with a thatched roof and wall surfaces would be coated with whitewash to keep the clay exterior from eroding. This type of construction is known as [...] "wattle and daub" [...] (jacal to the natives) and eventually gave way to the use of adobe, stone, or ladrillos. Even though many of the adobe structures were ultimately replaced with ones of piedra or brick, adobe was still employed extensively and was the principal material used in building the missions as there was an almost universal lack of readily-available stone. The adobes were laid in courses and cemented together with wet clay. Due to the low <b>bearing</b> <b>strength</b> of adobe and the lack of skilled brick masons (albañils), walls made of mud bricks had to be fairly thick. The width of a wall depended mostly on its height: low walls were commonly two feet thick, while the highest (up to thirty-five feet) required as much as six feet of material to support them.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{a failure}} {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} to determine <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> of mechanically fastened joints with single bolt in glass–epoxy laminated composite plates. Two different geometrical parameters that were the edge distance-to-hole diameter ratio (E/D) and plate width-to-hole diameter ratio (W/D) were investigated. For that reason, E/D ratio was selected from 1 to 5, whereas W/D ratio was chosen from 2 to 5. Tensile tests were subjected to composite bolted joints for four different ply orientations such as angle-ply [0 / 30]s, [0 / 45]s, [0 / 60]s, and cross-ply [0 / 90]s. The major focus {{of this study was}} to observe the failure mechanisms of bolted joints under various preload moments as 0, 2. 5, and 5 Nm. The experimental results showed that the magnitudes of <b>bearing</b> <b>strengths</b> in bolted joints were strictly influenced from increasing value of applied preload moments, changing ofW/D and E/D ratios, and also ply orientations of laminated composite plates...|$|R
40|$|Analytical seismic {{response}} of multi-storey buildings isolated by lead–rubber bearings (LRB) is investigated under near-fault motions. The superstructure is idealized as a linear shear type flexible building. The force–deformation behaviour of the LRB is modelled as bilinear with viscous damping. The governing {{equations of motion}} of the isolated structural system are derived and the {{response of}} the system to normal component of six recorded near-fault motions is evaluated by step-by-step numerical method. The variation of top floor absolute acceleration and bearing displacement of the isolated building is plotted under different system parameters such as superstructure flexibility, isolation period and <b>bearing</b> yield <b>strength.</b> The comparison of results indicated that for low <b>bearing</b> yield <b>strength</b> there is significant displacement in the bearing under near-fault motions. In addition, there also exists a particular value of the yield strength of the LRB for which the top floor absolute acceleration of the building attains the minimum value. Further, the optimum <b>bearing</b> yield <b>strength</b> is derived for different system parameters under near-fault motions. The criteria selected for optimality are the minimization of both the top floor acceleration and the bearing displacement. The optimum yield strength of the LRB is found to be in the range of 10 %– 15 % of the total weight of the building under near-fault motions. In addition, the response of bridge seismically isolated by the LRB is also investigated and found that there exists a particular value of the <b>bearing</b> yield <b>strength</b> for which the pier base shear and deck acceleration attain the minimum value under near-fault motions. © Elsevie...|$|R
