The ratio μ E / μ R of true median survival times is the parameter of interest. This is of considerable interest in clinical trials of generic drugs. We think of the ratio m E / m R of the sample medians as a point estimate of the ratio μ E / μ R. We use the Fieller-Hinkley distribution of the ratio of two normally distributed random variables to de rive an unbiased level- α test of inferiority null hypothesis, which is {{stated in terms of}} the ratio μ E / μ R and a pre-specified fixed non-inferiority margin δ.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose was}} to examine the {{maternal}} influences on the development of infant oral biofim and dominant bacterial strains of at risk populations. Methods: The study used a cross-sectional design to examine factors influencing biofilm colonization and the identification of bacterial strains transmitted from mother to child. Participants were enrolled in Children’s Health Involving Parents of Greater Richmond (CHIP). Plaque and saliva samples were collected from mothers and their children ages 6 - 36 months. The colonized oral bacteria strains of the mother infant dyads were then compared. Oral bacterial strain identification was completed using the HOMIM Forsythe microbe identification array. Examination for concordant strains was done using the statistical <b>boot</b> <b>strap</b> shuffle in Excel. Results: Forty-one CHIP families were involved in the pilot study. Participants were predominantly non-white, less than high school education 46. 3 %, and their average age was 29. 1 years.

40|$|PURPOSE: 	The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the subgingival bacterial biodiversity in untreated chronic periodontitis patients through the use of next generation 16 S rRNA molecular analysis, and to determine similarities or differences between deep and shallow pockets within the same patients. METHODS: 	The analysis involved paired subgingival plaque samples from 24 subjects diagnosed with Generalized Moderate to Severe Chronic Periodontitis. One sample was selected from a single site having a probing depth 3 ̆e 5 mm (i. e. Deep Site), and the other from a site with a probing depth 3 ̆c 3 mm (i. e. Shallow Site) within each subject. Bacterial DNA amplification of the V 4 -V 6 region of the 16 S rRNA was performed. The amplicons were sequenced via 454 Roche Genome Sequencer FLX System. The identified sequences were evaluated, and then compared to calculated false discovery rates. RESULTS: 	A total of 119 independent microbial genera were identified within the samples analyzed. Seven genera were identified to be statistically significant (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in their association to deep or shallow sites following t-test and <b>boot</b> <b>strap</b> randomization: Actinomyces (p= 0. 004), Methylobacterium (p= 0. 028), Veillonella (p= 0. 028), and Rothia (p= 0. 038), and Streptococcus (p= 0. 033) in Shallow sites; while Mycoplasma (p= 0. 007) and Fusobacterium (p= 0. 016) were associated with deep sites. However, taking into account the calculated false discovery rates, it is suggested that none of the 119 microbial genera identified in this study were significantly associated with either deep nor shallow sites. CONCLUSION: The microbial genera identified within this study to be associated with deep and shallow sites follows the traditional pattern anticipated from the literature.

40|$|The {{growth of}} the {{freshwater}} prawn industry has not reached its great heights compared to the marine shrimps because of agriculturists’ innate fear of disease that will hamper the {{growth of the}} industry. High concentrations of infectious microorganisms (yeast, viruses and bacteria) in crustaceans during hot and cool seasons have resulted in a huge decline in prawn farming. Vibriosis, early mortality syndrome (EMS) and gastroenteritis due to zoonotic outbreaks have been a major threat to the rapid expanding production of freshwater prawns. The innate immune defense which leads to a lot of possible solutions needs to be thoroughly investigated for in-depth understanding of the defense mechanism of these prawns. This thesis investigates one of them namely the coagulation cascade which is a key mechanism in the invertebrate immune defense for avoiding loss of hemolymph particularly the clotting protein which activates a concatenate enzymatic reaction with the proPO system which leads to the production of the black-brownish pigments called melanin. In the current study, the putative clotting protein gene (CP gene) was sequenced from the fresh-water prawn transcriptome unigenes using Illumina’s Solexa sequencing technology. The putative clotting protein gene consisted of 5609 base pair with an open reading frame (ORF) length of 5139 bp. Putative CP encoded polypeptide has an estimated molecular mass of 189. 9 k Da and 1712 amino acids with a predicted isoelectric point of 5. 44. The deduced amino acid sequences of the clotting protein gene were aligned with other CP family members indicating the highest sequence similarity with A 7 YIH 6 (Penaeus japonicus clottable protein), B 5 KMA 2 (Penaeus monodon clottable protein), Q 9 U 572 (Penaeus monodon hemolymph clottable protein), A 8 DR 94 (Litopenaeus vannamei hemolymph clottable protein) and Q 9 UAR 3 (Pacifastacus leniusculus clotting protein). DNAstar protein analysis showed that M. rosenbergii CP is a protein with a hydrophilic structure and good antigenicity index. Analysis using PROSITE to identify the domains on the CP protein showed that positions 81 to 782 corresponds to the vitellogenin domain and positions from 1439 to 1635 correspond to the VWFD domain. Neibor–Joining phylogenetic tree of Clotting protein based on the vitellogenin domain of organism group ranging from invertebrate to vertebrate constructed on the basis of Poisson model and built at a <b>boot</b> <b>strap</b> of 1000. The tree represents tr_Q 9 UAR 3 (Pacifastacus leniusculus clotting protein) as the closest ancestral protein.

According to the outcome of the gene expression analysis, the mRNA transcription of the clotting protein gene in Vibrio parahaemolyticus challenged Macrobrachium rosenbergii was significantly induced in the stomach. The overall results of the current study indicate that the CP is without doubt an essential immune gene involved in the immune response against V. parahaemolyticus infection in Macrobrachium rosenbergii...|$|E

The Singularity would enable machines to become infinitely intelligent, and would pose an [...] "incredibly dangerous scenario". McAllester estimates a 10 percent probability of the Singularity occurring within 25 years, and a 90 percent probability of it occurring within 75 years. He appeared on the AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures in 2009:, and considers the dangers of superintelligent AI worth taking seriously: [...] I am uncomfortable saying that we are ninety-nine per cent certain that we are safe for fifty years...That feels like hubris to me. [...] He was later described as discussing the Singularity at the panel in terms of two major milestones in artificial intelligence: [...] 1) Operational Sentience: We can easily converse with computers.2) The AI Chain Reaction: A computer that <b>boot</b> <b>straps</b> itself to a better self.
