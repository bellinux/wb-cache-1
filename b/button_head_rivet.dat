A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round <b>head</b> <b>rivet,</b> taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these rivets use rivet strength figures measured with the mandrel removed.|$|R

40|$|TAP/NDE (Thermo-Acousto-Photonic {{nondestructive}} evaluation) {{has been}} developed {{to the point where}} it is possible to confidently explore many different application areas. One area of interest is the inspection of defects around rivet holes and under <b>rivet</b> <b>heads.</b> This problem is of concern not only from a safety point of view in aging aircraft, but also has major economic implications. For example, a heavy “C” check for a Boeing 707 requires the physical removal, inspection and replacement of many thousands of structural fasteners. Of the various types of <b>rivets</b> the round <b>head</b> <b>rivet</b> hole was chosen for this preliminary analysis (Fig. 1). Since it is not known how Lamb waves interact with an in situ rivet, we have chosen to restrict this analysis to the simplest possible case where there is no rivet in the hole. This corresponds to the current practice of removing the rivet and then using eddy current probes to inspect the hole. Our goal is to develop an inspection technique that does not require the physical removal of the rivet. The buried in-plane defect study was undertaken to provide real time, on-line detection of flaws during the processing of the material to prevent these flaws from causing in-service, premature rivet hole degradation. This inspection would prevent flawed materials from entering service...|$|R

40|$|December 2006. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable riveting parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, rivet diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed rivet. The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> The results demonstrate that the correct formation of <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the countersunk <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|R
