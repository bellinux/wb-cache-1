The Pope, having prayed lately for rain and got it, proceeds now, in the end of September, while such war-rumors are still at their height in Rome, to pray, or even do a Public Mass, or some other so-called Pontificality, [...] "in the Chapel of Philip Neri in the New Church," [...] by way of still more effectual miracle.

50|$|A Fugitive From the Past (Kiga Kaikyo) (1965) is {{considered}} his masterpiece. Adapted from the novel Kiga Kaikyo (1962) by Tsutomu Minakami and often compared to Kurosawas High and Low (1963), this examination of criminal life in post-war Japan is split into three sections: the criminal on the run, an interlude with a prostitute, {{and the final}} confrontation with police. The grainy widescreen cinematography results from Uchida’s unusual choice to shoot in 16mm and <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 35mm.

5000|$|Many {{contemporary}} critics had {{a similar}} opinion. A review in the Correspondance litteraire noted that Diderot's work was disjointed and discursive. Another review in the Annee Litteraire first targeted Seneca by noting that {{there had never been}} a single instance of Seneca opposing Nero or confronting Nero with the crimes he had committed. The critic then went on to target Diderot: [...] M. Diderot knows no other style than that of the ode or epic. His weightiest dissertations are always animated by some Pindaric outbursts.

5000|$|Chief Petty Officer Ronald Apps later recalled: In July 1940, I {{joined a}} Royal Fleet Auxiliary tanker - the War African - that was {{anchored}} off Sheerness for {{an idea that}} I have always assumed was thought up by Churchill. These tankers were filled up with fuel oil and there were mines and detonators down in the holds. The idea was that we would run them over to Boulogne and {{about five or six}} miles out of the harbour, we would set the controls and lash them - with the boilers going full bore - and run them into Boulogne harbour and let them <b>blow</b> <b>up,</b> <b>to</b> destroy the potential German invasion fleet. It was called Operation Lucid and we spent four weeks preparing. We practised setting the controls and evacuating the ship with two speedboats alongside us which had been commandeered from Southend. These speedboats were remarkable things. They could go at 35 or 40 knots and the idea was that at the blowing of a whistle, we had to rush down, get in the boats and we were away. Those four weeks were a bit hairy because the tanker was full up with fuel oil when it came to us and it was primed and ready to explode and there were air raids at night. When you're in a tanker, sitting on all this explosive material and the Germans are coming over and dropping bombs, it's not very ... shall I say 'sleep inspiring' experience.
