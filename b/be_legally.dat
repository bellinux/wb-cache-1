5|$|Kenyatta's {{government}} {{was eager to}} control the country's trade unions, fearing their ability to disrupt the economy. To this end it emphasised various social welfare schemes over traditional industrial institutions, and in 1965 transformed the Kenya Federation of Labour into the Central Organization of Trade (COT), a body which came under strong government influence. No strikes could <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> carried out in Kenya without COT's permission. Under Kenyatta, Kenya's first university—the University of Nairobi—was established, with several others following after.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the {{abolition}} of slavery was felt quickly. When the Thirteenth Amendment became operational, the scope of Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation was widened to include the entire nation. Although the majority of Kentucky's slaves had been emancipated, 65,000–100,000 people remained to <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> freed when the Amendment went into effect on December 18. In Delaware, where a large number of slaves had escaped during the war, nine hundred people became legally free.|$|E
5|$|Contact with {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{would raise}} legal questions, {{such as the}} rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes. Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied human rights, so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> owned and killed. If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Mallards {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} of ducks hunted as a sport. The ideal location for hunting mallards is considered to be where the water level is somewhat shallow. Hunting mallards might cause the population to decline in some places, at some times, and with some populations. In certain countries, the mallard may <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> shot but is protected under national acts and policies. For example, in the United Kingdom, the mallard is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which restricts certain hunting methods or taking or killing mallards.|$|E
5|$|Some municipalities, {{particularly}} in South Jersey, are dry towns where no alcohol can <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> served or sold. Some {{of them are}} dry because of their origins as Quaker, Methodist, or other Protestant religious communities. For example, the seaside resort town of Ocean City has been dry since {{it was founded in}} 1879 by four Methodist clergymen. In recent years, several municipalities have questioned whether they ought to remain dry. Dry towns frequently have public referendums on whether they should remain dry or allow liquor sales in order to attract new businesses and increase property tax revenue.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} ways that the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to the quarterback in {{a process known as}} the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.|$|E

One of the psychiatrists, Dr. Joel Fort, investigated his juvenile {{records and}} the diagnosis {{that he was}} once psychotic. He also interviewed Kemper, including under truth serum, and relayed to the court that Kemper had engaged in cannibalism, alleging that Kemper sliced flesh from the legs of his victims, then cooked and consumed these strips of flesh in a casserole. Nevertheless, Fort determined that Kemper was fully cognizant in each case, and stated that Kemper enjoyed {{the prospect of the}} infamy associated with being labeled a serial killer.|$|E
5|$|Flag-of-convenience {{registries}} are criticized, {{mostly by}} trade union organizations based in developed countries, {{especially those of}} Europe. On the other hand, maritime industry practitioners and seafarers from other countries contend {{that this is a}} natural product of globalisation. Seafarers from developed countries must make themselves competitive if they wish to take advantage and practice in a global environment. , thirteen flag states have been found by international shipping organizations to have substandard regulations. A basis for many criticisms is that the flag-of-convenience system allows shipowners to <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> anonymous and difficult to prosecute in civil and criminal actions. Some ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime, offer substandard working conditions, and negatively impact the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. , ships of thirteen flags of convenience are targeted for special enforcement by countries that they visit. Supporters of the practice, however, point to economic and regulatory advantages, and increased freedom in choosing employees from an international labor pool.|$|E
5|$|Grand Prix {{motorcycle}} {{racing is}} the premier championship of motorcycle road racing, {{which has been}} divided into three classes since 1997: 125cc, 250cc and MotoGP. Former classes that have been discontinued include 350cc, 50cc/80cc and Sidecar. The premier class is MotoGP, which was {{formerly known as the}} 500cc class. The Grand Prix Road-Racing World Championship was established in 1949 by the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and is the oldest motorsport World Championship in existence. The motorcycles used in MotoGP are purpose built for the sport, and are unavailable for purchase by the general public because they cannot <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> ridden on public roads. From the mid-1970s to 2002, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke. Rule changes were introduced in 2002, to facilitate the phasing out of two-stroke engines.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, the UNTAC {{administration}} had banned forest logging and timber exports, a major industry and source of foreign earnings. In October 1993, Ranariddh issued {{an order to}} lift the ban on a temporary basis so as to allow trees that were already felled to be exported for timber. The Khmer Rouge still controlled large tracts of forests in the regions of western and northern Cambodia bordering Thailand, and helped finance its operations by selling timber to Thai forestry companies The Cambodian government was unable to impose its will in Khmer Rouge territory, and was eager to regain the logging revenues. In January 1994, Ranariddh and Hun Sen signed a bilateral agreement with Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. The agreement provided for felled trees to <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> exported to Thailand on a temporary basis until 31 March 1994. The agreement also arranged for specially-designated customs zones to be created within Thai territory, which allowed Cambodian custom officials to inspect the logs and collect export duties.|$|E
5|$|In Alaska, {{the gray}} wolf {{population}} {{is estimated at}} 6,000–7,000, and can <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> harvested during hunting and trapping seasons, with bag limits and other restrictions. As of 2002, there are 250 wolves in 28 packs in Yellowstone, and 260 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho. The gray wolf received Endangered Species Act (ESA) protection in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan in 1974, and was re-classed from endangered to threatened in 2003. Reintroduced Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and, as of late 2002, number 28 individuals in eight packs. A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County, Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times. DNA analysis by Fish and Wildlife laboratories showed genetic characteristics {{similar to those of}} wolves in the Great Lakes Region.|$|E
5|$|Jogaila was duly baptised at the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków on 15 February 1386 {{and from}} then on {{formally}} used the name Władysław or Latin versions of it.

He was also to <b>be</b> <b>legally</b> adopted by Jadwiga's mother, Elizabeth of Bosnia, so retaining the throne in the event of Jadwiga's death. The royal baptism triggered the conversion of most of Jogaila's court and noblemen, as well as mass baptisms in Lithuanian rivers, a beginning of the final Christianization of Lithuania. Though the ethnic Lithuanian nobility were the main converts to Catholicism—both paganism and the Orthodox rite remained strong among the peasants—the king's conversion and its political implications created lasting repercussions for the history of both Lithuania and Poland.|$|E
