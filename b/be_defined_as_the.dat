5|$|Instead {{of solving}} {{for the two}} hyperbolas, Newton {{constructs}} their directrix lines instead. For any hyperbola, the ratio of distances from a point Z to a focus A and to the directrix is a fixed constant called the eccentricity. The two directrices intersect at a point T, and from their two known distance ratios, Newton constructs a line passing through T on which Z must lie. However, the ratio of distances TZ/TA is also known; hence, Z also lies on a known circle, since Apollonius had shown that a circle can <b>be</b> <b>defined</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> set of points that have a given ratio of distances to two fixed points. (As an aside, this definition {{is the basis of}} bipolar coordinates.) Thus, the solutions to Apollonius' problem are the intersections of a line with a circle.|$|E
