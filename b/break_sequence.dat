40|$|The {{relative}} {{size and}} location of prosodic phrase boundaries provides an important cue for resolving syntactic ambiguity. In previous work, we have introduced an analysis/synthesis formalism for scoring parses {{in terms of the}} similarity be-tween prosodic patterns recognized from a given utterance and synthesized for the hypothesized parse. This paper de-scribes a new approach to the synthesis problem, as well as an alternative scoring criterion. Specifically, a decision tree is designed to predict prosodic phrase structure for a given syntactic parse, and the tree is used to compute a parse score, which now is the probability of the recognized <b>break</b> <b>sequence.</b> Unlike the rule-based synthesis algorithm used in the previous work, the decision tree can be automatically trained and can therefore be designed specifically for differ-ent speaking styles or task domains. In experiments with a corpus of ambiguous sentences spoken by FM radio announc-ers, we have achieved isambiguation performance similar to the rule-based algorithm, which is close to the performance of human subjects in perceptual experiments using the scoring algorithm with hand labeled breaks. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of the Taiwan mountain belt {{is thought to be}} that of an imbricate thrust and fold belt developed in a forward <b>breaking</b> <b>sequence</b> above a shallowly dipping basal detachment. In recent years, however, a growing amount of seismicity data from the internal part of the mountain belt indicates the existence of widespread fault activity in the middle and lower crust, suggesting that deeper levels of the crust must be involved in the deformation than predicted by the shallow detachment, imbricate thrust belt model. To address this issue, we present new geological mapping, together with earthquake focal mechanism and seismic energy release data from the central part of Taiwan. We concur with the interpretation that the foreland basin part of the Western Foothills comprises an imbricate thrust system that is developing as a forward <b>breaking</b> <b>sequence</b> that is structurally and kinematically linked to a basal detachment at between 7 and 10 km depth. To the east of the foreland basin, however, in the Hsuehshan and Central Ranges, our data show the presence of two fault systems. An earlier, inactive thrust system with a well-developed cleavage is cut by a system of steeply dipping active faults that penetrate to a depth of 25 to 30 km or more. In the Hsuehshan Range, the second fault system is best represented by a structural and kinematic model in which this part of the mountain belt forms a zone of transpression with a structural architecture similar to that of a crustal-scale positive flower structure. Eastward, in the Central Range, Mesozoic basement rocks are over thrusting strongly folded and cleaved deep water sediments of the first, now inactive, thrust system. The involvement of deep crustal levels and Mesozoic basement in the second fault system is suggestive of the reactivation of preexisting basin-bounding faults that were located on the Eurasian continental margin.

40|$|The {{optimized}} linear δ-expansion {{is applied}} to multi-field O(N 1) × O(N 2) scalar theories at high temperatures. Using the imaginary time formalism the thermal masses are evaluated perturbatively up to order δ 2 which considers consistently all two-loop contributions. A variational procedure associated with the method generates nonperturbative results which are used to search for parameters values for inverse symmetry breaking (or symmetry nonrestoration) at high temperatures. Our results are compared with the ones obtained by the one-loop perturbative approximation, the gap equation solutions and the renormalization group approach, showing good agreement with the latter method. Apart from strongly supporting inverse symmetry breaking (or symmetry nonrestoration), our results reveal the possibility of other high temperature symmetry breaking patterns for which the last term in the <b>breaking</b> <b>sequence</b> is O(N 1 − 1) × O(N 2 − 1).

50|$|Though <b>sequence</b> <b>breaking</b> as {{a concept}} has existed almost since the {{inception}} of computer games complex enough to have sequential storylines, apparently the first documented action in a video game to be called a <b>sequence</b> <b>break</b> occurred in the Nintendo GameCube game Metroid Prime, in a thread called “Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus”. In the game, the rock monster Thardus was designed to be a required boss before the Gravity Suit and the Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. When a gamer named Steven Banks achieved this feat on January 18, 2003, he posted his discovery on the Metroid Prime message board on GameFAQs. The thread attracted a number of interested gamers, and the term <b>sequence</b> <b>breaking</b> was incidentally coined. The term has since grown in popularity and is now often applied to unintended shortcuts in any game.|$|R

Specically we look at the recognition of play and <b>break</b> <b>sequences</b> in football and the segmen-tation of football games based on these two events. Recognising relatively simple semantic events such as this is an important step towards full automatic indexing of such video material. These ex-periments were done using approximately 3 hours of data from two games of the Euro 96 competition. We propose that modelling the audio and video streams separately for each sequence and fusing the decisions from each stream should yield an accurate and robust method of segmenting multi-modal data...|$|R
