5|$|The Square Enix staff {{decided to}} develop Dream Drop Distance after being {{impressed}} {{by the quality of}} the Nintendo 3DS. Taking advantage of the console's functions, they increased the action elements from the series based on the system previously seen in Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep. Additionally, both the gameplay and the plot are meant to give a glimpse about what the following title in the series, Kingdom Hearts III, will <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> <b>The</b> game has been well received in Japan and in the US, selling over 250,000 and 180,000 units on its debuts respectively.|$|E

25|$|Further inroads {{came with}} the {{founding}} of a new school for the training of Western style music instructors in 1924, renaming the Istanbul Oriental Music School as the Istanbul Conservatory in 1926, and sending talented young musicians abroad for further music education. These students include well-known Turkish composers such as Cemal Reşit Rey, Ulvi Cemal Erkin, Ahmet Adnan Saygun, Necil Kazım Akses and Hasan Ferit Alnar, who {{became known as the}} Turkish Five. The founding of the Ankara State Conservatory with the aid of the German composer and music theorist Paul Hindemith in 1936 showed that Turkey in terms of music wanted to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> West.|$|E

No matter how many times the Logan family shuns him, he never stops trying to be their friend, like a stray dog who follows them.

25|$|According to Sigmund Freud, {{being unable}} to accept the illness of her child, Victoria ended up {{distancing}} herself from her first-born, which made {{a great impact on}} the behaviour of the future William II. However, other authors, such as the historian Wolfgang Mommsen, insist that the Crown Princess was very affectionate with her children. According to him, Vicky wanted her children to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idealised figure of her own father and tried, as best she could, to follow the educational precepts of Prince Albert. In 1863, Victoria and Frederick bought a cottage in Bornstedt so that their children could grow up in an environment similar to that of Osborne House. However, Victoria's influence on her offspring had an important limitation: like all the Hohenzollerns, her sons received a military training from a very young age, and the Crown Princess feared that such education would undermine their values.|$|E

25|$|When {{membership}} and activity {{was at a}} peak in the period after the Second World War, renowned Party speaker Tony Turner began giving lectures for the Party on what socialism would <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> <b>The</b> content of these lectures led him to develop a position that caused enormous controversy in the Party by the early to mid-1950s and which was elaborated by Turner and his supporters in articles in the Party's internal discussion journal of the time, Forum. A series of acrimonious disputes between the ‘Turnerites’ {{and the majority of}} the Party culminated in a Party referendum and then a resolution being carried at the 1955 Party Conference to the effect that all members not in agreement with the Declaration of Principles be asked to resign. Turner, having survived a previous attempt to expel him, promptly did so, along with a number of other members including Joan Lestor (later to become a Labour minister) and the psychologist John Rowan. Some of these ex-members formed a short-lived Movement for Social Integration, though, ironically enough, the impact the dispute had on the Party as a whole was almost entirely disruptive and negative. Indeed, it didn’t recover its vitality for some years, until the wave of radicalisation that grew up in the 1960s.|$|E

M2M described their second album as [...] "organic pop", as they used all real instruments in recording, while most pop albums use computerised ones.|$|E

500|$|The Egyptians {{distinguished}} nṯrw, [...] "gods", from rmṯ, [...] "people", but {{the meanings}} of the Egyptian and the English terms do not match perfectly. The term nṯr may have applied to any being that was in some way outside the sphere of everyday life. Deceased humans were called nṯr because they were considered to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> gods, whereas the term was rarely applied to many of Egypt's lesser supernatural beings, which modern scholars often call [...] "demons". Egyptian religious art also depicts places, objects, and concepts in human form. These personified ideas range from deities that were important in myth and ritual to obscure beings, only mentioned once or twice, that may {{be little more than}} metaphors.|$|E

In early 1947, factories suspended production for want of coal. The United States had abruptly terminated [...] Lend-Lease when the war ended. In its place was a $3.75 billion loan from the United States and a $1.25 billion loan from Canada, most of which had been spent by August 1947.

[...] Similarly, James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "Radio" [...] seems to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> latest electro-pop confection from Rihanna.

500|$|Frank Langella {{was cast}} as Louis Zabel. His death [...] "ultimately leads the {{characters}} {{to discover the}} shady practices" [...] of James's bank. Susan Sarandon portrays Sylvia Moore, Jacob's real-estate agent mother who is just as consumed by greed as Gekko is, but in a different sense. Audrey, a [...] "tough, intelligent trader in the Wall Street trenches", is portrayed by Vanessa Ferlito. John Buffalo Mailer plays Jacob's Long Island financier friend, Robby and Eli Wallach plays the part of Jules Steinhardt, a Churchill Schwartz top executive and Wall Street patriarch who considers the current economic climate to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 1929 stock market crash.
