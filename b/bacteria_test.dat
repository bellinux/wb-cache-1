25|$|The {{organization}} Riverkeeper collects {{samples in}} three Pocantico River tributaries. The river downstream of Pocantico Lake is a habitat for brown trout. The river is stocked each spring; 540 brown trout were stocked in 2013, and 630 were anticipated {{to be stocked}} in the river in 2014. After a <b>bacteria</b> <b>test</b> completed on October 4, 2014, the river {{was found to have}} an Enterococcus bacteria count of greater than 2420, indicating high amounts of fecal matter in the water. Other tests of the river quality {{at the mouth of the}} river in Sleepy Hollow also contain high levels of Enterococcus bacteria. In fact, the high bacteria counts throughout the river were taken both after wet and dry weather. Dry weather tends to result in lower bacteria counts because less flooding results in less overflow from sewage treatment plants. The high levels of bacteria in the river resulted in beach advisories for the entire river. In 2014, $9.9 million was put aside to repair the Tarrytown sewage treatment plant in order to improve water quality in the region.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Australian Leptospermum species had {{roles as}} {{traditional}} bush medicines for Australian Aborigines, including uses as antiseptic agents. Despite this ethnobotanical usage, the antimicrobial properties of Leptospermum spp. {{have not been}} rigorously studied. Methods: The antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of Leptospermum bracteata and Leptospermum juniperium leaves and flowers were investigated by disc diffusion and growth time course assays against a panel of bacteria and fungi. Toxicity was determined using the Artemia franciscana nauplii bioassay. Results: L. bracteata leaf and flower extracts inhibited the growth 36 % and 50 % of the <b>bacteria</b> <b>tested</b> respectively. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were equally affected by L. bracteata leaf extract. Of the 11 Gram-negative <b>bacteria</b> <b>tested,</b> 4 (36 %) were inhibited by L. bracteata leaf extract compared with 1 of the 3 Gram-positive <b>bacteria</b> <b>tested</b> (33 %). The L. bracteata flower extract was more selective with Gram-positive bacteria being more susceptible. Of the 14 Gram-negative <b>bacteria</b> <b>tested,</b> 4 were inhibited by L. bracteata flower extract (29 %) compared with 100 % of the Gram-positive <b>bacteria</b> <b>tested.</b> L. juniperium extracts were less effective antibacterial agents than were the L. bracteata extracts. L. juniperium leaf extract inhibited the growth of 36 % of the <b>bacteria</b> <b>tested</b> compared to only a single bateria (7 %) being inhibited by the flower extract. Gram-positive bacteria (100 % inhibited) were more susceptible to L. juniperium leaf extract than were Gram negative bacteria (18 % inhibited). No growth inhibitory activity was seen for any Leptospermum extract towards any of the fungi tested. The antibacterial activity of L. bracteata flower and L. juniperium leaf extracts was further investigated by growth time course assays which showed significant growth inhibition in cultures of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Aeromonas hydrophilia within 1 h. Conclusions: The low toxicity of these Leptospermum extracts and their inhibitory bioactivity against a panel of bacteria validate Australian Aboriginal usage of Leptospermum bracteata and Leptospermum juniperium as antiseptic agents and confirms their medicinal potential.
