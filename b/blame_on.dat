5|$|Admiral Parker and General Clinton {{engaged in}} a war of words after the battle, each seeking to cast the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> the other for the expedition's failures. Although Clinton was not blamed by the government, popular opinion held him responsible, and Parker was lauded for his {{personal}} bravery.|$|E
5|$|A naval {{board of}} inquiry was {{appointed}} shortly afterwards that determined {{the cause of}} the collision was of a lack of seamanship by the captain and watch officers of the ship. The Justice Minister, Kobie Coetsee, subsequently introduced a retrospective change in law to allow him to hold an inquest into the death of the only crewman whose body was found. The inquest lasted a year and apportioned <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> the captain and PWO.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, Arsenal {{fans were}} {{originally}} {{blamed for the}} violence as the police had fixed <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> them. In Turkey, the media portrayed Galatasaray fans as acting in self-defence, with criticism directed at the British fans for allegedly attacking members of the press. However, there were conflicting reports, with claims that some Galatasaray fans were instigating some of the violence. Later on, British media blame also transferred towards Galatasaray fans.|$|E

5|$|Shankar is {{an orphan}} {{raised by a}} sincere police officer named Raja Rao. His son Bharath accidentally kills a kid and Shankar takes the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> him. Shankar is imprisoned and Raja Rao warns him not to meet him again. After graduating, Shankar is {{employed}} as a circle inspector of police. He is popularly referred to as 'Encounter' Shankar because of his track record as an encounter specialist.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Tsar Alexander I laid all the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> M. I. Kutuzov, Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, it {{is clear}} that Kutuzov's plan was to retreat farther to the rear where the Allied Army had a sharp {{advantage}} in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, they might have been reinforced by Archduke Charles's troops from Italy, and the Prussians might have joined the coalition against Napoleon. A French army {{at the end of her}} supply lines, in a place which had no food supplies, might have faced a very different ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz. This essentially was Kutuzov's successful strategy in 1812, after the Battle of Borodino.|$|E
5|$|Alboin came to {{the throne}} {{after the death of}} his father, {{sometime}} between 560 and 565. As was customary among the Lombards, Alboin took the crown after an election by the tribe's freemen, who traditionally selected the king from the dead sovereign's clan. Shortly afterwards, in 565, a new war erupted with the Gepids, now led by Cunimund, Thurisind's son. The cause of the conflict is uncertain, as the sources are divided; the Lombard Paul the Deacon accuses the Gepids, while the Byzantine historian Menander Protector places the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> Alboin, an interpretation favoured by historian Walter Pohl.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} deaths {{as a result of}} the Colorado labor war were 2 strikers and at least 17 strikebreakers and {{non-union}} men. Another 15 strikebreakers died in a hoist accident in the Independence mine, which mine owners <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> union sabotage, and the union <b>blamed</b> <b>on</b> poor maintenance and inadequate safety practices.|$|R

5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to determine the cause of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{travel to}} New York City to party with Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak). Ryan starts acting erratically, {{and it is}} {{revealed}} that he is {{under the influence of}} drugs. Meanwhile, the remaining employees are going to be forced to work on a Saturday. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) proposes that they work late on Friday, so {{they do not have to}} come in the next day. Once Jim and his co-workers finish working, they find that they are locked in, and everyone quickly places the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> Jim.|$|E
5|$|Lad {{is accused}} of killing eight sheep owned by a neighbor. When the Master refuses to believe the accusations, they are taken to court where the neighbor's farmhand testifies that he saw Lad kill two of the sheep. The Master {{successfully}} shows the improbability of a single dog carrying off six sheep in two nights and that the two dead sheep left behind were clearly cut with a knife, not teeth. After Lad is given a 24-hour parole, the Master asks the judge to accompany him to the neighbor's house that night, where they discover that the farmhand was actually stealing the sheep, then killing one from each batch to put the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> Lad.|$|E

5|$|The Israeli embassy {{suffered}} {{a terrorist attack}} on March 17, 1992. It was perceived {{as a consequence of}} Argentina's involvement in the Gulf War. Although Hezbollah claimed responsibility for it, the Supreme Court investigated several other hypotheses. The Court wrote a report in 1996 suggesting {{that it could have been}} the explosion of an arms cache stored in the basement. Another hypothesis was that the attack could have been performed by Jewish extremists, in order to cast <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> Muslims and thwart the peace negotiations. The Court finally held Hezbollah responsible for the attack in May 1999.|$|E
5|$|By 20 December, {{arrangements}} for the delivery of emergency food and water supplies were made and expected to reach Carnarvon later that day. Supplies were also sent to outlying Aboriginal communities affected by the floods. After evacuating on 20 December, residents were {{allowed to return to}} their homes two days later in Carnarvon. However, most were left without power and clean water and required assistance from local agencies. Following the disaster, there were concerns that the Australian government could have prevented at least some of the floods by following through with a flood mitigation program. Dudley Maslen, the President of The Shire of Carnarvon stated that he did not want to place <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> any agency, though hoped for improvement during the future. More than 100 local government areas and regions were declared natural disaster areas on 21 December, encompassing areas from central Western Australia to the Pilbara coastline.|$|E
5|$|Farel and Calvin {{then went}} to Bern and Zurich to plead their case. The {{resulting}} synod in Zurich placed most of the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> Calvin for not being sympathetic enough toward the people of Geneva. It asked Bern to mediate {{with the aim of}} restoring the two ministers. The Geneva council refused to readmit the two men, who then took refuge in Basel. Subsequently, Farel received an invitation to lead the church in Neuchâtel. Calvin was invited to lead a church of French refugees in Strasbourg by that city's leading reformers, Martin Bucer and Wolfgang Capito. Initially, Calvin refused because Farel {{was not included in the}} invitation, but relented when Bucer appealed to him. By September 1538 Calvin had taken up his new position in Strasbourg, fully expecting that this time it would be permanent; a few months later, he applied for and was granted citizenship of the city.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collision}} Prime Minister Menzies ordered a Royal Commission {{to investigate the}} event. The Commissioner concluded that {{the collision}} was primarily the fault of Voyagers bridge crew not maintaining an effective lookout, but also placed <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> Melbournes Captain John Robertson (who resigned shortly after) and two other officers for failing to alert Voyager or take effective measures to avoid collision. The handing of the Royal Commission was seen as poor, and after a combination of public pressure and claims that Stevens had a drinking problem, a second Royal Commission was announced: the only time two Commissions have been held for the same incident. The second Royal Commission found that Stevens was likely medically unfit for command, {{that some of the}} first Commission's conclusions were therefore incorrect, and the Melbourne officers were not at fault. The two commissions caused great anguish in the hierarchy of the RAN, which was not accustomed to such tight scrutiny, and led to the eventual dismantling of the Naval Board's isolation from the civilian world.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{an alien}} race called Mimics arrives in Germany to storm and conquer {{continental}} Europe, decimating the human populations along the way. In 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF) achieves one solid {{victory over the}} Mimics at Verdun. In Britain, General Brigham, head of the UDF, commands Major William Cage, a public affairs officer with no combat experience, to cover a massive assault on France. Cage objects and threatens to put the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> Brigham should the invasion result in failure - as a result, Cage is tasered and arrested for disobeying orders, and transported to Heathrow Airport, turned into a military base. Awakened and demoted to private, he is disillusioned when he is assigned to misfit J squad {{under the command of}} Master Sergeant Farell.|$|E
5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The new engine system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, feeling that she {{would not be able to}} integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers the message to be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to pin the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a panel on the ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported out before the ship enters the slipstream.|$|E

5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was trying to put the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by saying that he had never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E
5|$|Relinquishing his {{position}} with the Navy Office in 1962, Becher {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom as Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in London. In January 1964 he returned to Australia, and was made Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet. During his time in this role Becher became embroiled in the controversy that followed the collision of HMA Ships Voyager and Melbourne, which took place in February that year. Prior to giving evidence before the Royal Commission that had been established to investigate the incident, Becher had discussed events with Melbournes Commanding Officer, Commander Ronald Robertson. The discussion became public knowledge, and led to suggestions of conspiracy. Becher stated to the commission that Melbourne should have questioned Voyagers final movements; his evidence is alleged to have influenced the Royal Commissioner, Sir John Spicer, to place a degree of <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> Robertson. In 1965, Becher assumed his final command as Flag Officer-in-Charge East Australia Area, before retiring from the Royal Australian Navy on 6 March 1966.|$|E
5|$|The band of robbers, now at home, {{are about}} to start {{splitting}} their stolen goods equally, when the police barge in. While three of the robbers are subdued after a fight, one manages to make his escape via a window and ends up on the roof. The two policeman chase the criminal, who eludes them by jumping from rooftop to rooftop. After the robber jumps down to the street, he runs toward the railroad station and boards a departing train. The police officers arrive but are too late, as the robber has left. The officers tell the train dispatcher to send a telegram to the next station, informing them of the fugitive and asking them to catch {{him as soon as}} possible. When the train reaches the next station, the burglar exits the train and unknowingly runs right into the path of policemen. With all four of the robbers caught, they are sentenced to forty years in jail. While doing work in the jail's quarry, the group review their failure, with each robber pinning the <b>blame</b> <b>on</b> another.|$|E
