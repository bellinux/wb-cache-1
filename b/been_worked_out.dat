5|$|The site {{reverted to}} private {{ownership}} after the war. As the quarry {{had long since}} <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out,</b> it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The quarry itself remained in almost the same condition {{as it had been}} in 1944, with sections of railway track still in place on the quarry floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{started in}} December 1971 at Morgan Studios, London. Unlike {{previous}} albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial {{section of the}} album had <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> when the band went into the studio. The remainder of the suite was written during the recording sessions. To compensate {{for a lack of}} material, Anderson got up early each morning to prepare music {{for the rest of the}} band to learn during that day's session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.|$|E
5|$|Testing was, however, able to {{continue}} in the meantime, as Platt-LePage had re-negotiated the XR-1 contract to cover a second flight-test aircraft. Built to a revised and improved version of the XR-1's design and designated XR-1A, the second aircraft had flown {{for the first time in}} May 1943. The XR-1A featured a revised cockpit covering compared to that of the XR-1, with the area of glazing being increased for improved visibility, and the pilot and observer's positions being reversed, the pilot now seated in the rear cockpit. During flight testing the XR-1A was found superior in flight performance to the XR-1; however, the controls were still proving troublesome, although the worst of the bugs did seem to have <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

5|$|The basic backing {{track was}} {{recorded}} at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes on 6 May 1969. Recording started at 3pm {{and went on}} until 4am the next morning. McCartney sang lead and played piano, Lennon played an Epiphone Casino guitar, George Harrison played a Fender Telecaster guitar fed through a Leslie speaker, and Ringo Starr played drums. The group recorded 36 takes, selecting take 30 as the best, which {{was made into a}} rough stereo mix. The basic structure of the song as it appeared on Abbey Road had not <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> at this stage, and the original recording ran onto a loose jam session, ending up as a fast rock-and-roll instrumental towards the end.|$|E

25|$|Because ammonites {{and their}} close {{relatives}} are extinct, {{little is known}} about their way of life. Their soft body parts are very rarely preserved in any detail.

25|$|There is a {{very good}} reason for {{skepticism}} regarding the repeated claims that the one unique problem of psychology, applicable across the entire discipline, has been identified and that the ToK System solves it.

25|$|Hemerythrin {{is another}} iron-containing oxygen carrier. The oxygen binding {{site is a}} binuclear iron center. The iron atoms are coordinated to the protein through the {{carboxylate}} side chains of a glutamate and aspartate and five histidine residues. The uptake of O2 by hemerythrin is accompanied by two-electron oxidation of the reduced binuclear center to produce bound peroxide (OOH−). The mechanism of oxygen uptake and release have <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> in detail.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{categories}} called topoi (singular topos) {{can even}} {{serve as an}} alternative to axiomatic set theory as a foundation of mathematics. A topos can also be considered as a specific type of category with two additional topos axioms. These foundational applications of category theory have <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> in fair detail as a basis for, and justification of, constructive mathematics. Topos theory is a form of abstract sheaf theory, with geometric origins, and leads to ideas such as pointless topology.|$|E
25|$|Construction was to {{have begun}} in June 2011, but {{problems}} emerged. Five utilities (including four communications lines and one electrical line) were discovered to have lines running below the site. While the utilities that owned these lines could move them quickly, the cash-strapped District of Columbia required federal funds to assist it in managing the street closures and infrastructure improvements that would be made during the relocations. Because of this, the National Park Service declined to issue a construction permit until a program had <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> to move these utilities and obtain these funds.|$|E
25|$|Although {{construction}} started, {{and good}} progress was made, the details {{appear to have}} <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> as the scheme progressed. The scheme was financed by passing the costs on to local farmers and landowners, and by the sale of plots of land once the scheme was complete. The Marsh Commissioners, who had overall responsibility for the scheme, {{received a letter from}} 20 farmers objecting to the construction of a lock, which Green had proposed to provide access to the interior of the marsh, and so the lock was not built.|$|E

While details have not <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out,</b> based on the vote of the principals, the membership would not favor forcing a team to forfeit {{in the event of a}} positive test, though the membership, which voted overwhelmingly favored to support a period of ineligibility for athletes testing positive, and narrowly supported forcing schools to adopt education programs if an athlete tested positive.|$|E
25|$|In 1874 and 1875, {{the diamond}} fields {{were in the}} grip of depression, but Rhodes and Rudd were among those who stayed to {{consolidate}} their interests. They believed that diamonds would be numerous in the hard blue ground that had been exposed after the softer, yellow layer near the surface had <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out.</b> During this time, the technical problem of clearing out the water that was flooding the mines became serious. Rhodes and Rudd obtained the contract for pumping water out of the three main mines. After Rhodes returned from his first term at Oxford he lived with Robert Dundas Graham, who later became a mining partner with Rudd and Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years before}} CNN's launch, in December 1976, Ted Turner turned his Atlanta, Georgia {{independent}} station WTBS {{into one of}} the original satellite-distributed television channels, leasing a transponder on RCA's Satcom 1 geostationary satellite. The Cable News Network was intended to be distributed on RCA's new Satcom 3, which was lost on its launch date of December 7, 1979. Because replacement transmission capacity was not readily available, the Turner Broadcasting System filed suit against RCA seeking use of another communications satellite and $35.5 million in damages. On March 5, Turner announced that a consent order had <b>been</b> <b>worked</b> <b>out</b> with RCA in federal court, allowing CNN to begin operations on June 1 as scheduled, using a transponder on Satcom 1.|$|E
