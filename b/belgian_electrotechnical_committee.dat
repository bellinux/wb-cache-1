40|$|Recently {{published}} International <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Committee</b> (IEC) {{technical reports}} IEC 61000 - 3 - 13 provides detailed methodologies for managing voltage unbalance (VU) in electric power systems. A key aspect in the VU emission allocation {{process is the}} estimation of VU propagation {{in different parts of}} the network. Although the VU propagation from upstream networks to downstream networks is adequately addressed, the attenuation of VU when propagating from downstream to upstream networks at the same voltage level has not been properly taken into account in the aforementioned methodologies. Furthermore, mains connected three-phase induction motors are known to attenuate VU, and there is no methodology currently available to quantify the attenuation provided by such motors. The main motivation behind the current research is to investigate the VU propagation and attenuation in radial distribution networks and to quantify the attenuation provided by induction motor loads. This paper reports that the VU propagation from downstream to upstream in a radial distribution network with symmetrical distribution lines can be conservatively approximated by the ratio of fault levels of upstream and downstream network. Moreover, an influence coefficient has been introduced as a means of appraising the impact of induction motor loads. The theoretical work presented is verified using unbalanced load flow analysis.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{and experimental}} simulation of flow around a complex, three-dimensional triangular lattice meteorological mast and accompanying anemometer booms {{has been carried}} out using the open source CFD code OpenFOAM. The simulation has been compared with results using a 1 / 20 th scale wind tunnel model using 3 D hot-wire anemometry probes and satisfactory agreement with the CFD has been found. Three turbulence models commonly applied in numerical external aerodynamics were employed with the one-equation Spalart–Almaras model compared with its more sophisticated two-equation counter parts k–ε and k–ω–SST. The differences in the results for the velocity field around the mast were found to be marginal and recommendations for the overall suitability of any individual RANS-based turbulence model for such flows were inconclusive. The predicted flow distortion surrounding the lattice mast differed from previously published data using the method suggested in International <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Committee</b> (IEC) standards based on the results specifically for the FINO 3 mast. Using the CFD simulation data it was possible to calculate the optimum boom length to place the anemometers outside of any flow distortion field for this mast.

40|$|Due to the {{important}} {{increase of the}} power of electrical transmission and distribution grids expected for the following years, especially in developing countries such as Kenya, Brazil, Philippines or Mexico among others, that have planes of generating energy from clean sources far away from the centres of consumption [1] it becomes a matter of special importance adapting and developing new substation connectors’ testing methods according to the power and temperature regimes at which they are expected to work. The international normative frame of substation connectors established both by the International <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Committee</b> (IEC) [2] and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) [3] sets standardized tests for the evaluation of high voltage connectors. These tests are routinely done within the quality plans of the manufacturers. At the moment, testing of substation connectors –and in general switchgear and fittings- is time demanding and costly due to the energy consumed by such tests. The expectations for the following years are that the power consumption of these tests will not do nothing but grow due to expected increase of power of worldwide overhead lines. For instance, today temperature rise tests in substation connectors involve power ranges up to 100 kVA, which are applied in cycles that can last several weeks. These tests are only feasible in few laboratories and at a very high cost: temporary, monetary, energetic and environmental. For this reason, following the line of other technologies such as aeronautics, naval engineering, or automotive as well as other studies done in the field of electrical engineering specially related to the corona effect [4], this study proposes to develop a reduced scale test system to perform temperature rise tests for substation connectors. Both, a theoretical framework based on analytical formulas, finite element method (FEM) simulations and experimental data has been developed to conduct reduced scale temperature rise tests and to set the conditions at which they provide comparable results to those attained in the original scale tests. Firstly, two circular loops (original and reduced scale loops) composed of a power conductor and two terminal connectors were analysed. The aim of this first study was to determine in an easy and trustful way the voltage and current values to be applied in experimental reduced scale tests to achieve the same steady-state temperature as in the original scale temperature rise test. The scale relationship between tests was set in 1 : 1. 8, although the method proposed in this study can deal with any other scale factor.

40|$|Between 44, 000 and 98, 000 {{patients}} {{die each}} year in US hospitals due to medical errors which may be prevented by providing the medical staff with instant access to patient records using wireless technology. If the electric field intensity of a wireless transmitter {{is greater than the}} immunity level of an electronic medical device (EMD), the device may malfunction. The consequences of this electromagnetic interference (EMI) can be as serious as harm to the patient. This thesis presents a quantitative assessment of the risk of exceeding immunity (REI) and an analysis of some EMI control policies by developing methods for fast estimation of the probability distribution of the electromagnetic field strength in indoor environments accounting for the mobility of transmitters. To determine the REI, ray-tracing, the Sabine method from acoustics, and the Ricean probability density function (pdf) are used. A commercial software is used to show that the presence of some furniture has negligible effect on the pdf of the field strength. An approximation of the power in higher order reflections in ray-tracing is used to present the modified ray-tracing-Rice method, immensely increasing the computational speed with no loss of accuracy compared to the Ray-tracing-Rice method. The Ricean and Nakagami pdfs are compared. It is shown that determining the Nakagami parameters requires more computation with no improvement in accuracy hence the Nakagami distribution is not recommended in indoor propagation. The two-wave with diffuse power theory is shown to be unreliable in estimating the pdf of the sum field of two fixed transmitters and reliable in the case of roaming transmitters. The Ricean function is then shown to approximate the pdf of the sum field of two roaming transmitters. The presence-weighted risk of exceeding immunity (PWREI) is introduced accounting for the mobility of one and two transmitters which can be present at distances close to and far from the EMD. The PWREI is useful for large-scale decision-making processes where both low- and high-risk scenarios are considered, contrary to worst-case analyses where the transmitters are fixed at close distances. The PWREI accounts for a policy where the staff members carrying the transmitters are required to maintain a minimum separation distance (MSD) from the EMD, and a non-compliance possibility. The PWREI is applied to a hospital ward using transmitters radiating 100 mW at 2. 45 GHz. With full compliance, any low level of PWREI can be reached by increasing the MSD. Assuming some non-compliance, there exists an optimal MSD at which the PWREI reaches the risk floor and remains constant for greater MSDs, suggesting that larger MSDs are not necessarily safer. The MSD suggested by the International <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Committee</b> is too conservative compared to the optimal MSD. A vertical separation between the transmitter and the EMD is useful and recommended for increasing the efficacy of the MSD policy...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the small wind {{industry}} has shown exponential growth; however there have been growing concerns over the safety and reliability of small wind turbines on the market. The International <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Committee</b> and the International Energy Agency are working to rectify these issues by introducing stricter requirements on small wind turbines; firstly through amendments to international standards and secondly {{with the introduction of}} a Standard Labelling Program to increase consumer awareness. In Australia, since commencing operation in 2008, the National Small Wind Turbine Centre has been working to improve the safety and performance of small wind turbines by providing independent testing services to manufacturers. Pure Engineering Pty Ltd in conjunction with Tromes Design has engaged the National Small Wind Turbine Centre to test their 1. 5 kW FolksWind vertical axis wind turbine in accordance with the international small wind turbine standards contained within the international series of standards IEC 61400. The prototype turbine is currently in the development phase. Over the course of this project the intern has assisted the centre with the testing of the FolksWind turbine. The majority of work undertaken has involved monitoring the power performance of the turbine to allow the manufacturers to make changes in an attempt to reach an optimal system configuration. Based on the data collected, changes have been made to the turbine power curve programmed into the system’s inverter in order to achieve an optimal tip speed ratio for the system. At the conclusion of the project, improvement has been made although a definite configuration for the system has not yet been determined. In addition to power performance testing, measurement of significant vibrations present in the system has been undertaken. Vibrations consistent with the turbine’s rotational speed and the frequency of blade passing have been observed. Based on this data it has been found that, as well as posing a safety threat, the vibrations are detrimental to the system’s performance. The manufacturer aims to significantly reduce the magnitude of these vibrations through modifications to the system’s structural components. The manufacturer has also requested that the National Small Wind Turbine Centre measure the strain in the uppermost guy wires to allow the thrust on the rotor to be calculated and an overall thrust curve for the system to be determined. This will allow the manufacturer to determine the required strength of a free standing tower for future production. As the final configuration of the system has not been determined this analysis is not yet complete however some preliminary data has been produced and the National Small Wind Turbine Centre will continue the process of determining the thrust curve for the final system configuration...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{an urgent}} need for an {{international}} protocol for power protection and substation automation, the International <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Committee</b> (IEC) and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) agreed to collaborate together to advance the existing communication protocols for substation automation system (SAS). The objectives were to achieve interoperability and free configuration in a multi-vendor environment substation. The outcome of this agreement was to announce {{the first edition of}} the IEC 61850 Standard as an international standard in 2004. The standard incorporates the use of logical nodes to resolve problems related to interoperability and interchangeability in multi-vendor zone substation systems. The standard also initiated a cost-effective Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messaging technology to replace the traditional copper wiring. The second edition of the IEC 61850 Standard was published in 2014 which is encapsulated in a series of 20 documents spanning over ten sections. The last few years has seen numerous studies pointing to the IEC 61850 as a worthwhile international standard for substation automation system. There is still, nevertheless, resistance from utilities to welcoming the IEC 61850 implementation. This may perhaps be {{due to the lack of}} knowledge that engineers have about the standard and/or because of several ambiguous topics that still are not addressed in detail in the context of IEC 61850. Furthermore, it should go without saying that, the GOOSE technology has brought several benefits to the power protection and communication systems in the field of substation automation. However, the lack of tools and knowledge to take advantage of the GOOSE messaging technology in IEC 61850 -based zone substations is tangible. For instance, in order to test an Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), isolating a GOOSE message from substation is a main industrial challenge for engineers. When an IED is isolated from live substation for test purposes, its GOOSE message is not isolated yet, and the IED under test is still publishing the GOOSE trip signal to other IEDs. In order to isolate the GOOSE trip signal for IED test purposes, each vendor implements its own method and they use their proprietary configurator tools. This means that, engineers are desperately dealing with a lack of comprehensive tool or method to isolate the GOOSE trip signal in a multi-vendor zone substation. These challenges led to the slow migration of the standard into substations. Having acknowledged these difficulties and challenges the spotlight is seemingly in the path of developing a tool or program to be utilised for GOOSE isolation and GOOSE management in a multi-vendor relay environment. In doing that, a 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation is implemented accompanied with a SCADA centre as a model of an IEC 61850 -based Substation. Two bays with separate 66 kV sub-transmission lines, 66 / 22 kV step down transformers, 22 kV Bus 1 with Bus Tie Circuit Breaker and three 22 kV feeders per bay have been considered for the simulation. In the construction of the Substation Simulator, the aim is to take advantage of the IEC 61850 GOOSE messaging technology for protection, control, monitoring and communication purposes. Hence, the hardwire connections are replaced by GOOSE signals through optic cables as much as possible. This thesis will not only provide the design and configuration procedures of this substation, but also will cover the difficulties that engineers may encounter in IEC 61850 -based substations systems in terms of device configuration, testing and maintenance. In order to fully understand the concept of the 66 / 22 kV Distribution Terminal Zone Substation, it is very essential to be familiar with the structure of communication protocols and the IEC 61850 Standard. This thesis starts by exploring a synopsis of communication protocols and their development over the time. It elucidates core elements of telemetry communications, structures of protocols and the significance of standards for communication protocols within substation automation systems. This is followed by a comprehensive exploration of the fundamentals of the IEC 61850 -based substations. In particular, it will cover the GOOSE messaging technology and interoperability in a multi-vendor substation environment.

The need for this document was recently made more apparent with the initiation of a PV Global Approval Program (PVGAP) {{at the international level}} and is in response to concerns that PV systems being fielded must meet performance standards and that these standards include system-level performance type tests. The title of these test procedures is prefaced with the word interim because experience in using the procedures is needed before a consensus standard is developed and accepted by the PV community through its activities with the IEEE Standards Coordinating Committee 21 (SCC 21) and International <b>Electrotechnical</b> Commission Technical <b>Committee</b> 82 (IEC TC 82) national and international standards-making bodies. Both entities have initiated projects to develop test standards and will need the technical basis and validation of test procedures such as those presented in this document before a consensus is achieved by the PV community...|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} of electromagnetically disturbing installations, including {{new forms of}} generating systems, to power distribution networks continue to increase. As a result, managing the network electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) within stipulated limits {{has become a major}} challenge to distribution network service providers (DNSPs). Therefore, the availability of a set of guidelines and recommendations based on well researched engineering practices would facilitate DNSPs in the provision of adequate supply quality to customers connected to the distribution networks. Accordingly, the International <b>Electrotechnical</b> <b>Committee</b> (IEC) has released a series of standards and technical reports to address the management of EMC in distribution networks. Despite the availability of these standards and technical reports, there remain inadequacies in these documents as well as gaps in the existing knowledge in relation to management of EMC, where further renements are required. These inadequacies and gaps must be addressed in order for DNSPs to properly manage EMC in distribution networks. The low frequency EMC concerns addressed in this Thesis include harmonics, voltage fluctuations and flicker, and voltage unbalance (VU). The focus of this Thesis is to investigate the management of these key EMC issues in future distribution networks. The recently published IEC Technical Report IEC 61000 - 3 - 14, provides power quality (PQ) emission limits for large disturbing installations connected to low voltage (LV) distribution networks. Noting that harmonic voltages in networks arise due to both large installations and smaller installations (whose harmonic current emission levels are governed by equipment standards), IEC 61000 - 3 - 14 proposes an additional factor, which is referred to as a `reduction factor 2 ̆ 7. This factor represents the fraction of the contribution to global emission allowance from the harmonic current emissions of smaller installations. IEC 61000 - 3 - 14 recommends that DNSPs determine these reduction factors considering the prevailing system conditions in their networks. The analyses presented in this Thesis show that the establishment of a universal value (network independent) for the reduction factor is not advisable, as it depends on a number of variables which are unique to the distribution network under consideration. This difficulty undermines the applicability of the IEC approach in relation to practical LV networks. Furthermore, a number of methodologies that exist in the current technical literature in relation to the assessment of harmonic current emission limits for disturbing installations connected to the public LV network are closely examined, emphasising {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each approach. A comparative study using test LV distribution networks is conducted. The study shows that, though underlying philosophies and data requirements for each of the investigated methodologies vary significantly they provide emission limits for each individual installation which are not too dissimilar. In relation to VU, application of the IEC methodologies may or may not lead to a conservative emission allocation, especially in complex radial networks. An alternative VU emission allocation methodology based on the constrained bus voltage (CBV) method is proposed in this Thesis. The theoretical bases for the formulation of the CBV methodology are presented together with several application examples. The CBV methodology is shown to be superior in comparison to the VU allocation methodology presented in IEC Technical Reports, as the former enables the network VU absorption capacity to be fully utilised. Compared to both IEC and CBV methodologies, the novel VU emission allocation procedure presented in this Thesis that is based on the concept of voltage droop (VD), provides a simplistic, less computationally and data intensive technique. In addition to harmonics and VU, voltage fluctuations and flicker are expected to become a major concern for DNSPs due to integration of intermittent and fluctuating renewable energy generators (REGs) to the distribution networks where little or no knowledge exists in relation to the contributions made by such sources to the network. The impacts of REGs with dierent control modes (i. e. power factor control operation, voltage control mode and reactive power dispatch mode) on voltage or no knowledge exists in relation to the contributions made by such sources to the network. The impacts of REGs with dierent control modes (i. e. power factor control operation, voltage control mode and reactive power dispatch mode) on voltage fluctuations and flcker are examined in this Thesis. In addition, the attenuation characteristics of distribution system loads and their impact on flicker levels in the distribution network are also investigated. The results demonstrate that flicker emission characteristics of REGs are influenced negatively by the reactive power control strategy employed and the flicker attenuation characteristics are influenced by the various load types connected to the distribution feeder. This is an aspect which has not been recognised in existing literature. The outcomes of the study emphasises the need for adequate planning by DNSPs in relation to voltage flctuations and flicker, before connecting REGs to the distribution network that have the capability to control the power factor or voltage. This Thesis also examines the PQ characteristics of small single-phase photovoltaic inverter (PVI) systems, with the objective of establishing realistic information relevant to their PQ impacts on the distribution network, as such knowledge is not widely available and will be useful for DNSPs in managing their networks. This is achieved by conducting controlled laboratory experiments using an experimental test setup based on IEC recommendations from which the harmonics and flicker emission levels have been generally observed to be within stipulated limits, however, some PVIs exceeded the emission limits for even harmonics...|$|R
