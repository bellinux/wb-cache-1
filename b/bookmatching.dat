5000|$|<b>Bookmatching</b> is the {{practice}} of matching two (or more) wood or stone surfaces, so that two adjoining surfaces mirror each other, giving the impression of an opened book.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} of Graf's pianos was largely undecorated, emphasizing instead {{the beauty of}} bookmatched veneers in walnut and mahogany. (The mirror-image motif created by <b>bookmatching</b> is visible in the illustration above.) The natural keys were normally of ivory and the sharps of ebony.|$|E

5000|$|Considerable use of {{wood was}} made in the {{internal}} trim of the [...] "Y" [...] Type. Door windows, front and rear screens were framed in burr walnut, the instrument panel set in <b>bookmatched</b> veneer offsetting the passenger side glove box.|$|R
50|$|As {{applied to}} wood, <b>bookmatching</b> is usually done with veneer (produced {{in one of}} several ways), but can also be done with solid wood. The {{technique}} is used to beautify a variety of objects such as furniture, violins, guitars or the interior of high-luxury cars. The two adjoining surfaces are produced from the same piece of wood, so that they have (almost) exactly the same appearance, but mirrored. The final effect varies with {{the figure of the}} wood chosen and can range from extremely subtle (so that the two surfaces almost appear to be a single piece of wood), to dramatic effects with wavy grain showcased, as in high-end guitars.|$|E
5000|$|Circassion walnut {{from the}} Black Sea region clads the foyer and grand {{staircase}} {{and is used}} in a <b>bookmatch</b> treatment. The foyer fireplace is of Indiana limestone. Embedded in this fireplace is the most prominent tribute to the Arts and Crafts movement in the house: Albert Van Den Berghen's bronze relief, ”Spirit of the Waves.” ...|$|R
50|$|Spruce is the {{traditional}} German choice wood for the tops of semi-hollow constructed instruments - this also is reflected in Duesenberg instruments. The back, bent sides and neck on these models usually are made of Maple which {{in the case of}} sides and back is flamed and <b>bookmatched.</b> The woodwork is done primarily in South Korea with finishing and Plek work done in Germany.|$|R
50|$|The building's {{interior}} exhibits Art Moderne and Art Deco finishes and detailing. The lobbies and corridors have {{marble and}} plaster walls, geometrically patterned terrazzo floors, and plaster ceilings with white bronze molding. The ceremonial courtroom is a double-height chamber with wall paneling of light <b>bookmatched</b> wood set in darker wood squares and a coffered plaster ceiling. Light fixtures range from white-bronze-and-glass chandeliers to wall sconces with Art Deco detailing.|$|R
50|$|The word, {{derived from}} Greek phil- loving + Latin lumen- light, was {{introduced}} by the British collector Marjorie S. Evans in 1943 (who later {{became president of the}} British Matchbox Label & Booklet Society, now renamed as the British Matchbox Label and <b>Bookmatch</b> Society). A person who engages in phillumeny is a phillumenist. These two forms have been adopted by many other languages, e.g., philuméniste, fillumenista, Filumenist and филуменист.|$|R
5000|$|Instead {{of relying}} on body-on-frame construction, like its {{predecessors}} {{and most of its}} competitors, the Mark X received a unitary construction monocoque body-shell, codenamed [...] "Zenith" [...] during its development. Its floorpan remained in production in elongated form, long after Mark X production ended, forming the basis of the Daimler DS420 Limousine until 1992. But at the same time, the interior was Jaguar's last to feature abundant standard woodwork, including the dashboard, escutcheons, window trim, a pair of large <b>bookmatched</b> fold out rear picnic tables, and a front seat pull-out picnic table stowed beneath the instrument cluster.|$|R
5000|$|Neck-through or neck-thru (or in full form neck through body) is {{a method}} of {{electric}} guitar or bass guitar construction that involves extending the piece (or pieces, in a laminate construction) of wood used for the neck through {{the entire length of}} the body, essentially making it the core of the body. The strings, fretboard, pickups and bridge are all mounted on this piece. So-called [...] "ears" [...] or [...] "wings" [...] (i.e. side parts of the body) are glued or laminated to the central [...] "stick". The [...] "wings" [...] may be <b>bookmatched</b> in order to give a symmetrical appearance, and are often cut from one piece of wood.|$|R
50|$|Somogyi's {{woodworking}} designs arise out of {{stringed instrument}} building tradition and aesthetic. They are fashioned {{out of thin}} sheets of musical grade tone woods which have been <b>bookmatched,</b> edge joined, and planed thin. The mosaic inlay patterns come out of guitarmaking design: guitars have open soundholes bordered with inlaid patterns of dyed pieces of wood. These inlaid mosaic patterns are a form of fret ornamentation, an effect made by laying pieces of material {{of the same size}} next to one another and thereby producing a design. In guitars these are called rosettes. While historical rosette design originated from Arabian, Celtic and European Renaissance influences, it is expanded in Ervin Somogyi's work to also embrace Japanese, Russian, African, primitive, abstract and modern design.|$|R
5000|$|The {{back and}} ribs are {{typically}} made of maple, most {{often with a}} matching striped figure, called [...] "flame." [...] Backs may be one-piece slab-cut or quarter-sawn, or <b>bookmatched</b> two-piece quarter-sawn. Backs are also purfled, but in their case the purfling is less structurally important than for the top. Some fine old violins have scribed or painted rather than inlaid purfling on the back. The small semicircular extension of the back known as the [...] "button" [...] provides extra gluing surface for the crucial neck joint, and is neglected when measuring {{the length of the}} back. Occasionally a half-circle of ebony surrounds the button, either to restore material lost in resetting the neck of an old instrument, or to imitate that effect.|$|R
50|$|New {{designs are}} drawn using 3D cad software. From the 3D design, {{two-dimensional}} flat sections are created {{to become the}} precision-cut frames (internal Rib-like structures perpendicular to the mid-line from nose to tail) and keel (known as stringer in a foam surfboard). Then <b>bookmatched</b> wood is selected that blends {{together to form a}} unique pattern on the deck and bottom of the board. The keel and frames are then drilled with holes to further reduce the weight. The constructed frames and keel define the overall shape and size of the board. The installation of fins and fin-boxes (for removable fins) is aided by a builder's laser to ensure that fins are placed, canted and toed-in symmetrically. The hollow and watertight nature of these boards require the installation of a vent plug to equalize internal and external pressure that changes due to temperature variation and to changes in atmospheric pressure which, without the vent, would cause air pressure inside the board to increase.|$|R

5000|$|In 1958, new Standard model {{retained}} most specifications of the 1957 Goldtop, including PAF humbucker pickups, a maple top, and a tune-o-matic {{bridge with}} a stop tailpiece or Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. The gold color used since 1952 {{was replaced by}} a cherry-red version of the Sunburst finish long used on Gibson's flat-top and archtop acoustic and hollow electric guitars. Since the maple cap was now visible, tops were made either with a solid [...] "plaintop" [...] piece of maple or two <b>bookmatched</b> pieces of figured (curly or quilted) maple. To differentiate from the earlier Goldtop model, the new Les Paul was referred to as The Les Paul Standard. Specifications during 1958-60 varied from year to year and also from guitar to guitar. Typical 1958 Les Paul Standard necks had a thicker neck, thinner frets and lower fret height, which changed during the course of 1959 to develop into typical 1960 necks with a thinner cross-section and wider, higher frets. The cherry dye used on the 1958-59 models faded rapidly from ultraviolet light exposure, so in early 1960 Gibson switched to a new, fade-resistant formulation which was also less translucent and slightly more orange; this is sometimes called the [...] "tomato soup burst." [...] Original production of the Standards lasted from 1958 to early 1961. Only about 1,700 of these early models were made and have subsequently become highly valuable.|$|R
5000|$|Typically the top (also {{known as}} the belly or table, in the U.K.) -- the instrument's soundboard) is made of quarter-sawn spruce, <b>bookmatched</b> at a {{strongly}} glued joint down the center, with two sound-holes (or [...] "f-holes", from their resemblance to a stylized letter [...] "f") precisely placed between the C-bouts and lower corners. The sound-holes affect the flex patterns of the top, or table, and allow the box to breathe as it vibrates. A decorative inlaid set of three narrow wooden strips, usually a light-colored strip surrounded by two dark strips, called purfling, runs {{around the edge of}} the top, and is said to give some resistance to cracks originating at the edge. It is also claimed to allow the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Some instruments have two lines of purfling, or have knot-work type ornaments inlaid in the back. Painted-on [...] purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. A slab-sawn bass bar fitted inside the top, running lengthwise under the bass foot of the bridge, gives added mass and rigidity to the top plate. Some cheaper mass-produced violins have an integral bass bar, carved from the same piece as the top. Ideally the top is glued to the ribs and linings with slightly diluted hide glue, to allow future removal with minimal damage.|$|R
