50|$|Republican President Richard Nixon {{endorsed}} Brewer {{in order}} to <b>break</b> <b>Wallace's</b> political career and secure Deep South votes for himself in the next presidential election (which could be carried again by Wallace, {{if he were to}} run again).|$|R
50|$|<b>Wallace's</b> <b>break</b> {{came when}} one of his clients opened a comedy club. The club owner was amused by Wallace's natural humor and {{friendly}} demeanor and offered him the chance to perform stand-up comedy. In 1977, Wallace walked on stage for the first time, wearing a preacher's robe and calling himself The Right Reverend Dr. George Wallace. His routine was completely improvised.|$|R
25|$|In week 5, the Lions {{hosted the}} {{defending}} Super Bowl Champion Pittsburgh Steelers. The Lions scored {{first with a}} 46-yard Jason Hanson field goal. The Steelers responded with a 7-yard TD run by Rashard Mendenhall. The Lions replied with another 46-yard field goal. In the second quarter, Pittsburgh scored first with a 15-yard TD catch by Heath Miller from Ben Roethlisberger. The Lions retaliated with a 38-yard interception run for a touchdown by William James. Hines Ward of the Steelers next got a touchdown of his own, a 17-yard catch, making the halftime score 21–13 Pittsburgh. After the <b>break,</b> Mike <b>Wallace</b> of Pittsburgh caught a 47-yard TD pass. The final score of the game was a 25-yard catch by Detroit's Dennis Northcutt. Lions backup QB Daunte Culpepper was sacked 7 times in the loss, 3 of which were on consecutive downs.|$|R
60|$|Andrew Macpherson's sudden {{attack at}} the gate {{overpowered}} the guard, {{and for a while}} he held possession of it, and following Archie's instructions, slew a horse drawing a cart laden with flour in the act of entering. Then the guard rallied, and, joined by other soldiers who had run up, made a fierce attack upon him; but his line of pikes drawn up across the gate defied their efforts to <b>break</b> through. <b>Wallace</b> and his party were within fifty yards of the gate when reinforcements from the castle arrived. Sir John Kerr, furious at the prospect of his enemies again escaping him, headed them in their furious rush. Wallace stepped forward beyond the line and met him. With a great sweep of his mighty sword he beat down Sir John's guard, and the blade descending clove helmet and skull, and the knight fell dead in his tracks.|$|R
50|$|The 1995 fall race weekend {{included}} the first NASCAR Supertrack race {{at the track}} {{and the return of}} Ernie Irvan to the Cup racing. Irvan had not raced since his near fatal crash at Michigan in 1994. He made his first start in a truck on Saturday, starting on the outside front row. He led 24 laps before suspension problems forced him {{to pull out of the}} race just after the halfway <b>break.</b> Kenny <b>Wallace,</b> Jack Sprague, and Geoff Bodine all ran strong up front at some point, but Mike Bliss went on to score his first-ever truck win. On Sunday in the Tyson Holly Farms 400, Irvan, driving a Number 88 Robert Yates Racing Ford, started seventh and finished sixth with a 31-lap lead. Mark Martin picked up his second win at the track. This was the first Winston Cup Series race since 1959 with all the cars running at the finish. There were 28 lead changes in this race, a record for North Wilkesboro Cup races.|$|R
5000|$|During her <b>break</b> from EastEnders, <b>Wallace</b> made {{television}} guest appearances, including once as Kat Slater, in the 2005 French & Saunders Christmas special. On 17 February 2006, Wallace was the [...] "guest host" [...] of an {{edition of}} the Channel 4 programme The Friday Night Project. She appeared in the one-off BBC One television dramas A Class Apart opposite Nathaniel Parker, The Dinner Party with Lee Evans and Alison Steadman. After visiting Hat Trick Productions with her agent, and singing an impromptu version of Marie Lloyd's song The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery, she was offered the lead role in Miss Marie Lloyd - Queen of The Music Hall for BBC Four.|$|R
2500|$|Kat was [...] {{written out}} of EastEnders {{temporarily}} in January 2012. The writers for EastEnders organised [...] "emergency script changes" [...] which saw Kat called away {{to care for}} her father Charlie after a stroke. A source said: [...] "It was a very easy decision to make for the show. She is a great actress and extremely popular on set. She'll come back stronger than ever." [...] It was announced shortly after <b>Wallace's</b> <b>break</b> from EastEnders that Sharon Watts, played by Letitia Dean, would return to the series. Numerous tabloids reported that the purpose of Dean's return is to replace Jessie Wallace or to [...] "fill the hole left behind by Wallace". This was later denied by an EastEnders spokesperson. The spokesperson commented: [...] "There is no link between Letitia's return to EastEnders and Jessie not being around at the moment. We have been working on plans to bring Sharon back for quite some time." [...] An insider added: [...] "Jessie and Letitia are two fantastic actresses and their characters are firm favourites with fans. Viewers can look forward to seeing them back on screen together later this year." ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Indonesian {{island of}} Sulawesi has a complex {{geological}} history. It {{is composed of}} several landmasses that have arrived at a near modern configuration {{only in the past}} few million years. It is the largest island in the biodiversity hotspot of Wallacea—an area demarcated by the biogeographic <b>breaks</b> between <b>Wallace’s</b> and Lydekker’s lines. The mammal fauna of Sulawesi is transitional between Asian and Australian faunas. Sulawesi’s three genera of squirrels, all endemic (subfamily Nannosciurinae: Hyosciurus, Rubrisciurus and Prosciurillus), are of Asian origin and have evolved a variety of phenotypes that allow a range of ecological niche specializations. Here we present a molecular phylogeny of this radiation using data from museum specimens. High throughput sequencing technology was used to generate whole mitochondrial genomes and a panel of nuclear ultraconserved elements providing a large genome-wide dataset for inferring phylogenetic relationships. Results: Our analysis confirmed monophyly of the Sulawesi taxa with deep divergences between the three endemic genera, which predate the amalgamation of the current island of Sulawesi. This suggests lineages may have evolved in allopatry after crossing Wallace’s line. Nuclear and mitochondrial analyses were largely congruent and well supported, except for the placement of Prosciurillus murinus. Mitochondrial analysis revealed paraphyly for Prosciurillus, with P. murinus between or outside of Hyosciurus and Rubrisciurus, separate from other species of Prosciurillus. A deep but monophyletic history for the four included species of Prosciurillus was recovered with the nuclear data. Conclusions: The divergence of the Sulawesi squirrels from their closest relatives dated to 9. 7 – 12. 5 million years ago (MYA), pushing back the age estimate of this ancient adaptive radiation prior to the formation of the current conformation of Sulawesi. Generic level diversification took place around 9. 7 MYA, opening the possibility that the genera represent allopatric lineages that evolved in isolation in an ancient proto-Sulawesian archipelago. We propose that incongruence between phylogenies based on nuclear and mitochondrial sequences may have resulted from biogeographic discordance, when two allopatric lineages come into secondary contact, with complete replacement of the mitochondria in one species.

2500|$|On {{announcement}} of the storyline, Soaplife said it [...] "could be fun but could be the ruin of Kat if they get it wrong", and wondered if it would put EastEnders [...] "back on top of its game", saying, [...] "That depends on Kat. If we're made to love and care about her, yes. If she comes over as a conniving, sneaky cheat only interested in her own wants and desires, no." [...] They opined that Alfie {{should be the one}} having the affair, as he cannot do anything right in Kat's eyes. They also said they [...] "wondered which Kat we'd be getting back after Jessie <b>Wallace's</b> <b>break.</b> Would it be the tart with a heart that made Kat a soap icon? Or the alley Kat that we got last year (Kat down the alley with delivery man Mark was not her finest moment). Now with the reveal that she'll have a mystery that we can all spend weeks or months trying to guess , we fear it will be more alley Kat." [...] All About Soap thought that because of the way Kat got rid of Roxy after she moved in with Alfie while Kat was away, [...] "you'd think that [...] Kat was really committed to her husband [...] and determined to make her marriage work" [...] but called the affair [...] "sizzling", saying it would [...] "send shockwaves all round Albert Square!" [...] Soaplife said that the storyline {{may turn out to be}} a good mystery, but [...] "when it comes to affairs, we prefer ours with a heap-big dose of love". However, they later said the storyline was [...] "getting boring". In All About Soap, letters page editor Laura thought the affair would be [...] "the hottest thing in the Square this summer!" [...] Soaplife awarded the storyline a bronze medal in their [...] "2012 Soap Olympics" [...] for [...] "best storyline cycling", as Kat is [...] "cheating again. Round and round she goes." [...] Kate White from Inside Soap said: [...] "Well, Kathleen Slater Moon, if you were hoping to win our sympathy by suggesting that this secret fling business is all Alfie's fault, think again! Yes, it's a bit annoying when your other half is too busy to pay you much attention—but there should at least be an effort to sort out your issues before you decide cheating is the answer! We're finding it hard to have sympathy". The magazine later called the storyline [...] "unusual" [...] but said that [...] "Kat has been busy showing us how infidelity should be done". When the affair turned from lust to love, Soaplife said that it was [...] "what the affair needed right from the start in order to save Kat's reputation." [...] Steven Murphy, editor of Inside Soap said that when the storyline started, he and his colleagues were [...] "a little intrigued" [...] but after Michael was eliminated, they were [...] "totally obsessed!" [...] An Inside Soap reporter said that [...] " [...] decision to keep the man's identity a secret—and to have several characters reacting as if it could be them—means that this is soap like we've never seen it before", and added that [...] "it makes for frustrating viewing at times, but there's no denying that this plot has us well and truly hooked. It's not so much a 'whodunnit?' as a 'who-done-her?'" ...|$|R
5000|$|The former Communist National Committee member Bella Dodd asserts in her 1954 memoir School of Darkness {{that the}} Progressive Party of 1948 had Wallace as its voice and [...] "inspirational leader" [...] but was really {{controlled}} by top U.S. Communists, particularly William Z. Foster and Eugene Dennis, who filled {{the staff of}} the new party with people loyal to themselves and dictated self-defeating policies to the Progressive Party. Dodd concluded: [...] The reason they wanted a small limited Progressive Party was {{because it was the only}} kind they could control. They wanted to control it because they wanted a political substitute for the Communist Party, which they expected would soon be made illegal. A limited and controlled Progressive Party would be a cover organization and a substitute for the Communist Party if the latter were outlawed." [...] Historians have disputed the degree to which Communists shaped the party. Most agree that Wallace himself was not a Communist, but they also agree that he paid very little attention to internal party affairs. Historians Schapsmeier and Schapsmeier argue (1970 p 181):Progressive Party stood for one thing and Wallace another. Actually the party organization was controlled from the outset by those representing the radical left and not liberalism per se. This made it extremely easy for Communists and fellow travelers to infiltrate into important positions within the party machinery. Once this happened, party stands began to resemble a party line. Campaign literature, speech materials, and campaign slogans sounded strangely like echoes of what Moscow wanted to hear. As if wearing moral blinkers, Wallace increasingly became an imperceptive ideologue. Words were uttered by Wallace that did not sound like him, and his performance took on a strange Jekyll and Hyde quality—one moment he was a peace protagonist and the next a propaganda parrot for the Kremlin.One historian (further to the left than the Schapsmeiers) explores the internal dynamic (Schmidt 258-9):* At one pole were the extreme leftists, three closely related groups—admitted Communists, past and present; the party-liners and fellow travelers who failed to differ noticeably with the Communists as to either policy or principle; and finally those non-Communists who, in … 1944-50 failed to take issue with the Communists on policy, but whose underlying principles seemingly differed….* In the middle were grouped an apparently large majority of Progressive Party followers—the moderates. Exemplified by both national candidates, these individuals were willing to accept Communist support, because they felt that it was inconsistent, in the light of their ideals, to oppose Redbaiting by others, yet attempt to read Communists out of the new party.* At the right were arrayed those who, feeling that Communist support should have been disavowed in no uncertain terms, yet were unwilling to adopt the ADA tactic of violent attack on the Communists. This group would have approved making the Progressives [...] "non-Communist" [...] rather than [...] "antiCommunist", excluding but not assailing the Reds. Most persons sharing this view had, like Max Lerner, completely avoided the party, but others like Rexford Guy Tugwell joined and stayed, if reluctantly, through the campaign….* In the period following 1948, party members were hounded by the House Unamerican Activities Committee, from job to job. Members found themselves fired from even the lowest of day labor jobs by FBI agents and others. Although historians point out that groups tended to leave the party in the order of their views from right to left, with most of the rightists departing during or shortly after the campaign, accompanied by many of the moderates. And the moderate defection, so marked following election day, 1948, becoming a nearly complete walkout in the summer of 1950, with the policy rift over Korea and Wallace's departure. Consequently, by the close of 1951 the few remaining portions of the Wallace Progressive Party were composed almost exclusively of the earlier extreme left group. These were the ones who had favored a [...] "narrow" [...] organization; after the <b>Wallace</b> <b>break,</b> they finally achieved this goal, with the departure of almost everyone else, this does not take into account the huge pressure to conform and stop the activism by HUAC and FBI. The fact that the member of congress defeated by Joe McCarthy was Robert La Follette Jr, as an irony not lost on these activists.|$|R
