50|$|A common {{manifestation of}} Vajrakilla has three heads, six arms, and four legs. Vajrakilaya's three right hands {{except for the}} right front one held vajras with five and nine prongs. The right front one makes a mudra as {{granting}} boons with open palm. Vajrakilaya's three left hands hold a flaming triple wishfulfilling jewel or triratna, a trident and the kilaya. Vajrakilaya's back is covered by the freshly flayed skin of the elephant representing 'ignorance' (Sanskrit: avidya; Wylie: marigpa), with the legs tied in front. A human skin is tied diagonally across his chest with the hands lying flat on Vajrakilaya's stomach and solar plexus representing the flailed ego that has released its powerful grip obscuring the 'qualities' of the Sadhaka. Qualities are represented iconographically by the 'vortex' (Sanrkit: chakra; Wylie: Khorlo) of the Manipura (Sanskrit: Maṇipūra). A rope ripples over his body with severed heads hanging by their hair representing the Akshamala or 'garland of bija' (Sanskrit: Varnamala). A knee length loin cloth winds around his <b>belly</b> <b>belted</b> with a tiger skin complete with tail, claws and head. This deity wears manifold nāga adornments and jewellery: naga earrings, naga bracelets, naga anklets and a naga cord over his chest, {{sometimes referred to as}} a naga gurdle and a naga hairpiece or hair ornament. Vajrakilaya's faces are round and small compared to the tall body. Despite the large fangs and bulging eyes and his wrathful appearance, Vajrakilaya is perceived as having a benevolent demeanor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{names in}} Turkish {{of the central}} {{structural}} elements of the hilye are, from top to bottom, başmakam (head station), göbek (<b>belly),</b> kuşak (<b>belt)</b> and etek (skirt). This anthropomorphic naming {{makes it clear that}} the hilye represents a human body, whose purpose is [...] "to recall semantically the Prophet's presence via a graphic construct". It has been suggested that Hafiz Osman's hilye design might have been inspired by the celebrated Hilye-i Şerif, which in turn was based on the possibly spurious hadith according to which Muhammad has said [...] "... Whoever sees my hilye after me is as though he has seen me... If so, a hilye might have been meant to be not read but seen and contemplated, because it is really an image made of plain text.|$|R
50|$|Disliking {{the taste}} of Bugs' soap, Taz washes it off and puts ketchup on Bugs. Bugs thinks it is blood and freaks out, telling Taz to find a doctor. Taz runs to an infirmary, only to find Bugs dressed as a doctor instead. After a few checkup procedures, Bugs puts spotted glasses on Taz and asks him if he sees spots on his eyes and Taz says he does. Then Bugs gives him {{nitroglycerine}} and puts an electric <b>belly</b> firmer vibrating <b>belt</b> on Taz and Taz explodes.|$|R
5000|$|Folk clothes {{represent}} {{an essential element}} and ethnic insignia of Albanian people. People of this country appreciate and value this traditional domain. Almost every ethnographic zone has various special characteristics of folk clothes. Folk clothes differ even within a zone’ the nuances differ village by village. Folk costumes were worn in the late 50’s. Nowadays only the elders prefer these traditional clothes especially those of men. It is important to mention that in villages young women and older ones still wear these dresses. Young ladies’ costumes are not very much {{different from those of}} the older women, but they are considerably more modest. The shirt and stockings are made of canvass. The shirt is a bit open and this opening is made by knitting needle. The stockings reach to the knee and are circled at the end by [...] "beads'. Apart from the shirt the vest is worn too, but it was only decorated based on one’s economic standing. The young women wore a scarf without fringes on their heads. Earlier the young women wore a round-the waist skirt, but much simpler and smaller than that of older women. Later the apron was worn which was done in a loom and was decorated with broidery made by knitting needle and was usually black. This apron was usually worn above the knee.The lasses wore stockings reaching to the knee and leather shoes. The latter were made of leather and laces,but later they were made of rubber, linen, string, and cotton threads. The young women did not use the same decoration as the older women.Until late the men of the Deçan region wore white or dark (black) leggings (tirq) with braids and vests also we made by braids. The leggings frock was made of wool and knitted by the women in a loom. Later it was pressed on a fuller's mill. Women also made the braids in black threads. Tailors made the sewing of the leggings and vests. The leggings were sown with 2 to 12 stripes of braids and their upper and lower parts were covered in leather. Apart from leggings also a woolen overcoat was sown. The leggings were tied on the <b>belly</b> with a <b>belt</b> and a long and colorful stripe made by women in the loom.|$|R
