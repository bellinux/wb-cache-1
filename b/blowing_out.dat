5|$|The show on June 14, 2002 at the United Spirit Arena in Lubbock, Texas was {{cancelled}} due to {{a transformer}} <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> during the 2nd song which put the whole show on auxiliary power making it unsafe for Spears and the entire production team to continue. The show initially {{was going to be}} rescheduled according to the band member and DJ, Skip, but it later fell through.|$|E
5|$|Early on 8 July, U-255 caught another {{ship from}} Convoy PQ 17, the 6,069 ton American {{merchant}} ship Olopana, loaded with 6,000 tons of explosives, gasoline, and trucks as deck cargo. A single torpedo hit the ship, <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> all the bulkheads, and killing {{seven of the}} crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, {{and asked if they}} had enough food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, <b>blowing</b> <b>out.</b> Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
25|$|By March 2007, {{increasing}} {{construction costs}} {{and the need for}} extra repair work meant that the project costs had <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> by $5 million. The costs had further <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> to $32.9 million by March 2009.|$|R

50|$|Another tradition, {{commonly}} found in Cuba, is to have 14 ladies (sometimes 7), and 14 escorts (sometimes 7) as a court. The escorts hold flowers (usually roses) and the ladies carry candles. As the quinceañera dances the waltz with her father, she <b>blows</b> <b>out</b> one candle, then picks up one rose. This continues until she has <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> all the candles and picked up all the roses. The 14 candles <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> represent her 14 previous years, and with each she makes a wish. When the time comes to cut the cake, the quinceañera will <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> her last candle, thus completing her 15 wishes. The flowers are given to her mother.|$|R
5|$|The next season, Ottawa {{would be}} {{challenged}} {{to repeat the}} success they had in 2011–12, due to long-term injuries to key players such as Erik Karlsson, Jason Spezza, Milan Michalek and Craig Anderson. Despite these injuries, the Senators would finish seventh in the Eastern Conference and head coach Paul MacLean {{would go on to}} win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's coach of the year. Ottawa would play the second-seeded Montreal Canadiens {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, eventually winning in five games, <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> Montreal 6–1 in games three and five. The Senators would advance to play the top-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins in the second round, this time losing in five games. During the off-season, the Senators traded veteran defenceman Sergei Gonchar to the Dallas Stars in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in 2013. July 5, 2013 would be a day of mixed emotions for the city and fans, as long-time captain Daniel Alfredsson signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Red Wings, leaving Ottawa after 17 seasons with the Senators and 14 as captain. The signing shocked numerous fans across the city and many within the Senators organization. The day finished optimistically however, as Murray acquired star forward Bobby Ryan from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for forwards Jakob Silfverberg, Stefan Noesen and a first-round draft pick in 2014. Murray would also sign free agent forward Clarke MacArthur to a two-year contract that same day and would sign free agent defenceman Joe Corvo to a one-year contract three days later on July 8.|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was {{intentionally}} overexposed, intensifying the foreground and <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it looked as though she was giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a negative image, creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.|$|E
5|$|When the 2016–17 season started, Harden {{was off to}} a great {{start and}} was widely {{considered}} a top MVP runner along with Kawhi Leonard plus former teammate Russell Westbrook. When the season ended, the Rockets were third in both the Western Conference and overall rankings, a major improvement from the season before. D'Antoni was named the NBA Coach of the Year, Eric Gordon the Sixth Man of the Year, and Harden finished second in MVP voting to Russell Westbrook. In the playoffs, the Rockets faced the sixth seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in a battle of the MVP frontrunners, as the winner was not announced until after the finals. The Rockets won the series 4–1 including Nene Hilario's perfect 12–12 in field goals in Game 4. But {{they went on to}} lose to the San Antonio Spurs in a six-game series, despite <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> the Spurs in game 1 by 27 points. The Spurs tied the series 2-2 and held on to win game 5 as Manu Ginobili blocked James Harden's game tying three point attempt as time ran out, and won game 6 by 39 points, as with Nene's injury, the Rockets could not guard Lamarcus Aldridge, who scored 34 points and grabbed 12 rebounds.|$|E

25|$|Experts soon {{agreed that}} the cause was a {{hydrogen}} explosion. Almost certainly the hydrogen was formed inside the reactor vessel because of falling water levels exposing zircaloy structures/fuel assembly cladding, which then reacted with steam and produced hydrogen, with the hydrogen subsequently vented into the containment building. When the hydrogen reached ignition concentration in {{the air of the}} secondary containment building, an ignition source such as a spark triggered a hydrogen-oxygen explosion, <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> the walls of this building from the inside.|$|E

25|$|In {{fighting}} {{a fire at}} a directly vertical spewing wellhead, high explosives, such as dynamite were {{used to create a}} blast wave that pushes the burning fuel and local atmospheric oxygen away from the well. (This is a similar principle to <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to spill out without igniting. Generally, explosives were placed within 55 gallon drums, the explosives surrounded by fire retardant chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material with a horizontal crane being used to bring the drum as close to the burning area as possible.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, whilst he {{produced}} impressive performances against the two leading counties (Yorkshire and Lancashire), Hearne could not recover his form, {{and apart from}} a few reasonable performances for the MCC the year 1901 was disastrous, with his average in purely county matches <b>blowing</b> <b>out</b> to over 30 runs per wicket. 1902 – the first really wet summer since 1894 – was equally disappointing, with a succession of rain-affected pitches only rarely exploited and little evidence of his old skill on the few hard pitches. Consequently, Hearne disappeared from consideration for Test and other representative selection, even during his occasional recoveries of form.|$|E
