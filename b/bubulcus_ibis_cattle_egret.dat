The eastern subspecies B. (i.) coromandus, described by Pieter Boddaert in 1783, breeds in Asia and Australasia, and the western nominate form occupies the rest of the species range, including the Americas. Some authorities recognise a third Seychelles subspecies, B. i. seychellarum, which was first described by Finn Salomonsen in 1934.|$|R

50|$|Little egrets {{are mostly}} silent but make various croaking and {{bubbling}} calls at their breeding colonies {{and produce a}} harsh alarm call when disturbed.

5000|$|The [...] western <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis)</b> is {{a species}} of heron (family Ardeidae) found in the tropics, subtropics and warm {{temperate}} zones.

40|$|Birds {{belonging}} to the orders Ciconiiformes and Phoenicopteriformes are common inmates of zoological gardens. There are 12 species of the order Ciconiiformes and 1 species of the order Phoenicopteriformes bred in the Ohrada Zoo. All these species bred in the zoo {{are found in the}} Old World chiefly. The successful breeding of mentioned species depends on detailed knowledge of their biology and on providing appropriate breeding conditions. This thesis is an effort for complete analysis of the history and the present of breeding mentioned species in the Ohrada Zoo. The main aim of this thesis was to evaluate the success of nesting of birds mentioned orders in relation to breeding conditions in the zoo according to all available data processing; and to evaluate the success of nesting season of the year 2012 according to watching nesting of the birds in mentioned year. The own watching was carried out since 9 th April to 30 th June 2012. There are 6 species in this zoo which breed successfully regularly: the <b>Cattle</b> <b>Egret</b> (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis),</b> the Little Egret (Egretta garzetta), the Black-crown Night-heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), the Glossy Ibis (Plegadis falcinellus), the Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia) and the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus). One species ? the Black Stork (Ciconia nigra) bred {{for the very first time}} in this zoo in 2012. Especially successful is the Greater Flamingo breeding in the Ohrada Zoo. The Eurasian Spoonbill, The Black-crown Night-heron, the Glossy <b>Ibis</b> and the <b>Cattle</b> <b>Egret</b> breeding is successful in relation to breeding conditions in this zoo, too. The nesting season of the year 2012 was exceptionally successful for the <b>Cattle</b> <b>Egrets,</b> the Eurasian Spoonbills and the Glossy Ibises, on the contrary this nesting season was not very successful for the Little Egrets...|$|R
5000|$|The ibises (collective plural ibis; {{classical}} plurals ibides and ibes) are a {{group of}} long-legged wading birds in the family Threskiornithidae, that inhabit wetlands, forests and plains. [...] "Ibis" [...] derives from the Latin and Ancient Greek word for this group of birds.

40|$|Paratanaisia spp. was {{recorded}} {{from the right}} kidney of a <b>cattle</b> <b>egret</b> (<b>Bubulcus</b> <b>ibis)</b> in Kafr Elsheikh governorate, Nile Delta, Egypt. The bird showed marked emaciation and dissipation. Necropsy findings revealed marked enlargement and brownish discoloration of the kidney. Microscopic examination demonstrated marked dilatation of renal tubules with hyperplasia of lining epithelium due to presence of a trematode consistent withParatanaisia spp. Eggs of this parasite were also noticed deeply within the interstitial tissue, surrounded with mononuclear cell infiltration, thus indicating their pathogenic potential.
