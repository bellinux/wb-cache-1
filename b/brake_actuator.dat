40|$|International audienceAutomotive light {{vehicles}} are complex systems involving many different dynamics. On one side, vertical, roll and pitch behaviours are often related to comfort performances (indeed, roll is also linked to safety characteristics [23]). On the other hand, safety performances are mainly {{characterized by the}} longitudinal, lateral and yaw dynamics [38, 14]. In practice, these two behaviours are often treated in a decoupled may (the first dynamics are often related to suspensions systems while the second one to steering and braking systems). This chapter focuses on the safety problem, and more specifically, on lateral and yaw dynamics. It presents two close techniques to design robust gain-scheduled H∞ MIMO VDSC (Vehicle Dynamic Stability Controller), involving both steering and rear <b>braking</b> <b>actuators.</b> Both approaches aim at restoring the yaw rate of the vehicle {{as close as possible}} to the nominal motion expected by the driver. The specific framework of each of that approaches is given below. First, a methodology allowing to synthesize such a controller while taking into account the <b>braking</b> <b>actuator</b> limitations and use the steering actuator only if it is necessary, is presented. The proposed solution is coupled with a local ABS strategy to guarantee slip stability and make the solution complete. The originality relies on the LPV formulation of the saturation-like function of the allowable braking force directly during the synthesis step. Secondly, the control design methodology aims at using the steering action to control the yaw rate and at limiting the use of the <b>braking</b> <b>actuator</b> only when the vehicle goes toward instability. Judging the vehicle stability region is done from the phase-plane of the side-slip angle and its time derivative, which is used to monitor the car dynamical behaviour. These controllers are both treated in an original way by the synthesis of a parameter dependent controller built in the LPV framework and by the solution of an LMI problem.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} the design of {{intelligent}} actuator logic for Electro-Mechanical Brake (EMB) system using fuzzy control. Previous studies simplified EMB system as a linear system or removed coulomb friction and backlash for the convenience of calculation. However, nonlinear components such as coulomb friction and backlash should be considered because the inherent nonlinearity in the high operating speed of EMB system is critical. Therefore, in this paper, we adopt full Brake by Wire (BBW) model of EMB system. Unlike Electro-Hydraulic Brake (EHB) system, EMB has no hydraulic back-up system, and is operated totally by electric and electro-mechanical components. Therefore, safety is the {{one of the most important}} problems in designing an EMB system. To control the EMB system, we developed fuzzy logic controller, which is effective in a complex and nonlinear system. MATLAB SIMULINK is used to provide the verification of the control performance. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy logic controller forces the EMB actuator to follow the command input precisely. This study will be a base of further research, whose purpose is to develop an intelligent actuator logic using adaptive fuzzy control for EMB system in noise and disturbance.

40|$|Heavy goods {{vehicles}} exhibit poor {{braking performance}} in emergency situations {{when compared to}} other vehicles. Part of the problem is caused by sluggish pneumatic <b>brake</b> <b>actuators,</b> which limit the control bandwidth of their antilock braking systems. In addition, heuristic control algorithms are used that do not achieve the maximum braking force throughout the stop. In this article, a novel braking system is introduced for pneumatically braked heavy goods vehicles. The conventional <b>brake</b> <b>actuators</b> are improved by placing high-bandwidth, binary-actuated valves directly on the brake chambers. A made-for-purpose valve is described. It achieves a switching delay of 3 – 4 [*]ms in tests, which is an order of magnitude faster than solenoids in conventional anti-lock braking systems. The heuristic braking control algorithms are replaced with a wheel slip regulator based on sliding mode control. The combined actuator and slip controller are shown to reduce stopping distances on smooth and rough, high friction (μ[*]=[*] 0. 9) surfaces by 10 % and 27 % respectively in hardware-in-the-loop tests compared with conventional ABS. On smooth and rough, low friction (μ[*]=[*] 0. 2) surfaces, stopping distances are reduced by 23 % and 25 %, respectively. Moreover, the overall air reservoir size required on a heavy goods vehicle is governed by its air usage during an anti-lock braking stop on a low friction, smooth surface. The 37 % reduction in air usage observed in hardware-in-the-loop tests on this surface therefore represents the potential reduction in reservoir size that could be achieved by the new system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} tolerating soft errors in brake-by-wire systems. Soft errors are caused by ionizing particles and manifest themselves as bit-flips in memory registers, latches, and flip-flops. As transistors are shrunk to sustain Moore's law, the frequency of such radiation-induced faults increases. The overall goal of the thesis is to design and evaluate cost-efficient techniques to tolerate soft errors in control systems. To emulate the effects of soft errors, we inject single bit-flips into the registers and the main memory of a microcontroller running a prototype brake controller. We first evaluate {{a version of the}} brake controller in which hardware exceptions are the only means for detecting errors. These experiments show that although many of the injected errors are masked by the brake controller program, a non-negligible proportion of the errors caused the controller to produce erroneous outputs to the <b>brake</b> <b>actuator.</b> We designed two software implemented mechanisms for detecting and recovering soft errors in the brake controller.

Recently, microprocessor-controlled prosthetic knees, which rely on magneto-rheological (MR) technology, have become available and have the potential to meet these needs.
