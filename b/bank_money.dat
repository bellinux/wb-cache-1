25|$|Since central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> {{currently}} exists {{mainly in}} the form of electronic records (electronic money) rather than {{in the form of}} paper or coins (physical money), open market operations can be conducted by simply increasing or decreasing (crediting or debiting) the amount of electronic money that a bank has in its reserve account at the central bank. This does not require the creation of new physical currency, unless a direct payment bank demands to exchange a part of its electronic money against banknotes or coins.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} an {{increased}} demand for base money, the central bank must act if it wishes to maintain the short-term interest rate. It does this by increasing the supply of base money: {{it goes to the}} open market to buy a financial asset, such as government bonds. To pay for these assets, new central <b>bank</b> <b>money</b> is generated in the seller's loro account, increasing the total amount of base money in the economy. Conversely, if the central bank sells these assets in the open market, the base money is reduced.|$|E

Banks have the legal obligation to return funds held in demand deposits immediately upon demand (or 'at call'). Demand deposit withdrawals can be performed in person, via checks or bank drafts, using automatic teller machines (ATMs), or through online banking.|$|E

Conversely, selling of securities by the central <b>bank</b> reduces the <b>money</b> supply.|$|R

25|$|According to the New York Times and the Saturday Evening Post, {{the first}} bank robbery in the United States {{occurred}} in March 1831 (the 19th {{according to the}} Times, the 20th according to the Post).

This allowed them to empty the vault of more than $245,000 in <b>bank</b> <b>money.</b> According to the Times, it cannot be confirmed {{if this was a}} robbery or a burglary. The Post later corrected this claim upon learning of a previous 1798 robbery of $162,821 from the Bank of Pennsylvania at Carpenters' Hall.

The authors argue that apart from the reserve requirement, prudential regulations also play important roles in constraining the money supply. Specifically, they study three Basel III regulations and theoretically analyze their standalone and collective impacts. The authors find that 1) the money multiplier under Basel III is not constant but a decreasing function of the monetary base; 2) the determinants of the <b>bank's</b> <b>money</b> creation capacity are regulation-specific; 3) the effective binding regulation and the corresponding money multiplier vary across different economic states and bank balance sheet conditions...|$|R

The paper concludes by discussing the major unresolved questions about <b>banking,</b> <b>money,</b> and price level determination. ...|$|R
