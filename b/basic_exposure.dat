40|$|The paper {{describes}} <b>basic</b> <b>exposures</b> of two Al and Mg alloys behaviour {{changes during}} the {{high cycle fatigue}} loading, which were detected using acoustic emission (AE) method and analysis of load frequency changes of the electromagnetic loading device. The electro-resonance fatigue test machine works with loading frequency corresponding with resonance of the whole loading system. In case that the rigidity of the tested sample is changed (cyclic hardening or softening in the initial part of loading, fatigue crack initiation and crack spreading etc.) this frequency is changed. It means {{that it is possible}} to estimate approximately the length of these stages. From practical point of view the most important is the identification of the fatigue crack spreading phase of course, but in case of detailed analysis some changes of frequency can be detected in the stage of “stable ” mode. Much more detailed information about changes of mechanism of cyclic damage is provided by AE method application, which identifies plenty of damage mechanisms. In the case of basic study the count of oversight of AE over predefined thresholds is captured. It is again possible to relatively reliably determine the length of initial changes phase and the phase of fatigue crack propagation from the records...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the numerical {{evaluation of the}} electroencephalogram (EEG) electrode artifacts that are caused during exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF), in volunteers study. The scope {{of the study is}} to differentially present the electromagnetic (EM) power absorption and local Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) distribution, with and without the electrodes. Versions of two <b>basic</b> <b>exposure</b> scenarios are evaluated: flat layered tissue phantom and anatomical head model exposed to plane wave or patch antenna radiation at operating frequency of 1966 MHz. Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is used in order to model the computational domain. E-field distributions and SAR values are calculated. The electromagnetic power absorption by the brain tissues is correlated with the presence of the EEG electrodes and the relative positioning of their leads. Results conclude in significant alternations in EM power absorption, E-field and SAR distributions, due to the co-polarization between the leads and the E-field. Concerning the realistic scenario, the presence of 32 electrodes and their leads enhances (11 % without and 12. 3 % with electric contact) the psSAR 10 g, comparing to the reference simulation...|$|E

40|$|What are the {{considerations}} {{of the composer}} when designing music to accompany a visual? Music is purposefully included within audiovisual products with considered reason; motivic, thematic, emotive, semantic or otherwise. Ultimately, music is employed to affect an audiovieweri, yet {{the consequences of this}} multi-modal interaction lacks clarity. Investigating cross-modal interaction at the level of <b>basic</b> <b>exposure</b> to audiovisual works provides a foundation in understanding the audioviewer's percept. The moving image and music are intrinsically temporal and consequently carry rhythmic potential. In the context of concurrent non-literal music (often referred to as ‘background’ or ‘non-digetic’ music) and moving images, our unified perception of the presentation is structured upon the interpretation of intrinsic audiovisual rhythms. Such rhythms are constructed via the periodic structure of transients within their individual modalities, and crucially cross-modally as auditory and visual transient patterns interact. Multimodal integration studies have shown that synchronous audiovisual stimuli will bind, creating a unified percept functioning to increase the 'transientness' of such events. Dynamic attending theory understands that attention is subject to internalised oscillations, following peaks and troughs to create an oscillation of attentional magnitude cycles. The potential for auditory rhythmic manipulation to influence the unified audiovisual percept is engaging...|$|E

40|$|Social {{indicators}} are a vital tool {{for planning and}} social reporting especially in the present era of uncertainness and change. The governing of complex and changing societies not only requires statistical measurements but systems that combine myriad facts into policy guidelines that identify {{the state of the}} present and point to future consequences (Frones, 2007). Policymakers and social services planners are increasingly aware and rely on social indicators to guide the making of social policy (Land, 2000).
