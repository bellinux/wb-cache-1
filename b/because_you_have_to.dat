[...] Lu, along with Robert Gibbs and several other Obama staffers, read Obama's manuscript for The Audacity of Hope and provided him with several editorial suggestions.|$|E
500|$|Colin Salmon plays James Middleton, a {{civil servant}} who sits between the British {{government}} and the Ministry of Defence. Salmon previously worked with Sky1 on Hex. He was attracted to the role in Strike Back due to the script being [...] "a page-turner, and they're rare. It's really lovely to sit down to start reading something and then {{not be able to}} stop <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know what's going to happen next," [...] as well as hearing of who was involved in the project. A member of The Prince's Trust charity, Salmon took the opportunity to visit some of their projects in Soweto while the series was filmed.|$|E

500|$|Newcomers Amanda Detmer and Chad E. Donella {{were cast}} as {{students}} Terry Chaney and Tod Waggner, respectively. [...] "When I first read the script, {{the thing that}} struck me most was that the characters were well-written and the relationships between them were strong and believable," [...] Detmer said. [...] "That's important, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> care about these people {{in order to be}} worried about what might happen to them". [...] Detmer defined Terry as [...] "very put-together [...] seems content to defer to [...] – to not make waves. But the stress of what happens affects their relationship and interestingly enough brings out a certain strength in her". On the other hand, Donella observed how similar his role was to himself. [...] "I believe in fate. I think you come into this life with some things to accomplish and you're taken out earlier or later depending on the game plan".|$|E

The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just {{get up there and}} screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't do a lot of videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E

[...] Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper said the incident had [...] "shocked the nation" [...] and called for a day of mourning. Valery Vienneau, Bishop of Bathurst, read a message on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI stating: [...] " [...] expresses sentiments of deep sympathy and spiritual closeness to the members of their families and to all staff and students who have been touched by this tragedy.

Nairn, who was cast to play Hodor from previously knowing Game of Thrones casting director from an audition {{he did for}} the film Hot Fuzz, admitted {{in an interview that}} he was at first unaware of his impending death in the show. He stated, [...] "First I heard from friends, people who had read the script, some other cast members. I think I said laughingly, [...] "So did I survive?" [...] They just gave me a look, and I was like, [...] "Whaat?" [...] Then I had the call from David and Dan, the fateful call everyone gets when your number's up. Then I read the script – which I loved. I loved the scene. I can't think of a better way to go, really. He doesn't give up. He never lets go of that door. For all costs, he's going to stop them from getting to Bran." [...] Reflecting on playing the role, Nairn also went on to note, [...] "People always joke, [...] "Oh you've got the easiest role, you don't have any lines to learn." [...] Anyone who knows anything about acting has been like, [...] "You actually have one of the hardest roles."

500|$|McKidd has {{referred}} to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as [...] "soulmates." [...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{allowing}} {{directors and}} writers {{to work within}} Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has [...] "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but {{the way that you}} get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." [...] For the Russos in The Winter Soldier, they {{had to deal with the}} idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, [...] "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film." [...] Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team [...] "come up with conceptually what we want to do" [...] for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling.

[...] Malone stated that [...] "it was a very structured process" [...] and that the [...] "chaos can only come from a grounded, logical base <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know where you're going to be spinning from.

2500|$|For the film's opening crawl, Lucas {{originally}} wrote {{a composition}} consisting of six paragraphs with four sentences each. He said, [...] "The crawl {{is such a}} hard thing <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be careful that you're not using too many words that people don't understand. It's like a poem." [...] Lucas showed his draft to his friends. Director Brian De Palma, who was there, described it: [...] "The crawl at the beginning {{looks like it was}} written on a driveway. It goes on forever. It's gibberish." [...] Lucas recounted what De Palma said {{the first time he saw}} it: [...] "George, you're out of your mind! Let me sit down and write this for you."

2500|$|IGN's Jeremy Dunham {{said of the}} PS2 version, [...] "there isn't much to find {{beyond the}} horrendous {{controls}} and suspiciously bad gameplay." [...] He was critical of the control system, saying [...] "Admirable as the attempt at a new attack system may be, we think that a more traditional method of attack {{would have been a}} better way to go." [...] He was also critical of the graphics, and concluded, [...] "Blade II has turned into our most recent poster child for how NOT to make a movie-licensed videogame." [...] Hilary Goldstein was equally unimpressed with the Xbox version. He too was critical of the combat system, finding it too limiting: [...] "The combat system seems to be begging for more. Chains, grabs, fluidity. But those things are absent. <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> use the thumbstick, and because the thumbstick represents the direction of an attack and the attack itself, combat seems very stilted." [...] He was also critical of the story, missions and AI, referring to the game as [...] "a momentary distraction in video game life." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a Rolling Stone {{interview}} in 2000, Rose mentioned {{that part of}} the delay of the album was him [...] "educating himself about the technology that's come to define rock", stating, [...] "It's like from scratch, learning how to work with something, and not wanting it just to be something you did on a computer." [...] The album was reportedly near completion in mid-2000 when producer Roy Thomas Baker convinced Rose to re-record the entire album, causing further delays. In 2004, bassist Tommy Stinson stated that the album was [...] "almost done" [...] and that it was held back by [...] "legal issues". Stinson also said delays were caused by Rose making sure every band member had a say in each song, mentioning that [...] "it's a lengthy process <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get eight people to basically write a song together that everyone likes." [...] Stinson also stated Rose was a perfectionist and an engineer involved on the album claimed that [...] "Axl wanted to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on infinitely, which is what they've done." [...] Geffen A Tom Zutaut stated the record [...] "could have been out by September 2002".|$|E
