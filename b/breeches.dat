These included the tragedy Punishment without Revenge, and the romantic comedies Don Gil of the Green <b>Breeches</b> and A Lady of Little Sense, which ran in repertory with {{a cast of}} ten actors in all three plays between September and December 2013. It was later transferred to the Arcola Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the area}} resembles Pennsylvania in climate, {{vegetation}} and wildlife. The park is near the southern limit for eastern hemlock and eastern white pine. Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. The surrounding forests contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Persistent Trillium, which grows near Rhododendron. Nearby boulderfields by Blood Mountain include Dutchman's <b>breeches,</b> squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E
5|$|Swannell {{played as}} a forward, {{and in his}} last Test {{specifically}} at number eight. He was an unconventional and hard rugby player, known for his violent play. He would turn up for training in unwashed kit, and wore the same pair of <b>breeches</b> for every game, again unwashed. His poor personal hygiene and overly violent playing style, made him an unpopular character {{in the eyes of}} other players.|$|E

40|$|Background Vaginal <b>breech</b> {{delivery}} can be {{a difficult}} obstetric procedure. The well-known Term <b>Breech</b> Trial concluded that planned elective caesarean section at term was safer for the babies than planned vaginal birth. This resulted in widespread adoption of protocols favouring planned caesarean section for <b>breech</b> presentation. However, daily experience shows that vaginal <b>breech</b> deliveries are still conducted in our hospitals. Objectives and methods This study was done to: 1) determine the reasons why vaginal <b>breech</b> deliveries still occur with live babies at Chris Hani Baragwanath hospital, despite {{the adoption of a}} protocol for elective caesarean section for <b>breech</b> presentation at term; 2) to audit the quality of clinical notes given the potential medicolegal hazards associated with <b>breech</b> delivery; and 3) to describe neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with vaginal <b>breech</b> delivery. This was a retrospective descriptive study and audit of vaginal <b>breech</b> deliveries, using a period sample of vaginal <b>breech</b> births of babies alive {{at the onset of the}} second stage of labour, and weighing 800 g or more at birth. Data collection was by review of maternal and neonatal case notes. Results Results There were 90 women with eligible vaginal <b>breech</b> deliveries. Four (4...|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{most of the}} regiment's life, the 52nd Foot wore {{traditional}} British Army red coats, with buff facings. During the American wars, {{the coat}} was long tailed, with buff facings, buff waistcoat and <b>breeches.</b> The grenadier company wore a bearskin hat with the King's Crest and the regimental number. Officers wore crimson sash, gorget and silver epaulettes.|$|E
5|$|Up {{until the}} middle part of the 20th century, it was {{customary}} to wear Tudor style under-dress, consisting of white silk embroidered doublet, <b>breeches,</b> full hose, white doeskin pumps with satin bows and a sword belt with sword, under the robes. Nowadays, morning dress or a lounge suit is worn, except for coronations when Tudor under-dress is worn by the canopy-bearers.|$|E
5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered twin gun turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three <b>breeches</b> too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
50|$|In {{the third}} period, from the 36th gestational week onward, the {{incidence}} of cephalic and <b>breech</b> presentations remain stable, i.e. <b>breech</b> presentation around 3-4% and cephalic presentation approximately 95%.

40|$|Mulesing is a {{means of}} blowfly strike control in Australian Merinos. Among {{potential}} mulesing alternatives, selective breeding for resistance is widely viewed to be the best long-term solution. Using data from the CSIRO <b>Breech</b> Strike Resistance Flock at Armidale (n= 1656), heritability and phenotypic correlations between <b>breech</b> strike and indicator traits (including <b>breech</b> and crutch cover, wrinkles, dags, urine stain and fleece characteristics) are reported. Weaner <b>breech</b> strike heritability was estimated at 0. 32 (0. 11). With the exception of dags (0. 09) all of the <b>breech</b> strike indicators were at least moderately heritable (> 0. 20). <b>Breech</b> wrinkle and dags were the indicator traits most closely correlated phenotypically with <b>breech</b> strike (both 0. 22) ...|$|R

5|$|During the 19th century, the regiment, {{in common}} with other Yeomanry and Militia units, sported a range of uniforms. Jackets were always dark blue. Between 1812 and 1873, a leather shako was worn, {{replaced}} in 1873 by a fur Busby with a red cloth bag. Service dress during the First World War was a khaki tunic and <b>breeches,</b> with a red stripe down the seam and a red lanyard worn by all ranks round the left armpit. The chevrons of sergeants and corporals were surmounted by a regimental badge on a red baize backing, a practice that continued through the inter-war years and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Glorious carried four BL 15-inch (381mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, {{one each}} fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her {{secondary}} armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three <b>breeches</b> too close {{together and the}} 23 loaders tended to interfere with one another. This negated the mount's intended high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast of the mainmast on Glorious. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|The IJN {{made several}} {{changes to the}} ship as she was repaired. Her {{fighting}} top was removed and her boilers were replaced by 16 Miyabara water-tube boilers. She retained her main guns, but their <b>breeches</b> were replaced by Japanese-built ones. Her secondary armament of eight 152 mm guns in twin turrets were retained, while her four casemated 152 mm guns were replaced by six Japanese-built 15 cm/45 41st Year Type guns; her light armament was revised to ten QF 12-pounder 12 cwt and four 37mm guns. Four 18-inch above-water torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament. Her crew now numbered 668 officers and crewmen.|$|E

5|$|The Regency period saw a {{shift in}} fashion that was largely {{determined}} by George. After political opponents put a tax on wig powder, he abandoned wearing a powdered wig in favour of natural hair. He wore darker colours than had been previously fashionable as they helped to disguise his size, favoured pantaloons and trousers over knee <b>breeches</b> because they were looser, and popularised a high collar with neck cloth because it hid his double chin. His visit to Scotland in 1822 led to the revival, if not the creation, of Scottish tartan dress {{as it is known}} today.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recruits}} to {{the force}} in 1873 were issued uniforms comprising scarlet Norfolk jackets – issued from the militia stores and chosen {{on the advice}} of Colonel Patrick Robertson Ross and Governor Alexander Morris – brown belts, white helmets, grey <b>breeches</b> and brown boots, with a round forage cap for their undress uniform. The grey trousers were soon replaced with blue ones, with a yellow stripe along the sides. These early uniforms were quite plain, and commissioned officers and their enlisted men wore essentially the same uniform.|$|E
5|$|The hussar cavalry were garbed in a black, {{light blue}} {{collared}} dolman, sometimes {{with a black}} pelisse. Black overalls were worn over tight <b>breeches</b> of the hussar style. The hussars also wore a black Shako. The sword and equipment were originally of Austrian design. The Uhlan squadron wore a green kurtka or lancer's jacket with red facings and a traditional czapka cap, their uniform being {{a copy of the}} Austrian Graf von Meerveldt Uhlan Regiment. The lance had a red and yellow pennon. By 1815, the Uhlans were wearing all-black uniforms, but retained the yellow-topped czapka.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract Objective. To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between maternal TSH and <b>breech</b> presentation at term. Design. Combined data sets of two prospective studies to obtain adequate epidemiological power. Patients: 1058 healthy pregnant women (58 <b>breech,</b> 1000 cephalic) and 131 women who presented in <b>breech</b> at an obstetrical outpatient clinic. Measurements: Maternal thyroid parameters (TSH, FT 4, TPO-Ab) and fetal presentation were assessed in both groups between 35 - 38 weeks gestation. Power calculations suggested that at least 148 <b>breech</b> cases were required. Results. The characteristics {{of the women in}} <b>breech</b> in both samples were similar. Women in <b>breech</b> (n= 58 + 131) had significantly higher TSH (but not FT 4) than those (n= 1000) with cephalic presentation (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0. 003). Different cut-offs were used to define high TSH in the 916 TPO-Ab negative women with cephalic presentation: the 90 th, 95 th and 97. 5 th percentiles were 2. 4 mIU/l (n= 149), 2. 7 mIU/l (n= 77) and 3. 2 mIU/l (n= 37). The prevalence rates of <b>breech</b> presentation in these women were all higher compared to the prevalence of <b>breech</b> in women below these cut-offs (df= 1, p 90 th percentile (> 2. 4 mIU/l) to present in <b>breech</b> was 1. 82 (95 % CI: 1. 30 - 2. 56). Conclusions. Women with high TSH at end term are at risk for <b>breech</b> presentation. Substantial evidence for a relation between <b>breech</b> presentation and neurodevelopmental delay exists. Since high TSH during gestation has also been linked to poor neurodevelopment, the relation between <b>breech</b> presentation and poor neurodevelopment might be thyroid-related.

50|$|The highest {{possible}} probability of <b>breech</b> presentation of 50% indicates that <b>breech</b> presentation {{is a consequence}} of random filling of the intrauterine space, with the same probability of <b>breech</b> and cephalic presentation in a longitudinally elongated uterus.|$|R
5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools {{is one of}} the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men would wear shirts made of piña raffia with a Chinese-style collar, black <b>breeches,</b> and cotton berets. Women wore piña dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered their hair with cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted to cut their hair short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Formerly, men {{not wearing}} {{military}} uniform wore knee <b>breeches</b> of an 18th-century design. Women's evening dress included trains and tiaras or feathers {{in their hair}} (or both). The dress code governing formal court uniform and dress has progressively relaxed. After World WarI, when Queen Mary wished to follow fashion by raising her skirts {{a few inches from}} the ground, she requested a lady-in-waiting to shorten her own skirt first to gauge the king's reaction. King GeorgeV was horrified, so the queen kept her hemline unfashionably low. Following their accession in 1936, King GeorgeVI and his consort, Queen Elizabeth, allowed the hemline of daytime skirts to rise. Today, there is no official dress code. Most men invited to Buckingham Palace in the daytime choose to wear service uniform or lounge suits; a minority wear morning coats, and in the evening, depending on the formality of the occasion, black tie or white tie.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 3, King Völsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen <b>breeches</b> tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E
50|$|The {{action was}} {{controlled}} by a handle, normally mounted vertically {{on the right side}} of the <b>breech.</b> When lifted, the handle operated a cam that forced the <b>breech</b> to rotate counter-clockwise, unlocking the interrupted thread. The entire <b>breech</b> was then pulled rearward with the same handle, sliding on a ring-shaped holder. The <b>breech</b> holder was hinged on one side, normally the left, so when the <b>breech</b> block was slid all the way to the rear it could be rotated out of the way for loading.|$|R
5000|$|Birth attendant's skill (and {{experience}} with <b>breech</b> birth) - The {{skill of the}} doctor or midwife {{and the number of}} <b>breech</b> births previously assisted is of crucial importance. Many of the dangers in vaginal birth for <b>breech</b> babies come from mistakes made by birth attendants. With the majority of <b>breech</b> babies being delivered by cesarean section there is more risk that birth attendants will lose their skills in delivering <b>breech</b> babies and therefore increase the risk of harm to the baby during a vaginal delivery.|$|R

5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{southern}} Blue Ridge Mountains, the area surrounding the lake consists of many valleys, ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions, starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1.5 billion years ago. The resulting landscape created diverse topology containing many different species of plants and animal. Much of the area is similar to Pennsylvania in climate, vegetation and wildlife. The lake is near the southern limit for Eastern hemlock and Eastern white pine. Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. Forests surrounding the lake contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Painted Trillium, which grows near Rhododrendron. Boulderfields near Sosebee Cove include Dutchman's <b>breeches,</b> squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E
25|$|Spanish <b>breeches,</b> rather stiff ungathered <b>breeches,</b> {{were also}} popular {{throughout}} the era.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} decade saw Spanish <b>breeches</b> as {{the most}} popular. These were stiff <b>breeches</b> which fell above or just below the knee and were rather moderately fitted. By the mid-1650s, in Western Europe, much looser, uncollected <b>breeches,</b> called petticoat <b>breeches</b> became the most popular. As the 1650s progressed, they became larger and looser, very much giving {{the impression of a}} lady's petticoat. They were usually decorated with many yards of ribbon around the waist and around the ungathered knee {{on the outside of the}} leg. Alongside the petticoat <b>breeches,</b> a collected but still loose fitted <b>breeches</b> called rhinegraves, were also worn. By the early 1660s, their popularity surpassed petticoat <b>breeches.</b> They were usually worn with an overskirt over them. The overskirt was heavily decorated with ribbon on the waist and the bottom of the skirt. Its length was usually just above the knee, but could also extend past the knee so that the rhinegraves underneath could not be seen and only the bottom of the stocking-tops was visible.|$|E
