40|$|The {{potential}} {{of small businesses}} is inhibited by a cocktail of problems of which inaccessibility to finance is pre-eminent. This problem {{is linked to the}} lenders’ risk estimation, often based on financial indicators which small businesses are not adept at using to signal their performance ability. This situation, especially in South Africa, with a history of a people who were previously disadvantaged does not aid the development of small businesses that may well be the antidote for overcoming the strain of poverty and unemployment in the country. This study stems from the human capital theory and investigated possible relationships between owner-manager characteristics and loan default propensity. The aim being to unveil non-financial variables, associated with the owner-manager which could be relied upon by lenders’ to estimate the loan default propensity of the small <b>business</b> <b>borrower.</b> Primary data collected in South Africa were empirically analysed for possible associations between owner-manager characteristics and loan default propensity. Results revealed business size-dependent differences in the association between certain owner-manager characteristics and business loan default propensity. The implication of this for all stakeholders is that considerations for small business lending should be sensitive to business size. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{banks are}} {{the major source of}} {{external}} finance for small businesses. The bank funds are needed to finance the day-to-day operations, purchase of capital equipment, and building needs. The small businesses do have access to the capital market, especially where equity finance is concerned,and thus rely heavily on bank loans for both short- and long-term needs. When granting loans to small businesses, bankers make decisions under conditions of uncertainty and asymmetry of information (Binks et al, 1992) Under these conditions, one party has certain pieces of information that have a material effect on a contract, but not the other party, and such a situation can give rise to a twin problem of moral hazard and adverse selection. In the former situation, the issue arises where the action of a small <b>business</b> <b>borrower</b> is not directly observable by the banker once he or she obtains the loan. This borrower may use the funds for other purposes which are personally profitable, but may be detrimental to the banker. In an adverse selection situation, a banker cannot distinguish between the good risk and the bad risk borrowers. A small business owner when approaching the bank for a loan has always an informational advantage over the banker, which leads him (the business owner) to overstate the soundness of his business proposition in relation to the funding sought. This problem sometimes affects the willingness of banks to enter into contracts to supply the needed funds to small businesses. The problem of adverse selection often lead bankers to commit errors in their decisions on lending to small businesses. Deakins and Hussain (1994) categorise the adverse selection as Type I and Type II errors. Type I error is where a banker turns down a good business proposition which {{turns out to be a}} success, while Type II error is where a banker accepts a proposition which turns out to be a business failure. Bankers may be concerned only with avoiding Type II error and not Type I, as the latter will not affect them unless the banks fail to achieve their targets. This partly explains why some small business propositions which have high potential for growth and profitability are turned away by the banks. At the branch level, bank managers often make their decisions on small business applications against a background of rules and instructions from their head offices (Fletcher, 1995). There are many variables which influence the rules and the work environment, and affect the lending decision. The decision on lending to small businesses is thus a process of interaction between the rules and a manager's experience. The extent of variability is affected by the interpretation of the rules and accountability in interpreting these rules. One extreme is the strict interpretation of the rules, which is a product of their rigour and detail. Where they lack detail or are imprecise, then the decision will depend on the interpretation, accountability and level of ambiguity. At the other extreme, the decision is made on the complete use of one's own experience and attitude and depends on the conviction of the value of the bank manager's own experience-Furthermore, because of the asymmetry of information in lending to small businesses. some elements of qualitative and intuitive analysis are required In decision-making. This paper attempts to discuss the influence of heuristics or intuition in the bank managers' lending decisions on small businesses, and its implication on the availability of funds to the small business sector in Malaysia...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the risk-return efficiency of credit policies for managing portfolio credit risk of banking institutions. The focus of the empirical analysis is on the impact of risk pricing and problem loan restructuring on bank risk and returns using a simulation model that represents an operating environment of lenders servicing the Australian farm sector. Insurance theory principles and agency relationships between a borrower and a lender are integrated into the portfolio theory framework. The portfolio theory framework is then couched in terms of the capital budgeting approach to generate a portfolio return distribution function for a particular credit policy regime. Borrowers are segmented by region, industry, loan maturity and credit risk class. Each credit risk class defines risk constraints on which a stochastic simulation model may be developed for credit scoring an average borrower in a portfolio segment. The stochastic simulation method is then used to generate loan security returns for a particular credit policy regime through time with loan return outcomes weighted by the number of borrowers in a segment to give measures of portfolio performance. Stochastic dominance efficiency criteria are used to choose between distributions of NPV of bank returns measured for a number of credit policy alternatives. The findings suggest that banks servicing the Australian farm sector will earn more profit without additional portfolio risk if the maximum limit to which pricing accounts for default risk in loan reviews is positively linked to volatility of gross incomes of farm <b>business</b> <b>borrowers.</b> Importantly, credit-underwriting standards must also be formulated so as to procure farm <b>business</b> <b>borrowers</b> of above average productivity with loans that are fully secured using fixed assets.

40|$|An {{overdraft}} is a lending instrument, usually {{offered by}} banks, {{that for a}} predetermined period allows the borrower to overdraw his account up to a predetermined limit. The timing and size of withdrawals is {{at the discretion of}} the borrower except, of course, when the credit limit is reached. Lending by Australian banks is predominantly by overdrafts and some attention has been focussed in the past on explaining the behaviour of overdraft advances. Individual demands for credit can therefore be characterised as censored (that is, subject to an upper limit). In practice there are only aggregate data for advances by overdrafts, which creeates difficulties for estimating the behavioural parameters for the demand for advances by overdraft. This paper develops a theory of aggregation of a group of individual demands that are each censored. A measure of credit rationing can also be derived from the approach. The approach is implemented using Australian data for three classes of <b>business</b> <b>borrowers.</b> The results support the view that the observed aggregate quantity of advances by overdraft is determined by both supply and demand factors. This finding is consistent with earlier work by researchers using Australian data. The significance of the present results lies in the attention paid to aggregation and the implications this has for the specification of the estimating equations. A second benefit of the approach is that it permits direct estimation of the distribution of rationed credit demands. The correctly aggregated equation specifies the observed stock of advances as a weighted average of constrained and unconstrained demands for credit, where the weights are interpreted as the probability that an individual borrower faces a binding credit limit. In that limited sense the probability measure, which varies over time, indicates the likelihood and distribution of credit rationing in the overdraft sector. These estimated probabilities are calculated for the three classes of <b>business</b> <b>borrowers</b> (agriculture, commerce and manufacturing) and are similar to the overdraft utilisation ratios in these sectors, which are independent measure of tightness in credit markets. ...|$|R

While an unsecured short-term loan is repaid from the borrower's future cash flow, a loan secured by accounts receivable (a unique form of"inside"collateral) is repaid from previously generated and observed sales (the borrower's trade credit terms to its customers). Consequently, lenders that secure accounts receivable are most concerned with the credit risk of the borrower's customers and the borrower's ability to continue to generate new sales.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{imperfect}} information plays {{a much more}} important role in financing “informationally opaque” small businesses than in financing large companies. 1 This chapter examines the asymmetric information issue in entrepreneurial finance from two perspectives: the effects of relationship lending and the impacts of credit market concentration on entrepreneurial financial behavior. These two perspectives are strongly linked to each other via the asymmetric information issue in entrepreneurial finance. Existing literature has recognized the important role played by relationship lending in alleviating the problem of asymmetric information. However, mixed empirical results have been reported. For example, {{it has been found}} that the development of relationship lending can improve the availability of finance for small <b>businesses</b> <b>borrowers</b> (Petersen and Rajan, 1994) and reduce the costs of finance (Berger and Udell, 1995). Meanwhile, with monopoly power, banks may extract rents, in terms of charging higher-than-market interest rates, from small businesscustomers who have very concentrated banking relationships (Ongena and Smith, 2001). In addition, both favorable and unfavorable effects of credit market concentration on financing small businesses have been acknowledged. Small <b>business</b> <b>borrowers</b> may have to pay a higher-than-market price on loans (Degryse and Ongena, 2005) {{and are more likely to}} be financially constrained (Cetorelli, 2004) than in competitive markets. On the other hand, empirical studies have shown that market concentration create a strong motive for lenders to invest in private information from small business customers, and therefore a concentrated market is more efficient in terms of private information acquisition (Han et al., 2009 b). The objective of this chapter is to investigate, by reviewing existing literature, the role played by relationship lending and the effects of market concentration on financing entrepreneurial businesses that are supposed to be informationally opaque. In the first section we review literature on the important role played by asymmetric information in entrepreneurial finance from two perspectives: asymmetric information and relationship lending, and the theoretical modeling of asymmetric information. Then we examine the relationship between capital market conditions and entrepreneurial finance and attempt to answer two questions: Why is the capital market condition important for entrepreneurial finance? and What are the effects of capital market conditions on entrepreneurial financial behavior in terms of discouraged borrowers, cash holding, and the availability and costs of finance...|$|R

Results indicate that supply conditions worsened most for the banks that were most exposed to the interbank market and for those that made the most use of securitization. While the initial capital position of banks did not significantly affect their lending, the deterioration of bank capitalization as proxied by charge-offs and profitability had a significant impact.
