5|$|A 2013 review {{said that}} there is enough {{suggestion}} of potential benefit from ketogenic diets in cancer therapy that establishing clinical trials is probably warranted. At present the only evidence of <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> anecdotal, but designing effective trials to measure the effect of adopting a ketogenic diet could prove challenging.|$|E
5|$|Acupuncture is {{no better}} than placebo, usual care, or sham {{acupuncture}} for nonspecific acute pain or sub-chronic pain. For those with chronic pain, it improves pain {{a little more than}} no treatment and about the same as medications, but it does not help with disability. This pain <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> only present right after treatment and not at follow-up. Acupuncture may be a reasonable method to try for those with chronic pain that does not respond to other treatments like conservative care and medications.|$|E

5|$|After battle, a {{currency}} called Grade is awarded or subtracted based on specific criteria that are fulfilled in battle. It {{is used to}} purchase bonuses during New Game Plus. Players are also prompted to cook food after battles {{if they have the}} materials. Cooking recipes determine the benefits received such as health recovery. The degree of the <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> determined by which character is chosen to cook.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} and has {{according to some}} reports been common in relatively recent times. As with lead, bismuth poisoning can result {{in the formation of}} a black deposit on the gingiva, known as a bismuth line. Poisoning may be treated with dimercaprol; however, evidence for <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> unclear.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{hand washing}} {{appears to be}} {{effective}} in reducing the transmission of cold viruses, especially among children. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials to normal hand washing provides greater <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> unknown. Wearing face masks when around people who are infected may be beneficial; however, there is insufficient evidence for maintaining a greater social distance.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} liberal social reforms {{in areas like}} censorship, homosexuality, divorce, education, and worker {{participation}} in company management were introduced, whilst social security <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> significantly increased. Increases were made in unemployment benefits, while substantial improvements in <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> made for farmers, students, war invalids, the sick, families with many children, women, and pensioners between 1970 and 1975, {{which led to a}} doubling of benefit and social security payments during that period. By 1979, old age and survivors’ <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> 53% higher in real terms than in 1970, while family <b>benefits</b> <b>were</b> 95% higher.|$|R

5|$|There are no interventional {{studies that}} {{directly}} show mortality benefit of cholesterol lowering in FH. Rather, evidence of <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> {{derived from a}} number of trials conducted in people who have polygenic hypercholesterolemia (in which heredity plays a smaller role). Still, a 1999 observational study of a large British registry showed that mortality in people with FH had started to improve in the early 1990s when statins were introduced.|$|E
5|$|Withdrawal is best {{managed by}} {{transferring}} the physically dependent patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam {{because it has}} the longest half-life {{of all of the}} benzodiazepines, is metabolised into long-acting active metabolites and is available in low-potency tablets, which can be quartered for smaller doses. A further <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> that it is available in liquid form, which allows for even smaller reductions. Chlordiazepoxide, which also has a long half-life and long-acting active metabolites, can be used as an alternative.|$|E
5|$|A {{country with}} a large trade surplus would {{generally}} see {{the value of its}} currency appreciate relative to other currencies, which would reduce the imbalance as the relative price of its exports increases. This currency appreciation occurs as the importing country sells its currency to buy the exporting country's currency used to purchase the goods. Alternatively, trade imbalances can be reduced if a country encouraged domestic saving by restricting or penalising the flow of capital across borders, or by raising interest rates, although this <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> likely offset by slowing down the economy and increasing government interest payments.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two levels}} of {{benefits}} for pesticide use, primary and secondary. Primary <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> direct gains {{from the use of}} pesticides and secondary <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> effects that are more long-term.|$|R

50|$|The {{argument}} for taxation {{of social welfare}} <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> that they result in a realized gain for a taxpayer. The argument against taxation <b>is</b> that the <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> generally less than the federal poverty level.|$|R
5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the standard length of treatment. In those with an annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish VKA treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show {{an increased risk of}} recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making. Thrombophilia test results rarely {{play a role in the}} length of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This has in part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (bariatric surgery). This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. Bariatric surgery is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> again uncertain.|$|E

30|$|Two broad {{categories}} of <b>benefit</b> <b>were</b> identified: primary <b>benefit</b> (n[*]=[*] 470) and secondary benefit (n[*]=[*] 49). Primary <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> {{those which are}} related to the justification for undertaking the imaging, e.g., abnormality detection, to assist in diagnosis or staging, or acting as an aid to clinical decision making, or intervention. Secondary <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> those that are not related to the justification for imaging, e.g., to promote patient engagement and understanding or to facilitate communication.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{overview}} of tax benefits granted by Estonian legal acts is given, and extent of tax benefits use by resident natural persons using the data from databases of Estonian Tax and Customs Board (ETCB) is analyzed. Also the possibility of tax <b>benefits</b> classification <b>is</b> considered and to whom and on which purposes stated tax <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> addressed is analyzed. Research based on three years data shows that in Estonia tax <b>benefits</b> for individuals <b>are</b> widely used. On average uncollected amounts of tax due to tax benefits approximately equal 9 % of the state budget revenues. Large amount of tax <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> not a negative indicator per se but they aid distributed incomes to reach people who really need those benefits. In opposite case tax <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> not reasoned but they rather create additional administrative workload. Talking about Estonian tax system roughly half of tax <b>benefits</b> <b>is</b> addresses to people who belong to low income stratum, {{at the same time}} remarkable proportion of <b>benefits</b> may <b>be</b> directed to middle-class and wealthy people...|$|R
5|$|The Puerto Rico Department of the Family {{currently}} {{provides the}} benefits to each participating family through a debit card, which replaced the physical cheques in the early 2000s. The monthly <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> deposited through an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system into a government-designated personal bank account, which can be accessed at any time with the debit card to withdraw cash or to make food purchases from authorized retailers. Since September 2001, 75% of each family’s monthly benefit has been designated exclusively for making direct food and grocery purchases, while the remaining 25% can be withdrawn as a cash benefit. The EBT debit card system has improved the program’s payment accuracy rate to 96.4% in 2003, 4 years ahead of its 2007 goal of 95% accuracy.|$|E
5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no tailpipe emissions. In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon dioxide emissions. However, this <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> mostly local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, these emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's battery is depleted and the gasoline-powered engine engages, the plug-in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E
5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air <b>benefit</b> <b>is</b> usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

5000|$|Employees - {{along with}} {{potential}} employees - {{tend to view}} <b>benefits</b> that <b>are</b> mandated by regulation differently from <b>benefits</b> that <b>are</b> discretionary, that is, {{those that are not}} mandated but are simply designed to make a compensation package more attractive. <b>Benefits</b> that <b>are</b> mandated are thought of as creating employee rights or entitlements, while discretionary <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> intended to inspire employee loyalty and increase job satisfaction. Based on this, Klonoski proposed definitions of both discretionary and non-discretionary benefits as a manager would view them: [...] "Discretionary employee <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> those organizational programs and practices that are not mandated by regulation or market forces, and that improve employee performance by increasing job satisfaction and/or organizational loyalty. Non-discretionary employee <b>benefits</b> <b>are</b> those organizational programs and practices that are mandated by regulation or market forces, and that create an employee right, entitlement, or expectation." ...|$|R
