60|$|As {{the stream}} of logs came up into the mill the first log was shunted off the chain upon a carriage. Two men {{operated}} this carriage by levers, one to take the log up to the saw, {{and the other to}} run it back for another cut. The run back was very swift. Then a huge black iron head butted up from below and turned the log over as easily {{as if it had been}} a straw. This was what made the jar and crash. On the first cut the long strip of bark went to the left and up against five little circular saws. Then the five pieces slipped out of sight down chutes. When the log was trimmed a man stationed near the huge <b>band-saw</b> made signs to those on the carriage, and I saw that they got from him directions whether to cut the log into timbers, planks, or boards. The heavy timbers, after leaving the saw, went straight down the middle of the mill, the planks went to the right, the boards in another direction. Men and boys were everywhere, each with a lever in hand. There was not the slightest cessation of the work. And a log forty feet long and six feet thick, which had taken hundreds of years to grow, was cut up in just four minutes.|$|E

50|$|While {{somewhat}} {{similar to a}} band saw, a scroll saw uses a reciprocating blade rather than a continuous loop. Like a hand coping saw, the scroll saw's blade can be removed and placed through a pre-drilled starting hole, allowing interior cutouts to be made without an entry slot. Also, the fineness in both width and tooth count of a scroll's blade permits significantly more intricate curves than even the narrowest gauge <b>band-saw</b> blade.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} was {{developed}} which {{enabled us to}} obtain high-resolution images {{of the distribution of}} an oil-borne stain in a saw-textured plywood surface. The method involved treating 90 µm thick plywood sections, which had been cut transversely through the wood-coating interface using a sliding microtome, with osmium tetroxide (OsO 4) prior to examination with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) operating in backscattered electron imaging (BEI) mode. The combination of OsO 4 staining and use of FE-SEM-BEI afforded excellent contrast differentiation between the coating and wood cell walls, revealing coating penetration into even nano-size cell wall cracks and delaminations formed during <b>band-sawing</b> of the plywood. The novel technique described adds a new dimension to probing wood–coating interface...|$|R
50|$|The PL-4A is a sport {{airplane}} {{intended to}} answer {{the need for a}} well designed, all-metal airplane which is easy to build, easy to fly, with low initial and operating costs, and folding wings so that it may be towed behind an automobile and stored at home. It is a low-wing airplane, VW-powered, with a closed or open cockpit large enough to accommodate even very large persons, and a generous baggage compartment. A “T” tail configuration improves rudder effectiveness and prevents the stabilator from interfering with the folded wings.Wing: In order to favor takeoff and climb performance, a high aspect ratio of 8 is used, which in combination with a large diameter, slow turning prop should provide good performance even at high altitude airports. The airfoil is the NACA 633418, which has a mild stall and a good overall performance even at “standard roughness.” The 18% thickness provides a deep spar, high torsional rigidity, and makes possible the simple, compact fittings at the wing folding joint, which are <b>band-sawed</b> from aluminum plate. The chord is constant at 40 in., and there is no washout.The ailerons have differential travel to minimize, adverse yaw. They are hinged at the bottom skin with standard piano hinges, as in the PL-1 and 2, providing smooth airflow {{over the top of the}} “down” aileron, and a good gap seal. The mass balance is concentrated in a lead weight attached to an arm extending into the wing box.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the energy}} {{estimates}} for a damped linear homogeneous beam-like equation will be considered. The energy estimates will be studied for different BCs (Boundary Conditions) for the axially moving continuum. The problem has physical and engineering application. The applications are mostly occurring in models of conveyor belts and <b>band-saw</b> blades. The research study {{is focused on}} the Dirichlet, the Neumann and the Robin type of BCs. From physical point of view, the considered mathematical model expounds the transversal vibrations of a moving belt system or moving <b>band-saw</b> blade. It is assumed that a viscous damping parameter and the horizontal velocity are positive and constant. It will be shown in this paper that change in geometry or the physics of the boundaries can affect the stability properties of the system in general and stability depends on the axial direction of the motion. In all cases of the BCs, it will be shown that there is energy decay due to viscous damping parameter and it will also be shown that in some cases there is no conclusion whether the beam energy decreases or increases. The detailed physical interpretation of all terms and expressions is provided and studied in detail...|$|E
40|$|Deck and {{stringer}} boards’ manufacturing {{for wood}} pallet production requires complex management {{due to the}} variability of the logs used as raw material. An analysis was carried out on a representative sawmill in north-eastern Italy; the manufacturing line was composed of a <b>band-saw,</b> a cut-saw and a multi circular saw machine connected by rollers and belts conveyors provided with buffers. A discrete event simulation model was built in order to investigate the possible inﬂuence of the variability of log diameter and of the productive layout on the actual production level. The simulations showed that the major advantage could come from an improvement in the layout, identifying the cut-saw machine as the main bottleneck of the manufacturing line. By adopting a different cutsaw machine, the productivity of the manufacturing line could increase up to+ 56 % in the daily production of deck and stringer boards showing an increased daily productive time of + 13 %. The effects of this change are evident especially for log diameters lower than 65 c...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of an axially accelerating string is investigated. The time dependent velocity {{is assumed to}} vary harmonically about a constant mean velocity. Approximate analytical solutions are sought using two different approaches. In the first approach, the equations are discretized first and then the method of multiple scales {{is applied to the}} resulting equations. In the second approach, the method of multiple scales is applied directly to the partial differential system. Principal parametric resonances and combination resonances are investigated in detail. Stability boundaries are determined analytically. It is found that instabilities occur when the frequency of velocity fluctuations is close to two times the natural frequency of the constant velocity system or when the frequency is close to the sum of any two natural frequencies. When the velocity variation frequency is close to zero or to the difference of two natural frequencies, however, no instabilities are detected up to the first order of perturbation. Numerical results are presented for a <b>band-saw</b> and a threadline problem. � 1997 Academic Press Limited 1...|$|E
40|$|From 1969 to 1972, Apollo astronauts {{collected}} 382 kg of rocks, soils, {{and core}} samples from six locations {{on the surface}} of the Moon. The samples were initially characterized, largely by binocular examination, in a custom-built facility at Johnson Space Center (JSC), and the samples have been curated at JSC ever since. Despite over 40 years of study, demand for samples remains high (~ 500 subsamples per year are allocated to scientists around the world), particularly for plutonic (e. g., anorthosites, norites, etc.) and evolved (e. g., granites, KREEP basalts) lithologies. The reason for the prolonged interest is that as new scientists and new techniques examine the samples, our understanding of how the Moon, Earth, and other inner Solar System bodies formed and evolved continues to grow. Scientists continually clamor for new samples to test their emerging hypotheses. Although all of the large Apollo samples that are igneous rocks have been classified, many Apollo samples are complex polymict breccias that have previously yielded large (cm-sized) igneous clasts. In this work we present the initial efforts to use the non-destructive techniques of micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and micro x-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) to identify large lithic clasts in Apollo 14 polymict breccia sample 14305. The sample in this study is 14305, 483, a 150 g slab of regolith breccia 14305 measuring 10 x 6 x 2 cm (Figure 1 a). The sample was scanned at the University of Texas High-Resolution X-ray CT Facility on an Xradia MicroXCT scanner. Two adjacent overlapping volumes were acquired at 49. 2 micrometer resolution and stitched together, resulting in 1766 slices. Each volume was acquired at 100 kV accelerating voltage and 98 mA beam current with a 1 mm CaF 2 filter, with 2161 views gathered over 360 deg at 3 seconds acquisition time per view. Micro-XRF analyses were done at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri on an EDAX Orbis PC micro-XRF instrument. Multiple scans were made at 40 kV accelerating voltage, 800 mA beam current, 30 m beam diameter, and a beam spacing of 30 - 120 micrometer. The micro-CT scan of 14305, 483 (Figure 2) was able to identify several large lithic clasts (approx. 1 cm) within the interior of the slab. These clasts will be exposed by <b>band-sawing</b> or chipping of the slab, and their composition more fully characterized by subsequent micro-XRF analysis. In addition to lithic clasts, the micro-CT scans identified numerous mineral clasts, including many FeNi metal grains, as well as the prominent fractures within the slab. The micro-XRF analyses (Figure 1 b,c) of the slab surfaces revealed the bulk chemical compositions (qualitative) of the different clast types observed. In particular, by looking at the ratios of major elements (e. g. Ca:Mg:Fe), differences among the many observed clast types are readily observed. Moreover, several clasts not apparent to the naked eye were revealed in the K:Al:Si ratio map. The scans are also able to identify small grains of Zr- and P-rich minerals (not shown), which could in turn yield important age dates for the samples...|$|R
40|$|Bamboo plies of 1 / 82 ̆ 2 and 1 / 322 ̆ 2 {{thicknesses}} were glued {{together to}} form multiple unidirectional and cross-ply laminates that measured 122 ̆ 2 by 122 ̆ 2. The thickness of each laminate was between 0. 252 ̆ 2 and 0. 3752 ̆ 2. All laminates were pressed together with a Tetrahedron MTP- 10 bench top precision press at 75 °F and 1000 lbf for 40 minutes. Laminates were then cut with a <b>band-saw</b> into four 32 ̆ 2 by 122 ̆ 2 test specimens, 24 hours after pressing. Each test specimen was three-point bend tested to identify the modulus of rupture (MOR) and apparent bending stiffness. Three-point bend testing was also performed on laminates that were cut from four commercially produced longboard skateboard decks. The manufacturer described the laminates used for each longboard skateboard deck as: a bamboo-core fiberglass sandwich, 5 plies of laminated bamboo, 7 plies of Canadian Maple and a hybrid of bamboo and Canadian Maple. Additional testing was performed on self-constructed laminate orientations that exhibited similar or greater MOR or apparent bending stiffness values to the commercially available longboard skateboard decks to identify the variability associated with gluing and pressing these laminate orientations. These laminates had significantly different MOR and apparent bending stiffness values compared to previously constructed laminates, despite having the same laminate orientation. The variance in MOR and apparent bending stiffness values {{is believed to be}} a result of the quantity of glue used to create each laminate, mechanical property differences in each bamboo ply utilized and differences associated with laminating due to the curvature of each bamboo ply...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Radiology and {{computed}} tomography {{are the most}} commonly available diagnostic tools for the diagnosis of pathologies affecting the head and skull in veterinary practice. Nevertheless, accurate interpretation of radiographic and CT studies requires a thorough knowledge of the gross and the cross-sectional anatomy. Despite the increasing success of reptiles as pets, only a few reports over their normal imaging features are currently available. The {{aim of this study}} is to describe the normal cadaveric, radiographic and computed tomographic features of the heads of the green iguana, tegu and bearded dragon. Results 6 adult green iguanas, 4 tegus, 3 bearded dragons, and, the adult cadavers of : 4 green iguana, 4 tegu, 4 bearded dragon were included in the study. 2 cadavers were dissected following a stratigraphic approach and 2 cadavers were cross-sectioned for each species. These latter specimens were stored in a freezer (− 20 °C) until completely frozen. Transversal sections at 5 [*]mm intervals were obtained by means of an electric <b>band-saw.</b> Each section was cleaned and photographed on both sides. Radiographs of the head of each subject were obtained. Pre- and post- contrast computed tomographic studies of the head were performed on all the live animals. CT images were displayed in both bone and soft tissue windows. Individual anatomic structures were first recognised and labelled on the anatomic images and then matched on radiographs and CT images. Radiographic and CT images of the skull provided good detail of the bony structures in all species. In CT contrast medium injection enabled good detail of the soft tissues to be obtained in the iguana whereas only the eye was clearly distinguishable from the remaining soft tissues in both the tegu and the bearded dragon. Conclusions The results provide an atlas of the normal anatomical and in vivo radiographic and computed tomographic features of the heads of lizards, and this may be useful in interpreting any imaging modality involving these species. </p...|$|E
