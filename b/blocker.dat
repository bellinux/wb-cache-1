Allison also continued to contribute defensively, playing in all 16 regular season games and recording an interception and fumble recovery.|$|E

5|$|Trinidad {{traveled}} to San Diego, California and defeated the IBF welterweight champion Maurice <b>Blocker</b> in two rounds, {{in a fight}} card that took place on June 19, 1993, televised by Showtime. Trinidad spent the first two minutes of the fight analyzing Blocker's style. With 11 {{seconds left in the}} first round, one of Trinidad's punches injured <b>Blocker,</b> who barely survived the round. In the second round, the champion's condition appeared to improve, but after the first 30 seconds, another Trinidad punch injured him. Trinidad followed with a combination, scoring a knockout at 1:49 in the round when the referee stopped the fight. Afterwards, tournament organizer Don King's exclusive relationship to stage fights for the cable channel Showtime meant that Trinidad would be showcased regularly on Showtime Championship Boxing.|$|E

5|$|Allison {{played for}} the Waterloo Lutheran Golden Hawks in college as a quarterback, where he led his team {{to play in the}} 8th Vanier Cup. After being drafted {{in the first round of}} the 1973 CFL Draft and traded to the Toronto Argonauts, he was {{converted}} to a defensive back. Over the course of his professional career, Allison made seven interceptions, recovered five fumbles, and contributed on the special teams both as a <b>blocker</b> and a return specialist.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his most}} {{prevalent}} skills are his speed and wrist shot, {{the latter of}} which has improved alongside his recent years of increased offensive production. He is also proficient at taking faceoffs. On the penalty kill, he is an efficient shot <b>blocker,</b> using his body {{to get in the}} way of pucks. While competing on the powerplay, he often uses his size and strength to maintain position in front of the opposing net to either screen the goaltender or deflect shots.|$|E

Nearly two {{months into the}} subsequent season, Cloutier recorded his 100th career NHL win, making 31 saves in a 3–1 victory over the Ottawa Senators on November 27, 2003. As the season progressed, Cloutier suffered several more injuries, {{the first of which}} was a groin injury in December 2003 that sidelined him for three games. He missed three more games before the season ended with cases of the flu and a lower-body injury. On February 14, 2004, he was fined $1,000 by the league for hitting opposing forward Ronald Petrovický in the face with his <b>blocker</b> during a game against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{head coach}} Buddy Parker saw Johnson's {{value as a}} <b>blocker</b> and moved him to fullback. In his first season with Detroit in 1957, he led the team in rushing, {{carrying}} for 621 yards and five touchdowns. In the 1957 NFL Championship Game, which was won by the Lions 59–14 over the Cleveland Browns, Johnson carried seven times for 34 yards, caught a sixteen-yard pass, and recovered a fumble on defense. Going into the 1958 season, the Lions looked to continue their success, and Johnson {{was expected to be}} the team's primary ball carrier. However, Johnson missed several games due to injuries, and the Lions finished with a 4–7–1 record and one of the league's worst rushing offenses.|$|E
5|$|Norton Internet Security 2000, {{released}} January 10, 2000, was Symantec's {{first foray}} beyond virus protection and content control filters.

5|$|The CFM56 is {{designed}} to support several reverse thrust systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and <b>blocker</b> doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing {{the thrust of the}} engine and slowing the aircraft down.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel <b>blocker</b> nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of vasospasm detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{quantify}} the potential harm of beta <b>blockers</b> {{in patients with}} peripheral arterial disease. Materials and methodsAll randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta <b>blockers</b> with placebo for the outcomes of claudication and maximal walking distance and time, calf blood flow, vascular resistance and skin temperature were searched using the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PubMed and CINAHL. Trials comparing different types of beta <b>blockers</b> were excluded. ResultsSix RCTs fulfilling the above criteria, {{with a total of}} 119 patients, were included. The beta <b>blockers</b> studied were atenolol, propranolol, pindolol and metoprolol. None of the trials showed a statistically significant worsening effect of beta <b>blockers</b> on the outcomes measured. There were no reports of any adverse events with the beta <b>blockers</b> studied. ConclusionsCurrently, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that beta <b>blockers</b> adversely affect walking distance in people with intermittent claudication. Beta <b>blockers</b> should be used with caution if clinically indicated, especially in patients with critical ischaemia where acute lowering of blood pressure is contraindicated...|$|R

5|$|Treatment is by prompt {{neurosurgery}} or radiologically guided interventions. Medications such as labetalol may {{be required}} to lower the blood pressure until repair can occur. Efforts to treat fevers are also recommended. Nimodipine, a calcium channel <b>blocker,</b> is frequently used to prevent vasospasm. Routine use medications to prevent further seizures is of unclear benefit. Nearly half of people with a SAH due to an underlying aneurysm die within 30 days and about a third who survive have ongoing problems. 10–15 percent die before reaching a hospital.|$|E
5|$|Dax helps Worf save Kor, and {{afterwards}} takes {{possession of the}} sword because she thinks the two Klingons cannot be trusted with it. The three make camp and sleep through the night, but Dax is awoken by a scuffle between Kor and Worf. The fight between them stops momentarily after Toral and his men arrive. After Toral is subdued, Kor and Worf again attack each other. Jadzia shoots them both with her phaser set to stun and then forces Toral to deactivate the transport <b>blocker</b> so that the three can return to the Runabout. After they depart the planet, Kor and Worf realize that if the sword divided two men as honorable as they, it {{would do the same}} to the Klingon Empire, so they beam it into space, leaving it to drift until the Klingon Empire is ready for it.|$|E
