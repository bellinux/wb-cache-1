30|$|The model {{consisted}} of 40 blood culture <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> an inserted cannula with a needle-free closed connector. Twice a day, each line was manipulated while instilling 1 mL {{of two different}} fluids (saline and propofol). We manipulated the bottles as follows: ten <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> clean gloves and disinfecting connectors with alcohol (controls), ten <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> hands (no gloves), ten <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> gloves impregnated with a 0.5 McFarland (MF) solution of Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and ten <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> gloves impregnated with a 0.05 MF solution of SA. The bottles were incubated in a BACTEC System at 37 °C under continuous agitation up to 10 days. When a bottle turned positive, 100 μL of the fluid was cultured and incubated followed by microorganism identification using standard procedures.|$|R

At the time, Excedrin was packaged in plastic <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> the mouth of the <b>bottle</b> sealed <b>with</b> foil and the lid secured to the <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> plastic wrap.|$|R
60|$|Directly {{the first}} crate was, in {{accordance}} with his directions, carried into the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the straw with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall's carpet. And from it he began to produce bottles--little fat bottles containing powders, small and slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids, fluted blue bottles labeled Poison, <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> round bodies and slender necks, large green-glass bottles, large white-glass <b>bottles,</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> glass stoppers and frosted labels, <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> fine corks, <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> bungs, <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> wooden caps, wine bottles, salad-oil bottles--putting them in rows on the chiffonnier, on the mantel, on the table under the window, round the floor, on the bookshelf--everywhere. The chemist's shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many. Quite a sight it was. Crate after crate yielded bottles, until all six were empty and the table high with straw; {{the only things that}} came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance.|$|R
