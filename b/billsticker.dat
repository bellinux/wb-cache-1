6000|$|... --He is {{down on his}} luck. He {{asked me}} {{to ask you to}} ask {{somebody}} named Boylan, a <b>billsticker,</b> to give him a job as a sandwichman.|$|E
6000|$|... --Thanks, Corley answered, you're a gentleman. I'll pay {{you back}} one time. Who's that with you? I saw {{him a few}} times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the <b>billsticker.</b> You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a {{crossing}} sweeper.|$|E

60|$|That sacred Herald's-College {{of a new}} Dynasty; we {{mean the}} Sixty and odd <b>Billstickers</b> with their leaden badges, are not sleeping. Daily they, with pastepot and cross-staff, new clothe the walls of Paris in colours of the rainbow: {{authoritative}} heraldic, as we say, or indeed almost magical thaumaturgic; for no Placard-Journal that they paste but will convince some soul or souls of man. The Hawkers bawl; and the Balladsingers: great Journalism blows and blusters, through all its throats, forth from Paris towards all corners of France, like an Aeolus' Cave; keeping alive all manner of fires.|$|R
60|$|Nothing to look at! That is indeed--you will find, if you {{consider}} of it--our sorrowful case. The vast extent of the advertising frescos of London, daily refreshed into brighter and larger frescos by its <b>billstickers,</b> cannot somehow sufficiently entertain the popular eyes. The great Mrs. Allen, with her flowing hair, and equally flowing promises, palls upon repetition, and that Madonna {{of the nineteenth century}} smiles in vain above many a borgo unrejoiced; even the excitement of the shop-window, with its unattainable splendours, or too easily attainable impostures, cannot maintain itself in the wearying mind of the populace, and I find my charitable friends inviting the children, whom the streets educate only into vicious misery, to entertainments of scientific vision, in microscope or magic lantern; thus giving them something to look at, such as it is;--fleas mostly; and the stomachs of various vermin; and people with their heads cut off and set on again;--still something, to look at.|$|R
6000|$|There {{is already}} a pretty lively sense in our English-speaking {{communities}} of the particular respect due to the young, and {{it is probable that}} those who publish these suggestive and stimulating prints do not fully realize the new fact in our social body, that the whole mass of the young now not only read but buy reading matter. The last thirty or forty years have established absolutely new relations for our children in this direction. Legislation against free art and free writing is, and one hopes always will be, intensely repugnant to our peoples. But legislation which laid stress not on the indecorum but on the accessibility to the young, which hammered with every clause upon that note, is an altogether different matter. We want to make the pantomime writer, the proprietor of the penny [...] "comic," [...] the <b>billsticker,</b> and the music-hall artist extremely careful, punctiliously clean, but we do not want, for example, to pester Mr. Thomas Hardy.|$|E
50|$|Sylvain Perier, professionally {{known as}} SP 38, is a French painter, street artist, <b>billsticker</b> and performer. He {{was born in}} 1960 in Coutances, Normandy (France). First {{classified}} as belonging to the Figuration libre artistic movement, this international figure of street art has produced artistic works in many countries.|$|E
