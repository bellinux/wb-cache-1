5|$|The book's general {{method is}} to present {{a wide range of}} {{examples}} from across the animal kingdom of each type of coloration, including marine invertebrates and fishes as well as terrestrial insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. The examples are supported by a large number of Cott's own drawings, diagrams, and photographs. This essentially descriptive natural history treatment is supplemented with accounts of experiments by Cott and others. The book had few precedents, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent follows (and criticises) Abbott Handerson Thayer's 1909 Concealing-Coloration in the Animal Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|Regardless of {{the actual}} impact of market {{integration}} on union density or on workers themselves, organized labor has been engaged {{in a variety of}} strategies to limit the agenda of globalization and to promote labor regulations in an international context. The most prominent example of this has been the opposition of labor groups to free trade initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). In both cases, unions expressed strong opposition to the agreements, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent pushed for the incorporation of basic labor standards in the agreement if one were to pass.|$|E
25|$|Already in 1603, {{the sources}} {{tell us that}} harpsichords {{were used in the}} Spanish and Portuguese synagogues in Hamburg. Particularly in the Amsterdam community, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> degree also in Hamburg and elsewhere, there was a flourishing of Classical music in the synagogues in the 18th century. There was {{formerly}} a custom in Amsterdam, inspired by a hint in the Zohar, of holding an instrumental concert on Friday afternoon prior to the coming in of the Shabbat, as a means of getting the congregants in the right mood for the Friday night service. An important Jewish composer was Abraham Caceres; music was also commissioned from non-Jewish composers such as Cristiano Giuseppe Lidarti, some of which is still used.|$|E

25|$|On 13 September 1492, Columbus {{observed}} that the needle of his compass no longer pointed to the North Star. The needle instead had varied a half point to the northwest, and continued to vary further as the journey progressed. Columbus at first {{made no mention of}} this, knowing his crew to be prone to panic with their destination unknown, but after several days his pilots took notice with much anxiety. Allegedly the crew grew so homesick and fearful that they threatened to sail back to Spain. Columbus reasoned that the needle did not point to the North Star, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> invisible point on the Earth. His reputation as an astronomer held weight with the crew, and his theory alleviated their alarm. It was once believed that Columbus had discovered magnetic declination, but it was later shown that the phenomenon was already known, both in Europe and in China.|$|E
500|$|Some reports however {{indicate}} that the legend was not seriously accepted: Carlyle suggests one near-eyewitness French account amounted to [...] "not a recantation of an impudent amazing falsehood, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> vague faint murmur or whimper of admission {{that it is probably}} false". Captain Diaz de Soria relates the story, probably apocryphal, that in 1840, the Prince of Joinville, while decorating the purported last survivor of Vengeur, would have told him [...] "we do this for the legend, my good man: nations, after all, live only of legends". In 1857, Guérin wrote [...] "one wonders how, after that, history could remain so credulous".|$|E
500|$|Pinfold's adopted {{defensive}} persona, [...] "a {{combination of}} eccentric don and testy colonel", {{was the same}} that Waugh cultivated to keep the world at bay. Pinfold adheres to an outmoded form of Toryism, does not vote, and expresses outrageous views, part-facetiously. Pinfold was [...] "absurd to many <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> rather formidable". After Waugh's death, Nancy Mitford confirmed the essentially mocking nature of Waugh's persona: [...] "What nobody remembers about Evelyn is that everything with him was jokes. Everything". While Waugh's biographer Selena Hastings describes Pinfold as [...] "an accurate and revealing self-portrait", Stannard {{suggests that it is}} primarily an analysis of the adopted persona in which, like Pinfold, Waugh [...] "gives nothing away".|$|E

500|$|Bird read a {{paper to}} the Senior Physical Society in 1839, {{reporting}} on tests he conducted of the effects on sparrows of poisoning by carbonaceous fumes. [...] This paper was of some importance and resulted in Bird giving his views to the British Association in the same year. (He acted as a secretary to the chemical section of the British Association in Birmingham.) [...] Bird also presented the paper at the Westminster Medical School, where Snow took {{a special interest in}} it. [...] Until then, Snow and many others had believed that carbonic acid acted merely by excluding oxygen. [...] The experiments of Bird and others convinced him that it was harmful in its own right, but he still did not subscribe to Bird's view that it was an active poison. [...] Also in 1839, Bird published a comprehensive paper in Guy's Hospital Reports, complete with many case histories, in which he documents the state of knowledge. [...] He realised that at least some cases of poisoning from stoves were due not to carbonic acid, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> other agent, although he still had not identified it as carbon monoxide.Coley, p. 366Vinten-Johansen, p. 90 ...|$|E

The inclination is typically not known, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent it can be determined from observed eclipses, be constrained from the non-observation of eclipses, or be modelled using ellipsoidal variations (the non-spherical shape of a star in binary system leads to variations in brightness {{over the course of}} an orbit that depend on the system's inclination).|$|E

[...] "The real place ceased to exist when its last resident was trundled off to a distant housing project", urbanist Roberta Brandes Gratz wrote a quarter-century later.

2500|$|The Damadim {{invasion}} {{was probably}} {{only the first}} in a series of events, responsible not only for Alodia's, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extend also Makuria's downfall. First there were the militant Mamluks, who seized power in Egypt from the Ayyubids in 1250 and quickly became very active on the southern frontier. Makuria became a target for several invasions and interventions during the 13th and 14th century, but apparently there was an expedition into East Sudan in 1316-17 too, chasing down Arab brigandines along Atbara river all the way to Jebel Kassala in Taka. On their way back the Mamluks plundered Al-Abwab for food, which was recorded as a splinter kingdom independent from Alodia since 1276 and is attested well into the second half of the 14th century. [...] The concrete circumstance of its secession remains unknown.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the waning}} of the Vijayanagara empire, Raja Wodeyar I (r. 15781617) {{became the first}} ruler of {{political}} importance at Mysore, having ousted the Vijayanagara governor at Srirangapatna. However, the fledgling kingdom still owed nominal allegiance to the diminished empire. The foundation of an independent state that would influence regional polity and culture was laid in this period. In the following decades, the Mysore court became the inheritor of the Vijayanagara literary legacy and a centre for textual production not only in Kannada, the native language, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent, even in Telugu and Sanskrit. The earliest available Kannada language writings from the Mysore court are by Tirumalarya I (or Tirumala Iyengar), Raja Wodeyar I's court poet. He composed the Karna Vrittanta Kathe (c.1600) in sangatya metre, a composition rendered {{to the accompaniment of}} an instrument. Raja Wodeyar I's grandson, Chamaraja VI (r. 16171637), is the earliest among the Mysore kings known for their personal contribution to the fine arts. The king wrote Chamarajokti Vilasa, a translation of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in the Valmiki tradition.|$|E
2500|$|I had {{a terrific}} {{friendship}} with Sheila Florance. In fact she acted in {{my very first}} film, and we always used to joke that I would make her a star. When I heard suddenly that she was dying of cancer I visited her immediately. There was no sentimentality or anything on her part—she was an incredible woman—but she said jokingly, 'There is still time to turn me into a star, but let's be quick.' I went home and spent three days and three nights writing the script and then with Barry Dickins and Sheila we did another draft. She was given eight weeks to live and so we made A Woman's Tale with this hanging over us. This motivated us, of course, but Sheila had a degree of greatness about her. She was a very powerful woman. It was an amazing challenge {{to make a film}} about life, in the face of death. To get the money of course was impossible and I had to pawn everything I had. People have asked me how we did it <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>some</b> extent we were idiotically courageous in taking this risk. Sheila and I joked all the time. I would say to Sheila, [...] "Please don't die on me or you'll kill me". She would reply, [...] "Don't worry I'll be a good girl." ...|$|E
