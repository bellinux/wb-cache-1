5|$|To {{keep costs}} down while {{ensuring}} sufficient longevity, Sega opted to create the platform from popular off-the-shelf components. The first model to be developed was actually the SC-3000, a computer version with a <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboard,</b> but when Sega learned of Nintendo's plans to release a games-only console, they began developing the SG-1000 alongside the SC-3000.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 Apple first {{implemented}} the Apple Desktop Bus allowing the daisy-chaining together {{of up to}} 16 devices, including arbitrarily many mice and other devices on the same bus with no configuration whatsoever. Featuring only a single data pin, the bus used a purely polled approach to computer/mouse communications and survived as the standard on mainstream models (including a number of non-Apple workstations) until 1998 when iMac joined the industry-wide switch to using USB. Beginning with the Bronze Keyboard PowerBook G3 in May 1999, Apple dropped the external ADB port in favor of USB, but retained an internal ADB connection in the PowerBook G4 for communication with its <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboard</b> and trackpad until early 2005.|$|E
2500|$|Smaller {{external}} keyboards {{have been}} introduced for devices without a <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboard,</b> such as PDAs, [...] and smartphones. Small keyboards are also useful {{where there is a}} limited workspace.|$|E
50|$|Apple's {{very first}} offering, the Apple I, was {{initially}} {{sold as a}} naked PCB without a keyboard (or a case), although some resellers and users fitted their own cases with <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboards</b> and Apple cooperated {{with at least one}} such reseller.|$|R
5000|$|Full-sized desktop {{keyboards}} with {{a dedicated}} numpad have function keys that can range up to F15, F16, or F19. F17-F19 keys were introduced with the aluminium USB keyboard. Compact keyboards {{such as the}} bluetooth wireless aluminium <b>keyboard</b> and the <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboards</b> on all Intel-based Macintosh notebooks range from F1-F12 only, just like IBM PC keyboards.|$|R
50|$|The {{very first}} Macs (the Macintosh and the Macintosh 512K) used {{proprietary}} connectors for the keyboard and mouse. The Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) was introduced with the Macintosh II and Macintosh SE. It was the standard input connector for keyboards and mice until USB was introduced with the iMac. The last Macintosh to have ADB was the Power Macintosh G3 (Blue & White), alongside the now-standard USB. Until February 2005, the PowerBook G4 and iBook G4 notebooks still used the ADB protocol {{to communicate with}} their <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboards</b> and trackpads, however they did not include any external ADB connectors.|$|R
2500|$|The {{exploration}} of musical synthesizers in the 1960s {{was a step}} towards the modern keyboard. As technology became more developed, huge synthesizers evolved into portable instruments {{that could be used}} in live shows. The rapid accumulation of momentum began in 1964 when Bob Moog produced his Moog synthesizer. It used a remote keyboard and was 'modular' in design. [...] (i.e. it was a rack that held boxes which each had a function. [...] At least one to create a tone controlled in pitch by a voltage input. [...] And usually a host of other modules including Filter(s), Amplifier(s), Envelope Generator(s) etc. [...] ) His next generation was equipped with a <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboard</b> in 1970; the Mini-Moog. These keyboards were monophonic, along with semi-modulars like the ARP2600, and were only able to respond to one note at a time. (Though 3 oscillators could be layered together in response to the 'control voltage' produced by that note.) ...|$|E

50|$|The Minimoog can be {{controlled}} using its <b>built-in,</b> 44-note <b>keyboard,</b> which is equipped with modulation and pitch-bend wheels or by feeding in an external one-volt-per-octave pitch-control voltage and triggering the envelope generators with an inverted switch trigger (S-Trigger in Moog terminology).|$|R
5000|$|The NeXTstation {{originally}} shipped with a NeXT MegaPixel 17" [...] monitor (with <b>built-in</b> speakers), <b>keyboard,</b> and mouse.

5000|$|A {{special case}} of the {{computer}} keyboard dome-switch is the scissor-switch. The keys {{are attached to the}} keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a [...] "scissor"-like fashion, and snap to the keyboard and the key. It still uses rubber domes, but a special plastic [...] 'scissors' mechanism links the keycap to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard. Typically scissor-switch keyboards also employ 3-layer membranes as the electrical component of the switch. They also usually have a shorter total key travel distance (2 mm instead of 3.5 - 4 mm for standard dome-switch keyswitches). This type of keyswitch is often found on the <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboards</b> on laptops and keyboards marketed as 'low-profile'. These keyboards are generally quiet and the keys require little force to press.|$|R

5000|$|In early 2002, Handspring ceased {{production}} of the Visor line, {{replacing it with a}} line of handhelds that were to be more [...] "communication-centric" [...] in nature; these would be sold under the name Treo. Except for the Treo 90, all Treo devices were smartphones with integrated cellular phones, and nearly all featured <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboards</b> to enhance e-mail and SMS functionality. The Treo line met with success, attributed in large part to Handspring's in-house VisorPhone software, which was tightly integrated with the Palm OS. The Springboard feature was no longer available on the Treo line, with Handspring favoring slimmer designs that left no room for the large slots necessary to support Springboard cartridges; peripheral technologies such as SDIO would soon render the Springboard platform obsolete. Additionally, technological advances meant that much of the functionality provided by Springboard modules, such as additional memory, a camera, MP3 player, Wi-Fi antenna, and GPS, could now be integrated into the handheld itself at reduced cost.|$|R

5000|$|Instruments with {{built-in}} effects include Hammond organs, electronic organs, electronic pianos and digital synthesizers. <b>Built-in</b> effects for <b>keyboard</b> typically include reverb, chorus and, for Hammond organ, vibrato. Many [...] "clonewheel organs include an overdrive effect. Occasionally, acoustic-electric and electric guitars will have built-in effects, {{such as a}} preamp or equalizer.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Apple IIe and Apple IIc <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboards</b> before it, the {{detached}} IIGS keyboard differs {{depending on}} what {{region of the world}} it was sold in, with extra local language characters and symbols printed on certain keycaps (e.g. French accented characters on the Canadian IIGS keyboard such as [...] "à", [...] "é", [...] "ç", etc., or the British pound [...] "£" [...] symbol on the UK IIGS keyboard). Unlike previous Apple II models, however, the layout and shape of keys were the same standard for all countries, and the ROMs inside the computer were also the same for all countries, including support for all the different international keyboards. In order to access the local character set layout and display, users would change settings in the built-in software-based control panel, which also provides a method of toggling between 50/60 Hz video screen refresh. The composite video output is NTSC-only on all IIGS systems; users in PAL countries are expected to use an RGB monitor. This selectable internationalization makes it quick and simple to localize any given machine. Also present in the settings is a QWERTY/DVORAK keyboard toggle for all countries, much like that of the Apple IIc. Outside North America, the Apple IIGS shipped with a different 220 V clip-in power supply, making this and the plastic keycaps the only physical differences (and also very modular, in the sense of converting a non-localized machine to a local one).|$|R
50|$|The Numeric Keypad IIe was Apple's first {{external}} keypad. Released as {{an option}} specifically for the popular Apple IIe computer in 1983, it helped correct some of the II series' shortcomings.

5000|$|The SDK-51 MCS-51 System Design Kit {{released}} 1982 contained all of {{the components}} of a single-board computer based on Intel's 8051 single-chip microcomputer, clocked at 12 MHZ. SDK-51 used the external ROM version of the 8051 (8031). Provides a serial port which can support either RS232 or current loop configurations, and also an audio cassette interface to save and load programs. Unlike some of Intel's other SDKs (e.g. SDK-85, SDK-86), the built-in monitor can only be controlled via the <b>built-in</b> QWERTY <b>keyboard</b> and cannot be commanded via the serial port. However, memory dumps and disassembly listings can be dumped out to the serial port, and it {{can also be used to}} transfer data to/from a connected PC in the form of Intel hex files.|$|R

50|$|At a {{hardware}} level, {{the most common}} incompatibility is the lack, in some Famiclones, of the original Famicom's expansion port (although it is always present, at least at a logical level, and in some clones it is internally hardwired; e.g. in computer-type Famiclones it is hardwired to the <b>built-in</b> <b>keyboard,</b> even if not externally accessible).|$|E
50|$|A former {{agent of}} EMS in the United States, Ionic Industries in Morristown, New Jersey, {{released}} a portable-keyboard VCS 3 clone.

50|$|In June 2002,AlphaSmart {{released}} the Dana product {{which was a}} radical departure from their standard product line. Similar to Apple Computer's Newton eMate 300 (a laptop running the Newton PDA operating system), the Dana, FCC ID KV2DANA001, was a fully fledged Palm OS device complete with a touch-screen, allowing a user to write directly on the screen via Graffiti in addition to typing on the <b>built-in,</b> full-size <b>keyboard.</b> The Dana's screen had a backlight and was capable of displaying complex graphics (though only in 4 bit grayscale), unlike the original AlphaSmart line. It had 8 mebibyte (MiB) of storage and two expansion slots for cards in Secure Digital (SD) or Multimedia Card formats. It was compatible with nearly every Palm OS application, and some Palm apps could take advantage of the Dana's extra-wide screen, which was 3.5 times the norm (560 x 160 pixels).|$|R
50|$|It {{ran on the}} Windows CE 2.11 {{operating}} system, Handheld PC Professional Edition 3.0, had a small trackpad {{with two}} buttons and a <b>built-in</b> miniature <b>keyboard.</b> It had 16 MB of RAM, 16 MB of ROM, Intel StrongARM CPU at 190 MHz, 640x480 256 color screen, 1 CF Type II, 1 PC card. It had a 10-hour battery life, and allowed for sending and receiving of faxes through its built-in modem. There is a software update to Handheld PC Professional Edition 3.01/Service Pack 1, and a 16 MB RAM upgrade card, bringing the RAM {{to a total of}} 32 MB. There is also an extended battery available, giving the Jornada 820 15 hours of running time, versus 10 in the standard battery. The Jornada 820 was bundled with TrueSync 2.0 to allow native synchronisation support for the Franklin Rex Classic and Rex Pro PDA.|$|R
