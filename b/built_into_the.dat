5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make jams and chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E

5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E
5|$|Twin {{depth charge}} tunnels were <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> rear {{hull of the}} Mogador-class ships. Each tunnel housed eight Guirard depth charges, with another sixteen stowed in the rear magazine. They were {{launched}} by remote control in patterns of four using a chain system.

5|$|Algocen Realty Holdings Ltd., {{the real}} estate branch on the Algoma Central Railway first {{commissioned}} The Algo Centre Mall project. The project was subsequently approved by the Ontario Municipal Board in 1978, with an estimated cost of $10 million. Construction then began in 1979 with the project being finished the next year. The 80-room Algo Inn, the town's largest hotel and retirement residence, was also <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mall. In its first year, 1980, the mall featured Woolco, Dominion, and Shoppers Drug Mart, {{and a total of}} 35 units. A distinct architectural feature of the building was rooftop parking.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has survived}} years of wear and warfare, {{one of the}} palace's wings is now in danger of {{collapsing}} into the Black Sea below. Cracks have begun {{to appear in the}} library, housing almost 10,000 books and manuscripts. Although Edward Blore had a state-of-the-art drainage system <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> palace's foundation, years of neglect and the construction of a nearby sewage pipe in 1974 have helped to increase the potential for a landslide. Another potential looming disaster is surrounding the medieval-style gatehouse near the palace's west side.|$|E
5|$|Broaches {{are shaped}} {{similar to a}} saw, except {{the height of the}} teeth {{increases}} over the length of the tool. Moreover, the broach contains three distinct sections: one for roughing, another for semi-finishing, and the final one for finishing. Broaching is an unusual machining process because it has the feed <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tool. The profile of the machined surface is always the inverse of the profile of the broach. The rise per tooth (RPT), also known as the step or feed per tooth, determines the amount of material removed {{and the size of the}} chip. The broach can be moved relative to the workpiece or vice versa. Because all of the features are <b>built</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> broach, no complex motion or skilled labor is required to use it. A broach is effectively a collection of single-point cutting tools arrayed in sequence, cutting one after the other; its cut is analogous to multiple passes of a shaper.|$|E
