500|$|In the Billboard {{magazine}} {{review of}} the album, contributor Katy Kroll wrote that Timberlake [...] "claims to be bringing 'sexy' back to pop music, and indeed he is. You can almost feel <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> rolling off the title track and 'SexyBack' featuring Timbaland". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards Timbaland, producer of the song, writing that Timbaland offers [...] "tougher, trickier rhythms, minimal live playing, a plethora of hip-hop cameos, and a self-consciously hard, edgy club sensibility" [...] to [...] "SexyBack". Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald noted, [...] "The producer's angular synthesizer crunch is all over it [...] at best on the single 'SexyBack' where they dispense with a chorus, leaving the song sustained by its vocal fireworks, electrofunk and Timberlake's repeated declaration that 'I'm bringing sexy back. PopMatters' contributor Quentin B. Huff wrote that [...] "SexyBack" [...] was the [...] "fraternal twin" [...] to Nelly Furtado's 2006 song [...] "Promiscuous". Andrew Murfett of The Age wrote that the song was a [...] "raunchy club banger that slyly suppresses" [...] Timberlake's customary falsetto. He continues, [...] "it's introduced a new phrase into the pop cultural lexicon". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday was complimentary towards the song, writing that it was [...] "Timberlake at his best, mainstreaming {{a combination of the}} wild, edgy dance-pop style of Basement Jaxx with Missy Elliott's more experimental hip-hop to create a boldly inventive sound that still pleases the masses." ...|$|E

Sir Henry Wood's bust is adorned with a laurel chaplet by representatives of the Promenaders, who often wipe an imaginary <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> from his forehead or make some similar gentle visual joke. Since 2006, the cost of standing place tickets has remained at just £5.00.

60|$|And Peter of Colfax, cornered and {{fighting}} for his life, was no marrowless antagonist, even against the Devil of Torn. Furiously he fought; in the extremity of his fear, rushing upon his executioner with frenzied agony. Great <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>sweat</b> stood upon his livid brow.|$|R

60|$|In {{possession}} of the weapon, the American turned toward the window from which had come the rescuing shot, and {{as he did so}} he saw the boy, Rudolph, clambering over the sill, white-faced and trembling.

60|$|He {{held out}} his hand as he spoke, and I grasped it firmly, thumb to thumb, keeping my elbow high so as to bear all my force upon it. His own trick was, as I observed, to gain command of the other hand by a great output of {{strength}} at the onset. This I prevented by myself putting out all my power. For a minute or more we stood motionless, gazing into each other's faces. Then I saw a <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> trickle down his forehead, and I knew that he was beaten. Slowly his grip relaxed, and his hand grew limp and slack while my own tightened ever upon it, until he was forced in a surly, muttering voice to request that I should unhand him.|$|R
60|$|Kells {{did not see}} the gun. In his madness {{he tried}} to move, to reach her, but he could not; he was sinking. His legs sagged under him, let him down to his knees, and but for the wall he would have fallen. Then a change {{transformed}} him. The black, turgid, convulsed face grew white and ghastly, with <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> clammy <b>sweat</b> and lines <b>of</b> torture. His strange eyes showed swiftly passing thought--wonder, fear, scorn--even admiration.|$|R

2500|$|On 22 August, Frankel won the Juddmonte International Stakes at York. This {{race was}} over 10 furlongs {{and was the}} first time that he raced over more than a mile. Consequently, there was much {{anticipation}} as to whether he would stay the extra distance. Starting at odds of 1/10 against eight rivals, he barely came off the bridle to win easily by seven lengths from Farhh, who was a nose ahead of four-time Group 1 winner St Nicholas Abbey in third. Most striking, was the dominance Frankel's very high cruising speed gave him, particularly now upped in distance to 10 furlongs. Indeed, TV footage of the aftermath in the Winners' Enclosure, shows Cecil in genuine awe of his equine protégé, running his hands down the horse's back to demonstrate there was hardly a <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> to be found. This was his eighth consecutive European Group 1 victory, breaking the previous record of seven in a row set by Rock of Gibraltar. After the race trainer Sir Henry Cecil said [...] "It's fantastic. It's great for Yorkshire and they deserved to see him." [...] He was attending the racecourse after missing Frankel's previous win due to ill health and said the win made him feel [...] "twenty years better.".|$|R

Our web page boasts the {{commitment}} to diversity and ensures that U of I Urbana-Champaign is the right place for you to be. I stare at these documents and feel a heart numbing coldness yet indescribable heat from the rage and pain that is engulfed within me. I was lied to. I look at the picture of the smiling face just as Black, if not darker, than mine. His eyes are illuminated with the glare from the camera. His blue shirt looks oddly out of place-as does heamongst the four other people {{on the cover of the}} pamphlet. As I look at the other people around him, three Whites and one Asian woman, I wonder where did this Black man come from. Does he really like it here? Then, just as I am about continue on to the next page I spot it: one solitary <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> on his forehead.

The film follows Hanuman’s encounter with Makari {{the daughter of the}} sea who wants to marry him, but instead through the swallowing <b>of</b> a <b>bead</b> <b>of</b> his <b>sweat</b> she gives birth to Makardhwaj who guards the gates of Patal (Hell) where Ram and Lakshman are taken when kidnapped. Hanuman gets the better of Makardhwaj and rescues Ram and Lakshman. A major battle ensues and Ahiravan and Mahiravan are killed, but somehow they keep regenerating.

60|$|One day Monsieur Ducroz {{seemed to}} be in great pain. He had been {{scarcely}} able to drag himself up the many stairs to Philip's room: and when he arrived sat down heavily, his sallow face drawn, with <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> <b>sweat</b> on his forehead, trying to recover himself.|$|E
60|$|He rose, {{absorbed in}} his {{successful}} find, and he pursued upon the table {{the process of}} smoothing the creases {{as much as possible}} from that priceless document. That done he took up a pen and attached his own signature alongside of Robespierre's; then into the blank space above he filled the name of Anatole d'Ombreval ci-devant Vicomte d'Ombreval. He dropped the pen and took up the sand-box. He sprinkled the writing, creased the paper, and dusted the sand back into the receptacle. And then of a sudden his blood seemed to freeze, and <b>beads</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>sweat</b> stood out upon his brow. There had been the very slightest stir behind him, and with it had come a warm breath upon his bowed neck. Someone was looking over his shoulder. An instant he remained in that bowed attitude with head half-raised. Then suddenly straightening himself he swung round and {{came face to face with}} Cecile Deshaix.|$|R
