500|$|The episode {{received}} rather negative reviews, since clip shows {{tend to be}} {{the least}} favorite episodes among fans. The episode has been described as [...] "framed {{in such a way as}} to still make [...] worth watching, like a slideshow that's not quite so boring", [...] "another clip show, although not the worst of them", and [...] "the episode title pretty much says it all". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said in a review: [...] "The romance related storyline fizzles. That leaves us with a good collection of clips, <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> can already watch them in their original episodes, why bother with this cheap excuse for product?" ...|$|E
500|$|F.R. Leavis {{argued that}} Boswell's {{criticisms of the}} play – [...] "that [...] has no sense of the theatre, and worse, cannot present or {{conceive}} his themes dramatically" [...] – were [...] "obvious", and that Irene was a failure because Johnson's best poetry (such as The Vanity of Human Wishes) was [...] "a poetry of statement, exposition and reflection: nothing could be remoter from the Shakespearean use of language [...] than the Johnsonian." [...] Like Eliot, Leavis suggested that the play {{might have been better}} if Johnson had not been determined to write it in blank verse:He is clearly determined that his verse shall not be changed into the 'periods of a declaimer', and that it shall not be said that the audience cannot easily perceive 'where the lines end or begin' (see his remarks on blank-verse in the Life of Milton). [...] In couplets, of course, he couldn't have written so dismally. [...] With the absence of rhyme and of the movement goes the absence of wit. [...] And without the wit he is without the Johnsonian weight. Johnson biographer Walter Jackson Bate has attempted to defend Irene, arguing that the reason why it is considered so bad is that the reader cannot help being aware that [...] "it is by one of the masters of English prose style (who also had a powerful command of one kind of poetic style), and it is also by one of the supreme critics of literature in whatever language". Bate claims that if contemporary readers were able to encounter the play without knowing who had written it, [...] "it would not seem too bad"; <b>but</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> cannot forget Johnson's achievements in other fields of literature, reading Irene is an especially depressing experience: [...] "the heart begins after a while to sink except in the most resolute Johnsonian, and sometimes even then." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Polannaruwa {{inscription}} of Vijayabahu is of {{much later}} date {{and does not}} first of all make any mention of any war or its out comes. It simply says that Vijayabahu fought many chieftains before consecrating the temple of Buddha's tooth relic in Polannaruwa. It neither mentions {{the names of the}} chiefs whom he fought with nor the outcomes. However, this alone cannot be taken as an evidence for the Lankan ruler not having fought cholas. <b>But</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> have the grants of Tiruvalangadu which appears not to have been a forgery, we may safely conclude that the chola involvement in [...] the region continued till very late in their rule. In fact, the inscriptions of Kulottunga I till the end of his rule around 1124 still call him 'Madurantaka and Ilamkondaan' meaning lord of Madurai and Ilangai (Sri Lanka).|$|E
2500|$|Cyril of Alexandria, his {{antagonist}} Theodoret, and Theodore of Mopsuestia, who was {{loose from}} all tradition, {{had the same}} clear belief. Cyril writes [...] "It is demonstrative of the gentleness and long-suffering of God, that Elias also the Tishbite shall shine upon us, to foreannounce when the Judge shall come {{to those in the}} whole world. For the Son shall come down, as Judge, in the glory of the Father, attended by the angels, and shall 'sit on the throne of His glory, judging the world in righteousness, and shall reward every man according to his works.' <b>But</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> are in many sins, well is it for us, that the divine prophet goes before Him, bringing all those on earth to one mind; that all, being brought to the unity through the faith, and ceasing from evil intents, may fulfill that which is good, and so be saved when the Judge cometh down. The blessed John the Baptist came before Him [...] "in the spirit and power of Elias." [...] But, as he preached saying, 'Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make His paths straight,' so also the divine Elias proclaims His then being near and all-but-present, that He may 'judge the world in righteousness.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Abe {{was arrested}} and interrogated over eight sessions. When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, [...] "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I {{wanted to take the}} part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories." [...] The {{interrogating}} officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. [...] "Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way." [...] Her answer was: [...] "I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. <b>But</b> <b>since</b> <b>we</b> were not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him....." [...] In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan, William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. [...] "She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love." [...] Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred {{at a time when the}} Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the Ni Ni Roku incident and a looming full-scale war in China. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time. The incident also struck a chord with the ero-guro-nansensu ("erotic-grotesque-nonsense") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.|$|E

As will be clear in the following, this implies that our data will be random vectors of rather high dimension (at least 72), and the estimate of the corresponding covariance matrix, to be used in the Mahalanobis distance, would need a very high number of simulated experiments, increasing thus too much the computational costs. We then looked for other metrics which are more computationally efficient also in presence of high dimensional data.|$|R
