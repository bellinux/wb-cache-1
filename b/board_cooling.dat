40|$|Natural {{convection}} heat transfer {{is found in}} many industrial applications such as nuclear technologies, electronic circuit <b>board</b> <b>cooling,</b> solar panel cooling and many other fields. When natural {{convection heat}} transfer coefficients are insufficient, passive heat transfer enhancement devices (called ribs/fins) are often used. In this paper, the effect of periodic patterns of protrusions (ribs) on the free-convection heat transfer of a vertical plate, with a uniform heat flux rate boundary condition, is experimentally investigated. The convective fluid is air. Two-dimensional, high resolution heat transfer measurements are performed by using infrared thermography and the heated thin foil technique. Experiments are performed on two types of ribs pattern topology: single or two staggered rows of ribs inclined at different angles and single or two-staggered rows of V-ribs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{considers}} {{a mathematical model}} of non-uniform cooling of electronic circuit boards. The block diagram of the system implementing this approach, the method of calculation of the electronic board temperature field, {{as well as the}} principle of its thermal performance optimizing are presented. In the considered scheme the main heat elimination from electronic board is produced by the radiator system, and additional cooling of the most temperature-sensitive components is produced by thermoelectric batteries. Are given the two-dimensional temperature fields of the electronic board during its uniform and non-uniform cooling, is carried out their comparison. As follows from the calculations results, when using a uniform overall cooling of electronic unit there is a waste of energy for the cooling 0 f electronic board parts which temperature is within acceptable temperature range without the cooling system. This approach leads to the increase in the cooling capacity of used thermoelectric batteries in comparison with the desired values. This largely reduces the efficiency of heat elimination system. The use for electronic <b>boards</b> <b>cooling</b> of non-uniform local heat elimination removes this disadvantage. The obtained dependences show that in this case, the energy required to create a given temperature is smaller than when using a common uniform cooling. In this approach the temperature field of the electronic board is more uniform and the cooling is more efficient.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- In this work, {{effort has}} been made in the {{evaluation}} and enhancement of thermal transport characteristics of metal matrix composites and contact interfaces. The thermal management systems are important in today’s faster growing industrial needs which are demanding the high end processors with highest speed and reliability of performance. The thermal management systems are used for applications like central processing unit (CPU) cooling, cooling of electronics circuit <b>boards,</b> <b>cooling</b> of mechanical and automobile systems like engine cooling. However, this work focuses on thermal management systems related to CPU cooling. In this work, initially, the importance and motivation behind the evaluation of the thermal characteristics for the MMC’s as well as TIMs. Thermal contact resistance in heat transfer applications are presented with examples. The heat transfer phenomenon at the interfaces is detailed with the classification based on contact criteria. The development of new MMC’s was detailed along with the different compositions of the MMCs. For this, initially, baseline materials were explained in detail along their thermal properties. Six MMC’s have been proposed with varying compositions of aluminum and silicon carbide. Aluminum was varied in percentage composition from 25 % to 35 %. The MMC’s were evaluated for the properties like thermal conductivity, specific heat, thermal diffusivity, CTE, density and Young’s modulus. Also, the variation of these properties with respect to temperature is evaluated. Finally recommendations are given for the MMC’s based on the required property criteria of the heat source material. As a second approach, the thermal contact resistance models were developed. A measurement system for contact resistances has been established by performing measurements on the known properties of the greases. Application of thermal greases is given in detail. The measurement system was established by conducting the experiments...|$|R
