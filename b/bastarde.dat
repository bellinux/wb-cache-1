5000|$|Poulet {{introduced}} into the court of Henry VII the Burgundian mirror for princes L'enseignement de vraie noblesse; the work was already old, and the Yorkist Warwick the Kingmaker had had a copy made in Bruges some thirty years earlier. The manuscript, for which Henry paid Poulet {{the large amount of}} £23 plus 10 marks on 26 July 1497, was put together in a transcription of high quality by Poulet, and had some adjustments to the text hinting at its application to Henry's problems with low-born pretenders to the throne. Entitled Imaginacion de vraye noblesse, it employed the lettre <b>bastarde</b> script commonly used in Flanders, and only later coming into use in England. The work itself was given an English version within a couple of years, by John Skelton. The original author has traditionally been given as Guillebert de Lannoy, but it is now argued that the work was by his brother Hugues de Lannoy. In either case, the work has strong associations with Poulet's home city of Lille. The manuscript, now British Library Royal MS 19 C viii, was once seen, together with the Charles d'Orléans MS Royal 16 F ii below, as entirely the product of a workshop of immigrant specialists headed by Poulet at Sheen, and so [...] "key early evidence of the Tudors' revival of English court culture". However it is now thought that Poulet scribed the pages at Sheen - the colophon is dated 30 June 1496 - but then sent them to one of the best Bruges workshops to be decorated, using his contacts there. A similar conclusion is less firm in the cases of some of the miniatures in the Orléans manuscript, one of which appears to depict London accurately.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the {{magazine}} can be traced in 1946. During the Virgin of Montserrat coronation festivities in 1947, even though the conditions were difficoult, {{there was a meeting}} between Catalan intellectuals and the Benedictine monks of the Montserrat abbey. In that moment there were two publications that were sponsored by the Montserrat abbey, and that have been born separately: Germinàbit, which was a magazine for the old singers of the abbey's choir, and Serra d'Or, which was the magazine for the abbey's workers. At the end of 1959, the two magazines were merged into one. The Germinàbit staff (Enric <b>Bastardes</b> and Max Cahner, that had entered due to Josep Benet) became part then of the one of Serra d'Or. This is why the magazine said [...] "2nd period".|$|R
