50|$|An {{analytical}} balance is {{a class of}} balance designed to measure small mass in the sub-milligram range. The measuring pan of an {{analytical balance}} (0.1 mg or better) is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that dust does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance's operation. This enclosure is often called a draft shield. The use of a mechanically vented <b>balance</b> <b>safety</b> enclosure, which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils, allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the measure of mass down to 1 μg without fluctuations or loss of product. Also, the sample must be at room temperature to prevent natural convection from forming air currents inside the enclosure from causing an error in reading. Single-pan mechanical substitution balance maintains consistent response throughout the useful capacity is achieved by maintaining a constant load on the balance beam, thus the fulcrum, by subtracting mass {{on the same side}} of the beam to which the sample is added.|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective: Osteoporosis afflicts a {{large number}} of populations in the world and is {{featured}} by systemic impairment of bone mass and strength which may further trigger an increase in the risk of fragile fractures. This network meta-analysis (NMA) is designed to distinguish therapies more preferable than others with respect to efficacy and safety. Methods: We searched the medical literature for relevant studies systematically. Both direct and indirect evidence were synthesized to compare the efficacy, described by odds ratios (OR) and 95 % credible intervals (CrI). Moreover, the surface under cumulative ranking curve was calculated to rank probabilities with respect to clinical outcomes. The new non-vertebral fractures, hip and wrist fractures, and adverse events were evaluated in this NMA. Results: Patients treated by alendronate, denosumab, teriparatide were associated with a reduced risk of new non-vertebral fractures compared to those treated by placebo. Alendronate, denosumab and zoledronic acid had better efficacy in preventing hip fractures. With respect to wrist fractures prevention, no significant difference was observed. Zoledronic acid exhibited significantly increased risk of adverse events than placebo, alendronate, denosumab, and raloxifene. According to SUCRA, teriparatide ranked highest in new non-vertebral fractures prevention, etidronate and denosumab <b>balanced</b> <b>safety</b> and efficacy well. Conclusion: In summary, teriparatide appeared to be the most efficacious drug for preventing new non-vertebral fractures, while etidronate and denosumab were preferable for <b>balancing</b> <b>safety</b> and efficacy well...|$|R

Before {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART), reports suggested that HIV-infected patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) would experience remission of their disease. It has now become clear that RA can develop in HIV-infected patients at any time, independent of HAART. Choosing the right medication to treat symptoms related to RA while avoiding excess weakening of the immune system remains a clinical challenge. Agents such as hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine might best <b>balance</b> <b>safety</b> with efficacy, making them reasonable first choices for therapy in HIV-infected patients with RA. More immune suppressing agents such as methotrexate may <b>balance</b> <b>safety</b> with efficacy, but data are limited. Corticosteroids such as prednisone may also be reasonable but could increase the risk of osteonecrosis. Among biologic response modifiers, tumor necrosis factor a inhibitors may <b>balance</b> <b>safety</b> with efficacy, but perhaps when HIV replication is controlled with HAART. Monitoring RA disease activity remains challenging as only one retrospective study has been published in this area. Those with HIV infection and RA can experience comorbidities such as accelerated heart disease and osteoporosis, a consequence of the chronic inflammatory state that each illness generates. Although HIV-infected patients are at risk for developing the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome when starting HAART, it appears that immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has a minimal effect on triggering the onset or the worsening of RA.

40|$|AbstractThe need to <b>balance</b> <b>safety</b> and {{operational}} efficiency at intersections requires special attention for accommodating left turn movements. Signalized intersections epitomise this need because unnecessary protection of left turns can significantly increase operational delay. Left turn protection however, increases safety {{and there is}} a need for proper balancing between the conflicting goals of safety and operations. The long time required to collect crash data to evaluate the use of existing warrants render them frequently ineffective and the need for a preliminary design tool to assist in left turn phasing decisions is needed. This research developed a quantitative safety assessment tool that predicts left turn related conflicts and uses them to determine the appropriate phasing scheme for left turns. The model was developed based on VISSIM micro-simulation software in conjunction with the Surrogate Safety Assessment Model...|$|E

Monitoring of calcineurin inhibitor therapy is usually per-formed by blood trough levels, pharmacokinetics such as measurement of two-hour peak levels, or by various areas under the curve assessments (AUC, 4 to 12 hours).

The results of the accident analysis were discussed and then compared to previous analysis of the Failure Knowledge Database (FKD, Japan).

30|$|Although {{our study}} has {{confirmed}} {{a significant reduction}} in overall complications when using a 4 -Fr vascular sheath rather than a 6 -Fr sheath in transfemoral arterial access for vascular interventional procedures, the majority of complications are minor, with no need for further intervention. The only additional factor demonstrating significance in complications was antegrade puncture. No significant difference has been demonstrated between the use of either sheath systems for major complications. Given the practical limitations of using a smaller system, these and earlier results do not justify the routine use of 4 -Fr sheath systems as the primary sheath size for all endovascular procedures. As with all aspects of endovascular intervention, the choice of sheath size must be dictated by patient characteristics and the specific procedure planned, in order to <b>balance</b> <b>safety,</b> successful outcome and treatment economy.|$|E
