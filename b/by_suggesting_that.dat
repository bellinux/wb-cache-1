5|$|At {{the time}} that Edward VIII (formerly Prince Edward) abdicated, {{an attempt was made}} to {{discredit}} Prince Albert, who had succeeded as George VI, <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> he was subject to falling fits, like his brother.|$|E
5|$|On another occasion, he amused and {{relieved}} the House, irritated {{by the prospect}} of being obliged to listen to the reading of a mass of documents as a preliminary to a resolution, <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> a dozen or so clerks be called in who might read the documents simultaneously and thus dispose of the business in a few minutes.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia {{responded to}} this <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> some {{interests}} a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E

5|$|Edward's unorthodox {{approach}} to his role also {{extended to the}} coinage that bore his image. He broke with the tradition that the profile portrait of each successive monarch faced in the direction opposite to that {{of his or her}} predecessor. Edward insisted that he face left (as his father had done), to show the parting in his hair. Only a handful of test coins were struck before the abdication, and all are very rare. When George VI succeeded to the throne he also faced left to maintain the tradition <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that,</b> had any further coins been minted featuring Edward's portrait, they would have shown him facing right.|$|E
5|$|There are {{differences}} within the material added by Scribe B. The first 23 stanzas of the B material {{shows signs of}} partial modernisation of the orthography, while the remainder show much more retention of Old Welsh features. Jarman explains this <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Scribe B started by partially modernising the orthography as he copied the stanzas, {{but after a while}} tired of this and copied the remaining stanzas {{as they were in the}} older manuscript. Isaac suggested that Scribe B was using two sources, called B1 and B2. If this is correct, the material in the Books of Aneirin is from three sources.|$|E
5|$|Although {{best known}} for their joint {{work on behalf of}} women's suffrage, Stanton and Anthony first joined the temperance movement. Together, they were {{instrumental}} in founding the short-lived Woman's State Temperance Society (1852–1853). During her presidency of the organization, Stanton scandalized many supporters <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> drunkenness be made sufficient cause for divorce. But the relationship between the women's suffrage movement and the temperance movement was hardly accidental. The two movements had common interests, with women's suffrage filling the role of cause and prohibition becoming the effect. Later, in state after state, once women gained the right to vote, they could press for various political measures to reduce drunkenness, perceived to be largely a problem involving the male sex. Thus, the two movements became frequently allied.|$|E

5|$|Barrichello placed blame upon Frentzen for {{starting}} the lap one accident at the Variante della Roggia corner. He demanded that Frentzen be banned for ten races. Barrichello also added that his helmet was damaged from his collision with de la Rosa. Frentzen reacted <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Barrichello braked earlier which {{forced him to}} make contact with teammate Trulli. FIA Race Director Charlie Whiting defended his decision not to stop the race saying that the safety car was deployed as all cars involved were in the run-off areas and that he believed stopping the race would be dangerous. However, he admitted that he was not aware about Gislimberti's condition when making the decision. Jordan team principal Eddie Jordan believed that Whiting had made the right decision and praised the safety of the modern Formula One car for protecting drivers.|$|E
5|$|In East Anglia, Rædwald's {{conversion}} was {{not universally}} accepted by his household {{or his own}} queen. According to the historian Steven Plunkett, she and her pagan teachers persuaded him to default in part from {{his commitment to the}} Christian faith. As a result, he kept in the temple two altars, one pagan and another dedicated to Christ. Bede, writing decades later, described how Ealdwulf of East Anglia, a grandson of Rædwald's brother Eni, recalled seeing the temple when he was a boy. It may have been located at Rendlesham, emerging focus of the regio of the Wuffing dynasty, according to Plunkett. Barbara Yorke explains the dual nature of the temple <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Rædwald would have been unprepared to reject his old religion and fully embrace Christianity, as this act would have been a public acknowledgment of his inferiority to Æthelberht. Rædwald's lack of commitment towards Christianity earned him the enmity of Bede, who regarded him as a renouncer of the faith.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{as early}} as 786 the {{creation}} of a Mercian archbishopric was being discussed at Offa's court. A letter to the papacy written by Coenwulf, who succeeded Offa's son Ecgfrith to the Mercian throne, claimed that Offa's motives were his dislike of Jænberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of the men of Kent. At the Council of Chelsea held in 787, Offa secured {{the creation of a}}n archbishopric for his kingdom centred on the diocese of Lichfield (in modern Staffordshire). Offa may have justified the move <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Jænberht planned to allow the Frankish king Charlemagne to use a landing site in Kent if the latter decided to invade, although this is only known from a 13th-century writer, Matthew Paris. Another concern was probably that of prestige, as having the main Mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase the kingdom's status.|$|E

5|$|The {{provenance}} {{and early}} history of the codex is uncertain; Rome (Hort), southern Italy, Alexandria (Kenyon,, 1912, p. 88. Burkitt), and Caesarea (T. C. Skeat) have been suggested as the origin. Hort's argument for Rome rests mainly on certain spellings of proper names, such as Ισακ and Ιστραηλ, which show a Western or Latin influence. A second argument is that the chapter division of Acts, {{similar to that of}} Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, is not found in any other Greek manuscript, but is present in several manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate. Robinson counters the argument <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> this system of chapter divisions was introduced into the Vulgate by Jerome himself, {{as a result of his}} studies at Caesarea. According to Hort, it was copied from a manuscript whose line length was 12–14 letters per line, because where the Codex Vaticanus's scribe made large omissions, they were typically 12–14 letters long.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Nesbitt auditioned to play Adam Williams, {{the male}} lead in Cold Feet, an ITV Comedy Premiere about three couples in {{different}} stages of their romantic relationships. The audition came about through a mutual friend of Nesbitt's and the director, Declan Lowney. The producer, Christine Langan, had also recalled his performances in Hear My Song and Go Now. Adam had not been written with an Irishman in mind to play him—English writer Mike Bullen had written the character as a thinly veiled portrayal of himself in his youth—but Nesbitt {{wanted to take the}} opportunity to appear in a contemporary drama as an ordinary man from Northern Ireland with no connection to the Troubles, especially after the Troubles-based plot of Love Lies Bleeding. Cold Feet was a critical success; it won the 1997 Golden Rose of Montreux and the 1997 British Comedy Award for Best ITV Comedy and was thus commissioned for a full series. Cold Feets first series aired at the end of 1998 and was followed by the second series in 1999. A storyline in that series featured Adam being diagnosed with testicular cancer, which inspired Nesbitt to become a patron of the charity Action Cancer. By the time of the third series, Nesbitt and the other cast members were able to influence the show's production; an episode featuring Adam's stag weekend was due to be filmed on location in Dublin but Nesbitt suggested it be filmed in Belfast and Portrush instead. Several scenes were filmed at his old workplace Barry's Amusements, although they were cut from the broadcast episode. At the end of the fourth series in 2001, Nesbitt decided to quit to move on to other projects. Executive producer Andy Harries persuaded him to stay for one more series <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> Adam be killed off, so Nesbitt signed on for the fifth series. During pre-production of the fifth series, Mike Bullen decided to kill off Adam's wife Rachel (played by Helen Baxendale) instead.|$|E
5|$|When {{rebel forces}} entered the palace, the Ngô {{brothers}} were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in Cholon. The brothers had kept {{in communication with}} the rebels through a direct link from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing {{that they were still}} in the palace. The Ngô brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in the back of an armoured personnel carrier by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base. While no formal inquiry was conducted, the responsibility for the deaths of the Ngô brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, and on Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution <b>by</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the Ngôs' corpses surfaced in the media.|$|E
