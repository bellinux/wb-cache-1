5|$|Manning's first start, a Tennessee {{homecoming}} {{game against}} Washington State, {{resulted in a}} 109 win. Things got progressively better for the Volunteers after Manning assumed the starting role, as they won six of their final regular-season games. The sole loss was a 1317 defeat {{at the hands of}} then-No. 10 Alabama in Knoxville. The loss was merely a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road, however, as Tennessee won all four regular-season games that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team around from a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E
5|$|Stratigeas {{made her}} debut as a villainous {{character}} on the March 19, 2000 episode of Sunday Night Heat, under the ring name Trish Stratus. She appeared on stage to scout Test and Prince Albert. The next night on Raw, Stratus began her first {{role in the}} company, managing Test and Albert in the tag team T & A. It was during her stint managing T & A that Stratus took her first major <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring, by being driven through a table by the Dudley Boyz at Backlash, after she had been taunting Bubba Ray Dudley for several weeks. In June, {{she was on the}} receiving end of a stink face from Rikishi on Raw.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E

25|$|Cauliflower ear is a {{blood clot}} that forms under the skin in the ear, causing {{there to be a}} large <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ear; the bump tends to be {{extremely}} hard. To develop cauliflower ear one must be hit in the ear many times or hit hard for it to form into {{a blood clot}}. When having cauliflower ear it is important to get the ear drained of liquid that has built up. Otherwise the ear will require surgery to return to normal shape and size. The best way to prevent cauliflower is to wear headgear. This will protect your ears from taking hard hits.|$|E
25|$|When either {{wheel is}} {{deflected}} upward, the center {{span of the}} spring (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward {{at the same time}} (for example, when hitting a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road) the center section bends uniformly between the pivot mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side. The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity.|$|E

25|$|The Spurs christened the SBC Center {{in style}} on November 1, 2002 by {{defeating}} the Toronto Raptors 91–72. The Spurs {{would not get}} off to a flying start as they had just a 19–13 record heading into January. In January the Spurs began to gel and seemed prepped to make a run, when they embarked on their annual Rodeo Road Trip, a nine-game road trip from January 25 to February 16. However, it would be hardly a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road for the charging Spurs, who won eight of the nine and began to climb their way to first place. The Spurs went on to erase their seven-game deficit and finished the season in a tie with the Dallas Mavericks for {{the best record in the}} NBA (60–22). Thanks to a tiebreaker, the Spurs won their third straight Division title as Tim Duncan claimed his second straight NBA MVP.|$|E

The Spurs would stay hot through December as they established a 25–6 record entering the New Year. With the later additions of center Nazr Mohammed from New York (acquired in a midseason trade of Malik Rose), and veteran forward Glenn Robinson from free agency, alongside regulars Bruce Bowen, Robert Horry, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Tim Duncan, the Spurs would be near the top in the Western Conference all season, battling the Phoenix Suns for {{the best record in the}} NBA. Just as it appeared the Spurs would cruise toward the playoffs their season suddenly hit a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road when Tim Duncan suffered an ankle injury. The Spurs struggled the rest of the season, finishing just 59–23. However, by the time the playoffs rolled around, Duncan was ready to return.|$|E

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a total of four stars, and called it [...] "an extraordinarily effective horror film". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called it [...] "a groundbreaker in fright that reinvents scary for the new millennium". Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "An intensely imaginative piece of conceptual filmmaking that also delivers the goods as a dread-drenched horror movie, The Blair Witch Project puts a clever modern twist on the universal fear of the dark and things that go <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave a B grade, saying, [...] "As a horror picture, the film may not be much more than a cheeky game, a novelty with the cool, blurry look of an avant-garde artifact. But as a manifestation of multimedia synergy, it's pretty spooky." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{reviewing}} {{their show}} on May 3, 2009, at the Van Andel Arena, Troy Reimink {{made a point}} of Crahan's absence, suggesting that while it could have seriously disrupted the tour, it seemed like [...] "merely a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road for Slipknot." [...] Reimink said the band's 17 song setlist, featuring songs from all their albums, [...] "demonstrated the group's skill at assembling relentlessly aggressive songs punctuated with fleeting, occasionally incongruous bits of melody." [...] While noting that Slipknot were [...] "not [...] thing", he described the show as [...] "an exercise in finely calculated chaos", rating the show 2.5 out of 4. Diana Nollen of The Gazette reviewed Slipknot's show in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, describing their stage show as a [...] "sophisticated sideshow of garish masks and growling lyrics." [...] Nollen made a note of their on-stage antics saying that [...] "it's rather entertaining as they lumber across the stage and climb on each other's percussion stations like baboons from hell." [...] Citing the singles [...] "Before I Forget" [...] and [...] "Psychosocial" [...] as particular highlights of the setlist, she concluded her review by saying that the [...] "final visual punch" [...] of drummer Joey Jordison's kit raising, tipping and rotating above the stage was like [...] "a demented version of an Adventureland ride." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} effects of noise on {{stationary}} pulse solutions (<b>bumps)</b> <b>in</b> spatially extended neural fields. The dynamics of a neural field is described by an integrodifferential equation whose integral term characterizes synaptic interactions between neurons in different spatial locations of the network. Translationally symmetric neural fields support a continuum of stationary bump solutions, which may be centered at any spatial location. Random fluctuations are introduced by modeling the system as a spatially extended Langevin equation whose noise term we take to be additive. For nonzero noise, bumps are shown to wander about <b>the</b> domain <b>in</b> a purely diffusive way. We can approximate the associated diffusion coefficient using a small noise expansion. Upon breaking the (continuous) translation symmetry of the system using spatially heterogeneous inputs or synapses, <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stochastic neural field can become temporarily pinned to a finite number of locations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network. As a result, the effective diffusion of <b>the</b> <b>bump</b> is reduced, <b>in</b> comparison to <b>the</b> homogeneous case. As the modulation frequency of this heterogeneity increases, the effective diffusion of <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> network approaches that of the network with spatially homogeneous weights...|$|R
