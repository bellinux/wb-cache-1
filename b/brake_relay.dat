50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service brake {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park <b>brake</b> <b>relay</b> valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer <b>brake</b> <b>relay</b> valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|E
50|$|A spring <b>brake</b> <b>relay</b> valve {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as the service <b>brake</b> <b>relay</b> valve, although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|E
50|$|With {{a service}} <b>brake</b> <b>relay</b> valve installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers.|$|E
50|$|In October 1968 the <b>braking</b> <b>relay</b> is {{introduced}} in the scheme. It provides electro-pneumatic braking along with linear contactor shut-off. The same year DK-406 electric engines were changed by DK-409B engines in compressors. And the compressor was improved into EK-7B.|$|R
25|$|Emergency brake connection: The {{computers}} {{are connected to}} the <b>brake</b> via a <b>relay.</b> A computer command or loss of current will release the air from the brake pipe applying the emergency brake.|$|R
50|$|In a truck’s air <b>brake</b> system, <b>relay</b> valves get {{a signal}} when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air {{to enter the}} brake chamber via air inlet. The {{diaphragm}} gets pushed, then the rod, then the slack adjuster which twists to turn the brake camshaft. Next, it moves the disc, wedge or s-cam, which pushes the brake shoes and lining, creating friction. This friction slows and eventually stops the brake drum’s turning, which stops the wheel.|$|R
40|$|Air {{brake system}} has been widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other brake system. The practical performance of air brake system may be greatly different from if we analyze it with static theory. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} build an integrate air brake system model to simulate the process of brake accurately. However, the dynamic mathematic model of air brake system is very complicate, which makes the model hard to be solved. In this paper, the components of air brake system are decomposed to several basic standard pneumatic components, and then build the system based on these basic standard pneumatic components. The standard pneumatic components which are built in the software-MWorks based on Modelica language include cylinder, nozzle, air reservoir, volume, and air pipe. An air brake system which contains <b>brake</b> valve, <b>relay</b> valve, <b>brake</b> chambers and pipelines is made based on the standard pneumatic components. The simulation results show the dynamic characteristics of air brake system...|$|R
5000|$|In the U.S. a non-original {{restored}} car may {{be termed}} a [...] "restomod." [...] Upgrades may include newer safety components such as seat belts, <b>brakes</b> or using <b>relays</b> to reduce electric current flowing through light switches. Usability upgrades such as fitting intermittent wipers, an alternator {{instead of a}} dynamo, or electronic ignition system instead of contact breaker points ignition system. Emissions upgrades such as hardened valve seats to use standard unleaded fuel, or retrofitted catalytic converters. Upgrades that are easily reversible to the original condition, or were available when the vehicle was current, {{would be less likely}} to be controversial. Less acceptable to the classic car market may be major alterations like engine swaps or gearbox transplants, which would be more like hot rodding.|$|R
40|$|Brake {{propagation}} is slow {{for long}} freight trains that use a conventional air brake system. If {{the train is}} too long then the brake application will not propagate throughout the whole train. Brake propagation {{is one of the}} factors that limit the length of current heavy haul freight trains using a conventional air brake system. It is possible that a relatively simple modification to every wagon's brake valve could be done to ensure the <b>brake</b> signal is <b>relayed</b> throughout the train irrespective of the length of the train. The modification effectively increases the quick service volume or 'bulb' on Westinghouse style triple valves by connecting an additional volume and valve to the brake pipe. As each wagon's brakes apply, extra air will be taken from the brake pipe to fill the additional volume and thus ensuring the propagation of the brake signal {{to the rear of the}} train. The modification also has the advantage of reducing the time for the brakes to reach their final pressure, which reduces the train's stopping distance. A computer model of a complete train air brake system developed through the Rail CRC is used to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the modification. Using air brake equipment at CQU, experimental tests have been conducted to determine the allowable size of the additional volume and show the stability of the modification...|$|R
