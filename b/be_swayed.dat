5|$|Minton {{was pleased}} with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became its leading {{supporter}} in the Senate. The measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses {{on behalf of his}} party in support of the bill, but public opinion could not <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> in the Democrats' favor.|$|E

5|$|The general {{goal of a}} {{level is}} to gain control over every village on an island, {{accomplished}} through acts that persuade the villagers {{to believe in the}} player. Villagers can <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> by everything from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. For example, if boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E
5|$|When Lancaster {{arrived at}} the town of Boroughbridge, Harclay was already in {{possession}} of the bridge crossing the river. The rebel forces counted probably no more than 700 knights and men-at-arms, against the 4,000 or so soldiers in the royal army. Lancaster initially tried to negotiate, but Harclay could not <b>be</b> <b>swayed.</b> Since there was no realistic alternative place to cross the river, and with the royal forces in pursuit from the south, the rebels {{had no choice but}} to fight. The ensuing battle was short and one-sided.|$|E

25|$|Until the {{publication}} of the bull, the election of the pope was often decided by a puppet electoral process. The Holy Roman Emperor often directly named a deceased pope’s replacement, or the pontiff named his own successor. Such a nomination under the canon law was not a valid election and the legal electors would have to ratify the choice, though undoubtedly they would naturally <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> by circumstances to give effect to the imperial preference.|$|E
25|$|Greaves was not fit for {{the game}} against Portugal so Hurst and Hunt {{continued}} up front, and England won 2–1 thanks to a brace from Bobby Charlton, the second of which {{was set up by}} Hurst. As the final against the Germans approached, the media learnt of Greaves' return to fitness and, while appreciating Hurst's contribution, started to call for the return of England's most prolific centre-forward. Ramsey, however, would not <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> and selected Hurst for the final.|$|E
25|$|A public dispute {{broke out}} between Grey and Cameron, who were both strong-willed. Grey wished {{to crush the}} Kingite {{rebellion}} quickly, but Cameron was adamant {{that he would not}} start operations until his supply line was in place. Grey argued that he understood the mentality of the Māori rebels, but Cameron would not <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> on military matters. Relations between Grey and Cameron were strained from this point on, as Cameron wrote directly to the Secretary of War in Britain, criticising Grey's war policy. Grey was faced with more and more criticism from the New Zealand press and public, which did not appreciate Cameron's high level of skill and experience.|$|E

25|$|In {{any given}} Shooting Dog Stake, {{it may be}} very {{difficult}} to place a dog which totally meets the exalted standard. Therefore, out of necessity, there will frequently be a need to accept a dog whose qualities and character can only begin to approximate this standard. The standard when applied should seek out a dog which displays superior bird dog characteristics in the form of natural qualities such as pace, range, bird sense, nose, stamina and style. The contender sought after should render a balanced, biddable performance, search intelligently and exhibit bird finding ability with quality always superseding quantity, manifest accuracy of location, loftiness and intensity on point. Subservience to the handler and proper handling response without the benefit of scouting and excessive handling are the “sine qua non” of a shooting dog. Excessive range {{on the part of a}} shooting dog is not considered desirable. When considering bird work, the judges should <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> not by the frequency of occurrence but rather the quality of the performance.|$|E
25|$|Jerusalem {{was still}} being rebuilt {{following}} the destruction caused by Titus in AD 70. Emperor Hadrian had built during the 130s a temple over the site of Jesus's tomb near Calvary, and renamed the city Aelia Capitolina. Accounts differ concerning whether the temple was dedicated to Venus or Jupiter. According to tradition, Helena ordered the temple torn down and, according to the legend that arose {{at the end of}} the 4th century, chose a site to begin excavating, which led to the recovery of three different crosses. The legend is recounted in Ambrose, On the Death of Theodosius (died 395) and at length in Rufinus' chapters appended to his translation into Latin of Eusebius' Ecclesiastical History, the main body of which does not mention the event. Then, Rufinus relates, the empress refused to <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> by anything short of solid proof and performed a test. Possibly through Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem, she had a woman who was near death brought from the city. When the woman touched the first and second crosses, her condition did not change, but when she touched the third and final cross she suddenly recovered, and Helena declared the cross with which the woman had been touched to be the True Cross. On the site of discovery, Constantine ordered the building of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; churches were also built on other sites detected by Helena. Sozomen and Theodoret claim that Helena also found the nails of the crucifixion. To use their miraculous power to aid her son, Helena allegedly had one placed in Constantine's helmet, and another in the bridle of his horse.|$|E

After retiring for 25 minutes on 18 November 1903, the jury unanimously found that Bayliss had been defamed, to the applause of physicians in the public gallery. Bayliss was awarded £2,000 with £3,000 costs; Coleridge gave him a cheque the next day.|$|E

500|$|On 18 January 1979, an {{anonymous}} caller to the Press Association informed {{them that the}} Provisional IRA had planted a bomb in the tunnel that was scheduled to detonate at midnight. While the Metropolitan Police were searching the tunnel, the bomb detonated at 12:40am, causing an explosion in a gas holder near the southern exit. This resulted in a fire on another gas holder approximately an hour later. No injuries were reported. Home Secretary Merlyn Rees hoped [...] "the House will join me in condemning these attacks and will support the Government in their determination not to <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> by such methods." [...] A Belfast man was jailed for 17 years in May 1983 {{for his role in}} the bombing.|$|E
500|$|In 1550, another {{conflict}} arose when John Hooper, the new {{bishop of}} Gloucester, refused to don the traditional vestments for his consecration. The vestments controversy pitted Cranmer, {{who supported the}} wearing of clerical garments, against Hooper, [...] Martyr and Jan Laski, the pastor of the Stranger church in London. As it was [...] known that Bucer had reformed the church services in Strasbourg to emulate {{the simplicity of the}} early church, Hooper expected Bucer's support. [...] However, Bucer tried {{to stay out of the}} fray, arguing that there were more important issues to deal with—lack of pastors and pastoral care, the need for catechismal instruction, and the implementation of church discipline. Hooper refused to <b>be</b> <b>swayed,</b> and [...] was imprisoned in the Tower of London until he accepted Cranmer's demand.|$|E
500|$|In 1926, the Jewish Anarchist Federation of New York asked Berkman {{to write}} an {{introduction}} to anarchism intended for the general public. By presenting the principles of anarchism in plain language, the New York anarchists hoped that readers might <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> to support the movement or, at a minimum, that the book might improve the image of anarchism and anarchists in the public's eyes. Berkman produced , first published in 1929 and reprinted many times since (often under the title What Is Communist Anarchism? or What Is Anarchism?). Anarchist Stuart Christie wrote that Now and After is [...] "among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language" [...] and historian Paul Avrich described it as [...] "the clearest exposition of communist anarchism in English or any other language".|$|E

500|$|Mc Shea (GameSpot) called Trouble in Paradise [...] "a safe {{sequel to}} a great game". Ultimately, Geddes (IGN) wrote that an {{expansion}} pack on the original game would have served the same function. Even with Trouble in Paradise upgraded controls, Bramwell (Eurogamer) preferred the precision of the Nintendo DS version's stylus or of a computer mouse, and thought the game could be further simplified. However, he saw the new release as a more polished opportunity to attract an audience that was not originally convinced by the reception of the first game. Electronic Gaming Monthly said that players that hated the original game would not <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> by the sequel. GameSpot 2008 year in review staff nominated Trouble in Paradise as the [...] "Best Game No One Played", which it did not win.|$|E
500|$|Rare Replay {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} review aggregator Metacritic. It {{reached the top}} of the United Kingdom all-format games sales charts—the first Xbox One exclusive to do so and Rare's first since Banjo-Kazooie in 1998. Rare Replay was also the first top-ranked budget title since Wii Fit Plus (2009) before it fell to sixth place the next week. Rare Replay was the sixth best selling game in North America for August 2015. The compilation had earlier been Amazon.com's most preordered game of the 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo. Reviewers liked its value proposition and low price. Many of the compilation's games already had long-established legacies, such that gamers who experienced the originals in their heyday—the target audience—were unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>swayed</b> by critical reviews of the selections.|$|E
500|$|The Duke, [...] "much {{thinner and}} greatly altered", {{returned}} to England in November. His relationship with Anne had suffered further setbacks {{in recent months}} (she had refused to grant him his requested appointment of Captain-General for life, and had interfered in military appointments). The damage done to Marlborough's general standing was substantial {{because it was so}} visible. For now, though, the central issue was the Duchess whose growing resentment of Harley and Abigail had finally persuaded the Queen to be rid of her. Marlborough visited Anne on 17 January 1711 (O.S.) in a last attempt to save his wife, but she was not to <b>be</b> <b>swayed,</b> and demanded Sarah give up her Gold Key (the symbol of her office) within two days, warning, [...] "I will talk of no other business till I have the key".|$|E
