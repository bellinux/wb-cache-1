5|$|According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss {{to drive the}} fire engine, a defective helicopter <b>bucket,</b> <b>and</b> a three-hour delay from the fire to a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål. Also, the fire carriage from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding the fire hazards of wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted {{that they should be}} made of a more fire-proof material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have to be monitored for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E
5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk <b>bucket</b> <b>and</b> a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a threshing floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob asks Mr. Krabs for assistance, but he {{supports}} the highway, believing that it can bring more customers to the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob then shows Mr. Krabs the highway's blueprint, which shows that the highway with concrete columns will run over the Krusty Krab and end directly at the Chum Bucket, revealing that Plankton {{is responsible for the}} highway's development. Mr. Krabs is outraged at this revelation and decides to support SpongeBob. They both go to the Chum <b>Bucket</b> <b>and</b> ask Plankton to not develop the highway, but he states {{that the rest of the}} town has already unanimously voted to build the highway.|$|E

5|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else. Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer from Montana. Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a <b>bucket</b> <b>and</b> burying the rest.|$|E
5|$|In a story {{recorded}} {{in the area of}} Cetinje, a zduhać was mortally wounded on Mount Lovćen in a battle against the transmarine zduhaći. The dying zduhać disclosed the way in which he could be saved, and one of his relatives acted according to the instructions. He went by night to a valley where he saw horses, oxen, rams, billy goats, men, and women. He passed by them in total silence, before he saw a black ox. He struck the ox with a wooden bar, and the animal roared tremendously. When he returned home, he found the zduhać sound and healthy. As believed in the region of Birač, eastern Bosnia, a mortally wounded zduhać could get well if he burned beech buds in a milk <b>bucket,</b> <b>and</b> censed himself with the smoke, using a spindle to wave the smoke toward himself. Before performing this rite, he should have publicly confessed that he was a zduhać. Most zduhaći would reputedly rather die than do that, because afterwards they could no more fly as zduhaći. As thought in Herzegovina, a man {{who did not want to}} be a zduhać anymore, should have confessed to a priest and promised that he would not fly anymore.|$|E

Bronze Age flint scatters have also been found in several places, particularly on the higher ground near Barrowby. At Saltersford a Bronze Age ingot and a rapier were found. There are also several ring ditches on the higher ground above Saltersford.|$|E
25|$|Cup lump is the coagulated {{material}} {{found in}} the collection cup when the tapper next visits the tree to tap it again.

40|$|We provide {{complete}} average-case {{as well as}} probabilistic {{analysis of}} the cost of <b>bucket</b> selection <b>and</b> sorting algorithms. Two variations of <b>bucketing</b> (<b>and</b> flavors there in) are considered: distributive bucketing (large number of <b>buckets)</b> <b>and</b> radix <b>bucketing</b> (recursive with a small number of buckets, suitable for digital computation). For Distributive Selection a compound Poisson limit is established. For all other flavors of <b>bucket</b> selection <b>and</b> sorting, central limit theorems underlying the cost are derived by asymptotic techniques involving perturbation of Rice's integral and contour integration (saddle point methods). In the case of radix bucketing, periodic luctuations appear in the moments of both the selection and sorting algorithms...|$|R

Numerous off-the shelf commercial products are now available and are used in locations where a connection to a sanitary sewer system is not possible, permitted or desired such as in remote summer cottages or for camping activities. At all times, users {{have also been}} building their own low-cost UDDTs with simple materials such as a funnel connected to a hose, a <b>bucket</b> <b>and</b> a seat.|$|E
25|$|The Alton Towers Waterpark, {{formerly}} known as Cariba Creek, opened alongside the Splash Landings Hotel in 2003. It is a large, part-indoor and part outdoor waterpark themed as a tropical Caribbean lagoon. The waterpark features several fast slides, a lazy river, a giant tipping <b>bucket</b> <b>and</b> many other water features. Also located there are two food and drink venues: Adventures Cave and Ice Cream Shack. Unlike Chessington Zoo at the also Merlin operated Chessington World of Adventures Resort, a separate ticket is needed for waterpark access as it is not included with the theme park entrance price.|$|E
25|$|Wharton {{was active}} to {{near the end}} of his life both {{physically}} and in business affairs. Until he was 72, he skated with guests on the pond at his Ontalauna estate near Philadelphia and would often go on walks with his family after dinner. Throughout his life he partook in physical exercise, total abstinence from tobacco, and restricted use of even mild alcoholic drinks. When he was nearly 80, he visited his Nevada silver mine by canoeing down the Colorado River and descending into the mine in a <b>bucket,</b> <b>and</b> when he was 81, he traveled to Germany with his grandson, Joseph Wharton Lippincott, to visit Kaiser Wilhelm II and had dinner on the kaiser's yacht. He continued to oversee his holdings in coke manufacture in Pennsylvania and iron in northern New Jersey.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} {{in the design of}} quick couplers. The initial divergence is between those that can pick up any of a range of <b>buckets</b> <b>and</b> attachments by clamping onto the mounting pins for the attachment (known as [...] "pin grabbers" [...] or [...] "pin couplers") and those that work only with <b>buckets</b> <b>and</b> attachments designed to suit that quick coupler (known as [...] "dedicated"). The claimed advantage of pin-grabbers is flexibility in use in that a machine owner can use a variety of <b>buckets</b> <b>and</b> attachments without changing the quick coupler or buying an adaptor. The claimed advantages of dedicated couplers depend on their individual design but often include better performance and smaller size.|$|R

25|$|A girl {{or woman}} goes {{early in the}} morning to a {{resource}} of water, as a well, spring, or stream. After she puts by the water an ear of maize and a bunch of basil which she has brought from home, she collects water with a <b>bucket,</b> <b>and</b> takes it home to her family. This water collected on early Christmas morning is called the strong water, and is believed to possess a special beneficial power. Each member of the family washes the face with it, and drinks it before breakfast; infants are bathed in it. On her way back home, the girl who carries the strong water picks several cornel or willow twigs, with which children are lightly struck that morning. This is intended to strengthen their health.|$|E
25|$|Drag-line {{excavation}} {{systems are}} heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types {{are used for}} road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the <b>bucket</b> <b>and</b> hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.|$|E
25|$|For the game, 10 of the 11 Troy State players {{scored in}} double figures. Terry McCord, who the {{following}} season would be named an NCAA DivisionII All-American, {{led the team}} with 41 points 16-of-26 shooting. The only player not to score in double figures was Andy Davis, who coincidentally made the game's first <b>bucket</b> <b>and</b> shot 1-for-1. Eight of the 10 Trojans scored at least 20 points, and of those, six scored at least 29. Smith recorded the game's only triple-double with 29 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists. Of the many statistical anomalies to occur in this high-scoring game, one was that only three total free throws were attempted between the teams (Troy attempted, and made, all three). DeVry's Clayton Jones had 19 of the Hoyas' 44 turnovers by himself, while DeVry's Dartez Daniel scored a game-high 42 points on 20-for-30 shooting.|$|E

25|$|IMR (Ob'yekt 616) (IMR {{stands for}} Inzhenernaya Mashina Razgrazhdeniya) - T-55 {{converted}} into a combat engineer vehicle. The turret was replaced with a hydraulically operated crane with capacity of 2 tonnes, capable of 360° turn. The crane is operated from an armoured cupola with a visor can also be fitted with a small <b>bucket</b> <b>and</b> used as excavator arm or a pair of pincer type grabs for removing obstacles like trees. Its jib is telescopic and when in traveling position it is folded down and placed on a cradle {{in the rear of}} the hull which is folded down against the engine deck when the crane is in use. A hydraulically operated dozer blade is mounted to the front of the hull; it can be used in a straight or V-configuration only. The vehicle is fitted with a searchlight. The IMR was developed in 1969 and entered service five years later.|$|E
25|$|The aft {{flight deck}} has two landing spots for {{aircraft}} {{the size of}} a Chinook, although it has no hangar or aircraft storage facility. Below the flight deck is the dock and vehicle deck. The latter has the capacity to hold thirty-one large trucks and thirty-six smaller vehicles or six Challenger 2 tanks and thirty armoured personnel carriers. The dock can hold four Landing Craft Utility MK10, each large enough to carry vehicles up to main battle tank size, which are then launched by flooding of the dock area. Four smaller LCVP MK5 that can carry thirty-five men or two light trucks are carried on davits, two each side of the ship's superstructure. Each ship also carries a fifty-two ton tracked beach recovery vehicle for assisting with landing craft recovery, as well as two tractors: one that can lay a track-way across a landing beach, and the second fitted with an excavating <b>bucket</b> <b>and</b> forks.|$|E
25|$|The most {{impressive}} of the burials without a chamber {{is that of}} a young man who was buried with his horse, in Mound 17. The horse would have been sacrificed for the funeral, in a ritual sufficiently standardised to indicate a lack of sentimental attachment to it. Two undisturbed grave-hollows existed side-by-side under the mound. The man's oak coffin contained his pattern welded sword on his right and his sword-belt, wrapped around the blade, which had a bronze buckle with garnet cloisonné cellwork, two pyramidal strapmounts and a scabbard-buckle. By the man's head was a firesteel and a leather pouch, containing rough garnets and a piece of millefiori glass. Around the coffin were two spears, a shield, a small cauldron and a bronze bowl, a pot, an iron-bound <b>bucket</b> <b>and</b> some animal ribs. In the north-west corner of his grave was a bridle, mounted with circular gilt bronze plaques with interlace ornamentation. These items are on display at Sutton Hoo.|$|E
