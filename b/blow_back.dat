5|$|Despite this, Andronicus tried {{once more}} to strike a decisive <b>blow</b> <b>back</b> at the Turks, this time hiring Catalan mercenaries. Under the {{guidance}} of Michael IX and the leadership of Roger de Flor, the 6,500-strong Catalan Company {{in the spring and}} summer of 1303 managed to drive back the Turks. The mercenaries' onslaught drove the Turks back from Philadelphia to Cyzicus, in the process causing great destruction to the Anatolian landscape. Once again these gains were thwarted by internal matters. Roger de Flor was assassinated and, in revenge, his company began pillaging the Anatolian countryside. When they finally left in 1307 to attack Byzantine Thrace, the locals welcomed the Ottomans who once again began blockading key fortresses in Asia Minor.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the night}} of [...] another German gas cloud was {{released}} against the 72nd and 73rd brigades, from the curtain, a re-entrant west of Messines, where no man's land was [...] wide. The British gave the gas alert at [...] on 16 June, when the wind was favourable for a German gas release. Just after midnight, sentries of the 8th Battalion, Queen's West Surrey and the 1st Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment of the 72nd Brigade, which had experienced the April attack and the 9th Battalion, Royal Sussex Regiment and 7th Battalion, Northamptonshire Regiment of the 73rd Brigade, saw gas rise from the German trenches and gave the warning. The cloud was dense but moved slowly in a light wind, which gave the British {{plenty of time to}} put on their anti-gas hoods. The gas was emitted for [...] and was blown to the south-east, towards the 17th Brigade on the right flank of the divisional area. Near the end of the discharge, the gas began to <b>blow</b> <b>back</b> and the British artillery bombarded the German front line. A few Germans climbed out of the front line trench only immediately to be forced back. All but ration parties and a few people moving along communication trenches, received the alert but gas casualties were similar to those in the April attack, which led {{to the conclusion that the}} PH helmets were inadequate against concentrated gas.|$|E

He craved a means of striking one <b>blow</b> <b>back</b> at the cause of his cheerless plight, while he was still on the scene of his discomfiture. For some minutes no method suggested itself, and then he had an idea.|$|E

The quaint figure, in its belaced frock, quilted petticoat, and red-heeled shoes, seemed to come tripping toward her in such a life-like way, that she almost saw the curls <b>blow</b> <b>back,</b> heard the rustle of the rich brocade, and caught the sparkle of the little maid's bright eyes.|$|E
60|$|At length all was prepared, and {{the deadly}} {{cast-iron}} flasks had been packed in sand, together with dynamite cartridges, the necessary detonators, electric wires, and so forth, an anxious and indeed awful task executed entirely in that stifling atmosphere by {{the hands of}} Orme and Quick. Then began another labour, that of the filling in of the tunnels. This, it seems, was necessary, or so I understood, lest the expanding gases, following the line of least resistance, should <b>blow</b> <b>back,</b> as it were, through the vent-hole. What made that task the more difficult was the need of cutting a little channel in the rock to contain the wires, and thereby lessen {{the risk of the}} fracture of these wires {{in the course of the}} building-up process. Of course, if by any accident this should happen, the circuit would be severed, and no explosion would follow when the electric battery was set to work.|$|E

60|$|Nick went to Great Stanhope Street at {{five o'clock}} and learned, rather to his {{surprise}}, that Julia was not at home--to his surprise because {{he had told her}} he would come at that hour, and he attributed to her, with a certain simplicity, an eager state of mind in regard to his explanation. Apparently she was not eager; the eagerness was his own--he was eager to explain. He recognised, not without a certain consciousness of magnanimity in doing so, that there had been some reason for her quick withdrawal from his studio or at any rate for her extreme discomposure there. He had a few days before put in a plea for a snatch of worship in that sanctuary and she had accepted and approved it; but the worship, when the curtain happened to <b>blow</b> <b>back,</b> showed for that of a magnificent young woman, an actress with disordered hair, who wore in a singular degree the appearance of a person settled for many hours. The explanation was easy: it dwelt in the simple truth that when one was painting, even very badly and only for a moment, one had to have models. Nick was impatient to give it with frank, affectionate lips and a full, pleasant admission that it was natural Julia should have been startled; and he was the more impatient that, though he would not in the least have expected her to like finding a strange woman intimately installed with him, she had disliked it even more than would have seemed probable or natural. That was because, not having heard from him about the matter, the impression was for the moment irresistible with her that a trick had been played her. But three minutes with him alone would make the difference.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Blow</b> <b>back</b> - For oxidizers that {{decompose}} exothermically such as {{nitrous oxide}} or hydrogen peroxide, flame or hot gasses from the combustion chamber can propagate {{back through the}} injector, igniting the oxidizer and leading to a tank explosion.

5000|$|The Panther was {{the first}} {{prototype}} semi-automatic marker designed by Tom Kaye of Airgun Designs in 1988. Since {{it was only a}} prototype it was never offered to the public. The design was sold to Direct Connect, but was never manufactured. AGD bought the design rights back in 1989 through a non-performance clause in the original contract. The <b>blow</b> <b>back</b> design was deemed to be too primitive (because pump markers changed in 1988, they got removable barrels and quickstrip pins) so a second generation prototype [...] "P2" [...] (for Panther Prototype Two) was developed. This second design was also a <b>blow</b> <b>back,</b> and had many problems. It was decided to give up on <b>blow</b> <b>back</b> technology and re-engineer the entire action into a [...] "blow-forward" [...] design. This eliminated many problems inherent in blow-backs, such as their dependence on full, constant operating pressure in order to cycle reliably. This hearalded the beginning of the Automag design which went through two revisions; P3 and P4. The P4 design was released to the public in 1990.|$|E
