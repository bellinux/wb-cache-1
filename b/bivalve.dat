5|$|<b>Bivalve</b> fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the valves remains as the fossil rather than the valves. During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of <b>bivalve</b> species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E

5|$|The fish is carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, <b>bivalve</b> mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids.

5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of <b>bivalve,</b> and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in <b>bivalve</b> molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of clams, cockles and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of mussels, 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons of oysters and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops. China increased its consumption 400-fold during the period 1970 to 1997.|$|E
5|$|Chlamys hastata, {{the spear}} scallop, spiny scallop or {{swimming}} scallop, is {{a species of}} <b>bivalve</b> mollusc in the family Pectinidae found {{on the west coast}} of North America from the Gulf of Alaska to San Diego, California. A limited number of these scallops are harvested by divers or by narrow trawls off the west coast of Canada.|$|E
50|$|There {{are more}} than 15,000 species of <b>bivalves</b> that live in both marine and freshwater. Examples of <b>bivalves</b> are clams, scallops, mussels, and oysters. The {{majority}} of <b>bivalves</b> consist of two identical shells that are held together by a flexible hinge. The animal's body is held protectively inside these two shells. <b>Bivalves</b> {{that do not have}} two shells either have one shell or they lack a shell altogether. The shells are made of calcium carbonate and are formed in layers by secretions from the mantle. <b>Bivalves,</b> also known as pelecypods, are mostly filter feeders; through their gills, they draw in water, in which is trapped tiny food particles. Some <b>bivalves</b> have eyes and an open circulatory system. <b>Bivalves</b> are used all over the world as food and as a source of pearls. The larvae of some freshwater mussels can be dangerous to fish and can bore through wood.|$|R
50|$|These <b>bivalved</b> {{gastropods}} {{were for}} a long time only known from fossils and dead material. Because of this, they had been described as being somewhat atypical <b>bivalves.</b> In the late 19th century they were classified among the <b>bivalves,</b> within the family Mytilidae, the mussels.|$|R

5|$|The sand whiting {{commonly}} inhabits shallow sandy substrates in bays, estuaries and surf zones {{where it}} preys on polychaete worms, small crustaceans and <b>bivalve</b> molluscs. Reproduction in {{the species is}} variable over its range, generally spawning twice between September and April. Young fish inhabit shallow sand flats, both along the coast and well into {{the upper reaches of}} estuaries.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bivalve</b> {{molluscs}} {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their population status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile {{so that they are}} representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E
50|$|A few {{groups of}} <b>bivalves</b> are active {{swimmers}} like the scallops; many <b>bivalves</b> live buried in soft sediments (are infaunal) and can actively move around using their muscular foot; some <b>bivalves</b> such as blue mussels attach themselves to hard substrates using a byssus; {{other groups of}} <b>bivalves</b> (such as oysters, thorny oysters, jewel boxes, kitten's paws, jingle shells, etc.) cement their lower valve to a hard substrate (using shell material as cement) and this fixes them permanently in place. In many species of cemented <b>bivalves</b> (for example the jewel boxes), the lower valve is more deeply cupped than the upper valve, which tends to be rather flat. In some groups of cemented <b>bivalves</b> the lower or cemented valve is the left valve, in others {{it is the right}} valve.|$|R
30|$|Since <b>bivalves</b> do not {{inhabit the}} mainland, the plant {{consumers}} could be snails (Gastropods), which form a sister clade with <b>bivalves,</b> forming the Pleistomollusca (Kokot et al. 2011).|$|R

5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi lives {{predominantly}} on muddy bottoms, {{where it}} is a predator of <b>bivalve</b> molluscs. In its native environment, it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. It is an important predator of the quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, in Narragansett Bay, and of the barnacle Balanus improvisus in Delaware Bay. In the Adriatic Sea, {{it has been observed}} to feed on the striped venus clam, Chamelea gallina, and the introduced Asian date mussel, Musculista senhousia.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include <b>bivalve</b> molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|Production of <b>bivalve</b> {{molluscs}} by mariculture in 2010 was 12,913,199 tons, up from 8,320,724 tons in 2000.

40|$|Brachiopods are marine Lophotrochozoa whose soft {{parts are}} {{enclosed}} in a <b>bivalved</b> shell.

5|$|S. ciliata is a benthic {{carnivore}} {{that feeds}} predominantly on polychaetes and various crustaceans. Like {{other species of}} Sillago, the diet of the species {{is related to the}} size and age of the individual, with three distinct size classes identified in a study conducted in Botany Bay, NSW. The smallest fish of 0–10cm take large amount of amphipods and few polychaetes, while fish between 11 and 20cm consume mostly neried polychaetes and few amphipods. The largest fish over 21cm take large amounts of <b>bivalve</b> molluscs and shrimps of the genus Callianassa.|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{tilefish}} larvae is unknown, but it {{is believed}} to be zooplankton. Juvenile and adults are omnivorous with a preference for small benthic invertebrates, with a staple being crabs and lobster. Great northern tilefish also consume <b>bivalve</b> molluscs, salps, squid, Atlantic dogfish, mackrel, hagfish, and herring. Human trash is also eaten, including potato peels and meat bones. They also eat other tilefish in a display of cannibalistism.|$|E
5|$|The many {{inhabitants}} of the tidal flats include lugworms, polychaete worms, sand hoppers and other amphipod crustaceans, and gastropod molluscs. These molluscs feed on the algae growing {{on the surface of}} the mud, and include the tiny Hydrobia, an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000m−2. <b>Bivalve</b> molluscs include the edible common cockle, although it is not harvested here.|$|E
40|$|Stable-isotope {{profiles}} through successive growth increments of Miocene <b>bivalves</b> from Western Amazonia reveal paleobiological characteristics, such as biotope preferences, longevity, and ontogenetic development. Two {{groups of}} <b>bivalves,</b> a fluvial and a lacustrine group, are recognized. The fluvial group {{is composed of}} pearly freshwater mussels whose isotope profiles are characterized by clearly recognizable cyclicity of considerable amplitude, similar to those from pearly freshwater mussels studied from the modern Amazon region. The lacustrine group, dominated by pachydontine <b>bivalves,</b> is characterized by very low amplitude and irregular isotope signals. Additional trace element analyses show seasonal variation in phase with stable isotope cycles. Seasonal stable isotope cycles show growth rates and longevity in <b>bivalves</b> from the fluvial group but are not clearly expressed in the lacustrine group. The Miocene Pebas ecosystem of Western Amazonia {{can be characterized as}} a wetland system of connected shallow lakes, swamps, and tributaries. The stable isotope signatures of fluvial <b>bivalves</b> are good recorders of prior seasonal climate changes, in contrast with those of lacustrine <b>bivalves.</b> © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the slow decline of the brachiopods over the last 100 million years or so {{is a direct result of}} the rise in diversity of filter-feeding <b>bivalves,</b> which have ousted the brachiopods from their former habitats; however, the <b>bivalves</b> have undergone a steady rise in diversity from the mid-Paleozoic onwards, and their abundance is unrelated to that of the brachiopods; further, many <b>bivalves</b> occupy niches (e.g. burrowing) which brachiopods never inhabited.|$|R
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of demersal fish feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of <b>bivalve</b> species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to <b>bivalve</b> shell growth.|$|E
5|$|The unusual genus, Entovalva, is endosymbiotic, {{being found}} only in the {{oesophagus}} of sea cucumbers. It has mantle folds that completely surround its small valves. When the sea cucumber sucks in sediment, the <b>bivalve</b> allows the water to pass over its gills and extracts fine organic particles. To prevent itself from being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several <b>bivalve</b> species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that the}} findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of pollutants in the <b>bivalve</b> tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E
50|$|Most {{species of}} muricids are carnivorous, active predators that feed on other gastropods, <b>bivalves,</b> and barnacles. The {{access to the}} soft parts of the prey is {{typically}} obtained by boring a hole through the shell {{by means of a}} softening secretion and the scraping action of the radula. Because of their carnivory, some species may be considered pests because they can cause considerable destruction both in exploited natural beds of <b>bivalves,</b> and in farmed areas of commercial <b>bivalves.</b>|$|R
