25|$|North Face: A {{well-established}} {{and classic}} route, very popular amongst mountaineers {{as a good}} introduction to alpine north-face climbing. Graded at AD+ to D-, dependent upon conditions, the route has an average angle of around 52° and the summit takes around 4 hours or more to reach from the Torino Hut. The route's difficulties are being mainly in overcoming the initial <b>bergschrund</b> and the moving from the lower to the upper ice field. By keeping to the right hand side of the slope climbers are able to utilise rock belays {{for much of the}} climb. Dangers involve rock and ice fall, and an early start is necessary to ensure good snow conditions as the face does get exposed to the sun later in the day.|$|E
500|$|The {{most popular}} route, dubbed the south route, begins at Timberline Lodge and {{proceeds}} up Palmer Glacier to Crater Rock, the large prominence {{at the head}} of the glacier. [...] The route goes east around Crater Rock and crosses Coalman Glacier on the Hogsback, a ridge spanning from Crater Rock to the approach to the summit. The Hogsback terminates at a <b>bergschrund</b> where Coalman Glacier separates from the summit rock headwall, and then to Pearly Gates, a gap in the summit rock formation, then right onto the summit plateau and the summit proper.|$|E
500|$|They {{look up at}} {{the awesome}} West wall of the {{mountain}} above them. They walk up the glacier wearing new crampons, probing for crevasses with their ice-axes. They cross the <b>bergschrund</b> and climb [...] "a few feet of easy rock". Carless suggests rappelling 200 feet (60 m) to the next glacier. They agree [...] "it would be difficult" [...] to get back if they did that. They return to their base camp and try again the next morning, again finding their way blocked. They wish the climbing waitresses from Wales were with them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bergschrunds</b> {{extend to}} the bedrock and can have a depth of well over 100 m.|$|R
50|$|According to some {{researchers}} the glaciers between Siula Grande and Yerupaja show a broad {{increase in the}} number, size and frequency of crevasses, and <b>bergschrunds.</b> As a result climbing routes used in the 70s are today considered impracticable.|$|R
50|$|Atwell Peak {{consists}} of three ridges, the north, east, and south. The east ridge connects with the north ridge about 100 horizontal metres north of the summit. All ridges, {{with the possible exception}} of the upper east ridge, are sharp and heavily corniced in winter and spring. The north ridge is the shortest climbing route. Several gullies on the southeast face offer moderate routes that eventually join one of the three ridges. The northeast face is the shortest of the peak's faces but has many <b>bergschrunds.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On September 7, 2007, two Portland-area climbers were {{ascending}} {{a technical}} {{approach to the}} Pearly Gates at early afternoon when one slid {{to the edge of}} the <b>Bergschrund</b> and sustained injuries sufficient for him to call for rescue assistance. [...] His partner decided it was too dangerous to descend the frozen gravel and loose rock face and remained in place. [...] Rescuers arrived about five hours later, assessed the fallen climber, treated minor injuries and belayed him walking down. [...] The other climber required technical climbing equipment and was assisted down the <b>Bergschrund.</b> [...] He walked down and joined his partner about dawn at a Timberline snowcat at the top of the ski area.|$|E
2500|$|On May 30, 2002, three climbers {{were killed}} and four others injured when they fell into a {{crevasse}} (The <b>Bergschrund)</b> in the hogsback. Most unusual was the televised [...] from the 304th RQS, which suddenly lost lift. Though the helicopter's five crew members were injured, no one was killed by the crash.|$|E
2500|$|Crevasses {{can form}} in several {{different}} ways. [...] Transverse crevasses are transverse to flow and form where steeper slopes cause a glacier to accelerate. [...] Longitudinal crevasses form semi-parallel to flow where a glacier expands laterally. [...] Marginal crevasses form {{from the edge of}} the glacier, due to the reduction in speed caused by friction of the valley walls. [...] Marginal crevasses are usually largely transverse to flow. [...] Moving glacier ice can sometimes separate from stagnant ice above, forming a <b>bergschrund.</b> [...] Bergschrunds resemble crevasses but are singular features at a glacier's margins.|$|E
5000|$|No {{developed}} roads or paths lead to Penny Royal Glacier, {{though it}} is frequented by backcountry and wilderness enthusiasts. The glacier is most often accessed from the steep pass between Penny Royal Glacier and Bomber Glacier, from the valley floor at its terminus, or from the Backdoor Gap pass, which separates the glacier from Mint Valley. Penny Royal Glacier lies on the informal [...] "Bomber Traverse" [...] wilderness hiking route through the Talkeetna Mountains. Mountaineers may cross it en route to nearby peaks, and the glacier can be skied. Visitors are cautioned {{to be aware of}} the potential existence of dangerous crevasses, moulins, and <b>bergschrunds,</b> which may come and go with the movement of the glacier.|$|R
50|$|At last {{we came to}} {{the region}} of <b>bergschrunds</b> and crevasses. They seemed to form at first an impassable labyrinth, but {{gradually}} the guides wound in and out between the large rifts, which were exquisitely lovely with their overhanging banks of snow and glittering icicles, and then trod as on pins and needles over a snowbridge here and there, or had to take a jump over the more feasible ones - and we found ourselves {{at the foot of the}} mountain; trudged up on the snow which ought to have been crisp but was even then more or less fresh fallen and sloppy; had to creep over about three crevasses, and after a tiresome pull, dragging one leg after another out of ankle or knee deep snow, we got on a crest of snow at right angles to the slope we had just come up. That slope with its crevasses on one side, and on the other a shorter and much steeper one which led in a few steps to a precipice.|$|R
50|$|In March 1879, Peter Kaufmann {{began his}} own {{career as a}} {{certified}} mountain guide. He had successfully fulfilled {{the requirements of the}} licensing body for Swiss guides in Interlaken. After instruction in various matters connected with the mountains, their geography, as well as the dangers connected with snow, ice, glaciers, and rock such as “the perils of couloirs, hidden crevasses, <b>bergschrunds,</b> and snow bridges,” he had been schooled in first-aid, including treatment and careful transportation of the injured. Moreover, he was expected to know how to avoid accidents and how to act prudently in the event of one. He was required “to be thoroughly acquainted with the mountains of his particular district,” the Bernese Alps, and, in a climbing test, he had to demonstrate his knowledge of the routes, the times needed for ascents, the position of peaks and passes, the use compasses and maps, ropes and ice-picks, such as step-cutting. Moreover, he needed “to show that he had in him the makings of a complete counselor and guardian angel to the climbers under his charge,” showing exemplary behavior at the club huts. After this rigorous training and testing, he was qualified to become an official mountain guide, so that the Governing Body of the District Authority in Interlaken certified him as a licensed guide and issued a paginated, leather-bound book (Führerbuch) in which his future clients could write their comments.|$|R
60|$|By {{and by the}} Indian {{stopped and}} Jimmy looked about. The neck had got very steep and the mist was thick. The pitch {{at the top of}} the glacier is awkward and Jimmy knitted his brows. If he {{balanced}} properly, pushed off, and trailed his rifle butt, he would go down like a toboggan; the trouble was, he might go over a perpendicular fall and into the <b>bergschrund</b> crack. To climb down and slip meant a furious plunge like the other, and if there was not a <b>bergschrund,</b> he might hit a rock. Yet, if he meant to go east, he must get down, and for a few minutes he sat moodily in the snow.|$|E
6000|$|M. Philipin took singly {{the sloping}} {{side of the}} {{connecting}} ridge; and, turning to the right, made straight for the [...] "Pins," [...] below which was spread a fleck of lean and languid green. The ascent was comparatively mild, except where it became a sheet of smooth and slippery granite; but when he reached a clump of large junipers, his course was arrested by a <b>bergschrund,</b> which divides this block--evidently a second outlier--from {{the apex of the}} Shárr, the [...] "Dome" [...] and the [...] "Parrot's Beak." [...] It was vain to attempt a passage of the deep gash, with perpendicular upper walls, and lower slopes overgrown with vegetation; nor could he advance to the right and rejoin his companions, who were parted from him by the precipices on the near side of the Col. Consequently, he beat a retreat, and returned to us at 2.30 p.m., after three hours and thirty minutes of exceedingly thirsty work: the air felt brisk and cool, but the sun shone pitilessly, unveiled by the smallest scrap of mist. He brought with him an ibex-horn still stained with blood, and a branch of juniper, straight enough to make an excellent walking-stick.|$|E
60|$|At last Lewis {{found it}} {{necessary}} to quit the glacier and scale the mountains by way of a pass which led into the gorge from which he hoped to reach the vale of Chamouni. He was in great perplexity here, for, the aspect of the country being unfamiliar to his eye, he feared that he must have lost his way. Nothing but decision, however, and prompt action could serve him now. To have vacillated or retraced part of his steps, would have involved his spending a second night among the icy solitudes without shelter; and this he felt, fatigued and fasting as he was, would have been quite beyond his powers of endurance. He therefore crossed the <b>bergschrund,</b> or crevasse between the glacier and the cliffs, on a snow-bridge, faced the mountain-side once more, and, toiling upwards, reached the summit of the pass a little before sunset. Fortunately the weather continued fine, and the country below appeared much less rugged than that over which he had passed, but he had not yet got clear of difficulties. Just below him lay the longest ice-slope, or couloir, he had hitherto encountered. The snow had been completely swept off its surface, and it bore evidence of being the channel down which rushed the boulders and obelisks of ice that strewed the plain below. To reach that plain by any other route would have involved a circuit of unknown extent. The risk was great but the danger of delay was greater. He swung the heavy axe round his head, and began at once the tedious process of cutting steps. Being an apt scholar, he had profited well from the lessons taught by Le Croix and others. Quick, yet measured and firm, was each stroke. A forced calmness rested on his face, for, while the ice-blocks above, apparently nodding to their fall, warned him to make haste, the fear of slipping a foot, or losing balance, compelled him to be very cautious. In such a case, a rope round the waist and a friend above would have been of inestimable value.|$|E
50|$|A randkluft {{is similar}} to, but not {{identical}} with, a <b>bergschrund,</b> {{which is the}} place on a high-altitude glacier where the moving ice stream breaks away from the static ice frozen to the rock creating a large crevasse. Unlike a randkluft, a <b>bergschrund</b> has two ice walls.|$|E

50|$|The <b>bergschrund</b> is {{distinct}} from the randkluft (also called rimaye), which is the crevasse of which one face is the rock, {{back wall of the}} corrie. The randkluft arises in part from the melting of the ice arising from the presence of the warmer rock face. However, the randkluft is sometimes called a <b>bergschrund.</b>|$|E
50|$|In a corrie or cirque, the <b>bergschrund</b> is {{positioned}} at the rear, {{parallel to the}} back wall of the corrie. It is caused by the rotational movement of the glacier. In a longitudinal glacier, the <b>bergschrund</b> is at the top end of the glacier at a right angle to the flow of the glacier. It is caused by the downwards flow of the glacier.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, {{the hollow}} {{may become a}} large bowl shape {{in the side of}} the mountain, with the {{headwall}} being weathered by ice segregation, and as well as being eroded by plucking. The basin will become deeper as it continues to be eroded by ice segregation and abrasion. Should ice segregation, plucking and abrasion continue, the dimensions of the cirque will increase, but the proportion of the landform would remain roughly the same. A <b>bergschrund</b> forms when the movement of the glacier separates the moving ice from the stationary ice forming a crevasse. The method of erosion of the headwall lying between the surface of the glacier and the cirque’s floor has been attributed to freeze-thaw mechanisms. The temperature within the <b>bergschrund</b> changes very little, however, studies have shown that ice segregation (frost shattering) may happen with only small changes in temperature. Water that flows into the <b>bergschrund</b> can be cooled to freezing temperatures by the surrounding ice allowing freeze-thaw mechanisms to occur.|$|E
50|$|In winter, a <b>bergschrund</b> {{is often}} filled by snow from {{avalanches}} {{from the mountain}} above it. In later summer, due to melting, it lies open and can present a very difficult obstacle to alpinists.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>bergschrund</b> (from the German for {{mountain}} cleft) is a crevasse {{that forms}} where moving glacier ice separates from the stagnant ice or firn above. It {{is often a}} serious obstacle for mountaineers, who sometimes abbreviate [...] "bergschrund" [...] to [...] "schrund".|$|E
50|$|Peak 5390 takes most backpackers one or {{two nights}} to {{approach}} due to its central location on Baranof Island. However, the peak is a nunatak and the final ascent is relatively short; {{only the tip of}} the mountain emerges from the surrounding icefield. The route to Peak 5390 navigates ridges, a cul-de-sac glacier, a glacial headwall, a seasonal <b>bergschrund,</b> and a large icefield. Only experienced climbers should undertake a trip, and local knowledge is recommended.|$|E
