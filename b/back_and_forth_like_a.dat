500|$|In the summer, {{water would}} be used to sluice and pan the dirt, {{separating}} out the heavier gold from gravel. This required miners to construct sluices, which were sequences of wooden boxes [...] long, through which the dirt would be washed; up to 20 of these might be needed for each mining operation. The sluices in turn required lots of water, usually produced by creating a dam and ditches or crude pipes. [...] "Bench gold" [...] mining on the hill sides could not use sluice lines because water could not be pumped that high up. Instead, these mines used rockers, boxes that moved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cradle, to create the motion needed for separation. Finally, the resulting gold dust could be exported out of the Klondike; exchanged for paper money at the rate of $16 ($430) per troy ounce (ozt) through one of the major banks that opened in Dawson City, or simply used as money when dealing with local traders.|$|E
500|$|Players {{dispatch}} enemies {{by either}} thrusting {{at them with}} his Dragon Sword or by defeating them using Power Boosting Items. These special items consume Ryu's [...] "ninja power", also located {{on the top of}} the screen. Power Boosting Items include the following: shurikens; [...] "Windmill Throwing Stars" [...] that move <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> boomerang; [...] "The Art of the Fire Wheel" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally upwards; [...] "Fire Dragon Balls" [...] which hurls fireballs diagonally downwards; and the [...] "Invincible Fire Wheel" [...] that creates a barrier of three fireballs around Ryu, destroying any enemy that touches them. These items can be found in various crystal balls scattered throughout the levels, and they can be switched out by collecting another Power Boosting Item. The amount of ninja power used depends on the type of Power Boosting Item used. At the end of each Act Ryu fights a boss which has its own strength meter, located {{on the top of the}} screen. The boss's strength meter decreases every time the player damages it, and the boss is destroyed when the player completely depletes its strength meter.|$|E
500|$|Verlaine and Lloyd interplayed their guitars {{around the}} rhythm section's drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing drew on 1960s rock and avant-garde jazz styles, abandoning the layered power chords of {{contemporary}} punk rock {{in favor of}} melodic lines and counter-melodies. Verlaine established the song's rhythmic phrase, against which Lloyd played dissonant melodies. Lloyd had learned to notate his solos {{by the time they}} recorded Marquee Moon, allowing him to develop his solo for a song from introduction to variation and resolution. The two traded rhythmic and melodic lines several times on some songs while producing tension. [...] "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jigsaw puzzle", Lloyd said. Most of the solos on Marquee Moon followed a pattern wherein Verlaine ran up a major scale but regressed slightly after each step. On [...] "See No Evil", he soloed through a full octave before playing a blues-influenced riff, and on the title track, he played in a Mixolydian mode and lowered the seventh by half a step. Lloyd opened [...] "Friction" [...] by playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing harmonics and series of descending scales.|$|E
60|$|The yacht was {{steaming}} {{at nearly}} full speed over waters as placid as a pond, and {{here and there}} were craft of all kinds darting <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> active fish.|$|R
5000|$|Hopkins is {{mentioned}} in Erykah Badu's 2010 [...] "Window Seat": [...] "I don't want to time-travel no more, I {{want to be}} here. On this porch I'm rockin', <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> Lightnin' Hopkins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{hardly know}} {{ourselves}} what has happened," [...] said Uncle John. [...] "We {{can hear the}} boom of guns yet, even at this distance, and we left the battle line flowing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> the waves of the ocean. Have a cup of tea, Maurie?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{then fell}} upon {{the ground and}} the boy rolled her <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> rolling-pin, until the cotton had filled all the spaces in her {{patchwork}} covering and the body had lengthened to its fullest extent. Scraps and the Scarecrow both finished their hasty toilets at the same time, and again they faced each other.|$|E
60|$|Upweekis {{has lost}} the trail again; he wavers <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> shadow under a {{swinging}} lamp, turning his great {{head from side to}} side. He cannot see nor hear nor smell his game; but he saw a bit of snow fly a moment ago, and knows that it came from Moktaques' big pads. Don't stir now; be still as the great spruce in whose shadow you stand; and, once in a hunter's lifetime perhaps, you will see a curious tragedy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see; I see," [...] said Ruggedo, nodding his bushy, white head {{until the}} point of his hair waved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pendulum. [...] "That fits in with my idea, exactly. Now, listen, and I'll explain to you my plan. We'll fly to Oz as birds and settle {{in one of the}} thick forests in the Gillikin Country. There you will {{transform}} us into powerful beasts, and as Glinda doesn't keep any track of the doings of beasts we can act without being discovered." ...|$|E
5000|$|The school's mascot is the Thunderbolt, but its student populace {{are more}} colloquially {{known as the}} T-Bolts or just the Bolts. This moniker was unintentionally gained from a {{basketball}} commentator in the school system's early years (circa 1960s), who, while watching the high school boys' team racing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> across the court, exclaimed that they zipping <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> [...] "thunderbolts." ...|$|R
50|$|Two {{characters}} {{introduced in}} previous stories {{return for the}} first time in this one: the resourceful Seccotine, and the shifty Zantafio who was last seen repenting his scoundrel ways at the conclusion of Spirou et les h√©ritiers, but later evolved into a worse villain. Franquin expressed regrets at twisting the character <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> this, but later did the same again with Zorglub.|$|R
60|$|There was {{no longer}} any doubt! The lamp was beating <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> the clapper of a great bell. Where was he? Billy sought a window. He found some little round, glass-covered holes near the low ceiling at {{one side of the}} room. It was only at the {{greatest}} risk to life and limb that he managed to crawl on all fours to one of them.|$|R
60|$|So Peter said good-by {{and kept}} on down the Laughing Brook to the Smiling Pool. Right where the Laughing Brook entered the Smiling Pool {{there was a little}} pebbly beach. Running along {{the very edge of the}} water was a slim, trim little bird with fairly long legs, a long slender bill, brownish-gray back with black spots and markings, and a white {{waistcoat}} neatly spotted with black. Every few steps he would stop to pick up something, then stand for a second bobbing up and down in the funniest way, as if his body was so nicely balanced on his legs that it teetered <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> seesaw. It was Teeter the Spotted Sandpiper, an old friend of Peter's. Peter greeted him joyously.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was at Bellagio, {{stopping}} at the big hotel there, and ten days ago I lost my letter of credit. I {{did not know what}} in the world to do. I was a stranger; I knew no one in Europe; I hadn't a penny in my pocket; I couldn't even send a telegram to London to get my lost letter replaced; my hotel bill was a week old, and the presentation of it imminent--so imminent that it could happen at any moment now. I was so frightened that my wits seemed to leave me. I tramped and tramped, <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> crazy person. If anybody approached me I hurried away, for no matter what a person looked like, I took him for the head waiter with the bill.|$|E
6000|$|Jukes' glance was {{wandering}} and tipsy; his red {{face was}} puffy, {{as though he}} had overslept himself. He had had an arduous road, and had travelled over it with immense vivacity, the agitation of his mind corresponding to the exertions of his body. He had rushed up out of the bunker, stumbling in the dark alleyway amongst a lot of bewildered men who, trod upon, asked [...] "What's up, sir?" [...] in awed mutters all round him;--down the stokehold ladder, missing many iron rungs in his hurry, down into a place deep as a well, black as Tophet, tipping over <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> see-saw. The water in the bilges thundered at each roll, and lumps of coal skipped to and fro, from end to end, rattling like an avalanche of pebbles on a slope of iron.|$|E
5000|$|One {{interpretation}} of Sakamoto's work notes {{his use of}} volume changes as way to mimic the movement of water: [...] "In Jaws (1987) ... the overwater music sways from soft to loud and loud to soft, rocking <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> the undulating waves of a shark-infested ocean." [...] The effect isn't very smooth, however, because of technological constraints: the Nintendo's sound chip was limited to 16 discrete volume settings.|$|R
6000|$|Both saints {{began to}} unfold their tales at once, [...] Both wished their tales, like simial ones, prehensile, [...] That they might seize his ear; fool! knave! and dunce! [...] Flew zigzag <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> strokes of pencil [...] In a child's fingers; voluble as duns, [...] They jabbered like the stones on that immense hill [...] In the Arabian Nights; until the {{stranger}} [...] Began to think his ear-drum in some danger.|$|R
5000|$|Game {{designer}} Dale Donovan {{noted in}} Pyramid: [...] "The {{fact that both}} the 300th issue of Dragon and issue #95 of Dungeon had sealed, [...] "mature content" [...] sections incited more than one Internet flame war, with lots of folks flying off the handle in this direction or that, numerous invectives being tossed <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> hot potatoes, <b>and</b> scores of teeth gnashed {{for one reason or}} another. All that, and the book wasn't even out yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Let us go on,' {{said the}} woman. Her eyes were hungry, {{and her hand}} was upon her heart, as with the hurt of {{something}} inside. She bent <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> tree in the wind as she stood there. 'Yes, let us go on,' said the man. His voice was hollow, like the klonk of an old raven, and he was hunger-mad. His eyes were like live coals of fire, and as his body rocked to and fro, so rocked his soul inside. And I, too, said, 'Let us go on.' For that one thought, laid upon me like a lash for every mile of fifteen hundred miles, had burned itself into my soul, and I think that I, too, was mad. Besides, we could only go on, for there was no grub. And we went on, giving no thought to {{the man with the}} one eye in the snow.|$|E
6000|$|... 'One hot night I saw the Boy roving {{about here}} wrapped in his flaming discontents. There was flash on flash against the clouds, and rush on rush of shadows {{down the valley}} till the shaws were full of his hounds giving tongue, and the woodways were packed with his knights in armour riding down into the water-mists--all his own Magic, of course. Behind them you could see great castles lifting slow and splendid on arches of moonshine, with maidens waving their hands at the windows, which all turned into roaring rivers; and then would come the {{darkness}} of his own young heart wiping out the whole slateful. But boy's Magic doesn't trouble me--or Merlin's either for that matter. I followed the Boy by the flashes and the whirling wildfire of his discontent, and oh, but I grieved for him! Oh, but I grieved for him! He pounded <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bullock in a strange pasture--sometimes alone--sometimes waist-deep among his shadow-hounds--sometimes leading his shadow-knights on a hawk-winged horse to rescue his shadow-girls. I never guessed he had such Magic at his command; but it's often that way with boys.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know not}} how the Devils leaped down, {{or how the}} fight began. I heard Hugh cry: [...] "Out! out!" [...] {{as though he were}} at Santlache again; I saw Thorkild's steel cap smitten off his head by a great hairy hand, and I felt an arrow from the ship whistle past my ear. They say that till Witta took his sword to the rowers he could not bring his ship inshore; and each one of the four archers said {{afterwards}} that he alone had pierced the Devil that fought me. I do not know. I went to it in my mail-shirt, which saved my skin. With long-sword and belt-dagger I fought for the life against a Devil whose very feet were hands, and who whirled me <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> dead branch. He had me by the waist, my arms to my side, when an arrow from the ship pierced him between the shoulders, and he loosened grip. I passed my sword twice through him, and he crutched himself away between his long arms, coughing and moaning. Next, as I remember, I saw Thorkild of Borkum, bare-headed and smiling, leaping up and down before a Devil that leaped and gnashed his teeth. Then Hugh passed, his sword shifted to his left hand, and I wondered why I had not known that Hugh was a left-handed man; and thereafter I remembered nothing till I felt spray on my face, and we were in sunshine on the open sea. That was twenty days after.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... (b) The {{one thing}} in the world that {{he wanted to do was}} to be right here, for the most miraculous event of which he had ever heard was meeting Miss Nash. First one, then the other, these {{thoughts}} swashed <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> the swinging tides. He got away from them only long enough to rejoice that somehow--he didn't know how--he was going to be her most intimate friend, because they were both Americans in a strange land and because they both could make-believe.|$|R
60|$|Impelled by {{the blows}} that rained upon him, now from this side, now from that, White Fang swung <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> an erratic <b>and</b> jerky pendulum. Varying were the {{emotions}} that surged through him. At first, he had known surprise. Then came a momentary fear, when he yelped several times {{to the impact of}} the hand. But this was quickly followed by anger. His free nature asserted itself, and he showed his teeth and snarled fearlessly {{in the face of the}} wrathful god. This but served to make the god more wrathful. The blows came faster, heavier, more shrewd to hurt.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no! It is the Wall. Along the top are towers with guard-houses, small towers, between. Even on {{the narrowest}} {{part of it}} three men with shields can walk abreast, from guard-house to guard-house. A little curtain wall, no higher than a man's neck, runs {{along the top of}} the thick wall, so that from a {{distance}} you see the helmets of the sentries sliding <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> beads. Thirty feet high is the Wall, and on the Picts' side, the North, is a ditch, strewn with blades of old swords and spear-heads set in wood, and tyres of wheels joined by chains. The Little People come there to steal iron for their arrow-heads.|$|R
5000|$|The wig-wag {{is mounted}} atop the washing machine's transmission, where it oscillates <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{railroad}} signaling wig-wag (hence the name).

5000|$|The {{competitor}} {{walks across}} a 4 in wide, plank-like bridge that moves <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pendulum, when walked on.

50|$|The 50' {{climbing}} wall (Carolina Straight Wall), {{built in}} 2001, has six faces {{with varying degrees}} of difficulty. The 50' tower (Alpine Tower II), built in 2001, has six routes to the top and various obstacles to tackle, including cargo nets and hanging logs. A swing is suspended between the tower and an adjacent support. Riders are attached to the swing, hoisted diagonally and then released to swing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pendulum.|$|E
60|$|Daylight's muscles tautened {{a second}} time, {{and this time}} in earnest, until {{steadily}} all the energy of his splendid body was applied, and quite imperceptibly, without jerk or strain, the bulky nine hundred pounds rose from the door <b>and</b> swung <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> pendulum <b>like,</b> between his legs.|$|R
25|$|She {{was dressed}} for {{traveling}} and for cold weather. Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, ‚Äî it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally.

50|$|A non-holonomic {{solution}} in this case, roughly speaking, {{corresponds to a}} motion of the car by sliding in the plane. In this case the non-holonomic solutions are not only homotopic to holonomic ones but also can be arbitrarily well approximated by the holonomic ones (by going <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth,</b> <b>like</b> parallel parking in a limited space) - note that this approximates both the position and {{the angle of the}} car arbitrarily closely. This implies that, theoretically, it is possible to parallel park in any space longer than the length of your car. It also implies that, in a contact 3 manifold, any curve is -close to a Legendrian curve.This last property is stronger than the general h-principle; it is called the -dense h-principle.|$|R
50|$|The SDS shank has the {{advantage}} of fitting into a simple spring-loaded chuck, so that bits are simply pushed into the chuck without tightening. This shank and chucks made for it are especially suited to hammer drilling with masonry drills in stone and concrete. The drill bit is not held solidly in the chuck, but can slide <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> piston; it does not slip during rotation due to the non-circular shank cross-section, matching the chuck. The hammer of the drill acts to accelerate only the drill bit itself, and not the large mass of the chuck, which makes hammer drilling with an SDS shank drill bit much more productive than with other types of shank.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve the}} layered dough for plain parathas, {{a number of}} {{different}} traditional techniques exist. These include covering the thinly rolled out pastry with oil, folding <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> paper fan and coiling the resulting strip into a round shape before rolling flat, baking on the tava and shallow frying. Another method is to cut a circle of dough from the centre to its circumference along its radius, oiling the dough and starting at the cut edge rolling so as to form a cone which is then squashed into a disc shape and rolled out. The method of oiling and repeatedly folding the dough as in western puff pastry also exists, and this is combined with folding patterns that give traditional geometrical shapes to the finished parathas. Plain parathas can be round, heptagonal, square, or triangular.|$|E

60|$|Here were no seals whatever. The boat‚Äôs stern {{touched the}} hard shingle. I sprang out, {{extending}} {{my hand to}} Maud. The next moment she was beside me. As my fingers released hers, she clutched for my arm hastily. At the same moment I swayed, as about to fall to the sand. This was the startling effect of the cessation of motion. We {{had been so long}} upon the moving, rocking sea that the stable land was a shock to us. We expected the beach to lift up this way and that, and the rocky walls to swing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> the sides of a ship; and when we braced ourselves, automatically, for these various expected movements, their non-occurrence quite overcame our equilibrium.|$|R
5000|$|In the Old Testament, Chapter 1 of the Book of Ezekiel recounts {{a vision}} in which Ezekiel sees [...] "an immense cloud" [...] that {{contains}} fire and emits lightning and [...] "brilliant light". It continues: [...] "The {{center of the}} fire looked like glowing metal, and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures". These creatures are described as winged and humanoid, they [...] "sped <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>like</b> flashes of lightning" [...] and [...] "fire moved <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> among the creatures". The passage goes on to describe four shiny objects, each appearing [...] "like a wheel intersecting a wheel". These objects could fly and they moved with the creatures: [...] "When the living creatures moved, the wheels beside them moved; and when the living creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose".|$|R
