25|$|EBPVD {{systems are}} {{equipped}} with ion sources. These ion sources are used for substrate etching and cleaning, sputtering the target and controlling the microstructure of the substrate. The ion beams bombard the surface and alter the microstructure of the film. When the deposition reaction takes place on the hot substrate surface, the films can develop an internal tensile stress due to the mismatch in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} between the substrate and the film. High-energy ions can be used to bombard these ceramic thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coatings</b> and change the tensile stress into compressive stress. Ion bombardment also increases the density of the film, changes the grain size and modifies amorphous films to polycrystalline films. Low-energy ions are used for the surfaces of semiconductor films.|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} of the petroleum cost in the last decades revitalized the interest for lighter and more economic vehicles. Simultaneously, the demand for safe and unpolluted transports grows. The application of thermal <b>barriers</b> <b>coatings</b> (TBC) on combustion chamber and on flat surface of pistons reduces the thermal losses of the engines, resulting in higher temperatures in the combus-tion chamber. This fact contributes to {{the improvement of the}} thermal efficiency (performance) and for the reduction of incomplete combustion. Supported on these initial ideas, thermal <b>barriers</b> <b>coatings</b> constituted by CaO partially stabilized zirconia were produced and their microstructure examined. This coating still presents some drawbacks associated with thermal stresses and permeability to oxidizing gases, which will, eventually, lead to failure of the TBC by spallation. The failure may, in general, be associated to one of three factors: oxide growth at the ceramic-metal interface, formed during thermal cycling; stress build-up due to thermal cycling; and metal-oxide interface segregation, mainly of S. However, it is also relevant to understand the behavior of TBC’s under isothermal oxidation. Therefore, this paper investigates the effect of oxidation on the adherence of thermal sprayed coatings. The adherence was measured by linear scratching tests, widely used fo...|$|R

25|$|Thin-film {{deposition}} is {{a process}} applied in the semiconductor industry to grow electronic materials, in the aerospace industry to form thermal and chemical <b>barrier</b> <b>coatings</b> to protect surfaces against corrosive environments, in optics to impart the desired reflective and transmissive properties to a substrate and elsewhere in industry to modify surfaces to {{have a variety of}} desired properties. The deposition process can be broadly classified into physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In CVD, the film growth takes place at high temperatures, leading to the formation of corrosive gaseous products, and it may leave impurities in the film. The PVD process can be carried out at lower deposition temperatures and without corrosive products, but deposition rates are typically lower. Electron-beam physical vapor deposition, however, yields a high deposition rate from 0.1 to 100 μm/min at relatively low substrate temperatures, with very high material utilization efficiency. The schematic of an EBPVD system is shown in Fig 1.|$|E
25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coatings.</b> However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInterfacial {{toughness}} is {{an important}} factor to address thermal <b>barrier</b> <b>coating's</b> (TBC) durability. In this paper, a promising method, based on interfacial indentation, is used to analyze apparent interfacial toughness of TBC deposited by Atmospheric Plasma Spray (APS). The specimens made by APS were treated using different oxidation holding times and temperatures, namely 1050 C‐circle‐ 100 h, 1100 C‐circle‐ 100 h, 1050 C‐circle‐ 300 h and 1100 C‐circle‐ 300 h, respectively. The morphology of the interface between the TBC and the underlying bond coat was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Results have shown that the fracture toughness of the interface between the bond coat and the top coat decreased as the oxidation conditions become more severe that is the temperature and/or to a lesser extent the exposure time is increased. Simultaneously, the thickness of the thermally grown oxide (TGO) generated on top of the aluminum reservoir bond coat increases as well. The TGO is a ``double layer'' oxide successively composed of a first scale of Al 2 O 3 close to the bond coat and a second scale of CoCrNiO close to top coat. In addition, it was also found that the possible thermally activated spallation ofAPS TBC's system occurs in the zone of the TGO layer, especially within the CoCrNiO oxide scale. Consequently damage of APS systems is shown to initiate at the interface through complex mechanism of delamination in relation with both the toughness and the microstructure of the interface. In order to inhibit the growth of the detrimental CoCrNiO oxide and in turn favors the development of a dense and stable alumina scale, a Supersonic Fine Particles Bombarding (SFPB) method was used to optimize the quality of APS coating...|$|R
