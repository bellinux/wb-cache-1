He decided to take on the role of lead vocals himself in the absence of Lynott, and persuaded Scott Gorham, Brian Downey and Darren Wharton to return to the fold. To complete the line-up, Marco Mendoza continued in Lynott's role as <b>bass</b> <b>player.</b> They received criticism for using the Thin Lizzy name without Lynott being present, but the band only played hits from Thin Lizzy's back catalogue, and did not compose any new material.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Smith's death, the fourteen-year-old Lennon was visiting members of the Stanley family in Sango Bay, Durness, Scotland, and was not {{informed}} until he returned home. Lennon's first reaction was to laugh hysterically, but then to privately grieve and cry, as he later did after hearing {{about the death of}} his mother three years later, and the death of Stuart Sutcliffe (The Beatles' first <b>bass</b> <b>player)</b> which were all major factors in Lennon's early life. In the same year as Smith’s death the McCartney family moved to 20 Forthlin Road, which is only ¾ of a mile (1.2km) from Mendips. Lennon would later meet Paul McCartney {{for the first time at}} St. Peter's Church, where Smith was buried.|$|E

5|$|Death Cab for Cutie {{began as}} a solo project of Ben Gibbard in 1997, while he was the guitar player for the band Pinwheel, and was {{recorded}} under the name All-Time Quarterback. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords the same year. The release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, recruiting Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as lead guitarist, Nick Harmer as <b>bass</b> <b>player,</b> and Nathan Good as drummer. Death Cab for Cutie was officially formed at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, and lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band's development. Many of the early songs were recorded {{in the basement of}} an Ellis Street home Gibbard lived in with several roommates in Bellingham.|$|E
5|$|DecembeRadio played {{its last}} concert on November 8, 2012.

By 2014, the band members had {{moved on to other}} projects. Josh Reedy toured as a <b>bass</b> <b>player</b> with Chris Cagle, then joined Thomas Rhett's band as a keyboardist and guitarist. Brian Bunn had a stint as a touring guitarist with Third Day, then joined Reedy in Rhett's band.

In {{contrast to his}} touring for The Way I See It, Saadiq {{did not include a}} horn section for certain shows and played on guitar for a more rock-oriented sound. While travelling between concert dates, Saadiq and his bandmates watched music documentaries for inspiration, including a documentary on Bob Marley & The Wailers and the 1973 film Wattstax. He expanded his touring in promotion of the album into August 2011, with concerts alternating between North American headlining dates and European music festivals.|$|E

Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is Drive Shaft, and that nobody knows who the <b>bass</b> <b>player</b> (Charlie) is. He goes on to tell Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin Drive Shaft for a {{comeback}} tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie {{to stay with him}} for a few weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and that he can get Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has a plane to catch.|$|E
5|$|Many {{rock and}} metal fans that became Christians through the {{ministry}} of Christian metal bands were rejected from churches in the 1980s. In 1984, California pastor Bob Beeman saw this problem and soon started the ministry called Sanctuary - The Rock and Roll Refuge. This fellowship brought many musicians together and formed groups such as Tourniquet, Deliverance, Vengeance and Mortal that would soon become ground breaking acts in Christian music culture. Sanctuary's first worship leader was Stryper's vocalist Michael Sweet and later Barren Cross' <b>bass</b> <b>player</b> Jim LaVerde. Sanctuary sponsored the first Christian metal festival, The Metal Mardi Gras, held in 1987 in Los Angeles. This proved influential and soon Christian metal festivals were organized elsewhere as well. Sanctuary's activities began spreading, and it had 36 parishes all over the United States at its peak by the 1990s. The Sanctuary parishes {{had a significant impact}} on the Christian metal movement: groups that would later become notable such as P.O.D. performed their first concerts in Sanctuary.|$|E

He also ruled himself out of being the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver due to the experiences he has had of being the vocalist of his own band Loaded, saying that being the lead vocalist and being a <b>bass</b> <b>player</b> at the same time was not as appealing to him because it would require him to be much more static in his stage presence, saying that he prefers moving around on stage during live performances. In the same interview, McKagan talked about his new book which was then in the writing stages.|$|E
