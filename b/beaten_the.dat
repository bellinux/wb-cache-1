On {{the last day of}} the season, October 3, Boston won their game and Cleveland lost, giving them identical 96–58 records and forcing a tiebreaker the following day at Boston. The Indians chose rookie Gene Bearden to start against Boston in the tie-breaker, despite only having one day of rest, as he had <b>beaten</b> <b>the</b> Red Sox twice that season, and the Red Sox chose Denny Galehouse, passing on Mel Parnell, who had <b>beaten</b> <b>the</b> Indians on three separate occasions that season.|$|E
5|$|The National League used {{a three-game}} playoff (prior to 1969) {{to break a}} tie for the pennant, the winner of which would face the American League {{champion}} Yankees in the 1951 World Series. The Dodgers won the coin toss for home field advantage, but opted to host game one at Ebbets Field on October 1, while the Giants would as a result get to host games two and three at the Polo Grounds on October 2 and 3. The Dodgers chose Ralph Branca, who also started {{the first game of}} the 1946 tiebreaker, to start game one because he had <b>beaten</b> <b>the</b> Giants twice in the regular season, while the Giants chose Jim Hearn, who had <b>beaten</b> <b>the</b> Dodgers twice that year.|$|E

On August 25, 750, the Abbasids, having already <b>beaten</b> <b>the</b> Umayyads in the Battle of the Zab in Iraq, conquered Damascus after facing little resistance. With the heralding of the Abbasid Caliphate, Damascus became eclipsed and subordinated by Baghdad, the new Islamic capital.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be <b>beaten.</b> <b>The</b> prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals.

Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up the photograph of Luke with the women.|$|E

5|$|For the Persians, the two {{expeditions to}} Greece {{had been largely}} successful; new territories had been added to their empire and Eretria had been punished.

It {{was the first time}} that Greeks had <b>beaten</b> <b>the</b> Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.|$|E
