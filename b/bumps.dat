5|$|Bony crests {{are found}} on the skulls of many theropods, {{including}} many tyrannosaurids. Alioramus, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single row of five prominent bony <b>bumps</b> on the nasal bones; a similar row of much lower <b>bumps</b> is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus, {{as well as some}} specimens of Daspletosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tarbosaurus. In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on the lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each eye on the postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior.|$|E
5|$|The circuit was resurfaced {{ahead of}} the race weekend, {{smoothing}} out many of the <b>bumps</b> and imperfections that had developed over time. The new surface—introduced to allow the circuit to accommodate a round of the MotoGP World Championship—saw teams projecting lap times of under 1:06.000 for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed sealing the mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (<b>bumps</b> and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bump</b> {{capability}} in PayPal’s apps {{was removed}} in March 2012. At that time, <b>Bump</b> Technologies released <b>Bump</b> Pay, an iOS app that lets users transfer money via PayPal by physically <b>bumping</b> two smartphones together. The tool was originally {{created for the}} <b>Bump</b> team to use when splitting up restaurant bills. The payment feature was not added to the <b>Bump</b> app because the company “wanted {{to make it as}} simple as possible so people understand how this works,” Lieb told ABC News. <b>Bump</b> Pay was the first app from the company’s <b>Bump</b> Labs initiative. A goal of <b>Bump</b> Labs is to test new app ideas that may not fit within the main <b>Bump</b> app.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For {{flip-chip}} {{process of}} RF system-on-packages(SOP), double <b>bump</b> bonding processes were investigated. Sn-Ag and Sn solder joints were {{formed by the}} reflowed double <b>bumping</b> process, and Sn/In/Sn <b>bump</b> joints were fabricated by the non-reflowed double <b>bump</b> bonding process. The height-to-size ratios of 0. 78 and 0. 65 were obtained for the reflowed double <b>bumping</b> and the non-reflowed <b>bumping,</b> respectively. Average contact resistance of the reflowed Sn-Ag and Sn solder joints was about 13 mΩ which was much lower than 24 ~ 33 mΩ of the non-reflowed Sn/In/Sn <b>bump</b> joints. The reflowed solder double <b>bumping</b> method is more suitable for flip-chip process of RF-SOP than the non-reflowed double <b>bump</b> bonding...|$|R

5|$|The broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical spores are 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. Their surfaces {{are covered with}} small rounded <b>bumps.</b> The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–30 by 6–7.5μm. The hyphae of the flesh are brownish with thin walls, and measure 4–6μm; hyphae in the spines are thin-walled, septate, and sometimes branched, measuring 3.5–4.5μm. The hyphae do not have clamp connections.|$|E
50|$|The {{space of}} <b>bump</b> {{functions}} is closed under many operations. For instance, the sum, product, or convolution of two <b>bump</b> functions is again a <b>bump</b> function, and any differential operator with smooth coefficients, {{when applied to}} a <b>bump</b> function, will produce another <b>bump</b> function.|$|R
50|$|The elbow <b>bump</b> as a {{greeting}} is also attributed to be a derivative {{of the more}} well known fist <b>bump,</b> beginning in the 1980s. The earliest written record of the elbow <b>bump</b> by David Grimes supports this hypothesis. More recently, Shaquille O'Neal demonstrated the derivative nature of the elbow <b>bump</b> {{in relation to the}} fist <b>bump</b> in 2004, when he dismissed Kobe Bryant's greeting with a half-hearted elbow <b>bump.</b>|$|R

5|$|The fogstand beetle of the Namib Desert, Stenocara gracilipes, is able {{to collect}} water from fog, as its elytra have a {{textured}} surface combining hydrophilic (water-loving) <b>bumps</b> and waxy, hydrophobic troughs. The beetle faces the early morning breeze, holding up its abdomen; droplets condense on the elytra and run along ridges towards their mouthparts. Similar adaptations are found in several other Namib desert beetles such as Onymacris unguicularis.|$|E
5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish {{sides of the}} tiles, and entail that tiles may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, tiles must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the <b>bumps</b> on their edges fit together.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} showing that dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers. Some dromaeosaurid fossils preserve long, pennaceous feathers on the hands and arms (remiges) and tail (rectrices), as well as shorter, down-like feathers covering the body. Other fossils, which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers, still preserve the associated <b>bumps</b> on the forearm bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life. Overall, this feather pattern looks very much like Archaeopteryx.|$|E

5|$|To {{termites}}, any {{breach of}} their tunnels or nests {{is a cause}} for alarm. When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an alarmed termite <b>bumps</b> into other termites which causes them to be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area, {{which is also a}} way to recruit extra workers.|$|E
5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} {{is distinguished}} from other {{species in the}} genus Wynnea by the pustules (small <b>bumps)</b> on the outer surface, and microscopically by the large asymmetrical longitudinally ribbed spores with a sharply pointed tip. The spores are made in structures called asci, which have thickened rings at one end that are capped by a hinged structure known as the operculum—a lid that is opened when spores are {{to be released from}} the ascus.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small <b>bumps</b> or short projections on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body projections that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{high power}} LED is often {{packaged}} with flip chip method. The gold <b>bump</b> is usually made by electroplating or gold evaporation, which cause the environment pollution and material waste. A gold wire <b>bump</b> manufacture technology for high power LED flip chip {{is described in}} this paper. The wire bond device is used and different <b>bump</b> making parameters, such as weld temperature, pressure and ultrasonic power, are optimized through experiments. At the same time, a new <b>bump</b> wire tail height managing process is introduced. The gold wire <b>bump</b> with this method height difference keep in 3 micrometers and which is convenient for flip chip.

5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures. Such structures {{may have little}} or no function in a current species, yet have a clear function in ancestral species, or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes, and sexual traits in organisms that reproduce via asexual reproduction. Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose <b>bumps</b> and primitive reflexes.|$|E
5|$|In September 2008, Apple sent a {{cease and desist}} {{letter to}} the Victoria School of Business and Technology in Saanich, British Columbia, {{claiming}} the school's logo infringed Apple's trademark rights and that the school's logo falsely suggested Apple had authorized the school's activities. The logo in question featured the outline of an apple and a leaf, although the design incorporated a mountain, had three <b>bumps</b> {{on top of the}} apple instead of the two used by Apple, and had no bite out of the apple, unlike Apple's logo. In April 2011, the school reported it had settled its 3-year dispute with Apple, was launching a new logo under a new name, Q College, and was expanding its operations. The settlement's full terms were undisclosed.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype of C. casuarius, {{the sides}} and tail of the body are covered in scales of several types. Polygonal tuberculate scales, covered in small <b>bumps,</b> vary in size over the body. Conical limpet-like scales are only {{preserved}} on a fold of skin preserved {{on the back of}} the tibia, but which was probably from the bottom of the belly, rather than the leg. Separating the polygonal scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales, arranged close together in rows. Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae, except for those in the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and transversely ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point.|$|E

40|$|A {{cylindrical}} <b>bump</b> with a spherical {{free end}} has been {{mounted on a}} cylindrical surface, and flow visualization, surface pressure measurements and the turbulent velocity statistics measurements were performed. The thickness of the turbulent boundary layer was thinner than the <b>bump</b> height at {{the position of the}} <b>bump.</b> Slenderness parameter (H/D) of the <b>bump</b> was 1. This setup was a prototype of a typical wall-mounted sensor on aircrafts, therefore it has practical importance. Analysis of the experimental data shows that thickness of the turbulent boundary layer controls the location of separation over the <b>bump.</b> Spherical ending of the <b>bump</b> delays the separation, especially from half height of the <b>bump</b> {{to the top of the}} <b>bump.</b> It also affects the strength of trailing vortices created at the free end of the <b>bump,</b> and hence size of the separated region. The thickness of the horseshoe vortices are directly related to the freestream velocity. The curvature of the ground plate does not have significant effect for far downstream positions...|$|R
