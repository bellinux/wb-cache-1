On the TGS set, a huge {{poster of}} Jenna is hung with her real {{birthday}} and death date. When Jenna sees that her real birth date is displayed, she comes out of hiding and appears on stage to cover the poster. After witnessing this, Liz confronts Jenna and Tracy for their behavior, but is glad to be <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day of the strike, which has spread to Buffland's rival city of Clearfield , the mood among the laborers has turned ugly. Temple warns that the attacks on Algonquin Avenue are imminent, and aids Farnham's force in turning back assaults on the captain's house and on the Belding residence. Bott and Sleeny are {{captured}} by the force; the former is sent to prison but Farnham has pity on Sleeny as a good workman, and the carpenter serves only a few days. The settlement of the strike in Clearfield takes the wind out of the Buffland action, and soon most are <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> though some agitators are dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in Rock Springs was stabilized {{as early as}} September 15, when Warren first requested the removal of federal troops, but the mines at Rock Springs remained closed for a time. On September 30, 1885, white miners, mostly Finnish immigrants {{who were members of}} the Knights of Labor, walked out of mines in Carbon County, Wyoming, in protest of the company's continued use of Chinese miners. In Rock Springs, the white miners were not <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> in late September, because the company still used Chinese labor. Rock Springs steadily became quieter, and, on October 5, 1885, emergency troops, except for two companies, were removed. However, the temporary posts of Camp Medicine Butte, established in Evanston, and of Camp Pilot Butte, in Rock Springs, remained long after the riot. Camp Pilot Butte closed in 1899 after the onset of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, LaBonge finds a {{man named}} Cissy Alvarez whom Maleeni owed money. LaBonge admits that he caused Maleeni's head to fall off, and says that he will give Alvarez the money he is owed if he helps him with his magic. Mulder and Scully learn that Maleeni has an {{identical}} twin brother, Albert. Albert, interestingly enough is even wearing a neckbrace, which he says he got {{in a car accident}} in Mexico. Mulder tells him he thinks he did the magic act, but the man shows that he has no legs, which he also lost in Mexico in the car accident. <b>Back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> Alvarez threatens Pinchbeck that he will kill him if he does not get his money. LaBonge then frames Alvarez for a robbery by attacking a security truck disguised as Alvarez. Mulder soon finds out that Pinchbeck is the real Maleeni and that he faked having no legs. After confronting Pinchbeck, he admits that he faked his own death in order to get out of Alvarez's debt. Pinchbeck admits that he found his brother dead of a heart attack at home and used his body as a double. Pinchbeck is promptly arrested, as is LaBonge, who brings a gun to a bar, in an attempt to purposely get arrested. In addition, Alvarez is arrested because of the attempted robbery LaBonge did earlier.|$|E
5|$|During a {{night out}} in {{the one of the}} Zones – the cordoned off zone of {{decaying}} ghettos surrounding the City of London – Mike introduces Chris to journalist Liz Linshaw, who is also Mike's former mistress. Before they leave the Zones, Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. <b>Back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn's contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. The challenge is settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris' profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. As Chris becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria's son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader might be a better option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London to shop for arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris's efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan's death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn's employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it's the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum for their clients. While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Columbia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan's son.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} some time since people began to argue that {{folklore}} studies is in decline. The author might not be alone in thinking that a huge gap is opening between folklore studies and history as an adjacent academic field. In this paper, by looking <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>works</b> of and exchange among Tatsuo Hagiwara (Medieval history), Yoshihiko Amino (Medieval history), and Yoshio Yasumaru (Modern history), all historians who were active in the 1970 s and 1980 s and who positively evaluated folklore studies in Japan, the author provides, {{in the form of}} a memoir, insights into the possibility of integrating folklore studies and history, before questioning the integration of folklore studies with sociology, cultural anthropology, and ecology as currently proposed by scholars of folklore studies...|$|R

To do so he must visit the only other surviving member of the friendship group, Kuro, who now lives in Finland with two daughters. While preparing for the visit, Tsukuru goes to buy presents for Kuro's children and sees Sara hand in hand with a middle-aged man, smiling in a way she never did with Tsukuru.|$|E
25|$|Remington Rand {{also made}} a {{significant}} number of false and misleading statements designed to mislead the media, demoralize strikers and reassure investors. Sixteen days into the strike, for example, company president James Rand announced an end to the strike at all six plants, a statement which roiled the union and led hundreds of workers to mistakenly accuse elected union leaders of selling out. In fact, no agreement had been reached. Two weeks later, Remington Rand announced that workers in Ohio had returned to work under a new collective bargaining agreement which offered highly favorable terms. The announcement demoralized workers in New York and Connecticut, and raised suspicions about the competence and reliability of union leaders. The truth was that only 21 of the 911 workers at the plant had accepted these terms, and they had not supported the strike. A few days later, Remington Rand officials falsely claimed that 5,300 of the company's workers had crossed picket lines and were <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|The remake {{version of}} the video is about a person who loses touch with himself. Originally full of life, the protagonist becomes a robot working a {{monotonous}} office job. One morning, he wakes up from a dream of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are {{in a circle around}} his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. <b>Back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, and at the moment that he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a white box that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E

5000|$|During {{his life}} and {{immediately}} after, Mangan's legacy was co-opted by Irish Nationalism, primarily thanks to John Mitchel's biography of Mangan, which stressed that Mangan was [...] "a rebel with his whole heart and soul against the whole British spirit". Naturally, this helped propel Mangan's legacy as Ireland's first national poet, and helped lead future Irish writers to look <b>back</b> <b>at</b> his <b>work.</b>|$|R

500|$|Graves {{was badly}} {{injured in the}} 1946 {{laboratory}} criticality accident at Los Alamos that killed Louis Slotin. Slotin, who was training Graves to replace him in his position as chief bomb assembler for Los Alamos, was demonstrating the dangerous [...] "tickling the dragon's tail" [...] test to Graves and several other scientists when the accident occurred. Graves, who was nearest to Slotin, suffered an estimated dose of 390 roentgens, and was given a 50 percent chance of survival. [...] This caused severe radiation poisoning, loss of hair and a zero semen count. After two weeks of [...] hospitalization and a several weeks of convalescence, {{he seemed to have}} recovered fully, and in a few months was <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and skiing vigorously, with only a bald spot on the head to show for the experience.

Commenting on the plot with Homer and Roz, Childs {{explained}} that [...] "there’s some comic possibility and resonance in having Homer stabbed in the <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Many people have been stabbed in the back by an ambitious colleague. Unfortunately, Homer {{may not be the best}} character to give this sort of storyline a heart. Homer is a bad employee who deserves to be ratted out by his subordinate. The fact that she is selfish and mean doesn’t add to this story. Yes, that is the sort of person who would stab someone in the back for their own gain, but yes, Homer also had it coming. Where is the joke?" ...|$|E
500|$|When the Nixon Administration {{took office}} in January 1969, the secret National Security Study Memorandum 1 {{collected}} views of top officials on the prospects for President Richard Nixon's policy of Vietnamization. There was a division of thought among those contributing, but McCain {{was one of those}} who were relatively optimistic, believing the North Vietnamese had entered peace talks due to military weakness, South Vietnamese pacification progress was real, and the tide of the war was favorably turning. [...] McCain suffered a mild stroke around this time, but was <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> a month later. [...] Following an inspection tour of South Vietnam in December 1969, McCain remained very optimistic about the course of the war and the ability of South Vietnamese forces to carry greater burdens. [...] McCain did not give much credence to the anti-Vietnam War movement; in reaction to the popular slogan [...] "Make love, not war," [...] he told a 1970 Naval Academy class that they were part of a fraternity [...] "whose members are men enough to do both." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 8 July 2009, 70,000 {{construction}} {{workers who were}} working on the new stadiums walked off their jobs. The majority of the workers receive R2500 per month (about £192, €224 or US$313), but the unions alleged that some workers were grossly underpaid. A spokesperson for the National Union of Mineworkers said to the SABC that the [...] "no work no pay" [...] strike would go on until FIFA assessed penalties on the organisers. Other unions threatened to strike into 2011. The strike was swiftly resolved and workers were <b>back</b> <b>at</b> <b>work</b> within a week of it starting.
