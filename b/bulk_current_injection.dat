40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we present}} a set of methodologies to model the {{electromagnetic}} susceptibility (EMS) testing of I/O buffers for mobile system memory based on the <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> (BCI) method. An efficient equivalent circuit model is developed for the current injection probe, line impedance stabilization network (LISN), printed circuit board (PCB), and package. The simulation results show good correlation with the measurements and thus, the work presented here will enable electromagnetic susceptibility analysis at the integrated circuit (IC) design stage.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} clock frequencies and decreasing rise times, the mandatory upper frequency limit for radiated emission and susceptibility testing on electronic modules are increasing up to 3 or even 6 GHz. The <b>Bulk</b> <b>Current</b> <b>Injection</b> test method has widely gained acceptance as alternative immunity test method. Unfortunately, test levels for this test method are only available up to 400 MHz. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a theoretical model based on antenna reciprocity {{that can be used}} to predict the worst-case current that is induced into a typical <b>Bulk</b> <b>Current</b> <b>Injection</b> set-up by an incoming plane wave. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} <b>current</b> <b>injections</b> into solar cells due to {{parallel}} connection within CPV modules are investigated. A <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> into a solar cell increases its temperature. If the <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> is above a certain threshold a thermal runaway is started. The <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> into a solar cell {{is limited by}} the short circuit current generated by a string of parallel connected cells. The value of the short circuit current is determined by the number of cells in parallel and by the concentration factor of sun light used in the CPV module. In this work the value of <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> is calculated above which a thermal runaway is triggered. For these calculations a model is introduced and tested with an experimental setup. The model shows a satisfying agreement with the measurement. The model is used to calculate the maximum number of solar cells for which the temperature increase due to <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> is limited to 20 K and a thermal runaway is prevented. This maximum number is presented in dependence of the concentration factor of sun light...|$|R

50|$|The <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> {{technique}} {{examined in}} Dr Eio's publications optimize the switching transient of power diodes, thyristors and insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) {{without the need}} of changing the structure of these devices. To implement the <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> technique, <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> circuit was developed with results indicating that the injection of an additional current during its switching transient can reduce the reverse recovery charge of a given power diode and thyristor, and also reduce the tail current of insulated gate bipolar transistors.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an improvement in}} power flow calculation based on <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> method by introducing optimization factor. In the method proposed by this paper, the PQ buses are represented by current mismatches while the PV buses are represented by power mismatches. It {{is different from the}} representations in conventional <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> power flow equations. By using the combined power and <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> mismatches method, the number of the equations required can be decreased to only one for each PV bus. The optimization factor is used to improve the iteration process and to ensure the effectiveness of the improved method proposed when the system is ill-conditioned. To verify the effectiveness of the method, the IEEE test systems are tested by conventional <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> method and the improved method proposed separately. Then the results are compared. The comparisons show that the optimization factor improves the convergence character effectively, especially that when the system is at high loading level and R/X ratio, the iteration number is one or two times less than the conventional <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> method. When the overloading condition of the system is serious, the iteration number in this paper appears 4 times less than the conventional <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> method...|$|R
40|$|The upper {{frequency}} limit to which extent legislative EMC tests {{have to be}} done is increasing for both emission and immunity test methods. It would thus be interesting to have limit levels for <b>Bulk</b> <b>Current</b> <b>Injection</b> up to higher frequencies than the current ones up to 400 MHz. This however requires knowledge of a realistic test current that needs to be injected and correlates to currents induced by radiation. This paper proposes a realistic limit for using the BCI method as an alternative to radiated immunity tests up to 1 GHz. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{diagnosing}} noise immunity of {{printed circuit boards}} (PCBs) by the <b>bulk</b> <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> (BCI) test was proposed, which {{can contribute to the}} PCB trace designs for common-mode noise. A grading index, which is defined as the ratio of the stray capacitances with and without critical IC of malfunction, was introduced to distinguish the PCB susceptible to the common-mode noise.

Current-based test stimuli allow detection of some faults which are difficult to detect or are untestable when conventional voltage-based test stimuli are used. In addition, the selection of test stimuli is simpler since faulty behaviours are observable in the whole frequency band with <b>current</b> <b>injection.</b> An example of a current-testable operational amplifier has been designed, and the small test circuitry required for <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> has a negligible impact on circuit performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of harmonic <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> from single-phase grid-connected converters is comprehensively investigated. The measurable impacts from grid voltage, converter commutation, power factor, PWM modulation and control strategy are demonstrated on the harmonic <b>current</b> <b>injection.</b> According to the mechanism, a tailor-made control solution which employs a low pass voltage-loop filter and internal model principle-based hybrid current controller, is proposed {{to eliminate the}} harmonic <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> from the single-phase grid-connected converters. Experiments are performed to verify {{the validity of the}} mechanism and the proposed control method. It not only presents an effective tailor-made solution to the elimination of harmonic <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> from grid-connected power converters, but also provides a mechanism-based benchmark tool to further develop rational grid requirements on the harmonic injection levels in the grid integration of distributed generation units...|$|R

Based on the proposed measurement method, far-field radiated emissions from microstrip components are obtained, which closely corresponds to measurements in a fully anechoic chamber. The proposed method also estimates the radiated emission reduction by miniaturizing the physical size of microstrip bandpass filters (BPFs). Full-wave electromagnetic simulation further demonstrates {{the effectiveness of the}} measurement method.

The equal response voltage on the cable or the antenna port of the equipment under test (EUT) is regarded as equivalent principle for radiation and injection test. The injection and radiation response analysis model and the injection voltage source extrapolation model in high intensity radiated field are established. The conditions of using differential-mode <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> as a substitute for radiation are confirmed. On the basis of the theoretical analysis, the function and structure design scheme of the directional coupling device is proposed. The implementation techniques for the single differential-mode <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> method (SDMCI) and the double differential-mode <b>current</b> <b>injection</b> method (DDMCI) are discussed in detail.
