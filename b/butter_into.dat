Stolypin's program of resettlement granted a lot of land for immigrants from elsewhere in the empire, creating a large portion of well-off peasants and stimulating rapid agricultural development in 1910s. Local merchants exported large quantities of labeled grain, flour and <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> central Russia and Western Europe.|$|E

Thus for [...] "Bath Buns", she instructs: [...] "Make a light dough with 1/2 lb. of flour, 1/4 lb. of butter or lard, 1 oz. of castor sugar, 2 eggs, 1/2 pint of lukewarm milk, and about 1.2 oz. of yeast. Rub <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> flour; blend ... Set it to rise in a warm place, ... bake lightly and thoroughly till golden brown." ...|$|E

In other cases only the relative proportions are indicated, as for the [...] "Salmis of Partridges with Aspic Jelly", where the only hint of quantity in the recipe is [...] "must be mixed with one-third of its quantity of aspic jelly". This recipe also indicates the style of cross-referencing, with the starting instruction [...] "Prepare the salmis as directed in No. 1078".|$|E

5000|$|... "Casa Bonita" [...] is the {{eleventh}} {{episode of the}} seventh season of the American animated television series South Park, and the 107th episode of the series overall. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 12, 2003. In the episode, Cartman misleads <b>Butters</b> <b>into</b> going missing {{in order to gain}} an invitation to Kyle's birthday party. The titular restaurant in the episode is based on the real-life Casa Bonita, a chain of Mexican-themed restaurants in Denver, Colorado.|$|R
500|$|The {{fertile soil}} and {{temperate}} {{climate of the}} valley proved ideal for hops. Not only did the plants thrive, farmers were able to obtain {{four or five times}} the usual yield. Meeker, never one to miss an opportunity, formed his own hop brokerage business. In 1870, he penned an 80-page pamphlet, Washington Territory West of the Cascades, to promote investment in the region. He took ship for San Francisco, then journeyed east by the new transcontinental railroad, hoping to get the railroads to expand to his region. He met with newspaper editor Horace Greeley (known for his famous advice, [...] "Go West, young man") and with railroad mogul Jay Cooke as part of his promotional blitz. [...] Cooke, who was building the Northern Pacific Railway to cross the northern tier of the country, not only bought up Meeker's pamphlets to give away to potential investors, but hired Meeker to drum up interest in his railroad. [...] While working from a Manhattan office, Meeker dressed like city dwellers, but did not entirely lose his frontier habits, often stirring a lump of <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> his coffee.|$|E
2500|$|Butter also {{provided}} extra income to farm families. They used wood presses with carved decoration to press <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> pucks or small bricks {{to sell at}} nearby markets or general stores. The decoration identified the farm that produced the butter. [...] This practice continued until production was mechanized and butter was produced in less decorative stick form. [...] Today, butter presses remain in use for decorative purposes.|$|E
2500|$|Melted butter {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the preparation of sauces, most obviously in French cuisine. Beurre noisette (hazelnut butter) and Beurre noir (black butter) are sauces of melted butter cooked until the milk solids and sugars have turned golden or dark brown; they are often finished with an addition of vinegar or lemon juice. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are emulsions of egg yolk and melted butter; they are in essence mayonnaises made with butter instead of oil. Hollandaise and béarnaise sauces are stabilized with the powerful emulsifiers in the egg yolks, but butter itself contains enough emulsifiers—mostly remnants of the fat globule membranes—to form a stable emulsion on its own. Beurre blanc (white butter) is made by whisking <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> reduced vinegar or wine, forming an emulsion with the texture of thick cream. Beurre monté (prepared butter) is melted but still emulsified butter; it lends its name to the practice of [...] "mounting" [...] a sauce with butter: whisking cold <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> any water-based sauce at the end of cooking, giving the sauce a thicker body and a glossy shine—as well as a buttery taste.|$|E

2500|$|Churning {{produces}} small butter grains {{floating in}} the water-based portion of the cream. This watery liquid is called buttermilk—although the buttermilk most common today is instead a directly fermented skimmed milk. The buttermilk is drained off; sometimes more buttermilk is removed by rinsing the grains with water. Then the grains are [...] "worked": pressed and kneaded together. When prepared manually, this is done using wooden boards called scotch hands. This consolidates the <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> a solid mass and breaks up embedded pockets of buttermilk or water into tiny droplets.|$|E
2500|$|Brooks was {{the first}} known American {{sculptor}} working in the medium of butter, and she would come {{to be identified as}} [...] "The Butter Woman". In 1867, she created her first butter sculpture, when, after the failure of the farm's cotton crop, she sought a source of supplemental income. Farm women of the time often created decoratively shaped butter using butter molds, but rather than molding, Brooks sculpted the <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> shapes such as shells, animals, and faces. Rather than traditional sculpting tools, she used [...] "common butter-paddles, cedar sticks, broom straws and camel's-hair pencils". Her customers appreciated the skillfully sculpted butter, and there was a good market for her works. She continued producing her butter sculptures for {{about a year and a}} half, then took a break from it for a few years.|$|E
2500|$|Smith was {{described}} by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and a smile of [...] "inexpressible benignity". He was known to talk to himself, a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions. He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and he {{is reported to have}} had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study. According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a tanning factory, and while discussing free trade, Smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape. He is also said to have put bread and <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up [...] outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.|$|E

60|$|We undressed him, {{and found}} his {{beautiful}} white body all discoloured with bruises. The mother began to sob again, with a chorus of babies. The girls tried to soothe the weeping, while I rubbed <b>butter</b> <b>into</b> the silent, wincing boy. Then his mother caught him in her arms, and kissed him passionately, and cried with abandon. The boy let himself be kissed—then he too began to sob, till his little body was all shaken. They folded themselves together, the poor dishevelled mother and the half-naked boy, and wept themselves still. Then she took him to bed, and the girls helped the other little ones into their nightgowns, and soon the house was still.|$|E

60|$|The milk {{was made}} partly <b>into</b> <b>butter,</b> partly <b>into</b> fresh cheese. These were sent off {{once a week}} to catch the steamer for Buenos Ayres.

It was sent in large baskets made of rushes, and packed in many layers of cool, fresh leaves; so that it arrived at Buenos Ayres, forty hours after leaving Mount Pleasant, perfectly fresh and good. The skim milk was given to the pigs, who had already increased to quite a numerous colony.|$|R

A piece of fish completed his bill of fare. He ate silently, looking neither to right nor left nor across at me. Here and there, at the various tables, other men were eating, just as silently. In the whole room there was hardly a note of conversation. A feeling of gloom pervaded the ill-lighted place. Many of them sat and brooded over the crumbs of their repast, and made me wonder, as Childe Roland wondered, what evil they had done {{that they should be}} punished so.|$|E
