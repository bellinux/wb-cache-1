50|$|Trichodesmium <b>blooms</b> release carbon, {{nitrogen}} {{and other nutrients}} into the environment. Some species of Trichodesmium {{have been shown to}} release toxins which cause mortalities in some copepods, fish, and oysters. <b>Blooms</b> have also been credited with releasing the toxin which causes clupeotoxism in humans after ingesting fish which have bioaccumulated the toxin during Trichodesmium <b>blooms.</b> The larger impact of these <b>blooms</b> is likely important to the oceanic ecosystem and is the source of many studies. <b>Blooms</b> are traced and tracked using satellite imaging where the highly reflective gas vacuole makes Trichodesmium <b>blooms</b> easily detectable.|$|R

Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the Jazz Age and do not translate to the modern era. <b>Bloom</b> believes the novel is in the canon of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.|$|E

40|$|The {{flowers of}} Waratahs, Telopea speciosissima (family Proteaceae) are {{regularly}} harvested illegally from natural bushland, particularly close to urban {{areas such as}} the New South Wales Central Coast. The removal of Waratah <b>blooms</b> from the wild may have implications for the long-term survival of local populations because of the interaction between wildfire events, subsequent flowering and limited seedling recruitment opportunities. To reduce the incidence of theft, blue acrylic paint was applied to <b>blooms</b> to reduce their commercial value. The painting of <b>blooms</b> in 2004 did not significantly reduce the incidence of wildflower theft when compared to unpainted <b>blooms,</b> but overall losses were lower (27 %) than in 2003 (33 %). However, painting of <b>blooms</b> had a deleterious affect on fruit production on plants with multiple heads with painted <b>blooms</b> having significantly reduced fruit set compared to unpainted <b>blooms.</b> Painting of <b>blooms</b> had no significant effect on seed quality (seed production per fruit, seed germination or seedling vigour) when compared to unpainted <b>blooms.</b> The painting of Waratah <b>blooms</b> to reduce theft was relatively ineffective and decreased fruit production. Alternative strategies should be considered to reduce wildflower theft in the area...|$|R

50|$|At greater latitudes, spring <b>blooms</b> {{take place}} {{later in the}} year. This northward {{progression}} is because spring occurs later, delaying thermal stratification and increases in illumination that promote <b>blooms.</b> A study by Wolf and Woods (1988) showed evidence that spring <b>blooms</b> follow the northward migration of the 12 °C isotherm, suggesting that <b>blooms</b> may be controlled by temperature limitations, in addition to stratification.|$|R

5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and felt she was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire <b>Bloom</b> was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast <b>Bloom</b> and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E
