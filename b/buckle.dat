30|$|The {{differences}} among the results from different researchers mainly arise from two aspects. Firstly, previous <b>buckling</b> solutions are only approximate results with simplified assumptions. The accurate <b>buckling</b> solutions under sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> and helical <b>buckling</b> stages have not been obtained with the <b>buckling</b> differential equation and energy method. Secondly, a comprehensive description of {{the transition from the}} sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> to helical <b>buckling</b> has not been proposed due to the significant difference between these two <b>buckling</b> modes. The critical point between the sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> and helical <b>buckling</b> stages is usually assumed in theoretical analyses, but no distinct dividing point is found in experiments. Therefore, sophisticated description of the <b>buckling</b> state transition and accurate <b>buckling</b> solutions under these two <b>buckling</b> modes still needs an in-depth research.|$|R

Both lateral <b>buckling</b> and local web <b>buckling</b> were witnessed in the tests. The two types of <b>buckling</b> were reproduced in the finite element simulations using ABAQUS. The <b>buckling</b> modes and usually overestimated <b>buckling</b> loads of a joist were obtained from linear eigenvalue <b>buckling</b> analysis. The <b>buckling</b> modes were then introduced into a joist as initial geometric imperfections to conduct nonlinear <b>buckling</b> analysis, and more reliable <b>buckling</b> loads were obtained. Based on statistics of the analytical results, the local web <b>buckling</b> capacity at a support was empirically expressed by the postbuckling load.

This is the first time in the drilling industry that a <b>buckling</b> model was successfully validated in the field, and this model can predict realistically the onset and severity of <b>buckling</b> for any 3 D trajectory. Many articles discuss <b>buckling</b> inside a wellbore but an increasing number of field observations suggest that existing <b>buckling</b> theories fail to predict <b>buckling</b> phenomenon such as lockup.

5|$|The family becomes {{increasingly}} frightened and distrustful of him, especially when his latest advice leads Hayley {{to be attacked}} by a shark. With the shark loose in the house, the family fights for survival. Stan loses hope and admits Francine's suggestions are better than his own, until Klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more. Stan obtains a bear from the zoo to battle the shark, which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family. Refusing to accept Francine's pleas to just get help, Stan instead throws a javelin that hits his wife in her shoulder instead of the bear. <b>Buckle</b> enters {{the house with a}} tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting Stan, who later tells <b>Buckle</b> that he made the right call.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the dynamic {{torsional}} <b>buckling</b> of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) embedded in an elastic medium is studied {{by using a}} continuum mechanics model. By introducing initial imperfections for MWNTs and applying the preferred mode analytical method, a <b>buckling</b> condition is derived for the <b>buckling</b> load and associated <b>buckling</b> mode. In particular, explicit expressions are obtained for embedded double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs). Numerical results show that, for both the DWNTs and embedded DWNTs, the <b>buckling</b> form shifts from the lower <b>buckling</b> mode to the higher <b>buckling</b> mode with increasing the <b>buckling</b> load, but the <b>buckling</b> mode is invariable for a certain domain of the <b>buckling</b> load.

30|$|Chen et al. (1990) first deduced the {{critical}} force to cause helical <b>buckling</b> {{with the energy}} method and stated that critical helical <b>buckling</b> load was \(\sqrt 2 \) times {{the critical}} sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> load. In Chen’s research, the axial force on the tubular string {{was assumed to be}} constant during the process from the starting of sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> to helical <b>buckling.</b> By assuming that the axial force increases linearly from the start of sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> to helical <b>buckling,</b> Wu (1992) refined Chen’s method and pointed out that Chen’s result was an average value of the critical sinusoidal and helical <b>buckling</b> loads. According to Wu, the critical helical <b>buckling</b> load is \(2 \sqrt 2 - 1 \) times the critical sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> load. Miska et al. (1996) assumed that the axial force increased linearly in the entire loading process and found that the critical helical <b>buckling</b> load was \(2 \sqrt 2 \) times the critical sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> load. Miska et al. (1996) also proved that the sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> configuration became unstable (\(\beta = 1.875 \)) before the tubular string changes to the helical <b>buckling</b> configuration. Therefore, the tubular string may be in a sinusoidal or helical <b>buckling</b> state when the axial force satisfies \(1.875 < \beta < 2 \sqrt 2 \). Cunha (1995) pointed out that there are two critical helical <b>buckling</b> loads, where the lower limit value is equal to Chen’s result and the upper limit is equal to Miska’s result. The upper limit means the minimum axial force causing helical <b>buckling</b> in the loading process, while the lower limit refers to the minimum axial force to keep the tubular string in the helical <b>buckling</b> stage for the unloading process. Mitchell (1997) obtained similar conclusions with the <b>buckling</b> differential equation. On the basis of previous studies, Gao et al. (2002) summarized the previous assumptions (Fig.  2) and considered that the axial force increases linearly in the sinusoidal <b>buckling</b> stage and then remains constant until the start of helical <b>buckling</b> based on experimental results.|$|R

5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor <b>Buckle</b> in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing <b>Buckle</b> and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>buckling</b> behaviors of short multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) under axial compression by using molecular mechanics (MM) simulations. The {{effects of the}} number of walls, length and chiral angle of MWCNTs on the <b>buckling</b> behaviors are examined. The results show that the <b>buckling</b> behaviors of short MWCNTs are rather different from single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and slender MWCNTs. Moreover, it is observed that the <b>buckling</b> strains of short MWCNTs vary inversely proportional to the number of nanotube walls. For slender MWCNTs, the <b>buckling</b> strains fluctuate as the number of walls increase. It increases for beam-like <b>buckling</b> mode, decreases for shell-like <b>buckling</b> mode and is approximately constant for the shell-beam-like <b>buckling</b> mode. The increase in the length of MWCNT has also led to a significant decrease of the <b>buckling</b> strain for short MWCNTs.

5|$|From {{the early}} 1840s to 1851 Staunton could {{successfully}} give odds {{to almost any}} UK-based player, including eventually John Cochrane; the exceptions were Henry Thomas <b>Buckle,</b> to whom Staunton gave pawn and move in 1843 and lost their match (six losses, no draws, one win), and Elijah Williams in 1851, against whom Staunton won more games but lost the match because he had given Williams a three-game start. According to match records collected by Jeremy P. Spinrad, the only players who were successful against Staunton without receiving odds from 1840 to 1852 were: Saint-Amant, who won their first match in London in 1843 and lost their second, longer match in Paris the same year; Adolf Anderssen, who eliminated Staunton from the 1851 London International tournament; and Elijah Williams, who beat Staunton in the play-off for third place in the same tournament. Before 1840 Staunton was still a relative beginner, and after 1851 his health was too fragile for serious competition. In the late 1840s some UK commentators wrote that <b>Buckle</b> was stronger, and von der Lasa was regarded by some as the world's best. Staunton did not play von der Lasa until 1853, and was forced by ill-health to abandon the match.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The out-of-plane {{secondary}} bifurcation <b>buckling</b> load-displacement equilibrium {{paths of}} the elastic circle pipe arch {{with and without}} out-of-plane brace {{at the top of}} the arch are traced using a new numerical tracing strategy. The out-of-plane secondary bifurcation <b>buckling</b> loads of the arch with the same sections and different rise-span ratios are obtained under the concentrated load {{at the top of the}} arch and the full span uniformly distributed load, which are compared with out-of-plane linear <b>buckling</b> load and in-plane primary <b>buckling</b> load. The calculation results show: for the same section circle pipe arches without the out-of-plane brace and under the concentrated load at the top the arch, the out-of-plane secondary <b>buckling</b> load is always less than the in-plane primary <b>buckling</b> load and the out-of-plane <b>buckling</b> will occur before the in-plane primary <b>buckling.</b> The out-of-plane secondary bifurcation <b>buckling</b> load of the arch with 0. 2 rise-span ratio is the biggest. The bigger the rise-span ratio is, the bigger the difference between out-of-plane and in-plane <b>buckling</b> load. When the arch is subjected to full span uniformly distributed load, the out-of-plane <b>buckling</b> will also occur before the in-plane primary <b>buckling</b> and the out-of-plane secondary bifurcation <b>buckling</b> load of the arch with 0. 4 rise-span ratio is the biggest.

Exactly what that <b>buckling</b> mode is as well as how much force is necessary to cause <b>buckling</b> depends on the material properties. Taking both a finite difference and analytical approach to the problem, it is desired to obtain relationships between the material properties and the predicted <b>buckling</b> modes.

40|$|The report {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} test strengths and the behaviour of cold-formed lipped channel columns compressed between fixed ends and pinned ends. It is well-known that local <b>buckling</b> of pin-ended channel columns induces overall bending of the section. However, this phenomenon does not occur in fixed-ended channel columns which remain straight after local <b>buckling</b> until overall <b>buckling</b> occurs. Consequently, local <b>buckling</b> has a fundamentally different effect on the behaviour of pin-ended and fixed-ended channel columns.
