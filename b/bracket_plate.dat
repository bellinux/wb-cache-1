Based on *MAT_PLASTIC_KINEMATIC of LS-DYNA program, this report studies effects of failure strain of the material parameters on structure of penetrating projectile. By establishing a group of numerical models about 45 steel hemispherical projectile penetrating semi-infinite concrete targets, this research aimed at analyzing effects of different failure strain values related to the destruction of the internal bracket structures of this projectile. At the same time, it studied the criterion of failure on finite dynamic program. The numerical results show that the use of failure strain in this model can well simulate damage of internal bracket structures of the projectile. Test was carried on based on this conclusion, which showed that <b>bracket</b> <b>plate</b> is subjected to shear failure in process of penetration, and numerical simulation was consistent with the experimental results...|$|E

2500|$|In Nevada, all motor vehicles, {{with the}} {{exception}} of motorcycles and trailers, are issued two license plates. According to state law, most standard passenger vehicles issued two plates are required to display them on both the front and rear bumpers of the vehicle. Display of the front license plate, however, is optional for vehicles that either were not designed to have a front plate, or the manufacturer did not provide a <b>plate</b> <b>bracket</b> or other means for front display of a license plate. As a result, the law to display both the front and rear plates is rarely enforced, and {{it is not uncommon for}} owners of vehicles with Nevada license plates to remove the manufacturer-supplied front license <b>plate</b> <b>brackets</b> from their vehicles and display only the rear plate. In 2015, Wyoming passed a law, similar to Nevada, that does not require a front license plate on vehicles that either are not specifically designed to have a front plate, or the manufacturer did not provide a <b>plate</b> <b>bracket</b> or other means for front display of a license plate. Nebraska passed an identical law in 2016. In 2017, Montana also passed a similar law, exempting such passenger vehicles from displaying a front plate but requiring motorists to first obtain approval from the Montana Highway Patrol.|$|R
50|$|Wyoming {{state law}} usually {{requires}} {{front and rear}} license plates. However, on July 1, 2015, a new law took effect that allowed custom and antique vehicles to display only rear plates, as well as vehicles that were originally manufactured without a <b>plate</b> <b>bracket</b> on the front.|$|R

50|$|Electric griddles are {{typically}} {{made of a}} thinner plate material than a similar gas griddle to improve the heat transfer between the bottom-mounted elements and the cooking surface. Elements used to heat the griddle {{are typically}} 4-5 kilowatt (kW) per linear foot, and made from round rod sheathed incoloy material whose geometry is designed to optimize temperature distribution across the plate. The round elements have a tangential point of contact with the griddle plate and are commonly {{held in place by}} a clamping <b>bracket</b> or <b>plate.</b> More than one element per linear foot is common, and an array of these elements is required to heat a griddle plate of any given width. Electric griddles tend to be less expensive than a gas unit of similar size, due largely to the reduced plate thickness, but also the generally lower cost of construction and reduced sophistication of most electric griddle control systems.|$|R

The wings had a reverse taper towards the root, which gave the impression of a bent gull wing from some angles, although the spars were straight. It had a girder type construction faired with a light wood stringers to give the aerodynamic shape. The forward fuselage was duralumin tube joined with <b>brackets</b> and <b>plates,</b> and the after part was welded stainless steel tubes. <b>Plates</b> and <b>brackets</b> were cut from channel extrusions rather than forming from sheet steel.

40|$|AbstractCordierite based {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in high temperature applications due to their good thermo-mechanical properties and thermal shock resistance. They are generally employed in the kiln furniture (shelves, <b>brackets,</b> bearing <b>plates)</b> for firing ceramic pieces. Because of its low expansion coefficient and dielectric properties, cordierite is also used in advanced ceramics, catalyst supports automotive, industrial waste gas purification and parts subjected to sudden temperature changes. The low intrinsic strength of the cordierite may be compensated {{by the presence of}} mullite, forming a composite material of cordierite-mullite, extending its use to somewhat higher temperatures, at the expense of a slight increase in the thermal expansion coefficient. In this work a cordierite-mullite precursor was prepared from a mixture of magnesium oxide, calcined alumina, silica fume and monoaluminum phosphate solution that produces fast setting at room temperature (∼ 20 minutes) and then, by calcination, cordierite-mullite is generated. The evolution of the mineralogical phases was studied from room temperature to 1350 °C by X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetry. A possible sequence of chemicals reactions throughout the heat treatment is also proposed. Adding refractory aggregates to this precursor leads to obtaining a fast-setting concrete, suitable for the formation of individual pieces or repair service at moderately high temperatures. A summary of its main properties is also included...|$|R

50|$|The engines's bore {{and stroke}} both measure 86.0 mm, which {{engineers}} refer to as square. According to Mitsubishi, the new cylinder dimensions contribute to a free-revving character (max power at 6,500 rpm), linear power delivery and wide torque curve. Mitsubishi used a timing chain instead of a belt for better reliability and iridium spark plugs to lower emissions and to help extend major service intervals for lower cost of ownership. To reduce weight, Mitsubishi used a plastic cam cover and intake manifold and double-layer stainless steel exhaust manifold. The exhaust manifold has a rear location on the transverse engine, compared to the front location for the previous engine, yielding important benefits such as better emissions performance. To lower vibration, Mitsubishi used a 4-point inertial axis system with cylindrical hydraulic engine mounts {{on the left and}} right sides. A lightweight, high-rigidity squeeze-cast aluminium bracket on the right side mount (engine side) lowers engine noise under acceleration. A lightweight, high-rigidity steel <b>plate</b> <b>bracket</b> on the left side mount (transmission side) lowers gear noise. A custom-tuned insulator was developed for the front and rear mounts to help control both idle vibration and acceleration shock.|$|R
40|$|Two {{types of}} {{connection}} are generally {{considered in the}} design of steel structures in practice. These are classified as completely rigid (fixed) and simple (pin) connections. In theory, completely rigid connections cannot undergo rotation and simple connections cannot transfer moment. Nevertheless, in reality, rigid connections have a relative flexibility which makes them to rotate and simple connections have some reserve capacity to transfer moments. However, in an effort {{to increase the amount of}} data on the rotational stiffness of top and seat angle available to researchers, this thesis presents the modeled and non linear analysis of different theoretical top and seat angle connections. The finite element modeling software, ABAQUS, is used to create moment-rotation curves for these theoretical connections such as top and seat angle connection with bracket and top and seat angle connection with gusset plate. To demonstrate finite element modeling’s ability to accurately predict the response of the theoretical connections, the results of several experiments performed on top and seat connections are reproduced in ABAQUS. The result of this study shows that initial stiffness of top and seat angle connection increased when attached <b>bracket</b> or gusset <b>plate</b> in connection zone. It is also found that this type of connection can be classified as rigid connection...|$|R
50|$|The Proton Saga Iswara (known as the Proton Mpi in the United Kingdom) was {{launched}} on 15 August 1992. It {{is named after}} the great Helen butterfly (Papilio iswara) of Sarawak. The new Saga Iswara {{is based on the}} outgoing Saga Megavalve platform. The exterior design was updated and restyled by a British firm. The Iswara features a new grille, slimmer headlights, grooved taillight clusters, plastic bumpers and side mouldings. Additionally, the rear license <b>plate</b> <b>bracket</b> was moved to the bumper instead of the boot. Like its predecessor, the Saga Iswara was produced in both 4-door saloon / sedan and 5-door hatchback guises, powered by the same 1.3-litre and 1.5-litre engines. However, models exported to Singapore and the United Kingdom were fitted with Mitsubishi's ECI Multi fuel injection system and a catalytic converter to meet Euro I emission standards. A five-speed manual and a three-speed automatic transmission were offered, both sourced from Mitsubishi. The saloon version of the Saga Iswara was widely used as taxis in Malaysia in the 1990s and 2000s. Most were converted to NGVs for greater fuel efficiency. Many Saga Iswara taxis are still in use today, but they are being phased out in favour of newer Proton taxis.|$|R
25|$|The {{front and}} rear clips were also {{redesigned}} on the Taurus and Sable sedans; all body panels were brand-new except the doors. Station wagons received the new front clips but from the firewall back they were {{essentially the same as}} the 1996-1999 wagons. The Taurus now had the turn signals integrated into the headlamps, {{similar to that of the}} previous generation Sable. The front bumper was also redesigned to include a larger front grille which, like the previous generation, contained a chrome bar running through the middle containing the Ford logo. The rear clip was redesigned with a larger trunk and trunklid, as mentioned above, as well as giving the Taurus two large taillights as opposed to the rear lightbar used in the previous generation cars. Mounted on the trunklid was a large chrome bar containing the Ford logo, like in the front. In 2003 for the 2004 model year, the front clip was slightly redesigned, and the Taurus got a new front bumper and grille. The grille was made smaller, with the chrome bar removed, replaced by just a large Ford logo in the center. The taillights were slightly redesigned, originally to include amber turn signals, but this was cancelled at the eleventh hour. Instead the rear was given larger reverse lights, and the chrome bar above the license <b>plate</b> <b>bracket</b> was deleted.|$|R
50|$|The Proton Saga LMST {{hatchback}} {{was introduced}} in 2003 as the successor to the Proton Saga Iswara. Despite sharing the same, ageing platform with the original Proton Saga from 1985, the new Saga LMST featured a completely redesigned interior, with a new dashboard, instrument panel and meter cluster which offered a digital display consisting of an odometer, a fuel gauge and a temperature gauge. The steering wheel, gear stick and two-tone, red-on-black interior panels were also new. On the exterior, the car received a new front grille, head lights with integrated fog lights, tail lights, front & rear bumpers, side skirts and a rear spoiler. The rear number <b>plate</b> <b>bracket</b> was also repositioned to the boot, and the rear bumper on later variants featured parking sensors, a first in the Saga lineage. The car came with the same 1.3L 4G13 engine, offering 83 bhp (62 kW) at 6,000rpm and 109Nm of torque at 4,000rpm. The 3-speed automatic was discontinued, and only the 5-speed manual transmission was offered. The new Saga LMST was sold in two trim lines, one with power steering and one without, {{as well as an}} option for the 14-inch alloy rims from the Iswara S.E. The brakes were discs at the front and drums at the rear. The LMST was not equipped with airbags or ABS, and was sold in four colours; red, dark blue, grey and black.|$|R
