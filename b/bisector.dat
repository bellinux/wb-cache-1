5|$|Scientists {{investigated}} {{the possibility that}} the transit signal detected by Kepler was actually due to a third star in the system that eclipsed its sister stars. However a <b>bisector</b> analysis of the spectra of KOI-98's star ruled out that hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Viète {{began by}} solving the PPP case (three points) {{following}} {{the method of}} Euclid in his Elements. From this, he derived a lemma corresponding {{to the power of}} a point theorem, which he used to solve the LPP case (a line and two points). Following Euclid a second time, Viète solved the LLL case (three lines) using the angle bisectors. He then derived a lemma for constructing the line perpendicular to an angle <b>bisector</b> that passes through a point, which he used to solve the LLP problem (two lines and a point). This accounts for the first four cases of Apollonius' problem, those that do not involve circles.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} special cases are {{much easier to}} solve than the general case of three given circles. The two {{simplest}} cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points (PPP) or tangent to three lines (LLL), which were solved first by Euclid in his Elements. For example, the PPP problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must lie on the perpendicular <b>bisector</b> line of any two. Hence, the center {{is the point of}} intersection of any two perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the LLL case, the center must lie on a line bisecting the angle at the three intersection points between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the intersection point of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every intersection point of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general LLL problem.|$|E

25|$|This is {{simpler than}} Euclid's proof, but Euclid does not present the {{construction}} of an angle <b>bisector</b> until proposition 9. So the order of presentation of the Euclid's propositions would have to be changed to avoid the possibility of circular reasoning.|$|E

25|$|The proof {{proceeds}} as follows: As before, let {{the triangle}} be ABC with AB=AC. Construct the angle <b>bisector</b> of angle BAC and extend it to meet BC at X. AB=AC and AX {{is equal to}} itself. Furthermore angle BAX = angle CAX, so, applying side-angle-side, BAX and CAX are congruent. It follows that the angles at B and C are equal.|$|E

25|$|A {{perpendicular}} <b>bisector</b> of {{a side of}} {{a triangle}} is a straight line passing through {{the midpoint of the}} side and being perpendicular to it, i.e. forming a right angle with it.

The diameter of this circle, called the circumdiameter, can be found from the law of sines stated above. The circumcircle's radius is called the circumradius.|$|E

25|$|An angle <b>bisector</b> of a {{triangle}} is {{a straight line}} through a vertex which cuts the corresponding angle in half. The three angle bisectors intersect in a single point, the incenter, usually denoted by I, {{the center of the}} triangle's incircle. The incircle is the circle which lies inside the triangle and touches all three sides. Its radius is called the inradius. There are three other important circles, the excircles; they lie outside the triangle and touch one side as well as the extensions of the other two. The centers of the in- and excircles form an orthocentric system.|$|E
25|$|The four-site {{models have}} four {{interaction}} points by adding one dummy atom near of the oxygen along the <b>bisector</b> of the HOH {{angle of the}} three-site models (labeled M in the figure). The dummy atom only has a negative charge. This model improves the electrostatic distribution around the water molecule. The first model to use this approach was the Bernal–Fowler model published in 1933, which {{may also be the}} earliest water model. However, the BF model doesn't reproduce well the bulk properties of water, such as density and heat of vaporization, and is thus of historical interest only. This is a consequence of the parameterization method; newer models, developed after modern computers became available, were parameterized by running Metropolis Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations and adjusting the parameters until the bulk properties are reproduced well enough.|$|E
