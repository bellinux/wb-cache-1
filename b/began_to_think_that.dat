25|$|Portillo's {{loss of the}} Enfield Southgate seat, in the 1997 general {{election}} to Labour's Stephen Twigg, {{came as a shock}} to many politicians and commentators, and came to symbolise the extent of the Labour landslide victory. Halfway through the campaign, Portillo invited aides Andrew Cooper and Michael Simmonds to his house and presented them with some ideas for a leadership campaign following the expected Conservative defeat and asked them to finish it off. However, when a poll in The Observer on the weekend before the election showed that Portillo held only a three-point lead in his hitherto-safe seat, Portillo asked Cooper, who oversaw the party's internal polling, to reassure him that it was wrong; Cooper was unable to and Portillo <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> he might lose.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1968, WMATA polling {{suggested}} that citizens of Maryland and Virginia strongly supported Metro. After all, these people desperately needed a quick, efficient way of getting to their jobs in the District of Columbia. Eager {{to find some way}} to break ground and begin the construction of the subway system, WMATA asked voters in the two states to approve construction bonds for the subway. They overwhelming did so in November 1968, with 72 percent of voters in favor. Natcher also agreed in the fall of 1968 to release funds for architectural plans, engineering design, and land acquisition (but not construction) of Metro, and Metro broke ground in December 1969. But as Natcher continued to withhold construction funds through 1971, citizens of Maryland and Virginia <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the money they had invested in Metro would be wasted. Soon, political pressure was building on members of Congress from these two states to stop Natcher and move ahead with Metro.|$|E

25|$|The first {{plans for}} a canal between Hereford and Gloucester were made by Robert Whitworth, one of James Brindley's pupils, in 1777. The route {{was part of a}} grander plan to link Stourport on Severn and Leominster as well. Twelve years later, Richard Hall {{submitted}} {{plans for a}} canal via Ledbury. In March 1790, the promoters decided to submit the plans to Parliament. Josiah Clowes, an engineer who had previous experience of working on the Chester Canal and who had worked with Whitworth on the Thames and Severn Canal, was to be the engineer. It appears that he re-surveyed the route, and recommended a change, so that it passed through Ledbury. A branch would be built to Newent where there were minor coalfields, and the canal would be suitable for boats , capable of carrying 35 tons. The estimated cost was £70,000, and it was expected to carry 33,203 tons per year, generating £9,582 in revenue. Some of the promoters <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> improving the River Wye might be a better option, but the announcement of new seams of coal at Newent resulted in a decision to obtain an Act of Parliament, which was granted in April 1791.|$|E

500|$|Another popular {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's vision of goddess Annapurna of Varanasi. Ramprasad {{was on his way}} to the river for his daily ritual bath when a {{beautiful}} young woman stopped him, asking if she could hear him sing a devotional song to the Divine Mother. Ramprasad requested her to wait, since it was getting late for his noon worship. When he returned, he couldn't find her, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it may have been the [...] "play of Divine Mother." [...] Sitting down to meditate, he was surrounded by a radiant light and heard a female voice saying, [...] "I am Annapurna (…) I came all the way from Varanasi to hear your songs but, alas, I had to leave disappointed." [...] Ramprasad was angry with himself and immediately left for Varanasi to find Mother Annapurna and sing for her. After walking many miles, he reached Triveni, where he took rest under a tree on the bank of the Ganges. Here he reportedly received another vision, saw the same mystical light, and heard the Mother's voice saying, [...] "Stay here and sing for me.

500|$|The 1850s and 1860s also {{mark the}} line between what some {{scholars}} see as the idealistic, Hegelian young Marx from the more scientifically minded mature Marx writings of the later period. This distinction is usually associated with the structural Marxism school and not all scholars agree that it exists. The years of revolution from 1848 to 1849 had been a grand experience for both Marx and Engels. They both became sure that their economic view of {{the course of history}} was the only valid way that historic events like the revolutionary upsurge of 1848 could be adequately explained. For some time after 1848, Marx and Engels wondered if the entire revolutionary upsurge had completely played out. As time passed, they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a new revolutionary upsurge would not occur until there was another economic downturn. The question of whether a recession would be necessary to create a new revolutionary situation in society became a point of contention between Marx and certain other revolutionaries. Marx accused these other revolutionaries of being [...] "adventurists" [...] because of their belief that a revolutionary situation could be created out of thin air by the sheer [...] "will power" [...] of the revolutionaries without regard to the economic realities of the current situation.|$|E

2500|$|Slaveholders <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{slavery was}} {{grounded}} in the Bible. This view was inspired {{in part by a}} reinterpretation of the Genesis passage [...] "Cursed be Canaan; The lowest of slaves Shall he be to his brothers" [...] (Genesis 9); Ham, son of Noah and father of Canaan, was deemed the antediluvian progenitor of the African people. Some whites used the Bible to justify the economic use of slave labor. Subjugation of slaves was taken as a natural right of the white slave owners. The second class position of the slave was not limited to his relationship with the slave master, but was to be in relation to all whites. Slaves were considered subject to white persons.|$|E

2500|$|Growing up {{the son of}} {{a wealthy}} {{merchant}} who was well connected with the major artists of the time, Hofmannsthal was raised in what Carl Schorske refers to as [...] "the temple of art". This perfect setting for aesthetic isolation allowed Hofmannsthal the unique perspective of the privileged artist, but also allowed him to see that art had become a flattened documenting of humanity, which took our instincts and desires and framed them for viewing without acquiring any of the living, passionate elements. Because of this realization, Hofmannsthal’s idea {{of the role of the}} artist began to take shape as someone who created works that would inspire or inflame the instinct, rather than merely preserving it in a creative form. He also <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the artist should not be someone isolated and left to his art, but rather a man of the world, immersed in both politics and art.|$|E

[...] Regarding the sale of the first volume of Worthies of Ireland he writes: [...] "I sent a quantity of copies to Ireland where I expected it would have the greatest sale – but there it met with little or none. In this country it sold much better – but the sale in both countries was such as to make me determined never to complete the work. This determination however I was induced to change two years approximately afterwards by my printer consenting to take the expenses on himself provided I would finish the work in one more volume. This I agreed to do...". Five editions of both volumes were published in 1821 and 1822 and are held by 37 libraries worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Returning {{home from}} Manhattan {{a much bigger}} and {{stronger}} man, Johnson quickly {{got a chance to}} test his new fighting skills in a quarrel against a man named Davie Pearson.

[...] When both of them were released from jail, they met at the docks, and were set to fight {{in the midst of a}} large crowd.

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, Gilmour <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> his musical talents were being underused by Pink Floyd, so in 1978 he {{channelled}} his ideas into the eponymous solo album, David Gilmour, which showcased his guitar playing and songwriting skills. Music written during the finishing {{stages of the}} album, but too late to be used, was incorporated into a song by Waters, which became [...] "Comfortably Numb", which was included on The Wall. The negative atmosphere surrounding the creation of The Wall album and subsequent film, compounded by The Final Cuts virtually being a Roger Waters solo album, led Gilmour to produce his second solo album, About Face, in 1984. He used it to express his feelings about a range of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He has since admitted that he also used the album {{to distance himself from}} Pink Floyd. He toured Europe and the US along with support act the Television Personalities, who were promptly dropped from the line-up after Dan Treacy unwisely revealed Syd Barrett's address on stage. Mason also made a guest appearance on the UK leg of the tour, which despite some cancellations eventually turned a profit. When he returned from touring, Gilmour played guitar with a range of artists, and also produced the Dream Academy, who had a US top ten hit with [...] "Life in a Northern Town" [...] in 1986.|$|E

[...] Half in fright and with a puzzled hand-shake, the boy made his way toward what seemed to be the white man's town. [...] He passed by a large pile of bones, and wondered what it meant. It was not many days until he was informed, for soon he found himself in full charge of the business of buying and shipping buffalo bones including the very pile which had so aroused his curiosity on arrival in the far west; for this was Indian and buffalo country then, but it proved to be the end for both shortly thereafter. It was the last year for the buffalo; and it was the last year of the happy, healthy, life for the Indians. Indians had killed his great-grandfather and carried on a war of extermination against his forebears in Pennsylvania in the old days. That kindly greeting by the old Sioux Chief quickly dispelled much of the prejudice that had filled his heart through childhood, and soon the youth <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Indians were not such terrible folks as Eastern people believed they were.” ...|$|E
