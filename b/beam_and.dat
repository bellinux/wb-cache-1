40|$|Abstract: The {{feature of}} the {{concrete}} grid-frame structure with specially shaped columns is the frame <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> specially shaped columns in the walls were divided by rib <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> rib columns, then the rib beams, the rib columns, the frame <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> the specially shaped columns together constitute the grid-frame structures with specially shaped columns. The rib <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> the rib columns can share parts of the vertical and horizontal loads which the structure should bear and work together with the frame <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> the specially shaped columns, so make the lateral stiffness of the structure is increased and the ultimate strength, ductility and seismic performance of the structure are improved. Moreover, Phosphorus gypsum will be poured to enclose concrete <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> columns and become the filler wall among them. At the same time, phosphorus gypsum wallboards are used as the middle filler walls to separated rooms flexibly. By doing so, the building is more energy saving. In addition, the phosphorus gypsum which {{is a type of}} industrial waste can be consumed and become useful material in construction...|$|R
5|$|A common path {{interferometer}} is a {{class of}} interferometer in which the reference <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> sample beam travel along the same path. Fig.4 illustrates the Sagnac interferometer, the fibre optic gyroscope, the point diffraction interferometer, and the lateral shearing interferometer. Other examples of common path interferometer include the Zernike phase contrast microscope, Fresnel's biprism, the zero-area Sagnac, and the scatterplate interferometer.|$|E

While there, she became involved with, then married, one of the anarchists she met: Cornelius (Iwan) Dirk de Bruin.

5|$|For a given tonnage, {{the second}} factor which governs the ship's {{dimensions}} {{is the size of}} the ports and waterways it will travel to. For example, a vessel that will pass the Panama Canal will be limited in its <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> draft. For most designs, the ratio of length-to-width ranges between 5 and 7, with an average of 6.2. The ratio of length-to-height will be between 11 and 12.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} {{system is}} composed of core walls, hat beams incorporated into the top level, outer columns and viscous dampers vertically installed between {{the tips of the}} hat <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> the outer columns.During an earthquake,the hat <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> outer columns act as outriggers and reduce the overturning moment in the core, and the installed dampers also reduce the moment and the lateral deflection of the structure. This innovative system can eliminate inner <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> inner columns on each floor, and thereby provide buildings with column-free floor space even in highly seismic regions.|$|R

5|$|Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids {{travel to}} Mos Eisley {{to find a}} pilot {{to take them to}} Alderaan. At a local cantina they hire {{smuggler}} Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the Falcon, taking the couch with them.|$|E

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or <b>beam,</b> <b>and</b> 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

Crews from NJG 2 and NJG 4 were able to deliver <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> Schräge Musik attacks against the unwary crews.

5|$|As {{members of}} the Uand U1classes, rebuilds were used mainly on mixed-traffic as well as {{secondary}} passenger duties on lines between the main routes. They were used all over the Southern Railway network, but were little-used over the steep track gradients west of Exeter. The smaller-wheeled Nclass was preferred amongst crews for the same duties, as high-speed running was rare away from the main lines in the West Country. Heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid's Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within weight restrictions in this area. The 21 rebuilt locomotives entered British Railways service in 1948. From 1955 a few were given replacement frames at overhaul: these had a shallower curve between the front buffer <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> the smokebox.|$|E

30|$|Description of the {{structure}} model: the steel structure model has a mild steel plate of thickness 10  mm so that it acts as a rigid slab of a structure. The load of the slab is transferred first into the beams then into the columns. There are four number of <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> columns of size 10  mm ×  10  mm ×  500  mm, i.e. there are four nos. of beams used in this structure to carry the imposed load from the steel plate which is then transferred to the base by means of another four columns and the cross-sectional area of these <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> columns are 10  mm ×  10  mm, i.e. width 10  mm and thickness 10  mm while the length of both the <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> columns are equals to 500  mm. The bars used for <b>beams</b> <b>and</b> columns are solid square bars.|$|R

5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted <b>beam</b> <b>and</b> a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E
