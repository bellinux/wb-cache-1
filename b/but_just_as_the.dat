25|$|<b>But</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> war seemed {{decided in}} the allies' favour, things started to go wrong. The Greek {{commander}} Michael Palaeologus alienated some of his allies by his arrogance, and this stalled the campaign as rebel Count Robert of Loritello refused to speak to him. Although the two were reconciled, the campaign {{lost some of its}} momentum. Worse was to come: Michael was soon recalled to Constantinople. Although his arrogance had slowed the campaign, he was a brilliant general in the field, and his loss was a major blow to the allied campaign. The turning point was the battle for Brindisi, where the Sicilians launched a major counterattack by both land and sea. At the approach of the enemy, the mercenaries who were serving in the allied armies demanded impossible increases in their pay; when these were refused, they deserted. Even the local barons started to melt away, and soon Adrian's Byzantine allies were left hopelessly outnumbered. The naval battle was {{decided in the}} Sicilians' favour, and the Byzantine commander was captured. The defeat at Brindisi {{put an end to the}} restored Byzantine reign in Italy, and by 1158 the Byzantine Army had left Italy.|$|E

[...] <b>But</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> team was approaching its 2017 preseason, the 29-year-old forward fully {{realized that he was}} not going to be able to make it back to his former level of play: Zakuani officially announced his retirement one final time, with a lengthy and heart-felt Instagram post to his fans (included in full in the MLS post cited below).|$|E
500|$|The film {{opens with}} conquistador Tomás Verde in New Spain {{fighting}} {{a horde of}} Mayans to gain entry into a pyramid, where he is attacked by a Mayan priest with a flaming sword. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that the conquistador has been commissioned by Queen Isabella of Spain {{to travel to the}} New World in search of the fountain of youth or Biblical Tree of Life and immortality. If Tomás can find it, she is convinced that she can {{put an end to the}} struggle between herself and an influential cleric during the Spanish Inquisition who is attempting to stop her search and usurp the throne. Isabella vows to spend eternity with Tomás upon his return, citing a correlation with Adam and Eve. When Tomás arrives at his destination, he finds that his fellow knights are exhausted and refuse to continue searching for the Tree of Life. A Franciscan monk discovers the location of the temple, but is killed while Tomás represses the mutiny amongst his officers. As the priest dies, he gives Tomás a ceremonial dagger and directs him towards the pyramid. Once he arrives at the pyramid, Tomás and his men are ambushed and Tomás is captured. He is forcefully directed to the top of the pyramid, and engages in [...] combat with a Mayan priest wielding a flaming sword. Tomás is stabbed in the stomach, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> priest is about to kill him, future Tommy appears before the figurehead. The priest believes Tomás is the [...] "First Father", apologizes and asks Tomás to usher him down the path of awe by slitting his throat. Tomás sacrificially kills the priest and proceeds to a pool with a large tree; convinced this is the Tree of Life. Tomás applies some of its sap to his torso and is cured of his stab wound. He drinks the sap flowing from the bark. But in a reenactment of the Mayan creation myth told earlier in the film, flowers and grass burst forth from his body and he literally gives rise to new life.|$|E

2500|$|Saunders and French {{followed}} separate {{careers as}} well as maintaining their comedy sketch show. Saunders' biggest solo success has been Absolutely Fabulous. The comedy was, in fact, based largely on a fourteen-minute French & Saunders sketch called [...] "Modern Mother and Daughter". Saunders and French were going to star in the comedy together, <b>but</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> studio had been booked, French received a long-awaited phone call confirming that an adoption agency had a new baby for her to adopt. Saunders proceeded to star in the comedy. The series, which she wrote and starred in as the irresponsible fashion PR agent Edina Monsoon alongside Joanna Lumley, who played Patsy Stone, brought her international acclaim and attention. The show ran for five full series, two telemovies, three special episodes, and a feature film {{over the course of}} twenty-four years from 1992 to 2016. The series is also known as Ab Fab and was broadcast in the United States on Comedy Central and BBC America, becoming cult viewing.|$|E
