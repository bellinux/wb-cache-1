In {{a manner similar to}} the in vitro release profiles described in Fig.  1, the differences in {{the fraction}} absorbed for the four formulations are easily discernible and a rank order is assigned. Of the four formulations, Formulations A–C show a much larger initial burst than Formulation D. The initial <b>burst</b> <b>value</b> at day 1 for Formulation D was around 7  %, nearly two to three times lower than the 13 – 20  % drug absorption seen with Formulations A–C. Between the copolymers, the 50 : 50 PLGA formulations (Formulations A and B) demonstrate a rapid absorption profile, while Formulations C and D indicate a more sustained absorption curve. In fact, the absorption profiles including initial burst release for Formulations A and B are nearly identical, similar to the in vitro release profiles (Fig.  1) and serum data from rats (Fig.  2) with complete release achieved within 15  days. On the other hand, between the 75 : 25 polymers, Formulation D exhibits slightly slower absorption profile through day 8, after which the rate of absorption increases and is nearly the same as Formulation C.|$|E
40|$|The {{internal}} pressure strength of tubing and casing often cannot satisfy the design requirements in high pressure, high temperature and high H 2 S gas wells. Also, the practical safety coefficient of some wells {{is lower than}} the design standard according to the current API 5 C 3 standard, which brings some perplexity to the design. The ISO 10400 : 2007 provides the model which can calculate the burst strength of tubing and casing better than API 5 C 3 standard, but the calculation accuracy is not desirable because about 50 percent predictive values are remarkably higher than real <b>burst</b> <b>values.</b> So, for the sake of improving strength design of tubing and casing, this paper deduces the plastic limit pressure of tubing and casing under {{internal pressure}} by applying the twin shear unified strength theory. According to the research of the influence rule of yield-to-tensile strength ratio and mechanical properties on the burst strength of tubing and casing, the more precise calculation model of tubing-casing’s burst strength has been established with material hardening and intermediate principal stress. Numerical and experimental comparisons show that the new burst strength model is much closer to the real <b>burst</b> <b>values</b> than that of other models.

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} that perception {{plays a role}} in computing grammatical well-formedness. This is shown specifically for grammatical constraints on word-final consonant cluster inventories (VC 1 C 2 #), with focus on coda cluster simplification in Trinidad English. The first claim of this thesis is that C 2 deletion is triggered when VC 1 C 2 # is not sufficiently distinguished perceptually from VC 1 #, by at least one relevant perceptual dimension. The relevant properties that sufficiently distinguish VC 1 C 2 # from VC 1 # are the release <b>burst</b> spectrum, <b>values</b> of F 2 transitions to Cl or C 2, transitions from Cl into C 1, nucleus (Vowel + Sonorant) duration, and high amplitude frication noise. This hypothesis was tested with a perception experiment that measured Standard English speakers' ability to discriminate between attested VC 1 C 2 #'s of Standard English and VCI#, with unreleased C 2. The result is that those C 2 's that are significantly less likely to be perceived in the absence of release are the same C 2 's that are deleted in Trinidad English (p <. 01). The relevant perceptual dimensions are the ones proposed here: release <b>burst,</b> <b>values</b> of F 2 transitions to Cl or C 2, transitions from Cl into C 2, nucleus duration, and high amplitude frication noise. The second claim of this thesis is that speakers encode this perceptually based difference between simplified and preserved clusters in their grammars. Namely, speakers neutralize VC 1 C 2 # and VC 1 # to VC 1 # where there is subminimal perceptual contrast between VC 1 C 2 # and VC 1 #. In order to test this second hypothesis, the perceptual discriminability of VC 1 C 2 # and VC 1 #, for unattested clusters of English, was established in a perception experiment. (cont.) Some unattested VC 1 C 2 's were significantly more perceptually distinct from VC 1 than others (p <. 01). This was predictable based on the relevant properties: release <b>burst</b> spectrum, <b>values</b> of F 2 transitions to Cl or C 2, transitions from Cl into C 2, nucleus duration, and high amplitude frication noise. In an affix stripping experiment, it was then discovered that TE speakers do not simplify unattested clusters (like mg# or mk#) across the board, but rather they simplify all clusters {{as a function of the}} perceptual difficulty involved in discriminating VC 1 C 2 # from VCI#. by Franz Katzir Cozier.

The article details the effects of irradiating cellulose fibres (Skogcell 90, Kotlas and Kraft) with high intensity ultrasound. The ultrasound employed in this investigation operated at a frequency of 20 kHz to allow maximum cavitation effects to be produced. The results show that exposure to ultrasound promoted fibrillation of the fibres without any fibre breakage, results confirmed from Kajaani tests. The fibrillation process was found to occur predominantly at sites on the fibre wall that had been previously damaged by the normal mechanical refining process. The conclusion reached was that commercial fibre refining could be enhanced by a combination of mechanical and ultrasonic refining. This new combination refining would give a reduction in the breaking and cutting of fibres that would reduce fibre loss during the refining process. The investigation also measured some important properties of the pulp slurries (Canadian Freeness and fibre length distributions) as well as properties of the resultant paper hand-sheets (strength and <b>burst</b> <b>values).</b> A series of photomicrographs showing the extent of the fibrillation are also included in the paper.

40|$|Abstract — Monitoring global {{states of}} an {{application}} deployed over distributed nodes becomes prevalent in today’s datacenters. State monitoring requires not only correct monitoring results but also minimum communication cost for efficiency and scalability. Most existing work adopts an instantaneous state monitoring approach, which triggers state alerts whenever a constraint is violated. Such an approach, however, may cause frequent and unnecessary state alerts due to unpredictable monitored <b>value</b> <b>bursts</b> and momentary outliers {{that are common}} in large-scale Internet applications. These false alerts may further lead to expensive and problematic counter-measures. To address this issue, we introduce window-based state monitoring in this paper. Window-based state monitoring evaluates whether state violation is continuous within a time window, and thus, gains immunity to short-term <b>value</b> <b>bursts</b> and outliers. Furthermore, we find that exploring the monitoring time window at distributed nodes achieves significant communication savings over instantaneous monitoring. Based on this finding, we develop WISE, a system that efficiently performs WIndow-based StatE monitoring at datacenter-scale. WISE is highlighted with three sets of techniques. First, WISE uses distributed filtering time windows and intelligently avoids global information collecting to achieve communication efficiency, while guaranteeing monitoring correctness at the same time. Second, WISE provides a suite of performance tuning techniques to minimize communication cost based on a sophisticated cost model. Third, WISE also employs a set of novel performance optimization techniques. Extensive experiments over both real world and synthetic traces show that WISE achieves a 50 %- 90 % reduction in communication cost compared with existing instantaneous monitoring approaches and simple alternative schemes.
