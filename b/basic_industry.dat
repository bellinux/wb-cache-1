25|$|The {{government}} also carried out an import substitution policy, taking what {{was obtained by}} agriculture to give support to the industrial sector, trading agricultural product exports for foreign currency to import industrial machinery, thus developing the industrial sector. The government raised tariffs, controlled foreign exchange and restricted imports {{in order to protect}} domestic industry. By the 1960s, Taiwan's import exchange industry was faced with the problem of saturating the domestic market. At the same time, the factories of some industrialized nations, because of rising wages and other reasons, slowly moved to certain areas that had both <b>basic</b> <b>industry</b> and low labor costs. By slow steps, the economic policy of Taiwan changed to pursue export expansion under advice of academic economists such as Ta-Chung Liu and Sho-Chieh Tsiang of Cornell University. They also promoted allowing interest rates to rise, to encourage domestic savings and expand the amount of resources available to fund new businesses. Additional academic advisers also members of Academic Sinica provided sound advice encouraging innovation in agricultural techniques, enabling one of the few successful takeoffs toward modern growth based on agricultural investment in cash crops for export.|$|E
500|$|In February 1921, Lenin {{introduced}} a New Economic Policy (NEP) to the Politburo; he convinced most senior Bolsheviks of its necessity and it passed {{into law in}} April. Lenin explained the policy in a booklet, On the Food Tax, in which he stated that the NEP represented {{a return to the}} original Bolshevik economic plans; he claimed that these had been derailed by the civil war, in which Sovnarkom had been forced to resort to the economic policies of [...] "war communism". The NEP allowed some private enterprise within Russia, permitting the reintroduction of the wage system and allowing peasants to sell produce on the open market while being taxed on their earnings. The policy also allowed for a return to privately owned small industry; <b>basic</b> <b>industry,</b> transport and foreign trade remained under state control. Lenin termed this [...] "state capitalism", and many Bolsheviks thought it to be a betrayal of socialist principles. Lenin biographers have often characterised the introduction of the NEP as one of his most significant achievements and some believe that had it not been implemented then Sovnarkom would have been quickly overthrown by popular uprisings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of recent trends in the U. S. <b>basic</b> <b>industries.</b> It first documents the dramatic fall in their shares of domestic employment and global production. It then considers explanations for these industries' relative [...] and, in some instances, absolute [...] decline. Those explanations fall into two categories: domestic explanations which focus on the decisions of labor, management and government, and international explanations which focus on the tendency of the product cycle to continually shift the production of established products and standardized processes to newly-industrializing countries. This review suggests that the recent difficulties of the U. S. <b>basic</b> <b>industries</b> have resulted not from {{one or the other of}} these factors but from their interplay. Insofar as product-cycle-based shifts in the international pattern of comparative advantage have contributed to recent difficulties, some decline in the U. S. <b>basic</b> <b>industries</b> is both inevitable [...] barring increased protection [...] and justifiable on efficiency grounds. Insofar as labor, management and government decisions share responsibility, the recent difficulties of U. S. <b>basic</b> <b>industries</b> may be at least partially reversible. ...|$|R
