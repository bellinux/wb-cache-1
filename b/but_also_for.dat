5|$|A known {{historical}} {{resident of}} Zaprešić was Count Josip Jelačić of Bužim (1801–59), the Ban of Croatia from 1848 until his death. Although born in Novi Sad, Serbia (then Habsburg Monarchy), {{he received an}} estate in Zaprešić together with his title. He is responsible for abolishing serfdom in Croatia in 1848, <b>but</b> <b>also</b> <b>for</b> an infamous suppression of Croatian intelligentsia, and the Illyrian movement during his reign under the orders of Baron Alexander von Bach, and Emperor Franz Joseph I. A statue of Jelačić riding a horse was constructed by Anton Dominik Fernkorn, and placed on the Zagreb's central square, Ban Jelačić Square. The statue has been repeatedly removed, and reinstated during changes in political power and orientation in Croatia, from monarchist, through ultra-nationalist, and communist, up to democratic. After the Croatian declaration of independence, marking {{the start of the}} democratic era, the statue was returned to the square, and Zaprešić credits Jelačić with a major arterial road named in his honor.|$|E
