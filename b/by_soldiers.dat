5|$|In {{his final}} analysis, Tokushi Kasahara looks at {{documents}} and diaries recorded <b>by</b> <b>soldiers</b> of the Japanese Army and concludes {{that at least}} 80,000 Chinese soldiers and POWs, or possibly over 100,000, were massacred by the Japanese, which was most of the estimated total force of 150,000 soldiers. Kasahara notes that Smythe's survey proves that a bare minimum of 12,000 ordinary civilians were massacred within Nanking, though other contemporary sources gives figures between 50,000 and 100,000, plus at least another 26,870 outside Nanking. Kasahara generally concludes that the death toll must have been well over 100,000, and possibly around 200,000. His more specific range of figures is roughly 160,000 to 170,000.|$|E
5|$|In the {{cultural}} sphere, {{there were some}} Mongol elements in Western medieval art, especially in Italy, of which most surviving examples are from the 14th century, after {{the chance of a}} military alliance had faded. These included the depiction of textiles from the Mongol Empire and Mongol script in various contexts, the latter often anachronistic. Imports of textiles had a considerable influence on Italian textile design. Mongol military costume is sometimes worn <b>by</b> <b>soldiers,</b> typically those acting against Christian figures, as in martyrdoms or Crucifixion scenes. These were perhaps copied from drawings made of Mongol envoys to Europe, or ones brought back from Outremer.|$|E

Although the zoo's administrators succeeded in convincing the local authorities that any danger from the animals was minimal, primarily because the perimeter walls were so high, the keepers were replaced in their sharp-shooting role <b>by</b> <b>soldiers</b> who patrolled the grounds armed with tommy guns.|$|E
