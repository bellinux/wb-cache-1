50|$|Made with an {{inflatable}} <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tube</b> and a rigid hull, these boats combine {{the advantages of}} traditional inflatable boats - security, stability, portability, {{and ease of use}} - with those of rigid-hulled boats - comfort, agility and speed.|$|E
40|$|A system {{comprising}} {{an inflatable}} load-lifting canopy of oval planform with <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tube</b> am 3 separate trailer for inflation and towing over {{water has been}} proved feasible for loads of up to 8 tons over smooth gmund and calm water. Limits of perfonsance in more severe conditions have not been detensim. d. For future applications and in particular for loads of various sizes and load distribution a circular planfom canopy should be considered, togetherwith alternative methods of slinging, inflation and propulsion. When used over porous surfaces and uneven ground, a blower with increased airflow would be of advantage to maintain air pressure and reduce friction and abrasion of {{the base of the}} structwe...|$|E
50|$|The <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tubes</b> of Zodiac boats {{have several}} compartments, {{separated}} by waterproof partitions. Thanks to its important air reserves, the boat keeps {{its ability to}} float and stays conceptually unsinkable when fully loaded, even with a deflated compartment.|$|R
50|$|K1A2: Upgraded K1A1. Originally {{named as}} K1A1 PIP. Developed from 2008 to 2010, and {{mass-production}} started in 2012. First upgraded vehicle was rolled out on December 20, 2013. Technology benefit from K2 Black Panther {{has been applied}} to this model. Upgrades include <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tubes,</b> automatic commanding control with identification friend or foe, GPS and INS position recognition, and digital wireless communications and displays. It also has air conditioning and a soft-kill active protection system to defend against missiles and rockets.

40|$|An {{in vitro}} {{procedure}} was modified to estimate rumen buoyancy of corn bran and fiber types. Inoculum {{was obtained from}} two beef heifers and mixed with McDougall’s buffer then distributed to the in vitro tubes for 30 hours incubation at 100 °F. Fibrous material formed a matte layer which was measured to describe <b>buoyancy.</b> <b>Tubes</b> contained 6 g of a feedlot-type diet with 7. 5 % fiber type (alfalfa hay, grass hay, corn silage, or corn stalks), with no replacement or 25 % replacement of the remaining corn with corn bran. Buoyancy declined over time. Alfalfa hay had the most positive effect on buoyancy of corn bran. This new method offers promise for describing rumen buoyancy...|$|R
5000|$|The {{combination}} of rigid hull and large inflatable <b>buoyancy</b> <b>tubes</b> was initially conceived by a Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) team working under Inspector of Lifeboats Dag Pike in 1964 {{as a means}} of reducing the wear and tear of the fabric bottoms of the existing inflatable inshore lifeboats. Although working versions were built, the plywood rigid hulls were not strong enough and broke up in waves. Development was being simultaneously undertaken by students and staff at Atlantic College in South Wales, where the rigid section was formed as a deep vee hull to add strength and which worked. The Atlantic College RIB's were developed to be an effective rescue craft for the college's fleet of sailing boats on the often perilous Bristol Channel, and the college had become an Inshore Lifeboat Station for the [...] RNLI in 1963, carrying out countless rescues over the next 50 years. The first commercial RIB was introduced in 1967 by Tony and Edward Lee-Elliott of Flatacraft, and patented by Admiral Desmond Hoare in 1969 after research and development at Atlantic College.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Floating and sinking {{demonstration}} (Cartesian diver). The tube {{is filled}} with water and air. When pressing the bottle, the additional water enters the test tube, thus increasing the average density of the system tube-water-air, resulting with negative <b>buoyancy</b> and the <b>tube</b> sinks.|$|R
5000|$|Less-toxic modern {{imitations of}} bubble lights {{are made from}} acrylic or other clear plastic rods, with {{permanent}} bubbles deliberately manufactured into them, lit with fixed-color or color-changing LEDs. Other bubbling lights are much larger and sit on a table or floor, occasionally with fake fish which [...] "swim" [...] {{up and down as}} they change <b>buoyancy.</b> These <b>tubes</b> are usually filled with distilled water, and have one or more airstones at the bottom, and normally a light, along with an air pump.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{circulation}} of matter in AGB stars above the H-burning shell, which is known to yield the appearance of p-rich isotopes like 13 C, 17 O and the unstable 26 Al at the stellar surface. These nuclei were observed in presolar grains of AGB origin {{and in some cases}} (e. g. C isotopes) in spectroscopic observations of evolved stars. For the physical mechanism driving the mixing we consider magnetic flux <b>tube</b> <b>buoyancy.</b> Magnetic <b>tubes</b> are formed below the convective envelope and one can express the parameters of the required mixing phenomena in terms of the magnetic field intensity |−→B |. We show that the required values of |−→B | can span a considerable range. If the mixing arrives only at the innermost layers of the convective envelope, fields smaller than the solar ones are sufficient, according to our previous analysis. If instead magnetic fields have to appear at the surface, as is suggested by recent observations, than field intensities in the Megagauss range are necessary...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{nucleosynthesis}} {{results obtained}} following the recent suggestion that extramixing phenomena in red giants might {{be driven by}} magnetic buoyancy. We explore for this model {{the production of the}} short-lived radioactive isotope $^{ 26 }$Al and of stable light nuclei, considering both the case of the general <b>buoyancy</b> of flux <b>tubes</b> and that of the intermittent release of magnetized unstable structures. We show that abundant $^{ 26 }$Al can be produced, up to, and above, the highest levels measured in presolar grains. This level would be also sufficient to explain the early solar system $^{ 26 }$Al as coming from a nearby AGB star of low mass. The case of fast-moving instabilities is the most efficient, reaching almost the same effectiveness as hot bottom burning (HBB) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{cyclically}} varying {{magnetic field}} of the Sun {{is believed to be}} produced by the hydromagnetic dynamo process. We first summarize the relevant observational data pertaining to sunspots and solar cycle. Then we review the basic principles of MHD needed to develop the dynamo theory. This is followed by a discussion how bipolar sunspots form due to magnetic <b>buoyancy</b> of flux <b>tubes</b> formed {{at the base of the}} solar convection zone. Following this, we come to the heart of dynamo theory. After summarizing the basic ideas of a turbulent dynamo and the basic principles of its mean field formulation, we present the famous dynamo wave solution, which was supposed to provide a model for the solar cycle. Finally we point out how a flux transport dynamo can circumvent some of the difficulties associated with the older dynamo models...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of buoyancy and Coriolis forces on heat transfer in turbine blade internal coolant passages. The experiments {{were conducted}} with a large scale, multi-pass, smooth-wall heat transfer model with both radially inward and outward flow. An analysis of the governing flow equations showed that four parameters influence the heat transfer in rotating passages (coolant-to-wall temperature ratio, Rossby number, Reynolds number and radius-to-passage hydraulic diameter ratio). These four parameters were varied over ranges which are typical of advanced gas turbine engine operating conditions. It was found that both Coriolis and buoyancy effects must be considered in turbine blade cooling designs and that the effect of rotation on the heat transfer coefficients was markedly different depending on the flow direction. Local heat transfer coefficients were found to decrease by as much as 60 percent and increase by 250 percent from no rotation levels. Comparisons with a pioneering stationary vertical <b>tube</b> <b>buoyancy</b> experiment showed reasonably good agreement. Correlation of the data is achieved employing dimensionless parameters derived from the governing flow equations...|$|R
40|$|Micro-particle image {{velocimetry}} {{measurements of}} the 3 D (three-dimensional) convection patterns generated near an evaporating meniscus in horizontally oriented capillary tubes are presented. Analysis of the vapor diffusion away from the meniscus reveals a zone of intense heat flux near the solid-liquid-vapor junction which creates a temperature gradient along the meniscus. This results in a surface tension gradient which, coupled with buoyancy effects, causes buoyant-thermocapillary convection in the liquid film. The relative influence of buoyancy and thermocapillarity on the flow was investigated for tube diameters ranging from 75 to 1575 µm. A transition from a pure 2 D thermocapillary flow to a 3 D buoyant-thermocapillary flow is observed {{with an increase in}} tube diameter. For the 75 µm tube, a symmetrical toroidal vortex is observed near the meniscus. For larger <b>tubes,</b> <b>buoyancy</b> effects become apparent as they dominate the flow field. The high mass fluxes in smaller-diameter tubes drive stronger vortices. Particle streaks and µPIV images obtained in multiple horizontal and vertical planes provide an understanding of this three-dimensional flow behavior. A scaling analysis shows the importance of thermocapillary convection in evaporating menisci...|$|R
