500|$|Prior to the series, Bobrov {{held a press}} luncheon in Moscow. He {{refused to}} {{consider}} that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had [...] "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would [...] "be difficult {{to move from the}} front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises for us when we meet your Canadian stars." [...] He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov [...] "will stand out, even against your best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot. I think he will be effective." [...] Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well! But, Frank, {{where will}} you live? The old house is big enough for us all. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> Mary {{get on with your}} mother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> the {{dynamite}} explode--for, of course, that is {{what you}} intend. Would not some sort of wire or fuse he required for each parcel of dynamite?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> long <b>would</b> {{that take}} him?" [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Chinnery. [...] "If {{the man had}} been run over I could have understood it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sinful!' said my mother, bristling up {{when her}} son was attacked; 'sure we're all sinners; and it's you, Mr. Jowls, who have given me the inexpressible blessing {{to let me know}} THAT. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> else <b>would</b> you have had the poor child behave?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Before she died, {{she told}} her mother, [...] "Oh Mamma, young people…young people…they are the future. You see, I can't run anymore, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> I <b>would</b> like {{to pass on to}} them the torch, like in the Olympics! Young people have only one life and it's {{worthwhile}} to spend it well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Aunt Pen, {{you want}} me to look pretty and be a credit to you; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> you like to see my face the color of those geraniums all the evening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{can you be}} so pig-headed! You {{are talking}} like an imbecile. Your secretary, Miss Dore, is a nice girl. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> you feel if Percy were to come to you and say that he was engaged to be married to her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She had sat up {{for some}} hours the evening before, {{so that there was}} no fear of her not being strong enough to get up as she proposed; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> it be when she left her room, and beheld all that she could not have realised? ...|$|E
6000|$|He lay quiet enough, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> {{the matter}} <b>would</b> have ended I do not know, for passion was running high, had not Goza {{at this moment}} risen with a {{bleeding}} nose and called out-- ...|$|R
6000|$|He was weary, but {{he could}} have sung for very joy. Happily his {{thoughts}} reverted to Lucy and the future. He would pick {{out a couple of}} beautiful ponies for her, and break them gently. He would find some swift sturdy horses for himself. Then, as many thousands of times, he thought of his first horse Curly. None could ever take his place. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> he <b>would</b> have loved to own the black stallion! ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{himself and}} the boy, what did slavery mean? He hoped to {{understand}} better from Yusuf, and at any rate to persuade the man to become the medium of communication with the outside world, beyond that 'dissociable ocean,' over which his wistful gaze wandered. Then the ransom of the little Chevalier de Bourke would be certain, and, {{if there were any}} gratitude in the world, his own. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> long <b>would</b> this take, and what might befall them in the meantime? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very easy}} for you to joke, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> you like to wear a blinder like that for weeks and weeks, sir?" [...] and Rose {{quenched}} his rising spirits by slipping the shade over his eyes, as he still sat on the cushion at her feet.|$|E
6000|$|In {{points of}} honour to be tried, All passions must be laid aside; Ask no advice, but think alone, Suppose the {{question}} not your own; How shall I act? {{is not the}} case, <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> Brutus in my place; In such a cause would Cato bleed; And how would Socrates proceed? ...|$|E
60|$|It must be {{admitted}} that Tom and Sam were very uneasy. They had {{felt that the}} authorities might follow the Peacock, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> anybody ever discover them in such a lonely place as this? But there was no help for it, and on they went until Captain Langless called a sudden halt.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} {{that you were a}} milksop, Albert," [...] his sister said, indignantly. [...] "I knew that you were not strong, and was sorry for it, but it was much nicer for me that you should be content to walk and ride with me, and to take {{interest}} in things that I like, instead of being like Henry Nevil or Richard Clairvaux, who are always talking and thinking of nothing <b>but</b> <b>how</b> they <b>would</b> go to the wars, and what they would do there." ...|$|R
5000|$|.....when any {{new idea}} was {{suggested}} in religion, in medicine, in science, in economics, in sociology, and indeed {{in almost any}} field of thought, the first question which the learned body having charge of that field and making a living out of it would ask itself was not whether the idea was good and true and would tend to the general welfare, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> it <b>would</b> immediately and directly affect the set of doctrines, traditions, and institutions, with the prestige of which their own personal interests were identified." ...|$|R
60|$|Body--The {{ship was}} a new body for him. He had traded in the old dying body, {{withered}} and frail, for this hulking frame of metal and plastic, turbines and rocket jets. He was strong, now. Strong and big. The new body was more powerful than a thousand human bodies. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> long <b>would</b> it last him? The average life of a cruiser was only ten years. With careful handling he might get twenty out of it, before some essential part failed {{and there was no}} way to replace it.|$|R
6000|$|Little did Mr. Dunboyne {{know what}} changes {{had taken place}} since he and his son had last met, and what hope might yet present itself of {{brighter}} days for poor Euneece! I thought of writing to him. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> that crabbed old man receive a confidential letter from a lady who was a stranger? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> Beatrice fare? Would {{she come}} to herself safely? He thought so, {{it was only}} a fainting fit. But when she did recover, what would she do? Nothing rash, he prayed. And what could {{be the end of it}} all? Who might say? How {{fortunate}} that the sister had been so sound asleep. Somehow he did not trust Elizabeth--he feared her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Reconciled! Ruey, {{how you do}} ask questions!" [...] said Miss Roxy, {{fiercely}} {{pulling a}} bandanna silk handkerchief out of her pocket, with which she wiped her eyes in a defiant manner. [...] "Reconciled! It's easy enough to talk, Ruey, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> you like it, when everything was goin' smooth and playin' into your hands, and all the world smooth and shiny, to be took short up? I guess you wouldn't be reconciled. That's what I guess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You dare?" [...] asked Ajor. [...] "But {{your father}} will not permit it--Jor, my father, High Chief of the Galus, will not permit it, for like me you are cos-ata-lo. Oh, Co-Tan, if we <b>but</b> could! <b>How</b> I <b>would</b> {{love to see}} all the strange and {{wonderful}} things of which my Tom tells me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indecorous!" [...] he cried, {{and pushed}} back {{his chair and}} rose. [...] "What's indecorous about it? To leave you here alone in a hotel in New York would not only be indecorous, <b>but</b> senseless. <b>How</b> long <b>would</b> you put it off? a week--a month--a year? Where would {{you go in the}} meantime, and what would you do?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{conviction}} of this sad yet natural fact came to Mrs Jo with a pang, for she felt how utterly hopeless such a longing was; since light and darkness were not farther apart than snow-white Bess and sin-stained Dan. No dream {{of such a}} thing disturbed the young girl, as her entire unconsciousness plainly showed. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> long <b>would</b> it be before the eloquent eyes betrayed the truth? And then what disappointment for Dan, what dismay for Bess, who was as cool and high and pure as her own marbles, and shunned all thought of love with maidenly reserve.|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith, then, things ain't {{going on}} a bit too well," [...] said Mr. Blake. [...] "Abatement, {{abatement}}, nothing but abatement! Nobody abates me anything. I have to pay all family charges {{just the same as}} ever. What would they say if I was to take away my wife and girls, shut up Carnlough, and go and live in France? I could give them some abatement then and be a richer man. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> they like to have Carnlough empty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you guess}} now why I caused {{you to be}} taken living? I will tell you; {{that you may be}} the bait to draw her to me. To kill you would be easy; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> that serve, seeing that then she herself would choose to die? But, perchance, to save your life she will live also--yes, and give herself to me. At least, I will try it; should the plan fail--then you can pay the price of her pride with your blood, prince Aziel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sire," [...] he replied, [...] "the prince {{is still}} very young for the cares of state. Your Majesty fears his growing idle and careless, and doubtless you are right. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> it be if he were first to marry? This would attach him to his home, and your Majesty might give him a share in your counsels, {{so that he might}} {{gradually}} learn how to wear a crown, which you can give up to him whenever you find him capable of wearing it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Teleportation: In Marvel X-Men Encyclopedia Vol.2 they state Murmur has {{teleportation}} abilities. However, {{this was}} never fully explained. This comes from Alpha Flight's {{battle with the}} Zodiac, Murmur touched the Zodiac member named Virgo and said [...] "Paris." [...] Immediately Virgo vanished saying [...] "Scorpio I'm fading awayyy", (unusual given that someone under Murmur's control usually doesn't have independent thought). Virgo ended up in Paris, France with a type of amnesia. The Zodiac did have personal teleportation devices, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> Murmur <b>would</b> {{know this is a}} mystery. Also <b>how</b> Virgo <b>would</b> activate it and teleport to Paris is another mystery since Taurus later had to retrieve her as her teleporter was broken. The range of Murmur's actual ability to teleport was never stated.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pegasus, indeed!" [...] cried he, {{turning up}} his nose as high as such a flat nose could be turned up,--"Pegasus, indeed! A winged horse, truly! Why, friend, are you in your senses? Of what use would wings be to a horse? Could he drag the plough so well, think you? To be sure, {{there might be a}} little saving in the expense of shoes; <b>but</b> then, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> a man like to see his horse flying out of the stable window?--yes, or whisking him up above the clouds, when he only wanted to ride to mill? No, no! I don't believe in Pegasus. There never was such a ridiculous kind of a horse-fowl made!" ...|$|R
6000|$|After awhile, this [...] "Spiritual adamant," [...] as Palladius calls him, {{bought his}} freedom of them, and sailed for Rome. At sundown first the sailors, {{and then the}} passengers, brought out each man his provisions, and ate. Serapion sat still. The crew fancied that he was sea-sick; but when he had passed a second, third, and fourth day fasting, they asked, [...] "Man, why do you not eat?" [...] "Because I have nothing to eat." [...] They thought that some one had stolen his baggage: but when {{they found that the}} man had {{absolutely}} nothing, they began to ask him not only <b>how</b> he <b>would</b> keep alive, <b>but</b> <b>how</b> he <b>would</b> pay his fare. He only answered, [...] "That he had nothing; that they might cast him out of the ship where they had found him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{could watch}} sharply enough at night, Master Cyril. There {{would be no}} fear of her getting away then without our knowing it. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> it be during the day? There am I in the shop or store from {{seven in the morning}} until we lock up before supper-time. You are out most of your time, and when you are not away, you are in the office at the books, and she is free to go {{in and out of the}} front door without either of us being any the wiser." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{thinking}} always {{of his wife}} during his solitary rides, and of her fear and deep anxiety. It was for her sake and for the children {{that he was so}} care-worn, not for his own. Had he been alone in the world he would not have fretted himself in this fashion because of the malice of any man. <b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> it be with her should he be forced to move her from Gangoil? And yet, with all his love, they had parted almost in anger. Surely she would understand the tenderness of the message he had just sent her.|$|E
6000|$|They {{both knew}} that he had forged the documents, Brehgert and Croll; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>would</b> that concern him, Melmotte, if these two friends had {{resolved}} together that they would not expose him? He had desired to get the documents back into his own hands, and here they were! Melmotte's immediate trouble arose from the difficulty of speaking in a proper manner to his own servant who had just detected him in forgery. He couldn't speak. There were no words appropriate to such an occasion. 'It vas a strong order, Mr Melmotte,' said Croll. Melmotte tried to smile but only grinned. 'I vill not be back in the Lane, Mr Melmotte.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>how,</b> I <b>would</b> ask, is this {{position}} to be defended? Surely not by [...] contradicting almost {{every part of the}} inspired volumes, in which such [...] frequent mention occurs of different and distinct angels appearing to [...] the Patriarchs and Prophets, sometimes in groups, and sometimes in [...] limited numbers * *. It is, indeed, so wholly repugnant to the general [...] tenor of the Sacred Writings, and so abhorrent from the piety of both [...] Jew and Christian, that the learned author himself, either forgetting [...] what he had before advanced, or else postponing his philosophy to his [...] religion, has absolutely maintained the contrary in his explication of [...] the Cherubim, &c.|$|R
60|$|It was a {{week before}} he went again to Willey Farm. Miriam had {{suffered}} a great deal, and was afraid to see him again. Was she now to endure the ignominy of his abandoning her? That would only be superficial and temporary. He would come back. She held the keys to his soul. <b>But</b> meanwhile, <b>how</b> he <b>would</b> torture her with his battle against her. She shrank from it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well he may be, {{all alone}} there, and seeing poor Castle Blanch going to rack and ruin. I could cry about it {{whenever}} I think of it; <b>but</b> <b>how</b> much worse <b>would</b> {{it have been}} if he had deserted too! As long as {{he is in the}} old vicarage there is a home spot to me in the world! Oh, I thank him, I do thank him for standing by the old place to the last.' ...|$|R
