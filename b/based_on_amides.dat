40|$|Two {{biodegradable}} polycations {{based on}} hexanediol diacrylate linked oligoethylenimine (OEI) were synthesized by applying different reaction temperatures, 20 degrees C (LT-OEI-HD) and 60 degrees C (HT-OEI-HD).

HT-OEI-HD had a molecular weight of 26. 6 kDa, was mainly <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>amides,</b> and degraded more slowly than LT-OEIHD.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} {{of a family of}} gelators in which alkyl chains are connected to the amino groups of L-lysine methyl ester using a range of different hydrogen bonding linking groups (carbamate, amide, urea, thiourea and diacylhydrazine) using simple synthetic methodology <b>based</b> <b>on</b> isocyanate or acid chloride chemistry. The ability of these compounds to gelate organic solvents such as toluene or cyclohexane can be directly related to the ability of the linking group to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In general terms, the ability to structure solvents can be considered as: thiourea <carbamate <amide <urea similar to diacylhydrazine. This process has been confirmed by thermal measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies. By deprotecting the methyl ester group, we have demonstrated that a balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups is essential-if the system has too much hydrophilicity (e. g., diacylhydrazine, urea) it will not form gels due to low solubility in the organic media. However, the less effective gelators <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>amide</b> and carbamate linkages are enhanced by converting the methyl ester to a carboxylic acid. Furthermore, subsequent mixing of the acid with a second component (diaminododecane) further enhances the ability to form networks, and, {{in the case of the}} amide, generates a two-component gel, which can immobilise a wide range of solvents of industrial interest including petrol and diesel (fuel oils), olive oil and sunflower oil (renewable food oils) and ethyl laurate, isopropyl myristate and isopropyl palmitate (oils used in pharmaceutical formulation). The gels are all thermoreversible, and may therefore be useful in controlled release/formulation applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The systematic variation of the linker group in amphiphilic surfactants for carbon nanotubes has not been previously investigated. In the present series, the hydrophobic unit is derived from pyrene, the hydrophilic unit comprises 1 – 9 carboxylate groups and the linker is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>amide</b> or ether moieties. The resulting MWNT–surfactant dispersions, up to concentrations and efficiencies of ca. 160 mg L− 1 and almost 50 %, respectively, have been characterised by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy studies which provide detailed structure–property relationships, while transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to confirm that the MWNTs were well dispersed. For many of the new surfactants enhanced dispersion efficiency is observed compared to commercial surfactants. The efficiency of the dispersion is affected by the presence, functionality and particularly the length of the linker, and also the number of terminal carboxylate units. The marked effect of sodium, potassium and calcium cations on the dispersion behaviour is explained by interactions between the metal ions and the surfactant and an ionic screening mechanism. We also demonstrate that the dispersibility of the MWNT–surfactant dispersions can be reversibly switched ‘off’ and ‘on’ by addition of acid and base, respectively. The experimental results are supported by theoretical calculations of solvation energy ΔES.

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{preparation}} and analysis of mono- and multivalent host-guest complexes mainly <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>amide</b> (pseudo) rotaxanes with Hunter/Vögtle tetralactam macrocycles (TLM). Additionally, the binding behavior of differently substituted resorcinarenes towards cationic guest molecules was examined in a combination of solution and gas-phase studies. First, the binding behavior of different monovalent guests like diamide- or diketopiperazine-axles towards the monovalent tetralactam macrocycles was analyzed. The strong binding of diketopiperazine binding stations allows an effective rotaxane formation through stoppering reaction with an azide-functionalized stopper molecule through “click” chemistry. A detailed study combining NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements with X-ray crystallography and DFT calculations was performed to investigate the influence of different substituents on diamide binding stations {{in terms of the}} binding affinity towards the TLM. While guests with alkyl or alkenyl chains attached to the diamide carbonyl groups have a significantly higher binding affinity to the macrocycle than guests with benzoyl substituents, nearly no binding could be observed when electron-withdrawing groups were attached to the benzoyl-substituent. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> these results, di- and trivalent amide pseudorotaxanes were synthesized and a detailed thermdynamic analysis of the threading process was performed with respect to binding constants, binding enthalpies and entropies. Through double mutant cycle analysis, effective molarities and cooperative binding could be determined to provide a profound understanding of the binding situation in mono- and multivalent pseudorotaxanes. The multivalency-enhanced binding makes the syntheses of the first doubly and triply threaded amide rotaxanes through ”click” chemistry much more efficient than expected from the rather low yields of their monovalent counterparts. Furthermore, the trivalent rotaxane turned out to act as a molecular elevator, which can be controlled by the addition or removal of chloride ions. For studying the non-covalent interactions between differently substituted resorcinarenes and cationic guest molecules, a trend of the binding affinities was determined in the gas phase by ESI-MS/MS experiments. The determination of binding constants in solution by NMR titrations shows an opposed trend, which can be explained by a synergetic effect originating from the interaction of the halogenated resorcinarenes with the counter anions through hydrogen bonding...|$|R

Development of in vitro models that more accurately model mineralization systems in vivo will assist in understanding medical conditions as well as inform biomimetic materials development. Understanding the heirachical structures in mineralized tissues relies on the chemical control of crystal nucleation and growth at the interfaces. Studies presented in this thesis provide additional in vitro tools for studying in vivo systems by controlling for interface chemistry, mineralization environment, and experimental setup for elucidating the effect of interfaces in biomineralization. Covalently bound surface chemistry - oxide, methyl, carboxylate, 2 -aminoethyl dihydrogen phosphate, osteopontin, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) - on porous silicon substrates has a distinct affect on surface mineral nucleation and morphology. The morphology and coverage resulting from suspending the differed from those reported in literature. This method has potential for selectively examining the effects of covalently bound protein conformations and segments, more closely mimicking the conformation constraints at interfaces in biological systems.

Current rapid tests for pathogens include techniques such as ELISA, PCR, and immunoassays. Despite developments in these techniques there continues to be an increase in the incidence of foodborne illnesses and outbreaks with Salmonella spp. and E. coli O 157 :H 7 responsible for 30. 6 % and 2. 9 % of the foodborne illness deaths in the US respectively and costing $ 3. 1 billion in annual medical expenses, productivity losses, and costs for premature deaths annually. Thus, there is still a need for rapid pathogen detection. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) in combination with multivariate statistical analysis is able to identify, distinguish, and classify microorganisms. However, barriers to widespread use of FT-IR include: sample preparation procedures, preparation time, sensitivity, interference from water absorbance, and analytical tools used. The overall goal of this research was the development of sample preparation and FT-IR spectroscopy in combination with chemometrics for identifying, differentiating, and quantifying Salmonella Typhimurium and E. coli O 157 :H 7 from culture media and select foods. In the development phase, sample preparation methods for FT-IR analysis (filtration and Dynabeads ®) were evaluated for their sensitivity and specificity. Detection limits were 5. 6 log CFU/mL (Dynabeads®) and 6. 0 log CFU/mL (filtration) for E. coli O 157 :H 7 requiring 6 h incubation of 300 - 500 CFU/mL. FT-IR analyses were able to differentiate the effects of processing treatments (heat, UV, salt, alcohol, and antibiotics), and between live and dead cells of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and E. coli K 12.

More importantly, these (co) polymers could be synthesized free of metallic residues thereby making them suitable as biomedical and pharmaceutical biomaterials...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Lignocellulosic natural fibers like sisal and {{pineapple}} leaf fiber (PALF) {{can be incorporated}} in polymers <b>based</b> <b>on</b> biodegradable polyester <b>amide</b> matrix, BAK 1095 for achieving desired properties and texture in the resulting biocomposites. But high level of moisture absorption, poor wettability and insufficient adhesion between untreated fiber and the polymer matrix led to debonding with age. In order to improve the above qualities, various surface treatments of sisal fiber like mercerization, cyanoethylation, acetylation, bleaching and vinyl monomer (acrylonitrile) grafting are carried out which results in improved mechanical performance of sisal-BAK composites. Mechanical properties like tensile and flexural strength are optimum at a fiber loading of 50 wt%. Among all modifica-tions, alkali treatment and acetylation result in improved properties of the composites. Alkali treated sisal composite shows about 20 % increase in tensile strength and acetylate...|$|R
40|$|As a {{first step}} to {{determine}} the folding pathway of a protein with an alpha/beta doubly wound topology, the 1 H, 13 C, and 15 N backbone chemical shifts of Azotobacter vinelandii holoflavodoxin II (179 residues) have been determined using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Its secondary structure is shown to contain a five-stranded parallel beta-sheet (beta 2 -beta 1 -beta 3 -beta 4 -beta 5) and five alpha-helices. Exchange rates for the individual amide protons of holoflavodoxin were determined using the hydrogen exchange method. The amide protons of 65 residues distributed throughout the structure of holoflavodoxin exchange slowly at pH* 6. 2 [kex < 10 (- 5) s(- 1) ] {{and can be used}} as probes in future folding studies. Measured exchange rates relate to apparent local free energies for transient opening. We propose that the amide protons in the core of holoflavodoxin only exchange by global unfolding of the apo state of the protein. The results obtained are discussed with respect to their implications for flavodoxin folding and for modulation of the flavin redox potential by the apoprotein. We do not find any evidence that A. vinelandii holoflavodoxin II is divided into two subdomains <b>based</b> <b>on</b> its <b>amide</b> proton exchange rates, as opposed to what is found for the structurally but not sequentially homologous alpha/beta doubly wound protein Che Y...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} {{on the structure}} of the rat odorant-binding protein was investigated by spectroscopic and in silico methodologies. In particular, in this work, we examined the structural features of the rat OBP- 1 F by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and molecular dynamics investigations. The obtained spectroscopic results were analyzed using the following three different methods <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the unexchanged <b>amide</b> hydrogens of the protein sample: (1) the analysis of difference spectra; (2) the generalized 2 D-IR correlation spectroscopy; (3) the phase diagram method. The three methods indicated that at high temperatures the rOBP- 1 F structure undergoes a relaxation process involving the protein tertiary organization before undergoing the denaturation and aggregation processes, suggesting the presence of an intermediate state such as a molten globule-like state. Importantly, the proposed analyses represent a general approach that could be applied to the study of protein stability...|$|R

How various experimental parameters can affect microsphere morphology, reaction yield and re-binding capacity have been evaluated. Pre-polymerization interactions between template and functional monomer in chloroform and MeCN have been studied by 1 H-NMR. The {{results suggest that the}} interaction between nia and methacrylic acid (MAA) is mainly <b>based</b> <b>on</b> hydrogen-bonding between <b>amide</b> protons and MAA. Computational density functional theory (DFT) studies on MAA-nia complexes have been also performed to better understand hydrogen-bonding interactions. The imprinted activity of the microspheres, synthesized in chloroform or acetonitrile (MeCN), has been evaluated by spectrophotometric analysis of nia solutions when chloroform or MeCN are used as incubation solvents. The results suggest that MeCN interferes with hydrogen bonding between template and MAA during either the polymerization step or re-binding process as also observed from theoretical results. Finally, the selectivity towards selected nia analogues has been also confirmed...|$|R
40|$|A novel bio-affinitive, photocuring, and membrane-forming gelatin {{derivative}} was synthesized in this study. This {{process was}} <b>based</b> <b>on</b> the <b>amide</b> formation between carboxylic acid and the amine in methanol-water media using dicycloliexyl-carbodiimide (DCC) as a condenser. Gelatin and glycine were {{the sources of}} amine in the model reaction. Since there were two anhydride groups in each 3, 3, 4, 4 '-benzophenone tetra-carboxylic dianhydride (BTDA) molecule, two 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) molecules were used to induce the ring-opening reaction of BTDA and release two carboxylic acid groups. The resulting photoreactive gelatin was called GE-BTHE, of which the photoreactive component was the ketone groups of BTDA and HEMA that {{played the role of}} double bond supplier. This photoreactive gelatin could be converted from the transparent liquid phase into swollen membrane by a 6 -min irradiation of high pressure mercury lamp. The most efficient irradiation was at 267 nm and the highest degree of swelling of the cured GE-BTHE membrane could reach 5. 9. The elongation from the dried gel remained 5 - 10 '%, i. e., relatively elastic. The properties of this gelatin derivative were investigated using amide formation analysis, calculation of the gel content and the swelling ratio, and monitoring of the photocuring process. The GE-BTHE synthesized in this study should be very potential in applications such as protective wound dressings and hemostatic absorbents for minimally invasive surgery.

40|$|Most of the {{posterior}} segment diseases are chronic and multifactorial and require long-term intraocular medication. Conventional treatments of these pathologies consist of successive intraocular injections, which {{are associated with}} adverse effects. Successful therapy requires {{the development of new}} drug delivery systems able to release the active substance for a long term with a single administration. The present work involves the description {{of a new generation of}} microspheres <b>based</b> <b>on</b> poly(ester <b>amide)</b> s (PEA), which are novel polymers with improved biodegradability, processability and good thermal and mechanical properties. We report on the preparation of the PEA polymer, PEA microspheres (PEA Ms) and their characterization. PEA Ms (~ 15 μm) were loaded with a lipophilic drug (dexamethasone) (181. 0 ± 2. 4 μg DX/mg Ms). The in vitro release profile of the drug showed a constant delivery for at least 90 days. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> the data from a performed in vitro release study, a kinetic ocular model to predict in vivo drug concentrations in a rabbit vitreous was built. According to the pharmacokinetic simulations, intravitreal injection of dexamethasone loaded PEA microspheres would provide release of the drug in rabbit eyes up to 3 months. Cytotoxicity studies in macrophages and retinal pigment epithelial cells revealed a good in vitro tolerance of the microsystems. After sterilization, PEA Ms were administered in vivo by subtenon and intravitreal injections in male Sprague–Dawley rats and the location of the microspheres in rat eyes was monitored. We conclude that PEA Ms provide an alternative delivery system for controlling the delivery of drugs to the eye, allowing a novel generation of microsphere design...|$|R
40|$|Model {{peptides}} <b>based</b> <b>on</b> -(Aib-Ala) (n) -, and (Aib) (n) -Leu-(Aib) (2) sequences, {{which have}} varying amounts of 3 (10) -helical character, were studied {{by use of}} vibrational and electronic circular dichroism (VCD and ECD) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectroscopies to test the correlation of spectral response and conformation. The data indicate that these peptides, starting from a length of about four to six residues, predominantly adopt a 3 (10) -helical conformation at room temperature. The longest model peptides, depending on the series, may evidence some a-helical contribution to the spectra, while the shorter ones, with less than six residues, have much less order. The IR absorption spectra (as supported by theory) showed only small frequency changes between 3 (10) - and alpha-helices. By contrast, solvent effects {{are a source of}} much bigger perturbations. The ECD results show that the intensity ratio for the similar to 222 -nm to similar to 208 -nm bands, while useful for distinguishing between these two helical types in some sequences, may have a narrower range of application than VCD. However, the VCD data presented here continue to support the proposed discrimination between alpha- and 3 (10) -helices <b>based</b> <b>on</b> qualitative <b>amide</b> I and II bandshape differences. The present study shows the intensities of the 3 (10) -helical amide I (peak-to-peak) to its amide H VCD to be of the same order and useful for discriminating them from a-helices, whose amide I dominates the amide H in intensity. This qualitative result is experimentally independent of the amount of alphaMe-substituted residues in the sequence. These experimental VCD results are consistent in detail with theoretical spectral simulations for Ac-(Ala) (8) -NH 2, Ac-(Aib-Ala),-NH 2, and Ac-(Aib) (8) -NH 2 in 3 (10) - and alpha-helical conformations...|$|R

A well-defined anodic peak corresponding to the oxidation of mercury on proposed electrode was obtained at 0. 2 [*]V versus Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The effect of experimental parameters on differential voltammetric peak currents was investigated in acetate buffer solution of pH 7. 0 containing 1 [*]×[*] 10 − 1 [*]mol[*]L− 1 NaCl. Mercury (II) ion was preconcentrated at the modified electrode by forming complex with AAP under proper conditions and then reduced {{on the surface of}} the electrode.

40|$|We {{considered}} poly(esteramide) hyperbranched polymers (trade names: Hybrane S 1200 and Hybrane HA 1690) as enhancers of glimepiride solubility and therewithassociated dissolution rate. We prepared solid dispersions (SD) of glimepiride with hyperbranched polymers (HB) {{and compared}} their solubility {{with those of}} crystalline and amorphous glimepiride {{as well as with}} the solubility of SD of glimepridie with conventional linear polymers, i. ie. Poly(ethylene glycol) and Gelucire (stearoyl macroglyceride) s. Since the solubility and dissolution rate depend also on glimepiride crystallinity we characterized the morphology of solid dispersions by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis. The nature of molecular interactions involved in complexation of glimepiride with HB was studied by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The comparison of the results of in-vitro dissolution studies show that SD <b>based</b> <b>on</b> poly(ester <b>amide)</b> HB polymers showed significantly enhanced aqueous solubility of glimepiride and its dissolution rate as compared to glimepiride in crystalline or amorphous form as well as its SD with conventional linear polymers. We also calculated the amount of glimepiride complexed with particular HB polymer (loading capacity) in SD using dissolution results. The loading capacity for both HB polymers was estimated to be around 5 %, w/w of glimepiride. SD containing higher amounts of glimepiride appear to be oversaturated, so that non-complexed glimepiride crystallizes as a separate solid phase during the solvent evaporation. X-ray diffraction studies confirmed calculated loading capacity. IR results indicated that glimepiride forms complexes with HB polymers through hydrogen bonds between the NH groups of glimepiride and carbonyls of ester (O) -C=O and amide (N) -C=O groups of HB polymers. Therefore, the improved glimepiride solubility was ascribed to complex formation between glimepiride and HB polymers...|$|R
