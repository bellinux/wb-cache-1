25|$|Until recent times, Shebitku {{was placed}} within the 25th Dynasty between Shabaka and Taharqa. Although the {{possibility}} of a switch between the reigns of Shabaka and Shebitku had already been suggested before by Brunet and Baker had outlined nine reasons for the reversal, it was Michael Bányai in 2013 who first published in a mainstream journal many arguments in favor of such a relocation. After him, Frédéric Payraudeau and Gerard P. F. <b>Broekman</b> independently expanded the hypothesis. The archaeological evidence now in 2016/2017 firmly favours a Shebitku-Shabaka succession. Gerard Broekman's GM 251 (2017) paper shows that Shebitku reigned before Shabaka since the upper edge of Shabaka’s NLR #30 Year 2 Karnak quay inscription was carved over the left-hand side of the lower edge of Shebitku's NLR#33 Year 3 inscription. This can only mean that Shabaka ruled after Shebitku.|$|E

25|$|While Harsiese A {{may have}} become king at Thebes prior to Year 4 of Osorkon II, contra Kitchen, he {{certainly}} ruled Thebes during {{the first decade of}} Osorkon II's reign as Kitchen notes. Osorkon II's control over this great city is only first documented by 2 separate Year 12 Quay Texts which means that Harsiese had died by this time. If Harsiese was already ruling at Thebes earlier under Takelot I, it might help explain why Takelot I's own Year 5, Year 8, and Year 14 Nile Quay Texts, which mention the serving High Priests Iuwelot and Smendes III—who were all brothers of Takelot I--consistently omit any mention of Takelot's name, as Gerard <b>Broekman</b> aptly notes in an article in JEA (88 (2002)). Takelot I's name is left deliberately blank here. This might indicate a possible rivalry between Takelot I and Harsiese A at Thebes. The Amun Priests may have chosen not to involve themselves in this dispute by omitting any mention of the reigning king's name.|$|E
25|$|Takelot I's {{authority}} was not fully recognised in Upper Egypt, and Harsiese A, or another local Theban king, challenged his power there. Several Nile Quay Texts at Thebes mention two sons of Osorkon I--namely, the High Priests of Amun Iuwelot and Smendes III in Years 5, 8 and 14 of an anonymous king who {{can only be}} Takelot I, since Takelot I was their brother. Uniquely, however, the Quay Texts specifically omit any reference to {{the identity of the}} king himself. This might suggest that there was a dispute in the royal succession following Osorkon I's death in Upper Egypt, which seriously impaired Takelot I's control there. Harsiese A, as the son of the High Priest Shoshenq C and grandson of Osorkon I, or a hypothethical king named Maatkheperre Shoshenq must have appeared as a rival. The Theban priests henceforth chose to avoid any involvement in this dispute by deliberately leaving the name of the king in the Quay Texts 'Blank' rather than choosing sides, as G. <b>Broekman</b> notes in his study of the Karnak Quay Texts. This situation was ultimately later resolved by Osorkon II who is clearly attested as Pharaoh at Thebes by his 12th Regnal Year, according to Nile Quay Text No.8 and Text No.9.|$|E

2500|$|David Aston {{has argued}} in a JEA 75 (1989) paper that Osorkon II was succeeded by Shoshenq III at Tanis rather than Takelot II Si-Ese as Kitchen assumed {{because none of}} Takelot II's monuments {{have been found in}} Lower Egypt where other genuine Tanite kings such as Osorkon II, Shoshenq III and even the {{short-lived}} Pami (at 6-7 years) are attested on donation stelas, temple walls and/or annal documents. [...] Other Egyptologists such as Gerard <b>Broekman,</b> Karl Jansen-Winkeln, Aidan Dodson and Jürgen von Beckerath have also endorsed this position. Von Beckerath also identifies Shoshenq III as the immediate successor of Osorkon II and places Takelot II as a separate king in Upper Egypt. Gerard <b>Broekman</b> writes in a recent 2005 GM article that [...] "in light of the monumental and genealogical evidence," [...] Aston's Chronology for the position of the 22nd Dynasty kings [...] "is highly preferable" [...] to Kitchen's chronology. [...] The only documents which mention a king Takelot in Lower Egypt such as a royal tomb at Tanis, a Year 9 donation stela from Bubastis and a heart scarab featuring the nomen 'Takelot Meryamun' [...] have now been attributed exclusively to king Takelot I by Egyptologists today including Kitchen himself.|$|E
2500|$|While Osorkon II's precise reign {{length is}} unknown, some Egyptologists such as Jürgen von Beckerath ndash& in his 1997 book Chronology of the Egyptian Pharaohs [...] and Aidan Dodson have {{suggested}} {{a range of}} between 38 and 39 years. However, these much higher figures are not verified by the current monumental evidence. Gerard <b>Broekman</b> gives Osorkon II a slightly shorter reign of 34 years. English Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen, in a 2006 Agypten und Levante article, now accepts that if Nile Level Text 14 is correctly attributed to Year 29 of Osorkon II, then the reference to Osorkon's Sed Festival jubilee should be amended from Year 22 to Year 30. Kitchen suggests that Osorkon II would have died shortly after in his Year 31.|$|E

40|$|Focus of {{the paper}} This paper {{addresses}} the fresh produce supply chain in the retail sector. Its particular theme is product handling, arguably {{the single most important}} determinant of chain performance in this case. The specific focus {{of the paper}} is on achieving quality outcomes in handling fresh produce but it should be remembered that there are other perspectives on supply chain performance such as economic outcomes, marketing outcomes and environmental outcomes. Thus the reader should keep in mind that supply chain performance is a whole-of-system concept, and this paper address the performance of only one of its sub-systems. The paper assumes a particular sequence of logical relationships that justify its focus on the quality in handling. The sequence is as follows: 1) Firms in integrated chains are more competitive because they are able to create more value than firms acting independently (Spekman et al., 1998); 2) Achieving quality in handling is a pre-requisite to achieving through-chain integration (Handfield and Nichols, 1999); 3) Achieving quality in handling should therefore be conceptualised as a value-creating process (Van Roekel and <b>Broekmans,</b> 1997; van Hoek, 1998); and in this way 4) Achieving quality in handling improves the competitiveness of the supply chain (Fearne and Hughes, 1999) ...|$|R
40|$|Editorial commentThe {{standard}} {{surgical procedure}} {{for treatment of}} tubal ectopic pregnancy is salpingectomy, in which the affected fallopian tube is removed. A feasible alternative intervention, salpingotomy, has been promoted since 1957. With this procedure, the pregnancy is removed while the affected tube is preserved. There are 2 risks associated with salpingotomy: a repeated ectopic pregnancy in the same tube and a persistent trophoblast requiring additional treatment. Despite these potential drawbacks, salpingotomy has been widely used and often preferred over salpingectomy {{because it has been}} assumed that preservation of both tubes increased the prospects for a future pregnancy. However, limited data support this assumption, and it remains unclear whether the potential benefits of salpingotomy outweigh the risks. The aim of this open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial was to determine whether salpingotomy improves rates of ongoing pregnancy by natural conception compared with salpingectomy.

40|$|Background: Limited {{observational}} {{evidence suggests}} potential benefit for subfertile women undergoing operative hysteroscopy with several antiadhesion therapies (e. g. insertion of an intrauterine device (IUD) or balloon, hormonal treatment, barrier gels or human amniotic membrane grafting) to decrease intrauterine adhesions (IUAs). Objectives: To assess {{the effectiveness of}} anti-adhesion therapies versus placebo, no treatment or any other anti-adhesion therapy following operative hysteroscopy for treatment of female subfertility. Search methods: We searched the following databases from inception to March 2015 : the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and AlliedHealth Literature (CINAHL) and other electronic sources of trials, including trial registers, sources of unpublished literature and reference lists. We handsearched The Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology, and we contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria: Randomised comparisons of anti-adhesion therapies versus placebo, no treatment or any other anti-adhesion therapy following operative hysteroscopy in subfertile women. The primary outcome was live birth or ongoing pregnancy. Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, miscarriage and IUAs present at second look, along with their mean adhesion scores or severity.

40|$|Background: In {{clinical}} practice a diagnosis {{is based on}} a combination of clinical history, physical examination and additional diagnostic tests. At present, studies on diagnostic research often report the accuracy of tests without taking into account the information already known from history and examination. Due to this lack of information, together with variations in design and quality of studies, conventional meta-analyses based on these studies will not show the accuracy of the tests in real practice. By using individual patient data (IPD) to perform meta-analyses, the accuracy of tests can be assessed in relation to other patient characteristics and allows the development or evaluation of diagnostic algorithms for individual patients. In this study we will examine these potential benefits in four clinical diagnostic problems in the field of gynaecology, obstetrics and reproductive medicine. Methods/design: Based on earlier systematic reviews {{for each of the four}} clinical problems, studies are considered for inclusion. The first authors of the included studies will be invited to participate and share their original data. After assessment of validity and completeness the acquired datasets are merged. Based on these data, a series of analyses will be performed, including a systematic comparison of the results of the IPD meta-analysis with those of a conventional meta-analysis, development of multivariable models for clinical history alone and for the combination of history, physical examination and relevant diagnostic tests and development of clinical prediction rules for the individual patients. These will be made accessible for clinicians. Discussion: The use of IPD meta-analysis will allow evaluating accuracy of diagnostic tests in relation to other relevant information. Ultimately, this could increase the efficiency of the diagnostic work-up, e. g. by reducing the need for invasive tests and/or improving the accuracy of the diagnostic workup. This study will assess whether these benefits of IPD meta-analysis over conventional meta-analysis can be exploited and will provide a framework for future IPD meta-analyses in diagnostic and prognostic research.

40|$|BACKGROUND We {{recently}} reported that treatment with intrauterine insemination and controlled ovarian stimulation (IUI-COS) {{did not increase}} ongoing pregnancy rates compared with expectant management (EM) in couples with unexplained subfertility and intermediate prognosis of natural conception. Long-term cost-effectiveness of a policy of initial EM is unknown. We investigated whether the recommendation not to treat during the first 6 months is valid, regarding the long-term effectiveness and cumulative costs. METHODS Couples with unexplained subfertility and intermediate prognosis of natural conception (n= 253, at 26 public clinics, the Netherlands) were randomly allocated to 6 months EM or immediate start with IUI-COS. The couples were then treated according to local protocol, usually IUI-COS followed by IVF. We followed couples until 3 years after randomization and registered pregnancies and resources used. Primary outcome was time to ongoing pregnancy. Secondary outcome was treatment costs. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. Economic evaluation was performed {{from the perspective of}} the health care institution. RESULTS Time to ongoing pregnancy did not differ between groups (log-rank test P= 0. 98). Cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates were 72 – 73 % for EM and IUI-COS groups, respectively [relative risk 0. 99 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 85 – 1. 1) ]. Estimated mean costs per couple were € 3424 (95 % CI € 880 –€ 5968) in the EM group and € 6040 (95 % CI € 4055 –€ 8125) in the IUI-COS group resulting in an estimated saving of € 2616 per couple (95 % CI € 385 –€ 4847) in favour of EM. CONCLUSIONS In couples with unexplained subfertility and an intermediate prognosis of natural conception, initial EM for 6 months results in a considerable cost-saving with no delay in achieving pregnancy or jeopardizing the chance of pregnancy. Further comparisons between aggressive and milder forms of ovarian stimulation should be performed. Inge M. Custers, Minouche M. E. van Rumste, Jan Willem van der Steeg, Madelon van Wely, Peter G. A.
