5|$|More than 600 wing {{members were}} mobilized for Operation Noble Eagle, and the wing began flying around-the-clock combat air patrol {{missions}} immediately thereafter. This continued until February 2002. On 22 December 2001 the wing escorted American Airlines Flight 63 {{as a direct}} result of Richard Reid trying to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> a plane.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Brockman's report, {{everyone}} in Springfield shows their community spirit by giving them a new Christmas tree and $15,000. With the donations, Homer buys a new car. Driving it home, Homer gets stuck behind the Plow King and impatiently passes it. He unknowingly drives the car onto a frozen lake. The ice cracks, causing the car to sink and <b>blow</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E

5|$|Departure from Beirut {{was delayed}} by about one hour. Originally {{scheduled}} to depart at 05:45, take-off took place only at 06:01. Less than 15 minutes later, two Arab passengers threatened to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the aircraft using explosives {{that had been}} hidden in the first class cabin (and which likely had been smuggled there in Damascus) if the members of Black September were not released from the German prison.|$|E
5|$|Everyone sits in silence, {{waiting for}} Parsons's manager to arrive. Jan {{suggests}} that Graham <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> another balloon for Tamsin. Sally, Si and Graham realise that, {{with the camera}} footage they have, they can <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> all the purple balloons and sell them to multiple bidders. Jan screams when she sees movement in Tamsin's bedroom, and it is realised that Frankie is still alive. Jan takes Tamsin {{out of the room}} and the remaining three agree, after panicked discussion, that they should kill Frankie. Si loses a coin toss and smothers Frankie with a cushion. Later, out on the street, Frankie's body is put into an ambulance. Si says to Sally and Graham that he will be in touch and leaves. Sally and Graham discuss selling the camcorder footage, and Jan runs inside to see that Tamsin is not in her chair or room. Upstairs, Tamsin crawls onto the bed containing the balloon, carrying a heart-shaped helium balloon. On the street, Sally, Graham and Jan see Tamsin opening the upstairs window. She releases the helium balloon with the balloon containing Frankie's breath attached. The two float skyward as Graham films.|$|E
5|$|Smith and Seguin {{confirmed}} {{the fate of}} the mission upon their return. Houston dispatched orders to Fannin to abandon Goliad, <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the Presidio La Bahía fortress, and retreat to Victoria, but Fannin delayed acting on those orders. Believing the approach of Urrea's troops brought a greater urgency to local civilians, he sent 29 men under Captain Amon B. King to help evacuate nearby Refugio.|$|E

5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite can <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the highest bidder. Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to files}} {{recovered}} by Fisher in London (and made public by the president), the American public and Congress both believe that Iran is funding the Blacklist, and The United States and Iran are headed towards war. Looking for more solid proof of Iran's involvement, Fisher infiltrates Quds Force headquarters in Tehran(previously a U.S embassy). Inside, he discovers that Iran {{has nothing to}} do with the Blacklist, and that the files he recovered were planted by The Engineers in order to lure The United States into a war. Fisher narrowly escapes Tehran by using a Predator Drone to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the Iranian vehicles chasing him, causing an international incident.|$|E

5|$|For {{their next}} mission, {{the party is}} sent to the city of Bafsk to prevent the {{construction}} of a large airship known as the Dreadnought; however, it takes off just as they arrive. After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon which can <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the Dreadnought, they watch helplessly as an airship with Hilda on board is captured by the Dreadnought. When the Dreadnought lands to stock up on supplies, the party rescues Hilda and throws the Sunfire into the airship's engine. Before escaping from the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight whom Maria thinks she recognizes as Leon.|$|E

Ayane has a threefold stake in this plot: she wants revenge for Raidou being changed into a monster, for Hayate being brainwashed {{in their attempt to}} realize Project Epsilon, and for the manipulation and death of Genra. At the end of the game, Ayane uses her ninpo ("ninja arts") spell to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the DOATEC Tri-Tower.|$|E
5|$|In February 1973 Abu Daoud {{was arrested}} in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein's life. This led to Abu Nidal's first operation, using the name Al-Iqab ("the Punishment"); on 5 September 1973 five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris, took 15 hostages and {{threatened}} to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the building if Abu Daoud was not released. The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight, still holding five hostages, then to Riyadh, threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft. They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September. Abu Daoud {{was released from prison}} two weeks later; Seale writes that the Kuwaiti government paid King Hussein $12 million for his release.|$|E

5|$|In July 2012, a Lebanese man was {{detained}} by Cyprus police on possible charges relating to terrorism laws for planning attacks against Israeli tourists. According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted about the man due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying {{back and forth from}} Cyprus, and planned to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> a plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E

Tess wants Lex found, until Lex is revealed to have a surgically-implanted nano-transmitter in Tess's optic nerve. Wanting revenge, Lex uses a kryptonite bomb to have Lana's stolen bio-enhanced suit, designed to absorb and emit kryptonite radiation, absorb the radiation to de-activate the bomb and subsequently {{never be able to}} go near Clark again without fatal effects. Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) discovers Lex's location and uses a bomb to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> Lex's travelling medical transport, seemingly killing him.|$|E

5|$|The Commandos {{were divided}} into three groups: One and Two would travel in the MLs, while Three would be in Campbeltown. Under the command of Captain Hodgeson, Group One had the {{objectives}} of securing the Old Mole and eliminating the anti-aircraft gun positions around the southern quays. They were then {{to move into the}} old town and <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the power station, bridges and locks for the new entrance into the basin from the Avant port. The capture of the mole was a major objective, as it was to be the embarkation point for the evacuation after the mission.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{ultimately}} decided when {{the rising tide}} lifted Rhett's sloops free while temporarily leaving the Royal James stranded. Bonnet was left helpless, watching while the enemy vessels repaired their rigging and closed to board his paralysed vessel. Outnumbered almost three to one, Bonnet's men would have had little hope of winning a boarding action. Bonnet ordered his gunner, George Ross, to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> the Royal James's powder magazine. Ross apparently attempted this, but was overruled by {{the remainder of the}} crew, who surrendered. Rhett arrested the pirates and returned to Charles Town with his prisoners on 3October.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} way to purify uranium oxide in a laboratory was {{to take advantage of the}} fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which had experience with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure uranium oxide was produced.|$|E
