40|$|In {{aircraft}} engines, {{especially in}} turbomachinery components, {{large part of}} the flow along the surface is laminar or transitional. The boundary layer development, losses, efficiency and heat transfer are greatly affected by the location and extend of the laminar-to-turbulent transition. The accurate prediction of the transition process is necessary for the design of efficient and reliable machines. The accuracy of current models to predict the transition location and extend is limited. In the present work curvature effects are implemented in a flow solver developed at Stanford University in order to improve predictions of turbulent transition over a gas turbine <b>blade.</b> <b>Energy</b> TechnologyProcess and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|An initial {{feasibility}} study (Pilisi and Whitney, 2011) of drilling through the Mohorovičić discontinuity (Moho) into the oceanic mantle specifically focused on future requirements for planning, drilling and coring a hole 500 m into the oceanic mantle from three candidate {{locations in the}} Pacific Ocean (Cocos Plate, Baja California, and offshore Hawaii). The study points {{out some of the}} critical issues that need to be resolved before embarking upon such a challengingproject. It was conducted on the basis of data provided by the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program–Management International (IODP-MI), the Center for Deep Earth Exploration (CDEX) operating the drilling vessel Chikyu within IODP, public domain information, and past experience that <b>Blade</b> <b>Energy</b> Partners (hereafter mentioned as “Blade”; [URL] has had with frontier projects in the offshore deepwater oil and gas and geothermal industries...|$|E

40|$|Two {{classes of}} fan blade {{fragments}} were considered {{in an analysis}} of <b>blade</b> fragment <b>energy.</b> The first, of relatively small size (. 15 pound) and energy, tends to rebound from the fan and case when liberated in an FOD encounter. These small fragments have relatively low secondary damage potential and are less demanding in terms of protection. The larger fan blade fragments are ejected in a more direct release trajectory with higher energy and hence can represent a higher potential hazard. Simplified analytical methods were used to describe <b>blade</b> fragment <b>energy</b> transfer kinematics, establish fragment energy levels, evaluate damage potential and configure protection. The approach, methodology, and application are discussed as a possible building block for other applications. Development of effective local protection using Kevlar is also discussed. Analysis methods developed and applied to the rebound fragment problem and to the large direct release fragment problem are described...|$|R

40|$|The rub {{mechanics}} of aircraft {{gas turbine engine}} compressor abradable blade tip seals was studied at simulated engine conditions. In 12 statistically planned, instrumented rub tests using single titanium blades and fiber-metal rubstrips the rub velocity, incursion rate, incursion depth, blade thickness, and abradable strength were varied {{to determine the effects}} on rub energy, heat split between the blade, rubstrip surface and rub debris, and blade and seal wear. The rub energies were found to be most significantly affected by the incursion rate while rub velocity and blade thickness were of secondary importance. In five additional rub tests using single nickel alloy blades and multiple titanium alloy <b>blades,</b> rub <b>energy</b> and wear effects were found to be similar for titanium and nickel alloy <b>blades</b> while rub <b>energies</b> increased for multiple blades relative to single blade test results...|$|R

50|$|In {{its most}} {{prominent}} showing, the lightsaber's <b>energy</b> <b>blade</b> can cut, burn, and melt through most substances with little resistance. It leaves cauterized wounds in flesh, {{but can be}} deflected by another lightsaber <b>blade,</b> or by <b>energy</b> shields. The <b>blade</b> has even {{been used as a}} tool to weld metal substances. Other times, the lightsaber has been shown to cause bleeding wounds in the flesh, sometimes accompanied by burns. Some exotic saber-proof materials have been introduced in the Expanded Universe. An active lightsaber gives off a distinctive hum, which rises in pitch and volume as the blade is moved rapidly through the air. Bringing the blade into contact with another lightsaber's blade produces a loud crackle.|$|R

50|$|Writer Warren Ellis, who {{was known}} for his dark, cynical style, revamped three books, (X-Force, Generation X, and X-Man), as part of the Revolution revamp of the X-Men series of titles in 2000. Ellis' stint on X-Force, co-written by Ian Edginton and {{illustrated}} by Whilce Portacio, saw Bedlam, Cannonball, Meltdown, and Warpath become a covert ops superhero team under the leadership of Pete Wisdom, a British mutant and former intelligence agent who could shoot burning <b>blades</b> of <b>energy</b> from his fingers.

50|$|Inward flow water {{turbines}} have {{a better}} mechanical arrangement and all modern reaction water turbines are of this design. As the water swirls inward, it accelerates, and transfers energy to the runner. Water pressure decreases to atmospheric, {{or in some cases}} subatmospheric, as the water passes through the turbine <b>blades</b> and loses <b>energy.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like his father, Uriel has {{two sets}} of back mounted metal wings that can {{generate}} and fire razor sharp <b>blades</b> of <b>energy.</b> He can bend space and time within a certain radius, create a pocket dimension of accelerated years and release waves of artificial time to instantly kill victims. These latter powers {{are not related to}} his mutation but of unknown origin, although presumably given by Kang. Uriel wields in battle the mystic axe Jarnbjorn, Thor's old weapon. Uriel seemingly died in Uncanny Avengers #16 but was revealed to have changed the timeline so that he survived.|$|R
50|$|When {{airspeed}} is low, {{the mass}} of the air flowing through the propeller disk (thrust) causes a significant amount of tangential or rotational air flow to be created by the spinning <b>blades.</b> The <b>energy</b> of this tangential air flow is wasted in a single-propeller design. To use this wasted effort the placement of a second propeller behind the first takes advantage of the disturbed airflow. The tangential air flow also causes handling problems at low speed as the air strikes the vertical stabilizer, causing the aircraft to yaw left or right, depending on the direction of propeller rotation.|$|R

50|$|Anphans: The Next's {{original}} form, {{which is}} an analogous to Ultraman Type A and Nexus' Anphans. Because of his incomplete merging, The Next is only 10 meters tall, which was enough to face The One in Reputiria stage.

50|$|Miss Steed {{possesses}} {{the ability to}} create <b>blades</b> of psionic <b>energy</b> that attack and disable a person's brain and mind. These blades seem to appear from the area around her head, and although visible, are not corporeal weapons. They destroy both the physical portions of a brain, and psionic forms (including the Shadow King's astral form) on contact. This ability has been referred to as psionic skinning.|$|R
50|$|The {{photonic}} skins {{developed in}} PHOSFOS have potential applications in continuously monitoring {{the integrity and}} the behavior {{of different kinds of}} structures in e.g. civil engineering (buildings, dams, bridges, roads, tunnels and mines), in aerospace (aircraft wings, helicopter <b>blades)</b> or in <b>energy</b> production (windmill <b>blades)</b> and therefore provide the necessary means for remote early failure, anomaly or danger warning. Applications in healthcare are also being investigated.|$|R
