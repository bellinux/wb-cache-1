6000|$|LATTER. I don't in {{the least}} want to destroy {{the balance of the}} scene, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be clear about the spirit. What is the spirit? ...|$|E
6000|$|Louis sighed, and {{presently}} added, smiling, 'I am {{not going}} to rave about preferences for another; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know whether anything can be done for poor Jem Frost.' ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. G. (Turning over {{contents}} of table.) I know you'll hate me for this; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see what {{your work is}} like. (A pause.) Pip, what are 'farcy-buds'? ...|$|E
60|$|DICK. I {{would n't}} ask her to promise, {{it would n't be}} fair when she 's so young, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> her to know that I shall never change.|$|R
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD. I DON'T {{want to be}} kissed; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> you {{to behave}} {{properly}} and decently. We are sisters. We have been separated for twenty-three years. You OUGHT to kiss me.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only {{you said}} more than you meant, Japs. If it {{relieves}} your mind, it hurts other people. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> the note taken, so go and come back {{in time for the}} sports; which I don't think you will find much damaged.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no, I can't speak; I {{have none}} {{of that sort of}} talent. I have no self-possession, no eloquence; I can't put three words together. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> contribute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mammy, {{how good}} you be! It don't seem as if I ought to take it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go!" [...] cried Eli, {{catching}} her round the neck in an ecstasy of boyish delight and gratitude.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not immediately, at any rate, dear Jane. It is {{very kind}} in you to wish {{to take her}} off our hands, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> try her a little longer. I thought {{she seemed to be}} {{softening}} last night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir! It seems a {{great deal}} for such a small job. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> it very much. May I tell you how I'd like to spend it, father?" [...] cried Abby, beaming with the sweet delight of helping others.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I don't {{want you}} to eavesdrop, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> you {{to find out about}} them. And about Mr. Burnamy, too. I can wait, about the others, or manage for myself, but these are driving me to distraction. Now, will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll admit Marky is {{a perfect}} little devil. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> you to observe that she's been brave enough to eat part of her sandwich. Let's go. Where is the nice smiling little man? Let's pay our bill and go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be {{thoroughly}} well educated. I {{meant to go}} through them all, like Gillian and Mysie, and I am sure father must wish it too. I know he meant it when he went out last year.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Spencer Brydon {{recognised}} it--it {{was in fact}} what he {{had absolutely}} professed. Yet he importantly qualified. [...] "He isn't myself. He's the just so totally other person. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see him," [...] he added. [...] "And I can. And I shall." ...|$|E
6000|$|She stared hard at her finger-nails. [...] "It is hard {{to express}} one's self, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be honest with you. When I promised to marry you I thought I could; I {{thought it was a}} {{possible}} arrangement. I did think it could be done. I admired your chivalry. I was grateful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> a quart measure," [...] said Mattie, in her sweet, {{unchanged}} voice, [...] "but all in good time. You {{must stay}} and have tea with me, Jed. I'm all alone now--Mother and Father have gone. Unhitch your horse {{and put him}} in the third stall in the stable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{coming to}} that, M. le Comte," [...] replied the préfet. [...] "It will explain the reason of my {{disturbing}} {{you at this}} hour, when I was coming anyhow to partake of your gracious hospitality later on. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> your assistance, M. le Comte, as the matter of which I wish {{to speak with you}} concerns the King himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "P'r'aps if we sew ever so many flannel shirts {{we may be}} rich by-and-by. I {{should give}} mother a new bonnet first of all, for I heard Miss Kent say no lady would wear such a shabby one. Mrs. Smith said fine bonnets didn't make real ladies. I like her best, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> a locket like Miss Kent's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I don't {{think the}} little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, {{and the army}} wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect {{anything}} from Mother or you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I've wanted it so long," [...] said Jo, who was a bookworm.|$|E
6000|$|... “Thank you, father; I {{know very}} well that in {{studying}} with you I have learned a lot more than I should have done if I had gone to sea two years ago; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be working and earning something, instead of being an expense to you, and, as you know, I would prefer the sea to anything else.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well done, Dimchurch! Now we {{have her}} at our mercy. We will sail {{backwards}} and forwards under her stern and rake her with grape. I don’t want to injure {{her more than}} is necessary, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> kill {{as many of the}} crew as possible; it is better for them to die that way than to be taken to Jamaica to be hanged.” ...|$|E
5000|$|By 2000 {{they had}} taken on a new bassist, Sam Powers, and {{released}} their third full-length album, In the Valley of Dying Stars, as produced by long-time friend Nick Raskulinecz with help from Don Coffey Jr, who was beginning to show a keen interest in life {{on the other side of}} the glass. In the Valley of Dying Stars is by far the most emotional and raw of all of their albums; and, musically, in stark contrast to Head Trips diverse instrumentation, Dying Stars kept to the standard rock format: guitar, drums, bass. The emotional core of Dying Stars emanates from the death of Daviss grandfather (his namesake), to whom John had been very close and had admired dearly. Davis feelings on the record industry also emerged in songs such as [...] "Keep it Close to Me:" [...] "I want rock and roll, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> to deal with the hassle. I know what <b>I</b> know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>dont</b> <b>want</b> to feel like an asshole." ...|$|R
60|$|CLEOPATRA. Then I {{consent to}} stay, because <b>I</b> am asked. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>want</b> to, mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have and}} I will again," [...] Hamel declared. [...] "To-morrow morning I leave this house, <b>but</b> before <b>I</b> go I mean {{to have the}} affair of this man Dunster cleared up. Your uncle will be very angry with me, without a doubt. <b>I</b> don't care. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> you to trust me, if you will, and your sister. I should like to be your friend." ...|$|R
60|$|There is a {{woman in}} the state of Nevada to whom I once lied continuously, consistently, and shamelessly, for the matter of a couple of hours. I don't want to {{apologize}} to her. Far be it from me. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> explain. Unfortunately, I do not know her name, much less her present address. If her eyes should chance upon these lines, I hope she will write to me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{know very}} well, Rachel, that I believe as you believe. I am not {{thinking}} of the abolition of woman. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> abolish--the heroine, the sexual heroine. I want to abolish the woman whose support is jealousy and whose gift possession. I want to abolish the woman who can be won as a prize or locked up as a delicious treasure. And away down there the heroine flares like a divinity.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't want {{to break}} my promise. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do what's right; and I {{want to do what}} I think is right. I'm almost sick. I want Elbridge should stop for the doctor on his way to Mr. Putney's." [...] She broke into a convulsive sobbing. [...] "Oh, Suzette! Do give me a little more time! Won't you? And as soon as I can see it as you do--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wanted no}} telling as to that; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> telling as to your mode of life, and I {{have had it}} now. You had better not press me. You had better see Mr. Boltby. He {{will tell you what}} I am willing to do for you upon {{receiving}} your written assurance that you will never renew your offer of marriage to Miss Hotspur." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{taken care}} of myself for three years without any of my money. I guess. I {{can take care of}} myself along with some of my money here in San Francisco. I don't care to handle my {{business}} affairs yet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> a bank account, a respectable-sized one. I want to spend it as I see fit, for what I see fit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't think," [...] she said, [...] "that I am forgetting {{my promise}} to be content with what you have told me about myself. I am not so ungrateful as that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want,</b> before <b>I</b> consent to be Philip's wife, to feel sure that I am not quite unworthy of him. Is it because I am of mean birth that you told me I was Mr. Gracedieu's adopted child--and told me no more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know it is}} foolish, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be {{a regular}} {{butterfly}} {{for a little while}} and see what it is like. You know I couldn't help seeing a good deal of fashionable life abroad, though we were not in it, and here at home the girls tell me about all sorts of pleasant things that are to happen this winter, so if you won't despise me very much, I should like to try it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} may. You can {{find your way}} to her confidence, {{if you choose to}} try; she will trust you, when she won't trust her father. I don't care two straws about her other secrets; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know whether she is, or is not, {{plotting}} to marry the Irish blackguard. Satisfy me about that, and you needn't tell me anything more. May I count on you to find out how the land lies?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{never forget}} you, papa; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do {{something}} beautiful {{that you may}} be proud of me by and by. Mamma often tells me to stop; but when we get in here we forget there is any world outside, we are so busy and so happy. Now I'll go and run and sing, and be a girl to please you.' And throwing away the apron, Bess vanished from the room, seeming to take all the light with her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did," [...] said Aunt Beatrice weakly. Margaret's sudden attack fairly startled {{the truth}} out of her. [...] "It is very silly of me, <b>I</b> know, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> to go. <b>I</b> didn't care {{about a new}} dress. I'd have been quite willing to wear my grey silk, and I could have fixed the sleeves. What {{difference}} would it have made? Nobody would ever have noticed me, but Bella thought it wouldn't do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It needn't mean {{anything}} at all, dear," [...] he replied. [...] "This {{is only the}} beginning. I don't expect you to realise all that I have realised quite so quickly, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> you {{to keep it in}} your mind that this thing has come and that it can't be got rid of. <b>I</b> won't <b>do</b> anything foolish. If it is necessary <b>I</b> will wait, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am your lover now, as I always must be." ...|$|R
6000|$|As the old roan jogged {{away from}} the doctor's house, Miss Panney remarked to her companion, [...] "I needn't have hurried you off so soon, Dora, for it is three hours before the next mail will leave; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> Mrs. Tolbridge {{to sit down at}} once and write that letter without being {{interrupted}} by anything which you might have come to tell her. Of course, the sooner you send her the address, the better." ...|$|R
