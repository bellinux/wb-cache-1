40|$|In Italy, {{the value}} of {{bioeconomy}} is 251 billion € and more than 1. 7 million of workforce is employed in this sector. The forest-wood chain cover about 15 % of total value of bioeconomy. The consultation draft of Italian <b>Bioeconomy</b> <b>Strategy</b> was presented on November 22, 2016. This document identifies three macro-sectors (agrifood, marine bioeconomy, forestry and biobased industry) with the respective objectives and priorities. In addition, some Italian regions are organizing to devise a regional strategy detailing the key points of the EU <b>Bioeconomy</b> <b>Strategy</b> and Italian <b>Bioeconomy</b> <b>Strategy</b> in accordance with local peculiarities. In order to develop a regional strategy for the forest sector {{it is important to}} investigate the social demands and needs involving the local stakeholders. The aim of the study is to investigate the stakeholders’ opinions of Calabria Region (Italy) about the priorities of forest-wood chain to include in the future regional <b>bioeconomy</b> <b>strategy.</b> The stakeholders’ opinions were collected through the face-to-face administration of a structured questionnaire to 99 local stakeholders. The respondents assessed the importance of a set of objectives aimed to enhance the forest-wood chain at local level (economic exploitation of wood products; diffusion of forest certification; orientation of production to market demand; coordination of forest-wood-energy chain’s actors; implementation of environmental and cultural forest values; improvement of the level of mechanization in wood processing; improvement of the efficiency of forestry workers). In addition, the respondents assessed the capacity of some specific activities to achieve the above mentioned objectives. The collected data were used to define two strategies aimed to enhance the forest-wood chain in Calabria Region. The results show that for the interviewed stakeholders the main three objectives are: the implementation of environmental and cultural forest values, the improvement of the efficiency of forestry workers, and the diffusion of forest certification. In addition, the stakeholders highlighted the importance of the activities of environmental education for the citizens and the professional training courses for the forest operators. Finally, the diffusion of forest certification is a key issue for the interviewed stakeholders. This issue can be achieved facilitating the access of the certified products to the market and creating a chain-of-custody system for the wood products...|$|E

This paper presents a systematic and comparative analysis of official <b>bioeconomy</b> <b>strategies</b> of the EU, Germany, OECD, Sweden and the USA {{with regard to}} their context, visions and guiding implementation principles. In an additional step, the relationship between these strategies and important scientific and societal debates around bioeconomy is assessed. In conclusion, five major stumbling blocks for the further development of the bioeconomy are worked out. First, there is the risk of disappointment because far-reaching promises of the strategies are difficult to achieve. Second, the bioeconomy {{is not the only way}} to a low carbon economy so alternatives could impede the desired development. Third, persistent conflicts between the different uses of biomass for food, material and energy production could lead to unstable policy support with short-term shifts. Fourth, a broader success of new bioeconomy value chains could trigger new societal conflicts over bioeconomy if efficiency gains, cascading use, residue use and sustainability certification are not sufficient to ensure a sustainable supply of biomass. Fifth, the acceptance of bioeconomy could be compromised if bioeconomy policies continue to ignore the on-going societal debates on agriculture and food...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{bioeconomy}} {{has been}} embraced by many governments {{around the world}} as a way of responding to the grand challenge of climate change, it remains unclear what the bioeconomy is and how it can contribute to achieving these broad policy objectives. The aim {{of this paper is to}} improve our understanding of whether, and how, the bioeconomy includes contending rationales for governance and policy-making. In order to do this, we apply a typology of three bioeconomy visions onto the policy discourse on the bioeconomy. These visions are (1) a bio-technology vision; (2) a bio-resource vision; and (3) a bio-ecology vision. Based on a discourse analysis of 41 submissions to a public hearing on the development of a <b>bioeconomy</b> <b>strategy</b> in Norway, the paper explores the actors involved in shaping the new bioeconomy and analyses their positions on this emerging field. The paper finds that it is possible to categorise the consultative inputs into these three visions, and also that the bio-resource vision is predominant, which reflects the structure of the national economy. Moreover, the paper reflects upon how the contending visions observed imply negotiations and power struggles, which may hamper directionality in the current socio-technical transition...|$|E

40|$|The Forward-Looking Analysis {{portion of}} the AERTOs Bio-Based Economy project seeks to develop contextual, {{exploratory}} analysis that helps the participating research institutes better evaluate their <b>bioeconomy</b> <b>strategies.</b> The analysis takes a 15 - 20 year perspective and focuses {{on the level of}} the bioeconomy, rather than on specific technologies or biorefinery concepts. The analysis contends that RTOs and their industrial partners should consider the uncertainties of the future bioeconomy at different levels – The World and Sustainability, Europe and the Bioeconomy, and the RTOs and Industry – and through the lenses of three alternative logics. The logic of environmental sustainability pushes the bioeconomy and its component technologies in the direction of large scale, efficiently incentivized substitution of fossil-based emissions through bio-based alternatives, benefiting biofuel production and creating opportunities for RTOs to take a leadership role in their work to make industrial bioeconomy more sustainable. The logic of competitive innovation pushes countries and companies to search for defensible advantages in the bioeconomy. The scale of fossil substitution is smaller but the margins for successful companies are higher, and advanced bio-based materials and chemicals are a dynamic sector for investment. The RTOs have a smaller role and work increasingly on product performance issues. The logic of resource utilization sees countries and companies working to maximize the value of existing assets, particularly natural biomass endowments. The bioeconomy is driven primarily through national strategies and the Forest Biorefinery creates national champions in the Nordics. RTOs have a stable workflow and focus on increasing the efficiency of biorefinery systems. Uncertainties related to the quantitative boundaries of the future bioeconomy can be assessed through a review of scenario literature on biomass availability, biofuels and bio-based chemicals production. There is a wide range of estimates available, but central estimates suggest that potential supply of sustainable biomass to industry could exceed demand by 70 % in the long-term. Pressures created by changes at the margin of markets and through regional variations may nonetheless make realizing this potential difficult. Pathways applying the logic of environmental sustainability, {{to the extent that it}} generates common standards, will likely reduce supply-side risks. Because the transition to a bio-based economy will occur stepwise, accusations of ‘greenwashing’ may plague early bio-based products and strategies if they are not fully-fossil free or certified sustainable. Nonetheless these first attempts may also generate positive awareness and will need to continue in interplay with the development of standards and certifications. Pathways applying the logic of competitive innovation are likely to be those that create incentives for greenwashing and reputational risks to the bioeconomy. Uncertainties about feedstocks and technology costs have made feedstock flexibility a topic of interest in biorefinery development. Here, too, multiple concepts exist, from modular concepts that are truly feedstock agnostic to robust concepts designed to handle heterogeneity within a narrower feedstock basis. Once again the logical pathway applied will be likely to influence the approach to feedstock flexibility...|$|R

In recent years, governments, businesses and scientists have realized that the waste of resources has become {{the biggest threat to}} our planet, and taken concerted efforts to counteract this problem including environmental protection and environmental resources management. Scottish governments have urged businesses, farmers and manufacturers in Scotland to adopt a “one planet prosperity” policy designed to cut their energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, waste and resource use. Scottish leaders have regarded sustainable growth as the core objective of its regulatory strategy, and defined their statutory purpose as delivering environmental protection and improvement in ways which also create health and wellbeing benefits and sustainable economic growth. In the business world, UPM is one of the responsible companies which lead in sustainable solutions to the biggest threat to planet. UPM is a Finnish forest industry company. The production of UPM is based on renewable raw-materials which are biodegradable and recyclable. Recently, UPM has created the term “Biofore” to describe new forest industry. “Bio” stands for sustainable solutions and environmental performance. “Fore” stands for forest and the company’s position {{at the forefront of the}} development. UPM provides sustainable and safe solutions to the growing global consumption demand, and offers alternatives to replace non-renewable fossil-based materials. We understand from its vision, purpose and strategy the efforts that UPM has made in creating a sustainable society.

40|$|Driven by {{the growing}} {{awareness}} of the finite nature of fossil raw materials {{and the need for}} sustainable pathways of industrial production, the bio-based economy is expected to expand worldwide. Policy strategies such as the European Union <b>Bioeconomy</b> <b>Strategy</b> and national bioeconomy strategies foster this process. Besides the advantages promised by a transition towards a sustainable bioeconomy, these processes have to cope with significant uncertainties as many influencing factors play a role, such as climate change, technological and economic development, sustainability risks, dynamic consumption patterns and policy and governance issues.

40|$|A growing {{political}} {{interest in}} the development of biorefineries is being shaped by climate change and a need to develop economically viable substitutes (i. e., fuels, products and chemicals) to those produced in traditional oil refineries. The pulp and paper industry in Sweden has been stagnating and it is therefore potentially promising to integrate biorefining into its activities as one way of diversifying its business. Sweden has good prerequisites for a transition to a bioeconomy due to its natural geographic conditions, industry, and infrastructure. It has developed a <b>bioeconomy</b> <b>strategy</b> and piloted several biorefinery projects.

40|$|In 2012, the European Commission (EC) {{launched}} the <b>Bioeconomy</b> <b>Strategy</b> and Action Plan {{with the objective}} of establishing a resource efficient and competitive society that reconciles food security with the sustainable use of renewable resources. This report contributes to the plan by evaluating the macroeconomic impacts of bio-based applications in the EU. Such effects can only be evaluated with a computable general equilibrium model such as MAGNET. Four bio-based applications are considered, namely biofuel (second generation), biochemicals, bioelectricity, and biogas (synthetic natural gas). This is done assuming that 1 EJ lignocellulose biomass is converted into fuel, chemicals, electricity and gas and that the final product replaces an equal amount of conventional (e. g. fossil energy) product (on energy basis). The results show that given the assumed efficiency of conversion technology, costs of conversion, biomass price and oil price, the production of second generation biofuel and biochemicals are the only competitive sectors compare to their conventional counterparts in the year 2030 for the EU. In the case of the fuel sectors, it represents a net GDP effect of 5. 1 billion US dollars while biochemicals generates 6 billion US dollars. A substantial part of this impact {{can be explained by the}} increase in wages, since the production of biomass is relatively labour intensive.

In this regard, composting {{is a very}} strategic way to break down environmental impacts associated with manure management. This study was aimed at assessing the production sustainability of one ton of compost from dairy cattle/buffalo manure in two on-farm facilities operating in Southern Italy and using different bulking agents (wood chip from Short Rotation Forestry, straw and pruning residues). A combined assessment approach was used in 2013 to investigate all the aspects of the composting processes studied, to identify strengths and weaknesses and then optimize the operative steps. Particularly, Life Cycle Assessment, Energy Analysis and Life Cycle Costing were used to calculate environmental impacts, the involved energy {{and the cost of}} the production of 1 ton of compost, respectively, and to compare the various composting scenarios. Regardless of the type of composting scenarios, one ton of on-farm compost caused essentially ecotoxicity potential and abiotic depletion and its cost ranged from 10 to 31 euro. Compost production required from 233 to 756 MJ of energy. Particularly, the lesser impacts and the lesser energy and cost requirements occurred when maize straw or pruning residues were used as bulking agents. The proposed study, which linked together the three above mentioned methodologies, is unusual within the available literature on dairy cattle/buffalo manure composting. This combined approach allowed to define a complete landscape of sustainable possibilities in managing organic residues (especially manure) at the farm level giving useful information to promote the diffusion of these low technology composting processes and the agronomic use of compost thus obtained.

40|$|Launched in 2012, the <b>Bioeconomy</b> <b>Strategy</b> of the European Commission aims at {{developing}} {{the production and}} use of biomass within the European Union as a strategy to limit the consumption of fossil carbon while fostering jobs and growth. The quantification of biomass flows and their timely reporting are crucial for the monitoring of such strategy. In this framework, the present study focuses on the quantification of primary agricultural residues in the European Union as a promising feedstock for the bio-based and bioenergy sectors. Harvest indices or residue-to-product ratios (RPRs), determined at crop level, usually enter the computation of primary agricultural residues. Comparing four different functional forms of RPRs in function {{of the level of}} crop yield, we show that exponential forms better simulate the production of crop residues for high levels of annual crop yields. We then complement the RPRs reported in the scientific literature with twenty two exponential forms of RPRs and four fixed RPRs for commodities (or group of commodities) not reported so far. Finally, we estimate that 395 million tonnes of dry matter (Tdm) of primary agricultural residues are produced in Europe in 2013 from more than 130 crop commodities. Out of them, 297 million Tdm should remain in the fields for the maintenance of ecosystem services (using conservative assumptions) and 37 million tonnes are collected for agricultural uses. Hence, 62 million Tdm are collectable as feedstock for the bio-based and bioenergy sectors. They are mainly composed of cellulose (58 %) and sugar and starch (11 %). The production of primary agricultural residues is concentrated in the major cereal producing countries and stable over time. Nevertheless, a wider adoption of ad’hoc harvesting machinery, the optimisation of logistic processes and the maturation of the new bio-based value chains could help to better take advantage of the current production of agricultural residues.

40|$|To make {{a summary}} of a book that {{contains}} so many different threads is no easy task. One should, on the one hand, refer to its conceptual contribution to the paradigm of sustainable agriculture, {{and on the other}} hand, consider the conclusions drawn from the studies conducted at international, national and regional level. It is clear that changing the paradigm of agricultural development from an industrial to a sustainable one will be neither easy nor quick. Agriculture must satisfy the demand for food products while lowering the pressure on the environment, providing for technological and biological progress, meeting the need to ensure a secure supply of food, and ensuring global economic, social and environmental rationality. The discussion in this book has concentrated chiefly on the last two questions. This is because certain dimensions of environmental and social rationality have so far been poorly researched. Environmental rationality means not only protecting the natural environment and reducing the pressure placed on it by agricultural production. The authors have pointed out that the assumption of an intrinsic value of land changes the expected productivity of capital in the sectors which utilise that production factor, namely in agriculture. This has far-reaching theoretical and practical consequences. The statistical data that have been presented demonstrate that utilities are discounted in Polish land prices to a much greater degree than would result from the agricultural functions of land. A similar situation is found in other EU countries. Where does this excess value of land come from? It is undoubtedly a result of the expectations of political rents, of speculative motives, and also of non-agricultural amenities provided by land. However, it is hard to determine the proportions of these factors. Moreover, new utilities of land have the nature of public goods, which further complicates the problem of seeking a market equilibrium. Similarly, recognition of the fact of the absolute and relative deprivation of farmers in the long term changes the balance of intersectoral flows, because it means a drainage of surplus from agriculture to other branches of agribusiness. This drainage is understood as a permanent mechanism by which economic rent flows out of agriculture as a result of market imperfections, in particular the flexible prices of agricultural products. More space should be given to studies of this problem in the world literature. 135 Poznan University of Economics and Business, anna. matuszczak@ue. poznan. pl Summary: Political Rents and the European Model of Agriculture 239 The second thread of the theoretical considerations relates to the problem of whether the concept of political rent, as found in the literature, fits the processes taking place in European agriculture. A review of the literature on rent seeking suggests that these theories provide only a partial explanation of the level of political rents and lobbying actions in European agriculture. Although there is a vast theoretical literature on rent seeking and collective action at global level, there is not much empirical work done with regard to these problems relating to the Common Agricultural Policy. Particularly problematic is the question of measuring political rents in particular EU member states. It has been found that, on a global level, it is European agriculture that best meets the criteria of viability and sustainability. Viewed against the backdrop of global agriculture, it is economically effective (in the institutional conditions guaranteed by the CAP), satisfies a variety of economic and social needs, and is developing in a way that reduces the burden on the environment. In 2012, {{based on the results of}} social consultations, the European Commission published a strategy and plan of action relating to the bioeconomy in Europe. The strategy creates a cohesive framework for a comprehensive approach to the solution of complex social problems (challenges) in Europe and worldwide. The measures undertaken with respect to the bioeconomy are focused on three pillars: investment in research, innovations and skills; strengthening the impact of the policy and engagement of interested parties; and strengthening competitiveness in sectors of the bioeconomy. The <b>bioeconomy</b> <b>strategy</b> represents an important step towards solving contemporary economic and social problems. The model of the development of agriculture in the EU can thus be considered an appropriate path to be followed in relatively densely populated countries, in which food producing area per capita is small. However, does this model require institutional support and the payment of political rents? The question arises as to whether these are in fact political rents, if in return society receives a package of specified benefits, and there is a net increase in social well-being. Empirical analyses have shown that up to the mid 1980 s the level of support for agriculture in the EU (measured by the NRA indicator) was constantly increasing. The decline in support in subsequent years was maintained by payments of the decoupled type. Based on NRA values it can be concluded that nominal support in 2011 was at a level comparable to that recorded prior to the creation of an organisation of agricultural markets, that is, before 1962. This means that the CAP is distorting world prices to an ever smaller degree, and agricultural producers are losing their competitive advantages (although to differing extents). An important observation is the fact that, although the CAP applies to all member states, the level of support varies between those countries. In 2005 - 2011 it was the highest in Ireland, Slovenia, Poland, Belgium and the UK, and the lowest in Italy and Bulgaria. This observation 240 Summary: Political Rents and the European Model of Agriculture is confirmed by a second indicator constructed for the purposes of this research by the authors of Chapter 2. 3 – the Farm Receipts Gap Estimate (FRGE). Despite the fact that in principle agricultural policy has a universal application, the amount of financial support given to agricultural producers measured as a percentage of gross farm receipts is not uniform between countries, with differences as high as 17 percentage points in 2012136 (cf. Table 2. 4.). We should add that, according to the OECD, the value of the PSE for the whole of the European Union is 22. 6...|$|E
