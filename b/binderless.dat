30|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the features of}} <b>binderless</b> particleboard manufactured from sugarcane bagasse, under a high pressing temperature of 200 – 280  °C. Mechanical properties [i.e., modulus of rupture (MOR) and elasticity (MOE) in dry and wet conditions, internal bonding strength (IB)] and dimensional stability [i.e., thickness swelling (TS)] of the board were evaluated to investigate the effect of high pressing temperature. Recycled chip <b>binderless</b> particleboards were manufactured under the same conditions for comparison, and particleboards bonded with polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (PMDI) resin were manufactured as reference material. The target density was 0.8  g/cm 3 {{for all of the}} boards. The results showed that the mechanical properties and dimensional stability of both types of <b>binderless</b> boards were improved by increasing the pressing temperature. Bagasse showed better performance than that of recycled chip as a raw material in all evaluations. Bagasse <b>binderless</b> particleboard manufactured at 260  °C had an MOE value of 3.5  GPa, which was equivalent to the PMDI particleboard, and a lower TS value of 3.7  % than that of PMDI particleboard. The MOR retention ratio under the dry and wet conditions was 87.0  %, while the ratio for the PMDI particleboard was only 54.6  %. The obtained results showed the possibility of manufacturing high-durability <b>binderless</b> particleboard, with good dimensional stability and water resistance, which previously were points of weakness for <b>binderless</b> boards. Manufacturing <b>binderless</b> boards under high temperature was effective even when using particles with poor contact area, and it was possible to express acceptable properties to allow the manufacture of particleboards. Further chemical analysis indicated a contribution of a saccharide in the bagasse to the improvement of the board properties.|$|E
30|$|<b>Binderless</b> fiberboards with {{densities of}} 0.3 and 0.5 g/cm 3 were {{developed}} from kenaf core material using the conventional dry-manufacturing process. The effects of steam pressure (0.4 – 0.8 MPa) and cooking time (10 – 30 min) in the refining process, fiber moisture content (MC) (10 %, 30 %), and hot-pressing time (3 – 10 min) {{on the board}} properties were investigated. The results showed that kenaf core <b>binderless</b> fiberboards manufactured with high steam pressure and long cooking time during the refining process had high internal bond (IB) strength, low thickness swelling (TS), but low bending strength values. The <b>binderless</b> fiberboards made from 30 % MC fibers showed better mechanical and dimensional properties than those from air-dried fibers.

At a density of 0.5 g/cm 3, <b>binderless</b> fiberboard with the refining conditions of 0.8 MPa/ 20 min recorded a modulus of rupture (MOR) of 12 MPa, modulus of elasticity (MOE) of 1.7 GPa, IB of 0.43 MPa, and 12 % TS under the optimum board manufacturing conditions.|$|E

30|$|Research on <b>binderless</b> boards has {{coincided with}} the drive for agro-industrial waste {{recycling}} {{and the development of}} ecomaterials. As such, the feasibility of using various agro-industrial waste to manufacture <b>binderless</b> boards has been investigated. Lignocellulosic agro-industrial by-products, such as inter alia, kenaf core [3], oil palm biomass [4], moso bamboo [5], and rice straw [6] have been used to manufacture <b>binderless</b> boards. Although the exact determinants of the self-bonding mechanism are yet to be elucidated, the thermosetting behavior of lignin at elevated temperatures [7], polymerization of hot water extractives [8], particle size [9], and lignin–furfural resin formation [10] have been cited as possible causes of self-bonding between composite fibres.|$|E
30|$|To provide basic {{information}} on self-bonding in kenaf core <b>binderless</b> boards, {{a series of}} chemical analyses was conducted on <b>binderless</b> boards and their chemical changes during hot pressing were examined in our previous study. In this study, <b>binderless</b> boards were manufactured under conditions that may accelerate the supposed chemical changes to investigate their effect on the board properties. First, to investigate {{the influence of the}} chemical bonds formed by carbonyl compounds on self-bonding, the influence of acetic acid addition prior to board manufacturing was studied and the effect of methanol extractives (containing the carbonyl compounds) was also examined. Second, the influence of the condensation reaction in lignin was discussed from the viewpoint of board density. Last, to examine the influence of thermal softening of lignin, the influences of temperature condition and moisture content, {{as well as those of}} microwave pretreatment, were investigated. As a result, the estimated chemical changes were suggested to influence the <b>binderless</b> board properties.|$|E
30|$|The result {{showed that}} during the {{hydrothermal}} pretreatment of Eucalyptus wood, acid-catalyzed cleavage of β-O- 4 ′ linkages and ester bonds were the major mechanisms of lignin cleavage. This degradation pathway led to a more condensed lignin that has a high average molecular weight and more phenolic hydroxyl groups {{than those of the}} control. The hot pressing process resulted in the <b>binderless</b> boards with reduced lignin contents and decreased the glass transition temperature, thus making the lignin more accessible to the fiber surface. CEL isolated from the <b>binderless</b> boards showed an increased syringyl to guaiacyl propane (S/G) ratio but a lower molecular weight than that of the untreated Eucalyptus wood and the hydrothermal pretreated fibers. Moreover, Eucalyptus wood {{has the potential to be}} used to manufacture <b>binderless</b> boards. Based on the finding of this study, it is suggested that the combination of hydrothermal pretreatment and hot pressing process is a good way for conditioning hardwood sawdust for the production of <b>binderless</b> boards. The thermal softening of lignin, rich in phenolic hydroxyl groups, and increased condensed lignin structure contributed to the self-bonding formation of lignocellulosic materials. Future work will be conducted to optimize the pretreatment conditions and improve the performance of <b>binderless</b> board to higher values and commercial uses.|$|E

Modulus of rupture (MOR), modulus of elasticity (MOE), internal bonding strength (IB), thickness change, weight loss, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and color difference (ΔE*) by the CIE L*a*b* system were measured at various outdoor exposure periods up to 19 months. These values were then {{compared with those of}} a commercial medium-density fiberboard (MDF; melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin; thickness 9.0 mm, density 0.75 g/cm 3).

The MOR retention ratio of the kenaf core <b>binderless</b> boards with a pressing temperature of 200 °C was 59.5 % after 12 months of outdoor exposure, which was slightly lower than that of the MDF (75.6 % after 11 months of outdoor exposure).

The effects of bagasse type, manufacturing process, and storage method on the mechanical properties of <b>binderless</b> particleboards were investigated.

Triphasic Diamond/Carbide/Metal Composites (TDCC) will be commercialized in drilling and machining applications...|$|E
30|$|Self-bonding is {{the main}} factor of the {{performance}} expression of <b>binderless</b> boards, and therefore its clarification {{is considered to be}} an important issue. For this purpose, a series of chemical analyses were conducted on kenaf core <b>binderless</b> boards and their chemical changes during the hot-pressing process are discussed in this article. First of all, <b>binderless</b> boards were prepared from kenaf core powder at different pressing temperatures (without steam-explosion process) and were used for chemical analyses after they were reduced into powders and extracted with methanol. To investigate their chemical changes, lignin, holocellulose, and neutral sugar contents were determined, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded, and the nitrobenzene oxidation procedure was applied. As a result, it was found that parts of lignin and hemicelullose were decomposed during the hot-pressing process; however, the contribution of the resulting fractions to selfbonding was not observed. In addition, progress of condensation reactions in lignin and the formation of chemical bonds by low molecular weight conjugated carbonyl compounds in methanol extractives were observed. Thermal softening of lignin is also suggested {{to play an important role}} in the expression of board performance.|$|E
