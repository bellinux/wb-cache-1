5|$|The video {{begins with}} the younger version of Clarkson sitting at the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> station wagon. Singing the first verse, she {{witnesses}} a depressing scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly clasps both her hands before the video shifts {{to the present day}} where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. After posing for the photographers, she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighborhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane as it goes through a mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers. The next scene shows Clarkson singing with her band in a backyard party which is shown alternately with scenes from the film, as well as a montage of her family and co-workers waving away from her. In the final scene, the younger Clarkson is shown praying by her bedside.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{discovered}} {{at the crime}} scene suggested the victim's body had been placed in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car, then driven to the disposal location, where her body was dragged {{out of the car and}} around the trunk of the vehicle, then rolled down the ravine. Furthermore, on November 21, a pair of Liberty brand glasses belonging to a nearsighted individual were found approximately 50 feet (18 m) from the location where the victim's body had been placed in the ravine, although it remains inconclusive whether these glasses are related to the case.|$|E

5000|$|A {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Jake Davis. It was premiered on March 7, 2011. It features appearances by featured artist Dev in shiny glittering dress, which changes into a white-and-pink dress with <b>a</b> quarter <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pyramid and The Cataracs. The first few scenes were shot with a silver Mercedes-Benz 300SL, with appearance by all artists. The scene changes to a [...] "party in a club" [...] scene after the second chorus, and the <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car, given {{the title of the}} song. It ends with New Boyz being covered by the shadows. Ironically, the music video contains cars that actually don't feature <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> as well as a mustang in place of the Camaro that is not orange.

25|$|Back Seat Dodge ’38 (1964), by Edward Kienholz, is a {{sculpture}} portraying a couple engaged {{in sexual activity}} in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> truncated 1938 Dodge automobile chassis. The piece won Kienholz instant celebrity in 1966 when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors tried to ban the sculpture as pornographic and threatened to withhold financing from LACMA if it included the work in a Kienholz retrospective. A compromise was reached under which the sculpture's car door would remain closed and guarded, to be opened only on the request of a museum patron who was over 18, and only if no children {{were present in the}} gallery. The uproar led to more than 200 people lining up to see the work the day the show opened. Ever since, Back Seat Dodge ’38 has drawn crowds.|$|E
50|$|In 2005, Suliga {{was killed}} in an {{automobile}} accident in the parking lot <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Linden go-go bar. Governor Richard Codey ordered that flags be flown at half-staff in Suliga's honor. Suliga was sitting in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Infiniti that had been illegally parked by his driver, Nicholas Sorrentino; the car's back was sticking out onto the street. The Infiniti was struck while Sorrentino and Suliga were inside and one Joan Hannon was about to enter the vehicle, by an automobile driven by one Omar Beeks. Beeks later testified that he had struck the Infiniti while trying to avoid hitting another vehicle. Hannon was thrown twenty feet and suffered cracked ribs and pelvis in addition to a broken ankle. In a civil trial, a jury found Sorrentino liable for the accident and awarded $621,410 to Suliga's widow, Annemarie Pakulski, as well as $150,000 to Hannon for her injuries. The jury did not find Beeks liable for the accident in any amount.|$|R

2500|$|President Chen and Vice President Lu were {{standing}} in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> open convertible Jeep moving slowly through a crowded street when around 1:45 PM, a bullet penetrated the windshield of the vehicle, grazed Chen's stomach, and was stopped in his clothes. Chen received a flesh wound [...] long and [...] wide. The other bullet penetrated the windshield and hit a cast on Lu's knee which she was wearing due to an earlier injury and was later found in the vehicle. At first both believed that they had been hit by firecrackers, which are common in Taiwanese political parades and rallies. Chen realized that it was something more serious when he noticed that he was bleeding from the abdomen and that there was a bullet hole in the window. Chen reported pain in his abdomen and Lu reported pain in her knee and they were taken to the Chi-Mei Hospital. At 3:30 pm, the spokesperson for the president, Chiou I-jen, announced that the [...] "National Security Mechanism" [...] had been activated. By 5:30 pm, both the Pan-Blue and Pan-Green coalitions announced that they would cease all scheduled campaigning activities.|$|R

Preferring rich men, Clare tries {{to attract the attention}} of the wealthy men in Albert Square. Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and his brother Max (Jake Wood) show no interest; however, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is more susceptible despite being married to Jane (Laurie Brett). Clare flirts with Ian, wears revealing clothes and talks suggestively but she is playing a game and has no intention of taking things further, acting shocked when Ian suggests that she does. She blackmails Ian, threatening to inform Jane of his dishonourable intentions unless he pays to keep quiet but Ian tells Jane himself so she confronts Clare, warning her to stay away from Ian.|$|E
25|$|Pacheco {{repeatedly}} {{went into}} the lab at night to take photographs and to escort scientists, including veterinarians and a primatologist, through it to secure their testimony. Newkirk lay crouched on the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car outside, hidden under a large cardboard box with holes for her eyes, using a walkie-talkie from a toy store to alert Pacheco if anyone else entered the building. The monkeys' living conditions documented by Pacheco were graphically disturbing. Having collected the evidence, Newkirk and Pacheco alerted the police, who raided the lab, removed the monkeys, and charged Taub with 113 counts of cruelty to animals and six counts of failing to provide adequate veterinary care. Taub maintained {{that he had been}} set up by Newkirk and Pacheco while he was on vacation and that several of the photographs had been staged. The judge found Taub guilty of six counts of cruelty to animals for failing to provide adequate veterinary care and fined him $3,000. A later jury trial saw five of these counts dismissed, and the sixth was overturned on appeal because of a technicality. The National Institutes of Health, which had funded Taub's research, was among the scientists and other professionals who criticized the conditions in which Taub had kept the monkeys, though the NIH later reversed its decision when the charges against Taub were overturned.|$|E

5000|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} on 7 July 2016. The video opens with an extended sequence resembling David Lynch's short film Rabbits. Lead singer Matt Healy walks into a living room in clown makeup, which was previously seen in the music video for [...] "A Change <b>of</b> Heart", while <b>a</b> woman {{sits on the couch}} in a collapsed position. Like in Rabbits, Healy's actions in the room seem randomly soundtracked by a studio laugh track, including whoops, hollers and applause. He removes his clown makeup, sits on the couch and speaks in an exceptionally distorted, unintelligble voice to the woman before leaving again. As the song begins, the video shifts its tone by moving into colour footage. Healy tries to deal with heartbreak on a night alone, by crying, drinking, dancing and eventually having sex with a stripper in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automobile. Near the end, Healy seems to come to his senses and realizes that not only is he hallucinating most of his interactions with others in these situations, but that some of the other people are copies of himself (in the case of the stripper, he finds himself alone in the backseat, stroking his own face and chest.) The video was based on a story that Healy wrote.|$|R
500|$|Henderson {{was born}} in Chicago, Illinois, and named Rickey Nelson Henley, named after singer-actor Ricky Nelson, to John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley on Christmas Day, 1958, in Chicago, in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Oldsmobile {{on the way to}} the hospital. Henderson later joked, [...] "I was already fast. I couldn't wait." [...] When he was two years old, his father left home, and his family moved to Oakland, California, when he was seven. His father died in an {{automobile}} accident ten years after leaving home. His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley's junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname. As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland, Henderson developed the ability to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower — a rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers. In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left, and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so. [...] Henderson later said, [...] "All my friends were right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that's the way it was supposed to be done." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{scheduled}} {{release date}} for Axis was almost delayed when Hendrix lost the master tape of side {{one of the}} LP, leaving it in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> London taxi. With the deadline looming, Hendrix, Chandler, and engineer Eddie Kramer remixed most of side one in a single overnight session, {{but they could not}} match the quality of the lost mix of [...] "If 6 Was 9". Bassist Noel Redding had a tape recording of this mix, which had to be smoothed out with an iron as it had gotten wrinkled. During the verses, Hendrix doubled his singing with a guitar line which he played one octave lower than his vocals. Hendrix voiced his disappointment about having re-mixed the album so quickly, and he felt {{that it could have been}} better had they been given more time.|$|E
500|$|Red-Headed Woman {{begins with}} Harlow seducing her boss Bill LeGendre and {{intentionally}} breaking up his marriage. During her seductions, {{he tries to}} resist and slaps her, at which point {{she looks at him}} deliriously and says [...] "Do it again, I like it! Do it again!" [...] They eventually marry but Harlow seduces a wealthy aged industrialist who is in business with her husband so that she can move to New York. Although this plan succeeds, she is cast aside when she is discovered having an affair with her chauffeur, in essence cheating on her paramour. Harlow shoots LeGendre, nearly killing him. When she is last seen in the film, she is in France in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> limousine with an elderly wealthy gentleman being driven along by the same chauffeur. The film was a boon to Harlow's career and {{has been described as a}} [...] "trash masterpiece".|$|E
500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Pop the Trunk" [...] {{was based on}} a concept created by Yelawolf, and it was {{directed}} by Motion Family. The video incorporates different elements of culture of the rural American South. The first part is filmed in Yelawolf parent's house, in <b>a</b> wooded area <b>of</b> Gadsden, where his mother can be seen chopping meat with a meat cleaver on a porch that has a deceased deer hanging over her head. His stepfather is fixing an old Chevrolet pickup truck, and eventually gets a Mossberg pump shotgun to shoot a burglar that has been trespassing on his property, thus 'popping the trunk'. The burglar's corpse is seen lifeless. Later, he is seen sitting in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old Chevrolet Monte Carlo, rapping recreationally. Yelawolf's mate, Shawty Fatt, pulls into the parking lot <b>of</b> <b>a</b> liquor store and sees someone with whom he's had a disagreement, leading him to pull out his gun and kill the man before speeding off. The majority of the video is shot at night, giving the video an eerie feeling. There are many instances where the artist is seen rapping in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> makeshift fire in a trashcan in front <b>of</b> <b>an</b> abandoned vehicle, in a scrap junkyard, and other places interwoven in between the main storyline (usually on a cold day).|$|R

5000|$|Her {{statement}} {{taken in}} the Douglas Hospital explained while on the beach near Los Angeles, a young couple approached {{and asked her to}} come and pray for their sick child. When she went with them and looked in on the bundle in the <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> automobile, they then shoved her into their car. At the same time a cloth was held over her face loaded with a sickly sweet substance; later speculated to be chloroform with an additive. After awakening, she was no longer clothed in her bathing suit and was wearing a dress. A woman named [...] "Rose," [...] who displayed professional nursing skills, looked after her. Held for a time in what was a boarded up room in a house that appeared to be an urban area, she was later moved to the remote shack in Mexico. Trying to elicit some personal information to prove they had her, one of her captors burned McPherson's hand with his cigar, but felt bad about it and stopped. McPherson's statement gave details on how she escaped the desert shack while her assailants were out on errands. She cut her bonds on a metal can lid, a technique she later successfully demonstrated several times before skeptical reporters; and climbed out the shack's back window. Using a mountain to navigate, she made her way north. She told how she used her garments to shield herself from the afternoon sun and carefully stepped around any shaggy bushes in her path. In the evening, lights from a town guided her to its streets. Terrified by the unexpected savagery of nearby barking dogs behind a fence, she entered the yard <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Mexican couple, R. R. Gonzales and his wife. Her story was transmitted and transcribed across telegraph and phone lines becoming front-page international news.|$|R
