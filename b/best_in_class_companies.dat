40|$|In a {{competitive}} context that {{is characterized by}} globalization and high economic and financial instability, companies must adapt their strategies {{in order to take}} advantage of new markets (Flint, 2004). Several empirical studies underline how business relationships are important for companies to develop their activities and businesses and to survive on national and international markets (eg. Håkansson, Snehota, 1995; Håkansson, Prenkert, 2004; Håkansson, Waluszewski, 2002; Johanson, Mattsson, 1988). Other studies highlight that also cultural aspects are critical in establishing business relationships and in enhancing and maintaining ongoing business (Usunier, 1996; Hall, 1976; Herbig, 2000; Ghauri, Usunier, 2003; Fletcher, Fang, 2004). The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe how Italian companies approach the Chinese market and in particular, how they have changed their business model to face the Chinese challenge. Particular emphasis will be given to relationships and their importance to achieve a long-term competitive advantage on that market. The results of a both quantitative and qualitative research are presented. In the quantitative phase the behavior of Italian companies operating in China are analyzed through questions about the operative approach (marketing policies, instruments, product and process for quality certification) and the strategic approach (entry mode and approach to different targets), together with the results they achieved and the criticalities they had to face. The qualitative phase is focused on business models and marketing policies that Italian companies adopt when operating in the Chinese market. For this, in-depth interviews were conducted with some <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> <b>companies.</b> An evolutionary model on sustainable internationalization is then proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{benchmarking}} for {{closing the gap}} between <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> and the <b>company's</b> performance has proven its efficiency for well structured processes in large or multi-national enterprises. Nevertheless, even today the method of benchmarking in medium sized enterprises is still a rarity. This is mainly based on the different constraints caused by the market- and technically based product specification, by customers and the internal organisation of medium-sized companies with a low level-specification. Therefore classical process benchmarking in medium sized companies, defined as the comparison of individual processes with a <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> benchmark, is much more time-consuming and, due to the financial possibilities of the enterprises in most cases not feasible. The Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation (IPA), with its main activity of contract research for medium sized enterprises (>> 2000 employees and >> 500 million turnover), developed a special meth od dedicated to this problems and named the IPA Company Analysis. This method starts at the company level and compares the company's performance with a market standard and, if feasible, with a <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> competitor. This helps to take process interlinks into consideration. The IPA Company Analysis is done in three steps, starting with the data collection at the firm, followed by an expert and database routed analysis, and ending with a presentation at the company. The results of the contract research, based on the IPA Company Analysis, show a tremendous improvement, starting with this approach in medium sized companies...|$|R

30|$|Can SR and INT investors act {{according}} to the above preferences? SR (retail and institutional) funds 13 that are licensed for distribution in Germany account for € 30.9 billion. € 25.27 billion (~ 82  %) of these assets practice negative screening and € 15.81 billion (~ 51  %) follow a <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> investment approach (see FNG (2014)). Thus, at most 18  % of assets can be managed {{according to}} <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> without considering negative screens. This is roughly in line with the fraction of 20.4  % of SR and 12  % of INT investors who could be attracted to ‘pure’ <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> funds according to Table  10. Consequently, more than 30  % of the assets must be managed with {{a combination of the two}} strategies. Whether or not the SR funds match the preferences of SR and INT investors is impossible to clarify since the above data does not reveal which negative screens are employed and combined with the <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> approach. As mentioned in Dorfleitner and Utz (2014), it may also be possible that there is a gap between supply and demand for SR funds in German-speaking countries.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{nuts and}} bolts session will present case {{histories}} of how spectacular results were achieved and how the participants can apply these lessons. The speakers answer the question – Which <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> practices pay the highest dividends? The presentation will, also, share time tested techniques for gaining organizational support for implementing these changes. Starting from where you are now – we {{show you how to}} reap big dividends from a relatively small effort by applying <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> practices. These practices often yield results as high as 10 to 1. Objectives. Our purpose here is as follows: 1. Set forth <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> practices that every supply management group should pay attention to; 2. Show how to employ metrics as part of a <b>best</b> <b>in</b> <b>class</b> practices effort; 3. Illustrate how to win support of top management, as well as, other departments like accounting, engineering, marketing, production inventory and inventory control, and transportation. Winning support – the foundation. Nothing gets upper management’s attention like money. So promising significant savings and then delivering on those promises will ordinarily win support. But not always! The first thing we need to get across to all management in our organizations is the importance of our contribution. For example, in manufacturing, on average, 60 % of the sales dollars are spent to purchase goods and services of the organization. In building cars and trucks, purchasing costs run between 60 % to 80 %. The range for all manufacturing runs from 86 % (lead smelting) to 25 % (for some electronic assembly). Purchases for the service industries are smaller than most manufacturing but are still a significant. One study of service organizations showed purchases as a percent of revenue as following...|$|R
