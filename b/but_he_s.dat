And when he was warned {{of the possibility of}} Ayaka attacking Shipon during training, he displays extraordinary piloting abilities beyond what his ship should have been capable of handling. Another example would be during a simulator-game where Rinna scored Rank A, and Shima scored Rank B, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> scored Rank <b>S.</b> When Shima asks why Kouta does not do the best during class, especially since he is capable of it, he merely says: he wonders why also. Pierre once remarks [...] "Talented hawks hide their talons" [...] when referring to Kouta's skills.|$|R
40|$|Sometimes a {{proposition}} is 'opaque' to an agent: (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> doesn't know it, <b>but</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> does {{know something about}} how coming to know it should affect his or her credence function. It is tempting to assume that a rational agent's credence function coheres {{in a certain way}} with his or her knowledge of these opaque propositions, and I call this the 'Opaque Proposition Principle'. The principle is compelling but demonstrably false. I explain this incongruity by showing that the principle is ambiguous: the term 'know' as it appears in the principle can be interpreted in two different ways, as either basic-know or super-know. I use this distinction to construct a plausible version of the principle, and then to similarly construct plausible versions of the Reflection Principle and the Sure-Thing Principle...|$|R
5000|$|Scott (labeled the [...] "Troublemaker") is a devious and sneaky farm-boy, {{serving as}} the main {{antagonist}} of Total Drama: Revenge of the Island. He is very mean, sneaky, and a liar who does whatever dirty deed it takes to win. His tactic in Total Drama Revenge of the Island was to sabotage his own team without getting caught, which caused his team(s) to lose every single elimination challenge before the merge. He is somewhat of a bully to Cameron. People didn't realize that he was mean {{until the end of}} the series. Scott has a very large conflict with a mutated shark called Fang who constantly tries to brutally attack him any chance he gets for taking possession of one of Fang's shark teeth in Season 4. As a result, by the time of the Season 4 finale, Scott was hated and seen as a villain by every castmate including Chris. In Season 5, Scott returned as member of the Villainous Vultures, {{serving as the}} comic relief of the season. He abandons his sabotage idea due to the luxuirous mansion that winning teams were allowed to stay in, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> only <b>s.</b> <b>He</b> later gets into a relationship with Courtney, but soon ends it.
