During the war, Egypt captured the town along with other towns {{in an area that}} became known as the Gaza Strip. The Egyptians later established a sharia court system that held jurisdiction over personal affairs. Egyptian rule introduced relative prosperity to Deir al-Balah. The town witnessed a booming citrus industry made possible by the discovery of a substantial reservoir of ground water in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|At the 2001 UK census, {{there were}} 1,805,315 {{residents}} of Greater Manchester aged 16 to 74. The economic activity {{of these people}} was 40.3% in full-time employment, 11.3% in part-time employment, 6.7% self-employed, 3.5% unemployed, 5.1% students without jobs, 2.6% students with jobs, 13.0% retired, 6.1% looking after home or family, 7.8% permanently sick or disabled and 3.5% economically inactive for other reasons. The figures follow the national trend, although the percentage of self-employed people is {{below the national average}} of 8.3%. The proportion of unemployment in the county varies, with the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport having the lowest at 2.0% and Manchester the highest at 7.9%. In 2001, of the 1,093,385residents of Greater Manchester in employment, the industry of employment was: 18.4% retail and wholesale; 16.7% manufacturing; 11.8% property and business services; 11.6% health and social work; 8.0% education; 7.3% transport and communications; 6.7% construction; 4.9% public administration and defence; 4.7% hotels and restaurants; 4.1% finance; 0.8% electricity, gas, and water supply; 0.5% agriculture; and 4.5% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the proportion of jobs in agriculture which is only {{about a third of the}} national average of 1.5%, due to the overwhelmingly urban, <b>built-up</b> <b>land</b> use of Greater Manchester.|$|E

40|$|Remotely sensed {{imagery is}} a type of data that is {{compatible}} with the monitoring and mapping of changes in <b>built-up</b> and bare <b>land</b> within urban areas as the impacts of population growth and urbanisation increase. The application of currently available remote sensing indices, however, has some limitations with respect to distinguishing <b>built-up</b> and bare <b>land</b> in urban areas. In this study, a new index for transforming remote sensing data for mapping <b>built-up</b> and bare <b>land</b> areas is proposed. The Enhanced Built-Up and Bareness Index (EBBI) is able to map <b>built-up</b> and bare <b>land</b> areas using a single calculation. The EBBI is the first <b>built-up</b> and bare <b>land</b> index that applies near infrared (NIR), short wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal infrared (TIR) channels simultaneously. This new index was applied to distinguish <b>built-up</b> and bare <b>land</b> areas in Denpasar (Bali, Indonesia) and had a high accuracy level when compared to existing indices. The EBBI was more effective at discriminating <b>built-up</b> and bare <b>land</b> areas and at increasing the accuracy of the built-up density percentage than five other indices...|$|R
