50|$|The Serengeti is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} cat, first developed by crossing a Bengal (domestic and wild hybrid) and an Oriental Shorthair. Recognized and registered by The International Cat Association (TICA), no other first generation crosses can be registered as Serengeti. From the Bengal × Oriental cross came the first foundation Serengeti. Breeders then {{worked with the}} cat to produce a cat that resembles the breed profile set by TICA.Created by Karen Sausman of Kingsmark Cattery in California in 1994, the breed {{is still in the}} development stages, but the ultimate aim is to produce a cat that looks similar to a serval, without using any recent wild <b>cat</b> blood. (<b>Bengal</b> <b>cats</b> originate from hybridization of leopard cats and domestic <b>cats.</b> Most <b>Bengal</b> <b>cats</b> used in Serengeti breeding programs are many generations removed from these origins and possess few genetic contributions of the wild forebears except alleles affecting coat color.)Serengetis are spotted cats, with long legs and very large, round tipped ears. They have a long neck which blends with the base of the skull without tapering. Males are generally slightly larger and heavier than females and can weigh between 10 and 15 lbs; females generally weigh between 8 and 12 lbs. Because the Bengal stock is a hybrid cat, the Serengeti is also classified as a hybrid.|$|R

40|$|Researchers {{examined}} {{difference in}} the abundance of mammals in post-fire silvicultural management stands within a pine forest in Samcheok, Gangwon province, South Korea, from 2008 - 2010. Researchers recorded the tracks of 12 mammal species, amur hedgehogs (Erinaceus amurensis), Japanese moles (Mogera wogura), raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), Siberian weasels (Mustela sibirica), European badgers (Meles meles), <b>Bengal</b> <b>cats</b> (Prionailurus bengalensis), wild boars (Sus scrofa), roe deer (Caproelus pygargus), water deer (Hydropotes inermis), Korean hares (Lepus coreanus), red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) and Siberian chipmunks (Tamias sibiricus). There were {{significant differences in the}} number of species and tracks linked to mammals among unburned, post-burned Japanese red pine planted and post-burned untreated stands.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of biochemical, phenotypic, and 16 S rRNA analyses, Helicobacter canis was {{isolated}} from <b>Bengal</b> <b>cats</b> with and without chronic diarrhea. Because the cats were coinfected with other potential pathogens, including Campylobacter helveticus, and because H. canis was isolated from nondiarrheic cats, the causal role of H. canis in producing the diarrhea could not be proven. Histologically, the colons of the four affected cats were characterized by mild to moderate neutrophilic, plasmacytic, and histocytic infiltrates in the lamina propria. Rare crypt abscesses were also noted for three cats but were a more prominent feature of the colonic lesions noted for the fourth cat. This is the first observation of H. canis in cats and {{raises the possibility that}} H. canis, like H. hepaticus and H. bilis in mice, can cause inflammation of the colon, particularly in hosts with immune dysregulation. Further studies are needed to determine the importance of H. canis as a primary enteric pathogen in cats and the role of cats in the possible zoonotic spread of H. canis to humans...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} a rapidly progressive loss of motor {{function in a}} 16 -month-old male neutered <b>Bengal</b> <b>cat,</b> beginning in the pelvic limbs and progressing to involve all limbs and rendering the cat non-ambulatory. The neurological examination revealed flaccid tetraparesis with decreased spinal reflexes but preserved conscious proprioception and skin sensation. Extensive electrophysiological tests were conducted including electromyography, motor and sensory peripheral nerves potential recordings and 'late' potentials, defining the electrodiagnostic characteristics of this disease. Based on the electrophysiological findings, a generalised proximal and predominantly axonal neuropathy affecting the ventral (motor) nerve roots was suspected. As no aetiology was identified, this disease was classified as idiopathic polyradiculoneuropathy. Over a year, the cat presented three separate episodes of tetraparesis, each with a spontaneous complete recovery, consistent with the reportedly good prognosis for this disease...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{long-haired}} Bengals (more properly semi-long-haired) {{have occurred}} {{since the beginning}} of the Bengal breeding program, as longer-haired domestic cats were among those used in crosses with the wild Asian leopard cat to produce the breed. Some current F4 and later purebred Bengals carry the recessive long-haired genes and when they are mated with each other, they can produce long-haired <b>Bengals.</b> (See <b>Cat</b> coat genetics#Genes involved in fur length and texture.) Such offspring were usually spayed or neutered until ongoing intentional development of the long-hair variety, as they did not then qualify as Bengal breeding stock due to their non-conforming long or semi-long coats. On August 21, 2013, long-haired Bengals were granted [...] "preliminary" [...] breed status in the New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF) registry under the breed name Cashmere, at the behest of a breeder named Damian Vaughan.

40|$|Atsuyoshi Dota, Yuko Takaoka-Shichijo, Masatsugu NakamuraOphthalmic Research and Development Center, Santen Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Ikoma-shi, Nara, JapanPurpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of gefarnate on mucin-like glycoprotein secretion in isolated rabbit conjunctival tissue, and on corneal epithelial damage in rabbit and cat dry-eye models. Methods: Conjunctival tissue isolated from rabbits was treated with gefarnate. Mucin-like glycoprotein was detected in the culture supernatant by an enzyme-linked lectin assay. Gefarnate ointment was topically applied to eyes once daily for 7 days in the rabbit dry-eye model, in which the lacrimal glands, Harderian gland, and nictitating membrane were removed, or for 4 weeks in the cat dry-eye model, in which the lacrimal gland and nictitating membrane were removed. Corneal epithelial damage was evaluated by measurement of corneal permeability by rose bengal in the rabbit model or by fluorescein staining in the cat model. Results: Gefarnate stimulated mucin-like glycoprotein secretion in conjunctival tissue in a dose-dependent manner. In the rabbit dry-eye model, application of gefarnate ointment to the eyes resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in rose bengal permeability in the cornea, with the effect being significant at concentrations of &ge; 0. 3 %. In the cat dry-eye model, application of gefarnate ointment resulted in a significant decrease in the corneal fluorescein staining score. Conclusion: These results suggest that gefarnate stimulates in vitro secretion of mucin-like glycoprotein in conjunctival tissue and ameliorates corneal epithelial damage in animal dry-eye models. Gefarnate may therefore be effective for treating dry eye. Keywords: gefarnate, fluorescein staining, rose <b>bengal</b> permeability, rabbit, <b>cat,</b> dry ey...|$|R
