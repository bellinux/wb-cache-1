50|$|According to Bombardier marketing, the {{aircraft}} breaks even {{with about a}} third of its seats filled (or a quarter with more closely spaced seats), making it particularly attractive on routes with varying passenger numbers where many seats would be empty on some flights. For example, Island Air in Hawaii calculated that the use of a 50-seat regional jet would break even at 45 passenger seats compared to the Q400's 35-36 seats (around 55% <b>breakeven</b> <b>load</b> <b>factor).</b> Most short-haul routes are less than 350 miles (500 km), so the time spent on taxiing, taking off, and landing virtually eliminates a competing jet's speed advantage. As the Q400's 360-knot (414-mph, 667-km/h) cruise speed approaches jet speeds, short-haul airlines can usually replace a regional jet with a Q400 without changing their gate-to-gate schedules.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what the critical factors are to an airline’s financial turmoil, leading ultimately to a bankruptcy filing. Over the past decade, the airline industries’ performance has been dismal, leading to 20 bankruptcy filings. As competition increases, it is crucial for airlines to know which core business areas are essential to success. This paper identifies 8 specific industry metrics that are used to compare airlines, revealing where certain airlines falter and others shine. Some of these metrics are later applied to a case study examining Trans World Airlines (TWA) and American Airlines (AA), highlighting the factors leading to TWA’s bankruptcy filing during the same time period American Airlines remained profitable. The results show that the labor inefficiency, operating inefficiencies, unsuccessful fuel hedging programs, and high long-term debt are critical factors leading to an airlines bankruptcy. Four recommendations for airlines are provided, namely: 1.) The cross-utilization of employees, 2.) Maintain Cost Discipline, 3.) Focus on <b>Breakeven</b> <b>Load</b> <b>Factor,</b> and 4.) Do not neglect the intangibles such as brand reputation...|$|E
40|$|To compete {{successfully}} in short haul markets under 200 miles, an air transport system must offer a high daily frequency of service, N, {{as well as}} short air travel times. In a given market, N can be increased by using vehicles of smaller seat capacity, C, which are more expensive per seat to operate. A method of determining optimal values of N and C for assumed market behavior in terms of fare and time elasticities is presented. By defining total trip time to include the average wait for service, and using a demand model developed for the Northeast Corridor, the air share of total demand in any market can be calculated {{as a function of}} N and the competing fares. Plotting daily passengers versus N, and relating this to the maximum and <b>breakeven</b> <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> for a family of vehicles of different seating capacities, determines the values of N and C which maximize return to the operator.

40|$|Purpose: One key {{variable}} for improving efficiency in freight transport systems {{is to increase}} the load factor; the ratio of the actual load carried to the maximum load that could have been carried. A high <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in transport operations is of interest for several reasons; to lower costs and to reduce environmental impact. Shippers have a large influence on transport operations e. g. through choices concerning packaging, loading and planning. Therefore, it is of interest what opportunities there are for shippers to improve <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Meanwhile, there are few studies focusing on <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Since <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is often one of many aspects examined when discussing wider topics, such as transport efficiency, the research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is dispersed. Thus, it is difficult to get an overview of the subject, in particular to identify opportunities from a shipper’s perspective. To address the lack of overview of research on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how specific actors, in particular shippers, can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> {{the purpose of this paper}} is to structure how academic literature has described how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> can be influenced, with a specific focus on the role of shippers. Research approach: An extensive literature search in scholarly journals was performed on <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> terms using Summon search tool. A total of 473 articles were identified, where 29 articles discussed <b>factors</b> that influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> (determinants). Literature was categorized according to focus on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> actor perspective, mode of transport covered, how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is measured and determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Findings and Originality: The literature review identifies determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> within warehousing; order and delivery; packaging and loading; transport operations; information sharing and IT; and regulations. Surprisingly few studies discuss determinants, especially from the perspective of a shipper. The literature review shows a lack of detailed descriptions of determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Also, it is difficult to gain reliable data about <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and consequently also compare results between studies. Suggested research areas include how shippers can increase <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> in their transports, detailed descriptions of how determinants influence <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as well as how <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> performance can be measured; e. g. through standardized measuring methods. This research is unique since it is the first, to our knowledge, review on determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Research impact: This literature review contributes with an overview of the dispersed research on <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> structured according to determinants of <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Areas of interest for future research are suggested. Practical impact: The overview of determinants is useful for shippers, specifically logistics managers in order to gain understanding of their role when aiming for improved <b>load</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|R

30|$|This paper’s main {{variable}} {{of interest is}} the airline industry <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> The <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> measures the percentage of an airline’s output that has been sold to paying passengers. Hence, the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> {{is a measure of}} the extent to which supply and demand are balanced at prevailing prices. The achieved <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> for the industry as a whole conceal marked variations between different type of airliners, with regional carriers at the lower end of the spectrum and charter airlines generally achieving higher <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> than scheduled carriers [8]. The average <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> for individual airline enterprises masks variations between different markets and cabins. Economy cabins achieving higher <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> because customers tend to book further in advance and expect lower levels of seat accessibility than for premium cabins. The average <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> in the airline industry also conceal pronounced daily, weekly and, in particular, seasonal variations.|$|R
25|$|Average <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> {{in transit}} systems, is {{the ratio of}} the total number of riders to the total {{theoretical}} capacity. A transit vehicle running at full capacity has a 100% <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> while an empty vehicle has 0% <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> If a transit vehicle spends half the time running at 100% and half the time running at 0%, the average <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is 50%. Higher average <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> corresponds to lower energy consumption per passenger, so designers attempt to maximize this metric.|$|R
30|$|However, in reality, {{the true}} {{autocorrelation}} {{structure of the}} <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> has the periodic autocorrelation (i.e., <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> it is highly seasonal). Consequently, we have to identify the structure of both serial and periodic autocorrelations on the <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> Third, once we identify the autocorrelation structure of the <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> then we will deal with mechanisms to control it during model fit.|$|R
30|$|The <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is {{a measure}} of the {{performance}} and efficiency of an airline. The airline’s <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> directly reflects their competency and performance. The high <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> with appropriate pricing is a condition for the efficient operation of an airline enterprise [40]. Thus, it is enlightening for the performance of the airline to highlight factors that affect the <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> [22].|$|R

30|$|System <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is {{the average}} hourly {{quantity}} of electricity available during the year.

50|$|In {{turning flight}} the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is {{normally}} greater than +1. For example, in a turn with a 60° angle of bank the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is +2. Again, {{if the same}} turn is performed with the aircraft inverted, the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> becomes -2. In general, in a balanced turn in which the angle of bank is θ, the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> n {{is related to the}} cosine of θ by the formula: Another way to achieve <b>load</b> <b>factors</b> significantly higher than +1 is to pull on the elevator control {{at the bottom of a}} dive, whereas strongly pushing the stick forward during straight and level flight is likely to produce negative <b>load</b> <b>factors,</b> by causing the lift to act in the opposite direction to normal, i.e. downwards.|$|R
30|$|In {{the airline}} {{industry}} the term <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> {{is defined as the}} percentage of seats filled by revenue passengers. The <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is a metric that measures the airline’s capacity and demand management.

50|$|Passenger <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is an {{important}} parameter {{for the assessment of}} the performance of any transport system.

30|$|Yield {{management}} is the assortment of schemes, strategies and tactics the airline enterprises use to systematically manage demand {{for their services}} and products [25].

The <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is a quantity of the extent to which supply and demand are balanced at prevailing prices [18].

40|$|Purpose: Improving the {{efficiency}} of freight transport leads {{to a reduction in}} both costs and emissions. One key aspect of efficient transport is the <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> i. e., the load carried (required capacity) compared to the maximum load that could be carried (available capacity) in a load unit (e. g., a vehicle). Few existing articles discuss <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> from a shipper’s perspective. Also, the concept of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is interpreted in different ways, and there is confusion about what is 100 % full. To achieve a high <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> {{can be seen as a}} balance between required and available capacity. As a step towards identifying opportunities for shippers to improve <b>load</b> <b>factor,</b> the purpose of this paper is to structure the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> concept based on the balance between required and available capacity. Research Approach: A conceptual model was developed based on the literature. This model was applied in the typical case of a shipper outsourcing freight transport. The data collection consisted of several semi-structured interviews with people in logistics and transport roles. Findings and Originality: This paper presents a model that structures the concept of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> based on required and available capacity, including <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> as the balance between required and available capacity at different levels. Further, required capacity for a particular time period is determined by order details, item characteristics, number of items and the consolidation of items in the load at each <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level. Available capacity for a particular time period is determined by the type of load units and the number of load units at each <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level. The different levels interact, and, to complement the balance at each <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level, an overall measure comparing the required capacity at the lowest <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level with the available capacity at the highest <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> level is suggested. Research Impact: The conceptual model presented in this paper can be used to describe imbalances in shipper systems between required and available capacity. By providing structure and explaining inefficiency in terms of the imbalance between required and available capacity, the model is a step towards identifying opportunities for improving <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> The findings are also of interest to researchers in the field of transport efficiency and green logistics. Practical Impact: Logistics managers can achieve a better understanding of the concept of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and at what level their required and available capacity are imbalanced. Improving the <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is of interest in terms of both reducing costs and improving environmental performance...|$|R

The relationship between load diversity coefficient and route coefficient of variation in occupancy <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> is quantified. Two tables are provided that enhance passenger capacity and quality of service (QoS) assessment regarding onboard passenger load. The first expresses the transit operator’s perspective of load diversity and the passengers’ perspective of <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> relative to the operator’s, across six service levels corresponding to ranges of coefficient of variation in occupancy <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> The second interprets the relationships between passenger average travel time and each of passenger-relative <b>load</b> <b>factor</b> and occupancy <b>load</b> <b>factor.</b> The application of this methodology is illustrated using a case study of a premium radial bus route in Brisbane, Australia. The methodology can assist in benchmarking and decision making regarding route and schedule design.

This would also assist in transit service quality econometric modeling...|$|R
