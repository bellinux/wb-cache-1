40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} evaluating the quality <b>of</b> respiratory-gated radiation <b>delivery</b> using a commercially available device. During irradiation, gating traces for one field for each treatment were extracted from the system for each of 14 patients. The data were then transferred to a spreadsheet. Software was developed to evaluate the following parameters: duty cycle, amplitude of fiducial motion, fraction of amplitude of motion during gated delivery, and respiratory cycle time. Criteria were established for acceptability of gating traces. In our sample, over 85 % of the traces indicated acceptability. An example of results for one patient extracted from analyzed gating traces is as follows: mean duty cycle, 57 %; average amplitude of motion, 0. 89 cm; average fraction of motion during gated delivery, 0. 45; mean respiratory cycle time, 4. 5 s.

Improving billing {{and collection}} activities has an immediate impact on {{the revenue streams of}} a service provider that can, in turn, help the service provider in improving services. However, while effective {{billing and collection}} practices depend on many internal factors (including customer databases, the extent of metered and unmetered service provision, tariff and <b>billing</b> structures, <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>bills,</b> and facilities for customer payments), the institutional arrangements under which service providers operate and provide services determine whether such practices will remain sustainable in the long term. Efficient billing and collection practices can set incentives for the provider to effectively charge and collect water bills while also fulfilling a commercial orientation to services.

Under these circumstances, the plaintiff claimed that, in spite <b>of</b> the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading, the defendant was liable as a common carrier at common law, and alleged the failure of the defendant to carry and deliver the goods.

40|$|LL. D. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in South African law is {{the theme}} of this study. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in its {{traditional}} paper form is examined. The aim of the first part of the study is to reconcile the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that is based on English law with the principles of South African law, especially regarding concepts such as possession and ownership. A plea is made for the application of South African law to <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading rather than English law exclusively. Even though English law undoubtedly forms the basis of the law governing <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading, such law should be applied in a way that is consistent with the general principles of South African law. The functions <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading are considered in detail, particularly the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading as a document of title. A submission is made of five characteristics of a document of title. The conclusion is that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, though based on English law concepts, can be integrated into South African law without difficulty. The subsequent examination of the transfer of contractual rights and the imposition of liabilities will show that there is a dire need for new legislation in South Africa to replace an English Act of 1855. The current proposals for such legislation are, however, in need of extensive revision. The fact that the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading only arrives at the port of destination after the goods, leads to a multitude of problems. The carrier may only deliver the goods in exchange for a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Letters of indemnity are therefore used to protect the carrier that delivers the goods without receiving a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Such indemnities will be enforceable in South African law if the carrier has no reason to suspect that the receiver of the goods is not entitled to <b>delivery.</b> The consideration <b>of</b> the nature and functions <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, enables the study to progress to an examination <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. The use <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading means that many problems facing the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading can be avoided. The continuing evolution <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading will be examined against the background of electronic commerce. Writing and signature requirements should not inhibit the development <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. The difficulty facing the dematerialisation <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is providing for negotiability in an electronic environment, and ensuring that an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is the equivalent of an original and unique paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is possible to create an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that performs all the functions <b>of</b> a traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, and there are examples of the use <b>of</b> such electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading in practice. <b>Delivery</b> <b>of</b> the goods can take place by way of attomment rather than the usual symbolical delivery following the transfer <b>of</b> a paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is submitted that there is currently no need for legislative intervention to provide for electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading in South Africa...|$|R
50|$|When the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading {{is used as}} a {{document}} of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is the opposite from a straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and there is no specific or named consignee.

50|$|There are {{two types}} where <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading {{can be used as}} carrier's receipt for goods.

Clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading indicates that the goods have been properly loaded on board the carrier's ship according to the prima facie evidence. If the carrier finds out that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is different from goods on board, one can provide contradictory evidence on clean <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is valid as long as in the hand of the carrier, but once it is transferred and negotiated to the third party, it cannot be rebutted and the carrier can no longer mark discrepancy. The second is claused <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading.
