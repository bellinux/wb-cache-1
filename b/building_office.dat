It started <b>building</b> <b>office</b> and meter manufacturing facilities for the Southern California Gas Company in 1915, {{as well as a}} compressor station for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company in 1919. Fluor built the first [...] "Buddha Tower" [...] in 1921 in Signal Hill, California, for the Industrial Fuel Supply Company. The Buddha Tower was a design of water-cooling tower named after the Buddha temples they resemble.

500|$|A new [...] "Metropolitan Transportation Center" [...] at 48th Street and Third Avenue {{would be}} built to provide a {{terminal}} for the new LIRR line, feeding into the lower of the two decks in the 63rd Street Tunnel. It would also have a terminal for a proposed new high-speed spur to JFK that would run via Jamaica. The terminal would have extended from 47th Street to 50th Street, and the tunnel for the line would extend from 63rd Street to 42nd Street. The portion between 47th Street and 42nd Street {{was to have been}} used to store trains during off-peak hours. It would be a transfer point to Grand Central–42nd Street. Access to Grand Central Terminal would be provided through a new north end access point. Construction costs would be offset by <b>building</b> <b>office</b> space above the transportation center. There would be a mezzanine above the four island platforms and eight tracks, which were split evenly across two levels. (This would later be the East Side Access project.) The estimated cost of the project was $341 million, and the MTA applied for $227 million in Federal funds.|$|E
