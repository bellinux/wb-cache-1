25|$|Following the German {{invasion}} and occupation of Poland in 1939, a large resistance network was formed. That resistance required funds to operate, {{and the resources}} of the Polish government in exile, delivered through the cichociemni commando-couriers, were limited. In 1942 the resistance began planning to acquire money from the occupiers by carrying out large-scale robberies. Having learned that a large quantity of money would be moved by the occupiers to the German-established <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>Issue</b> in Poland, the resistance recruited a number of sympathizers within the bank. Preparations lasted about 14 months.|$|E

Those were the years of {{political}} and economical liberation, the beginning of breaking away from the Soviet system. On 15 December 1989 the Estonian government decided to establish the Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank). On 28 December 1989 the Bank Law of the Republic of Estonia was passed and Otsason was appointed the first President of the Bank of Estonia.

Sonnino envisaged to establish a single <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue,</b> but the main priority of his bank reform was to rapidly solve the financial problems of the Banca Romana, as well as to cover up the scandal which involved the political class, rather than to design a new national banking system. The newly established Banca d'Italia {{was the result of a}} merger of three existing banks of issue (the Banca Nazionale and two banks from Tuscany). Regional interests were still strong; hence the compromise of plurality of note issuance with the Banco di Napoli and the Banco di Sicilia, while providing for stricter state control.|$|E

2500|$|The Imperial Bank of Persia ( [...] ; Bank-e Šâhanšâhi-ye Irân) was a British {{bank that}} {{operated}} {{as the state}} bank and <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> in Iran (formerly known as Persia until the 1930s) between 1889 and 1929. It was established in 1885 with a concession from the Persian government to Baron Julius De Reuter (born Israel Beer Josaphat) a German–Jewish banker and businessman who later became a British subject.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1889 and 1928, {{the bank}} {{operated}} {{as the state}} bank and <b>bank</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> of Iran, and held a virtual monopoly on banking in the country. Sir William Keswick was the bank's chairman. The bank was principally funded by Glyn, Mills & Co., J. Henry Schröder & Co. and David Sassoon & Co.. Despite holding a monopoly, the bank's management was farcical, according to Geoffrey Jones, and the bank struggled to make a profit. However, Jones also notes that British banks in this period were allowed to disguise their profits by making transfers to or from [...] "inner" [...] or [...] "secret" [...] reserves before reaching their published profits figure. The Imperial bank's real profits were on average {{twice as high as}} the published profits between 1890 and 1952. [...] The bank contributed to the Iranian economy by mobilizing domestic savings, but many were doubtful of the real use of these savings as the Bank was often [...] "discriminated against Persians in giving credit". In 1927, 80% of the loans granted in Bushehr, Shiraz and Esfahan were to finance Iranian export of Opium, whereas most of the loans in the northern cities related to the trade with Russia. The imperial bank did not employ locals as managers; in contrast, the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which was mixed British, French and Turkish ownership employed middle eastern nationals in managerial positions. The bank's first owner, Joseph Rabino, born in London to an Italian Jewish family, was always regarded with great suspicion by his board.|$|E
