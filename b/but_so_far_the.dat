[...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{fact that}} God is FINITE is one upon which {{those who think}} clearly among the new believers are very insistent. He is, above {{everything}} else, a personality, {{and to be a}} personality is to have characteristics, to be limited by characteristics; he is a Being, not us but dealing with us and through us, he has an aim and that means he has a past and future; he is within time and not outside it. And they point out that this is really what everyone who prays sincerely to God or gets help from God, feels and believes. Our practice with God is better than our theory. None of us really pray to that fantastic, unqualified danse a trois, the Trinity, which the wranglings and disputes of the worthies of Alexandria and Syria declared to be God. We pray to one single understanding person. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>the</b> tactics of those Trinitarians at Nicaea, who stuck their fingers in their ears, have prevailed in this world; this was no matter for discussion, they declared, it was a Holy Mystery full of magical terror, and few religious people have thought it worth while to revive these terrors by a definite contradiction. The truly religious have been content to lapse quietly into the comparative sanity of an unformulated Arianism, they have left it to the scoffing Atheist to mock at the patent absurdities of the official creed. But one magnificent protest against this theological fantasy must have been the work of a sincerely religious man, the cold superb humour of that burlesque creed, ascribed, at first no doubt facetiously and then quite seriously, to Saint Athanasius the Great, which, by an irony far beyond its original intention, has become at last the accepted creed of the church.|$|E
