5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{industrial}} development in Minneapolis was tied to St. Anthony Falls and the power it provided. Between 1848 and 1887, Minneapolis {{led the nation in}} sawmilling. In 1856, the mills produced 12 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (28,000 m³) of lumber. That total had risen to about 91,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (215,000 m³) in 1869, and 960,000,000 <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (2,270,000 m³) in 1899. During the peak of this activity, at least 13 sawmills were operating on the falls. The sawmills also supported related industries such as mills that planed and smoothed the lumber; factories that built sashes, doors, and windows; and manufacturers of shingles and wooden buckets.|$|E
5|$|Commercial logging {{had also}} been {{operating}} for years in the Trinity River country, {{but most of the}} timber produced was used locally. After World War II, logging greatly increased both due to high demand for housing domestically and abroad, and the introduction of more advanced technologies. In 1959 alone, loggers took 439 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> from Trinity County. The rate dropped after that, but logging continued at 200–300 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> per year well into the 1980s. Many logged areas were on steep mountains, and improper construction of roads and skid trails exposed slopes to erosion and landslides. In 1988 several environmentalist groups including the Wilderness Society, Audubon Society and Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the Forest Service, preventing the cutting of 18.4 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of salvage lumber in an area with particularly high erosion risk. This generated pushback in the local timber industry, whose decline has partly been attributed to more stringent environmental regulations.|$|E
5|$|Under the O Act, the Department of the Interior {{under its}} General Land Office and later succeeded by the Bureau of Land Management, managed more than 44 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of {{standing}} inventory in 1937 {{into more than}} 60 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> by the mid-1990s, and harvested more than 44 billion <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> over that time period. In 1951, the U.S. Treasury had been fully reimbursed, and the 25 percent of the revenue that had previously gone to the Treasury now reverted to the counties; in 1953, the counties opted to divert that money to maintenance {{of the land and}} roads, reforestation, as well as recreational facilities and other improvements. A 1970 GAO report contained an estimate that from its implementation through 1969, the counties had received a total of $300 million {{as a result of the}} Act. The authors of the report also estimated that most counties received more from the government payments than they would have if the land had been held privately.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, in his {{capacity}} as chair of the New England Forestry Commission, Brown worked with the War Industries Board to send 10 sawmills abroad. The equipment went to Scotland to meet Britain's need for lumber. When the war effort in France subsequently required more than 73 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of lumber per month, Brown was commissioned as a major to oversee sawmill operations there, but ultimately was not allowed to serve in France because of his poor vision, as he was partially blind in one eye.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of {{the project}} {{suggested}} that the cheap electricity provided by the dam would be a strong enticement for electricity-intensive industries, such as aluminum smelting, to move to Alaska. They were encouraged by a 1962 economic feasibility study by the Development and Resources Corporation, which stated that the electricity generated would attract aluminum, magnesium and titanium industries to the region and help process locally produced minerals. The report also stated that the dam would attract a wood pulp mill on at least a temporary basis to process {{the hundreds of millions}} of <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of timber that would otherwise be lost as the dam's reservoir flooded. The authors of the DRC report were specific enough to predict that 19,746 jobs would be created by the dam's construction—not including jobs opened during the construction process. Both the 1962 study, and another report by University of Michigan researcher Michael Brewer in 1966, stated that tens of thousands of jobs would be created by the construction process alone, even if the cheap electricity generated by the dam failed to attract any additional industries to Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Mining in the creek's {{watershed}} {{began in}} 1844. A number of mining villages {{existed in the}} Tangascootack Creek watershed between 1845 and 1870. In the mid-1850s the Farrandsville Iron Company purchased large amounts of land in several places, including along Tangascootack Creek. In 1870 all of the mines in the area closed and lumbering became the area's most significant industry, with millions of <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> being floated downstream. The railroad tracks were removed and the mine buildings were abandoned or burned down. However, deep mining of the Clarion coal formation and the Lower Kittaning coal formation in the Tangascootack Creek watershed began in the 1800s and continued into the early 1900s. Strip mining operations began in the 1950s and 1960s, {{with some of the}} deep mines and surface mines being remined in the 1980s. The Independent Regulatory Review Commission issued a statement in the summer of 1987, saying that part of the North Fork Tangascootack Creek watershed was no longer suitable for surface mining. Treatment of the watershed began as early as 1998. Several projects devoted to improving the water quality of the creek had begun by 2001, by which point several more projects were planned. At least one of these projects involves the use of biosolids to encourage vegetation growth.|$|E
50|$|Portable mills {{have also}} been used in {{conjunction}} with salvage logging operations. In salvage logging, logs that were lost underwater during nineteenth-century river-borne log drives are recovered by divers. These logs are often worth many thousands of dollars. The thin kerf blade of the portable sawmill allows for much higher <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> yields from these valuable logs.|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of well-stocked second-growth coastal redwood stands to {{three levels of}} commercial thinning is reported after 29 years of growth. Commercial thinning treatments left 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent and 100 percent (uncut control) of the original basal area (400 ft 2 per acre) in a 40 -year old stand on the Jackson Demonstration State Forest. Stand values are given for basal area, number of trees, average diameter, and cubic <b>foot</b> volume and <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> volume per acre for the pre-treatment stand and five post-treatment inventory dates from 1970 to 1999. There were {{significant differences between the}} treatments in basal area, average diameter, and volume throughout the course of the study. Analysis of the periodic growth rate revealed strong statistical differences between the treatments in diameter growth but no significant differences in the basal area or volume growth (cubic and <b>board</b> <b>foot).</b> Total <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> volume was not statistically different between thinning treatments due to high variation but there is a trend indicating that the 25 percent retention treatment produced a lower yield than the other two treatments and the uncut control. Though this was not a regeneration harvest, regeneration was measured for inference to partial harvest management. The {{response of}} the understory regeneration was strongly affected by the density of the overstory canopy. A precommercial thinning study of the redwood sprouts showed a response only in the 25 percent overstory retention treatment...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermal {{insulation}} with thermal resistivities of {{at least}} 20 (h ft 2 F/ Btu in.) {{have been shown to}} have the potential for significant energy conservation if employed in residential and commercial refrigerator/freezers Many materials and systems have been proposed which may be incorporated into refrigerator/freezers to achieve this potential. The current state of the art for advanced evacuated insulations which may achieve resistivities of 20 was established by reviewing data on many materials available in the open literature on the dependence of the thermal performance on internal pressure. The costs for the powdered, fiber, foam and multilayer materials were then obtained from the manufacturer of the products Possible candidate materials for m-clusion into refrigerator/freezers are described and ranked based upon their thermal properties and costs. Several materials were found that may be used to make super-insulation panels with material costs of less than $ 1. 00 per <b>board</b> <b>foot,</b> if a plastic laminate is used for the container required to maintain the necessary vacuum. Materials falling in this category included. Beverly silica dust, open-cell polyurethane foam, fine perlite, 2. 7 lb/ft 3 fiberglass and 3. 6 lb/ft 3 fiberglass opacified with vapor-deposited alu-minum, precipitated silica, and mixtures of precipitated silica and fly ash. Mate-rial costs approaching $ 3. 00 per <b>board</b> <b>foot</b> will result if metallic contamment is required...|$|R

25|$|In late 1918, the Morse Dry Dock {{company began}} work on a new {{sectional}} floating dry dock. Constructed from at least three million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> of timber, and {{said to be a}} far more complex and difficult task than the building of a ship, the $1,000,000 dock was six years in the planning and took more than twelve months to build. It was constructed section by section at an ancillary yard of the company at the foot of 63rd St., Brooklyn. By March 1919, the first three sections were ready and were put to use {{for the first time in}} lifting the steamer Black Arrow out of the water, at the rate of one foot per minute.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though both}} plants were busy during the war, {{the company did}} not prosper in the forties due to {{shortages}} of lumber and labor as the country's workforce went to war. Minutes of the 1946 stockholders' meeting show the company's lumber inventory had been reduced, from over 3 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> in 1942, to just over a million in 1946. After the war, there was pent-up demand not only for boxes and crates, but also for furniture that the Tacoma plant had been producing. The company expanded to produce box-springs, and began an effort to improve handling of lumber to be kiln-dried. Both plants also continued to replace aging steam engines and boilers with electrical mill machinery. But there were no dividends distributed to stockholders for 1946. The trends of the decade were higher wages, shortages of materials, higher prices, and heavy competition, especially from local non-unionized factories.|$|E
25|$|The Susquehanna Boom {{lost its}} {{profitability}} for three main reasons. First was the periodic floods that swept down the West Branch Valley following the winter snow melt and the spring rains. The West Branch Valley was devastated by a flood in 1894. The sawmills {{along the river}} were largely destroyed. The boom was washed away close to two million of <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> (5,000 m³) of freshly cut timber were washed down the Susquehanna River. Second were the newly constructed railroads in North Central Pennsylvania. These railroads were able to transport the fresh timber more quickly and were less risky, expensive and dangerous than floating the logs down the West Branch Susquehanna River and its tributaries. Thirdly, little thought for the future was placed when the massive stands of old growth forest were harvested during the 19th century. The mountains were clear cut. The tops of the trees were left to dry. The passing steam trains spread burning embers along the railroad tracks. These embers would spark devastating fires that prevented the forests from regrowing. Without trees the sawmills could no longer process timber, the mills closed and eventually the boom itself was forced to close in 1908.|$|E

500|$|On August 28, 2014, Stanislaus Forest {{supervisor}} Susan Skalski {{signed a}} Record of Decision approving the Rim Fire Recovery Project. The plan allowed logging within {{an area of}} , including interior portions of the burned area and along roadways. Its goals were to: [...] "Salvage dead trees to capture economic value; remove roadside hazard trees to protect public and worker safety; reduce fuels for future forest resiliency; improve roads for hydrologic function; and, enhance wildlife habitat. A portion of the money captured from the salvage logging was ear-marked for additional projects following the fire." [...] The plan attempted to balance competing interests. Instead of the 660 million <b>board</b> <b>feet</b> initially proposed for logging, the final plan included salvage logging of 210 million <b>board</b> <b>feet.</b> The plan left small areas untouched as snag habitat for Black-Backed Woodpeckers and other snag-dependent wildlife. Instead of building permanent new roads, the plan eliminated permanent new road construction and reduced the mileage of temporary roads {{as part of the}} salvage logging plan. The Forest Service said that the final plan reflected a collaboration between the timber industry and various environmental groups, who had joined together in an attempt to find consensus on the recovery process. Skalski cited that collaborative agreement as being influential in her decision to significantly reduce the amount of salvage material. Forestry officials praised the plan, but some environmental groups denounced it.|$|E
