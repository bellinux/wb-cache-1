A large amount of residual biomass is available, due to residual product from pruning, forest maintenance and food chain.

5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the <b>biomass</b> <b>conversion</b> were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

Cynara cardunculus (cardoon) pretreated by steam explosion (SE) was involved in second-generation bioethanol production using separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) or simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) processes. Steam explosion pretreatment led to partial solubilisation of hemicelluloses and increased the accessibility of residual polysaccharides towards enzymatic hydrolysis revealing 64 % of sugars yield against 11 % from untreated plant material. Alkaline extraction after SE pretreatment of cardoon (CSEOH) promoted partial removal of degraded lignin, tannins, extractives and hemicelluloses thus allowing to double glucose concentration upon saccharification step. Bioethanol fermentation in SSF mode was faster than SHF process providing the best results: ethanol concentration 18. 7 g L- 1, fermentation efficiency of 66. 6 % and a yield of 26. 6 g ethanol/ 100 g CSEOH or 10. 1 g ethanol/ 100 g untreated cardoon.

40|$|Bifunctional nickel {{tungsten}} carbide catalysis {{was used for}} the conversion of aqueous sugar solutions into short-chain polyols such as ethylene glycol. It is shown that very concentrated sugar solutions, viz, up to 0. 2 kg L - 1, can be converted without toss of ethylene glycol selectivity by gradually feeding the sugar solution. Detailed investigation of the reaction network shows that, under the applied reaction conditions, glucose is converted via a retro-aldol reaction into glycol aldehyde, which is further transformed into ethylene glycol by hydrogenation. The main byproducts are sorbitol, erythritol, glycerol and 1, 2 -propanediol.

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} due {{to rising}} CO 2 emissions have made biomass an indispensable source of renewable fuels and chemicals. However, biomass inherently has high oxygen content, which translates to low energy density, thereby necessitating a deoxygenation step before being utilized as fuels. Recently, MoO 3 and Mo 2 C {{have emerged as}} promising earth-abundant cheap catalysts that perform hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) at relatively low temperatures (673 K) and ambient H 2 pressures wherein oxygen is selectively removed as water. However, there exists a significant knowledge gap in understanding the stability and the active phases responsible for HDO of these catalysts. Furthermore, their applicability for real <b>biomass</b> <b>conversions</b> has not been largely demonstrated. In this thesis, first, HDO of m-cresol, a biomass-derived model compound, is investigated over bulk and supported MoO 3 catalysts. Detailed reactivity and characterization studies reveal that Mo 5 + species plays a critical role during HDO. Specifically, TiO 2 and ZrO 2 are identified as ideal supports as they feature superior HDO reactivity and stability over bulk MoO 3 by stabilizing intermediate Mo oxidation states (i. e. Mo 5 +) while bulk MoO 3 over-reduces to inactive metallic Mo. Translating from model compound studies, supported MoO 3 catalysts are demonstrated {{to be effective in}} converting biomass (pine) pyrolysis vapors to hydrocarbons (ca. 30 % yield). In comparison with MoO 3, Mo 2 C is significantly more stable and selective for HDO of 4 -methylanisole to toluene under identical reaction conditions. Mo 2 C predominantly breaks the stronger phenolic C- 0 bond while MoO 3 also breaks the weaker aliphatic C- 0 bond, likely due to the presence of Bronsted acid sites. To gain insights into the surface active sites, operando near-ambient XPS is employed during HDO and this technique revealed that HDO seems to operate via distinct active sites over both these materials. Finally, Mo 2 C is shown to be effective in upgrading real lignin streams to a single product propylbenzene, a precursor for renewable polymer. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the applicability of MoO 3 and Mo 2 C in real <b>biomass</b> <b>conversions</b> and provides insights on the working nature of these catalysts, which will enable the design of more effective HDO catalysts. by Karthick Murugappan.

The knowledge {{of individual}} biomass concentrations allows for the calculation of <b>biomass</b> specific <b>conversion</b> rates which {{form the basis of}} anaerobic digestion models. Only few attempts addressed the absolute quantification of individual biomass concentrations in methanogenic microbial ecosystems which has so far impaired the calculation of <b>biomass</b> specific <b>conversion</b> rates and thus model validation. This study proposes a quantitative PCR (qPCR) approach for the direct determination of individual biomass concentrations in methanogenic microbial associations by correlating the native qPCR signal (cycle threshold, Ct) to individual biomass concentrations (mg dry matter/L). Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach circumvents error-prone conversion factors that are typically used to convert gene copy numbers or cell concentrations into actual biomass concentrations. The newly developed method was assessed and deemed suitable for the determination of individual biomass concentrations in a defined coculture of Desulfovibrio sp.
