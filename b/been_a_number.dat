5|$|A key {{influence}} on the plot of The Calculus Affair was an article that Hergé had read in a February 1954 issue of the Belgian weekly La Face à Main, reporting that there had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of incidents along the road from Portsmouth to London in southern England in which motorists' car windscreens had spontaneously shattered; the article's author suggested {{that it may have}} been caused by experiments undertaken in a nearby secret facility.

5|$|A more {{substantial}} Bronze Age settlement {{is known to}} have existed; the remains of what may have been a causeway were discovered in 1934, in the form of wooden piles unearthed by a farmer between Little Thetford and nearby Barway.

There have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of Bronze Age finds in the area, including a pre–701BC palstave at nearby Fordey farm, Barway, and at Little Thetford, a middle Bronze Age (1600–1001BC) rapier in 1953, and a late Bronze Age flesh-hook in 1929.|$|E

There have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of proposed missions afterwards however, and many of these involve the little-known upper atmosphere. The Soviet Vega program in 1985 dropped two balloons into the atmosphere, but these were battery-powered and lasted for only about two Earth days each before running out of power. Since then, there has been no exploration of the upper atmosphere. In 2002, the NASA contractor Global Aerospace proposed a balloon that would be capable of staying in the upper atmosphere for hundreds of Earth days as opposed to two.|$|E

Other blasts followed at the Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station near the waiting area next to the travel office.

The work was filmed in 1931 by The Teng Chun and then in 1975 by Fred Young and Rempo Urip.

The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this work}} we propose an {{approach}} to prioritizing order of transmission of sensed data in wireless sensor network that are very popular in, for example, environmental monitoring. The approach is based on determination of a consensus relation which is in "nearest distance " from all initial rankings shaped by multiple sensors of each network node. Statistically and probabilistically based analytical models useful for assuring network performance and providing reasonable number values n – k and m are proposed and discussed, where n – k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of packets transmitted to the sink; n <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of the network sensor nodes; k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of dropped packets due to a congestion; and m <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of node sensors (or rankings) ...|$|R

5|$|There have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> of {{proposals}} {{to extend the}} O-Bahn to Golden Grove or build other routes, however none have progressed beyond consultation. An extension to Golden Grove would require the acquisition of extensive tracts of private property, due {{to the absence of}} an available corridor. Population increase in the area is negligible, although sprawl continues from Tea Tree Plaza Interchange for another eight kilometres to the Adelaide Hills. The current route was built with an allowance for a station at Grand Junction Road but it has not been built.|$|E
