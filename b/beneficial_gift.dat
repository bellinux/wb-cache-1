25|$|The most {{important}} factor dominating the river history in Bengal is the large proportion of silt carried by its rivers. It is the silt which has created the land and made it habitable by building it up through the centuries. It is silt which is fertilising the land, but the silt, {{which has been the}} most <b>beneficial</b> <b>gift</b> of nature, has also produced most of the river problems now confronting the people of Bengal. Silt deposited in the old river channel beds has forced them to change course, creating problems for abandoned areas while assisting in developing new areas.|$|E
5000|$|Special {{problems}} arise {{in connection with}} the holding of property by unincorporated associations of persons. Whereas a company has separate legal personality and can hold property, with certain statutory exceptions, unincorporated associations of persons cannot. Accordingly, where an unincorporated association is formed for a non-charitable purpose (which is most often the case), a gift to an unincorporated association can fail as an invalid purpose trust. [...] However, the courts have usually tried to avoid such a result by construing the gift as a gift {{to the members of the}} unincorporated association. [...] The difficulty is that such a gift would then have to be construed as a distributive gift to the individual members, rather than a purposive gift for the objects of the unincorporated association. In Re Recher's Will Trust 1972 Ch 526 a more purposive approach was taken, and Brightman J held that a gift to The London and Provincial Anti-Vivisection Society was to be construed as a <b>beneficial</b> <b>gift</b> in favour of the members, not so as to entitle them to an immediate distributive share, but as an accretion to the funds of the society subject to the contract of the members as set out in the rules. [...] Further, it was held that such a construction would be possible whether the society was inward looking (i.e. existed to promote the interests of its members) or outward looking (i.e. existed to promote some external cause or purpose).|$|E
25|$|As a Big Daddy, {{the player}} can attempt to defeat other Big Daddies who are {{themselves}} escorting Little Sisters. Should the player succeed, {{they can then}} choose to either harvest or adopt the Little Sister. While adopted, the Little Sister can lead the player to corpses from whom she can extract more ADAM. While she does this, the player must defend her from splicer attacks and other foes. Once the Little Sister has collected enough ADAM, the player can then return her to an escape vent, where the player must choose to either rescue or harvest the Little Sister. Rescuing her gives the player a modest amount of ADAM but also the possibility of <b>beneficial</b> <b>gifts</b> later; harvesting her yields a large ADAM boost. ADAM can then be spent at Gatherer's Garden machines throughout Rapture to buy new plasmids, gene tonics, slots, or health/eve upgrades. Once the player has either rescued or harvested each of the Little Sisters on the level, the player will be attacked by a Big Sister. The Big Sister's agility and resourcefulness will task the player with a difficult fight before the player can proceed further in the game.|$|R
40|$|Microsurgery is the {{treatment}} of choice for most patients with a tubal factor. In-vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (TVF-ET) is performed in patients with the so-called classical indications: bilateral salpingectomy and tubal damage which is not correctable by means of microsurgery. We also discuss FVF in patients who have not conceived within 1 to 2 years following microsurgery. In women with tubal re-occlusion FVF should be performed. In patients with patent tubes following microsurgery, gamete intra-Fallopian transfer (GUT) forms part of a controlled clinical study. More clinical experience can perhaps solve the dilemma whether it is <b>beneficial</b> to perform <b>GIFT</b> or to offer IVF primarily to these patients. In patients with andrological infertility, GIFT is offered after six unsuccessful attempts of intrauterine insemination (IUI). In long-standing infertility, GIFT is performed when IUI with ovarian stimulation fails. Patients with genital pathology (patent tubes) are treated with GIFT unless it is not technically feasible. In these cases microsurgery or FVF should be discussed. Key words: gamete intra-Fallopian transfer/TVF therapy/ microsurgery of oviduct/tubal embryo transfe...|$|R
40|$|Female mate choice {{has been}} shown to provide direct mating {{benefits}} in several animal groups. In butterflies, for which there are increasing reports of fine-scale color-based mate choice, the evolutionary benefits that accrue from such mating biases, if any, are largely unknown. We addressed this issue in the butterfly Colias eurytheme, a species in which females choose mates on the basis of iridescent ultraviolet (UV) wing ornamentation and in which males donate reproductively <b>beneficial</b> nuptial <b>gifts.</b> In the first experiment, we assessed the mass of gifts donated to 77 virgin females by males sampled directly from a field encounter site. Despite large variance in the male adult phenotype and ejaculate, no single aspect of dorsal wing coloration, including UV brightness, chroma, or hue, was related to ejaculate mass. There was, however, an interesting interaction between the effects of male body size and copula duration upon ejaculate mass, with size scaling positively with ejaculate mass among males involved in shorter copulations (those lasting < 70 min) but negatively among males in longer copulations. In the second experiment, we assessed the lifetime fecundity, fertility, and longevity of 85 females mated under similar circumstances to free-flying wild males. Although several wing color parameters proved subtly informative in more sophisticated multivariable models, no model predicted more than about 20 % of the variation in any single female fitness parameter. The duration of copulation, which ranged from 35 min to over 16 h and which carries putative costs for females, was, again, only very weakly predicted by male wing color parameters (i. e., R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 089). Given the overall minor predictive power of male wing coloration in general and of UV brightness in particular, our results do not strongly support the hypothesis that female C. eurytheme prefer bright UV males to obtain direct benefits or to minimize the costs associated with lengthy copulations...|$|R
