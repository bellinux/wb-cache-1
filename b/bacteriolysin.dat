40|$|Non{{hemolytic}} Escherichia coli were {{outnumbered by}} hemolytic E. coli within 24 h after being inoculated in a mixed culture at an initial ratio of 200 nonhemolytic to 1 hemolytic organism. The hemolytic strain {{was found to}} produce a cell-free, filterable substance which causes lysis of nonhemolytic E. coli B when grown in liquid cultures but not when grown on agar plates. The <b>bacteriolysin</b> is inactivated by boiling, by freezing and thawing, and by incubation with trypsin. The inability to inhibit growth on an agar plate, dependence on cell concentration for its effect, lysis of the sensitive cells, and appearance of phage particles in the cell lysates suggest that this substance is not like colicins or microcins previously described. After lysis of E. coli B, bacteriophage particles were visible in transmission electron micrographs of material pelleted by ultracentrifugation. However, no bacteriophage were observed in pellets from the bacteriolysin-containing supernatants before lysis of E. coli B. Failure to find bacteriophage in these preparations, {{and the fact that}} some <b>bacteriolysin</b> activity remains in the supernatant solution after centrifugation at 150, 000 X g for 6. 5 h, indicate that the <b>bacteriolysin</b> is not itself a bacteriophage. Exposure of E. coli B to UV light and mitomycin C did not induce production of a temperate phage. The properties of this system, in which a cell-free substance produced by one strain of bacteria causes lysis of another strain, appear to differ from those of the various types of bacteriocins and bacteriophages described to date...|$|E
40|$|The {{cutaneous}} reaction {{demonstrates that}} the culture lysate of Streptococcus scarlatinæ is approximately ten time more potent in its toxic effect than is the culture filtrate since repeated and carefully controlled human skin tests show that 0. 1 cc. of a 1 : 2000 dilution of lysate reacts equally {{as well as a}} similar dose of a 1 : 250 dilution of culture filtrate (Dick's standard skin unit). Animal tests and the human intradermal reaction clearly reveal that the toxic principle of culture filtrate (Dick's toxin) and culture lysate (Duval-Hibbard endotoxin) are of the same nature) namely intracellular derivatives of the streptococcal cell. The in vivo prepared lysate affords a more potent antigen for the production of an antiendotoxic serum than the living, killed or culture filtrate of Streptococcus scarlatinæ. The inoculations into dogs of culture filtrate and of the "washed coccal bodies" yield strikingly different results. In those that receive filtrate no toxic effect is produced while in the ones injected with the washed coccal bodies a severe and often fatal toxemia results. The dog is highly susceptible to infection with Streptococcus scarlatinæ and also readily affected by injections of the in vivo prepared lysate. Toxic effects are produced almost immediately following the intravenous injection of lysate and death usually occurs in 24 to 48 hours from an acute hemorrhagic nephritis. Daily urinary examination shows a high percentage of albumin, large numbers of fine granular casts and quantities of macroscopic blood. A study of the kidney sections reveals an extensive glomerulonephritis. The work reported constitutes further evidence in support of our original contention that the poisonous substance of the scarlatinal streptococcus is derived from the bacterial cell set free through the dissolution of the germ plasm. The liberation of the poison in vitro occurs as the natural result of autolysis while in vivo it is produced through specific action of <b>bacteriolysin...</b>|$|E

The {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{scientific}} grounding and development of polyalternative biotechnology of multivariate antiseptic preparations based on <b>bacteriolysin</b> and other antimicrobial products of the selected producer Streptomyces albus UN 44 with activity heightened in 4 ? 4, 5 times. The scheme of the supporting selection of producers, that includes step treatment with mutagens of different nature (nitrous acid, ultraviolet radiation, N-methyl-N'-nitro-N- nitrosoguanidine) in set effective doses was proposed, and subsequent selection of overproducers. The complex taxonomic analysis of culture was first conducted, with the definition of the nucleotide sequence of 16 S rRNA gene and morphological, biochemical and biosynthetic features, that allowed to reidentify the culture as S. albus (initially S. recifensis var. lyticus). The possibility of replacing the hydrolyzed starch to molasses {{as a part of the}} nutrient medium for the biosynthesis of bacteriolysins by the selected strain was shown. Using the method of two-factor analysis of variance and central composite rotatable plan, the concentration of these components was optimized, which determined the price reduction of nutrient medium in 1, 5 - 2 times and the increase of the biosynthetic activity of the culture by 30 - 40 %. The increased stability and efficiency of the immobilized form of the bacteriolytic preparation from S. albus UN 44 were detected, which was prepared using adsorption on aerosil silica, and the main binding mechanisms in the enzymecarrier system were shown ? hydrogen bonds with silanol and OH-groups on the carrier surface, and the electrostatic interactions. The technological parameters of obtaining the immobilized drug were determined and became the basis of the Regulation (PR 20. 59 - 02070987 - 001 : 2015) and biotechnology of the bacteriolytic drug Cytorecifen-M, which has been implemented at SE "Enzyme". It was shown, that the antimicrobial action of the immobilized drug is not only useful on clinical strains of pathogens in a state of suspension, but leads to the inhibition (in 8 - 10 times) and the destruction of P. aeruginosa biomembrane. Stability of the bacteriolytic complex of S. albus UN 44 when stored in a liquid phase of culture fluid at a temperature to + 10 ?C and using of the sterilizing filtration has identified the possibility of developing a liquid form of antiseptics. Prospects for the use of this drug in veterinary medicine (and potentially medicine) are caused by the detected harmlessness of the producer, which is attributed to the group of the avirulent microorganisms (IV class of danger). The ability of the culture to synthesize complex antibiotics, which were identified using the matched system of two-stage extraction and fractionation, was detected for the first time. Using the methods of chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, the main antibiotic compounds of the culture were investigated and identified: bis (2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (C 24 H 38 O 4) and 3 -O-metylcyclopolic acid (C 12 H 14 O 6) with molecular masses of 390, 3 and 254, 1 respectively. For obtaining the antibiotics of antifungal and antibacterial specificity, the extraction and fractionation system was chosen, using column chromatography and the eluents, accordingly, chloroform:isopropanol (97 : 3 ? 80 : 20) and chloroform or hexane:chloroform (1 : 1). The determined conditions of allocation of antibiotics were used to develop the technological foundations for obtaining another form of medication-antiseptic from S. albus UN 44. For the first time was defined the high antagonistic activity of S. albus UN 44 towards relatively common phytopathogenes of genera Bipolaris, Fusarium, Phytium, Rizoctonia, along with the shown growth-stimulating activity determines the feasibility of using one of the developed forms of antiseptics in crop. The culture fluid preparation with a concentration 108 ? 109 CFU/cm 3 can be produced in the form of a suspension or dried and granulated form. The immobilized form of the enzyme preparation is used in the development of patented synthetic detergent with antiseptic effect, which is recommended for everyday use and for washing in hospitals. The possibility of the Cytal drug usage was shown in the processes of the food industry for the preparation of bakery improver, that improves the product quality in organoleptic characteristics and the porosity (7 %). The mode of biomass degradation of selected lactic acid bacteria cultures using bacteriolysins for obtaining dietary supplements was developed and put into production. The composition of the mild medical form (ointment) was matched, using the Cytal preparation, which contains formative components in certain concentrations (polyethylene, polyethylene glycol, proxanol 268, glycerin), anesthetic (lidocaine), preservative (ofloxacin) and reveals the prolonged antimicrobial action. Based on the research, the technical design for essential equipment and biotechnology of various forms of antiseptic drugs were developed, the normative documentation for the production and recommendations for the use of drugs were approved. Some technologies and processes were tested and put into production, practice and teaching process. The practical significance of the results was confirmed by relevant implementing regulations, recommendations for use and patents. ??????????? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ?????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ?????? ???? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????? ??????????????????? ?????????? ???????????????

40|$|In {{a recent}} review of our present {{knowledge}} of immunity in tuberculosis LSwenstein (1) says, "What is {{the fate of the}} newly introduced tubercle bacilli in the tuberculous organism? Easy as it would seem to decide this question, yet how little do we now know about it with certainty. " It is generally assumed that tubercle bacilli of reinfection are destroyed (2), although Krause and Willis (3) are of the opinion that immunity to reinfection is primarily due not to specific <b>bacteriolysins,</b> which destroy the bacilli, but to the interposition of an inflammatory barrier about them, which checks their spread in the body. There have been many experiments purporting to demonstrate a lysis of tubercle bacilli in the previously infected animal (4). These conclusions however have usually been based upon the reduction in numbers of stainable bacilli of reinfection and the tinctorial changes of those found. But when animal inoculation (5) has been used to determine the fate of tubercle bacilli of reinfection they have bee...|$|R
40|$|Lactobacilli {{constitute}} a large genus of Gram-positive {{lactic acid bacteria}} which have widespread roles ranging from gut commensals to starters in fermented foods. A combination of in silico and laboratory-based screening allowed us to determine the overall bacteriocin producing potential of representative strains of each species of the genus. The genomes of 175 lactobacilli and 38 associated species were screened {{for the presence of}} antimicrobial producing genes and combined with screening for antimicrobial activity against a range of indicators. There also appears to be a link between the strains’ environment and bacteriocin production, with those from the animal and human microbiota encoding over twice as many bacteriocins as those from other sources. Five novel bacteriocins were identified belonging to differing bacteriocin classes, including two-peptide bacteriocins (muricidin and acidocin X) and circular bacteriocins (paracyclicin). In addition, there was a clear clustering of helveticin type <b>bacteriolysins</b> in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group of species. This combined in silico and in vitro approach to screening has demonstrated the true diversity and complexity of bacteriocins across the genus. It also highlights their biological importance in terms of communication and competition between closely related strains in diverse complex microbial environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of the increased resistance to reinfection in tuberculosis is still uncertain. It has been demonstrated that bacilli of reinfection are either destroyed at once (1), if small numbers penetrate the tissues, or fail to multiply in the immune animal if large numbers invade the body (2), whereas in the normal individual the bacilli, whether many or few, at first grow unhindered. As to the {{mechanism of}} this growth inhibition in the immune animal, it may be said that, while antibodies in low titer develop during the the course of tuberculosis, {{there is no evidence}} of specific <b>bacteriolysins</b> acting in vitro (3). However, in vivo, studies have shown that in the body fluids of the immune animal the growth of tubercle bacilli is much less than that taking place in the body fluids of normal animals (2, 4). Since the bacillus multiplies not only in the tissue fluids but especially within the cytoplasm of the cells of the normal animal (5), the apparent failure of the microorganism to multiply within the phagocytes of the immune animal (6) must be explained. The increased rapidity of the mobilization of mononuclear phagocytes a...|$|R
40|$|Background The human gut {{microbiota}} comprises approximately 100 trillion microbial cells which significantly impact {{many aspects}} of human physiology - including metabolism, nutrient absorption and immune function. Disturbances in this population have been implicated in many conditions and diseases, including obesity, type- 2 diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. This suggests that targeted manipulation or shaping of the gut microbiota, by bacteriocins and other antimicrobials, has potential as a therapeutic tool for the prevention or treatment of these conditions. With this in mind, several studies have used traditional culture-dependent approaches to successfully identify bacteriocin-producers from the mammalian gut. In silico-based approaches to identify novel gene clusters are now also being utilised {{to take advantage of}} the vast amount of data currently being generated by next generation sequencing technologies. In this study, we employed an in silico screening approach to mine potential bacteriocin clusters in genome-sequenced isolates from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). More specifically, the bacteriocin genome-mining tool BAGEL 3 was used to identify potential bacteriocin producers in the genomes of the GIT subset of the Human Microbiome Project’s reference genome database. Each of the identified gene clusters were manually annotated and potential bacteriocin-associated genes were evaluated. Results We identified 74 clusters of note from 59 unique members of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Synergistetes. The most commonly identified class of bacteriocin was the > 10  kDa class, formerly known as <b>bacteriolysins,</b> followed by lantibiotics and sactipeptides. Conclusions Multiple bacteriocin gene clusters were identified in a dataset representative of the human gut microbiota. Interestingly, many of these were associated with species and genera which are not typically associated with bacteriocin production. peer-reviewedCJW, CMG and PDC are supported by a SFI PI award to PDC “Obesibiotics” (11 /PI/ 1137) ...|$|R
