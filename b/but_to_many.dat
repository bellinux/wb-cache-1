5|$|The {{goodwill}} {{generated by}} this surprising {{turn of events}} defused the situation, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> observers the scene on the balcony was mere theatricality without long-term resonance.

5|$|Mount Saint Peter Church was {{magnificent}} {{and rose}} {{up on the}} hill, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>many,</b> {{it seemed as if}} it could not really belong to the congregation. It was much richer than Saint Peter Church and {{if it had not been}} labored upon by so many members of the congregation, none would have felt worthy to call it their parish. But since so much work, love, and faith had been spent on this place of worship, parishioners became proud to have the honor of attending Mass there every Sunday. As a construction site, it had held some dangers. On September 28, 1941, a group of teenage boys, just out of high school, were making concrete flooring for the church at the Burrell Construction Company. A large crane operating above them made an unusual movement, causing its bucket, which weighed several tons, to come down with a huge crash right in their midst. All the working tools were completely destroyed but none of the boys were hurt. The bronze door at the front entrance fell on a worker, and everyone believed he had been crushed to death. When ten men lifted the door, they found the worker unharmed underneath it. In another case, an 18-year-old was assigned a job on the tower of the church before it was roofed. No one realized that he had poor eyesight and he fell from the tower while working. On his way down, he was able to grab onto a pulley that was suspended from the tower.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 20th century was marked {{by a number of}} notable new publications. A monthly magazine named Bharat Ratna was started from Patna in 1901. It was followed by Ksahtriya Hitaishi, Aryavarta from Dinapure, Patna, Udyoga and Chaitanya Chandrika. Udyog was edited by Vijyaanand Tripathy, a famous poet of the time and Chaitanya Chandrika by Krishna Chaitanya Goswami, a literary figure of that time. The literary activity was not confined to Patna alone <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> districts of Bihar.|$|E

25|$|Froese's {{most notable}} {{association}} was his partnership with Christopher Franke. Franke joined Tangerine Dream in 1970 after serving {{time in the}} group Agitation Free, originally to replace Schulze as the drummer. Franke is credited with starting to use electronic sequencers, which were introduced on Phaedra, a development that had not only a large impact on the group's music, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> electronic musicians to this day. Franke stayed with the group for 17 years, leaving in 1987 because of exhausting touring schedules as well as creative differences with Froese.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Sunday {{probably}} preached to more than one hundred million people face-to-face—and, to the great majority, without electronic amplification. Vast numbers [...] "hit the sawdust trail." [...] Although the usual total given for those who came forward at invitations is an even million, one modern historian estimates the true figure to be closer to 1,250,000. Sunday did not preach to a hundred million different individuals <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> of the same people repeatedly over {{the course of}} a campaign. Before his death, Sunday estimated that he had preached nearly 20,000 sermons, an average of 42 per month from 1896 to 1935. During his heyday, when he was preaching more than twenty times each week, his crowds were often huge. Even in 1923, well into the period of his decline, 479,300 people attended the 79 meetings of the six-week 1923 Columbia, South Carolina, campaign–23 times the white population of Columbia. Nevertheless,"trail hitters" [...] were not necessarily conversions (or even [...] "reconsecrations") to Christianity. Sometimes whole groups of club members came forward en masse at Sunday's prodding. By 1927, Rodeheaver was complaining that Sunday's invitations had become so general that they were meaningless.|$|E
500|$|Veteran dog breeders of {{the times}} were the primary critics of the novel, chastising Terhune's {{depiction}} of an unrealistically perfect collie that would mislead the public into believing such a dog could exist. The anniversary and subsequent editions, featuring a sable-and-white collie, also drew criticism from loyal readers as it did not resemble Lad. New York Times Book Review reviewer Alden Welch felt the full novel would [...] "surely appeal not only to all lovers and masters of dogs, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> who have never owned any and who have no general and indiscriminate liking for them." [...] He found the stories [...] "interesting" [...] and a [...] "most welcome addition to dog-literature", praising the novel as the most [...] "delightfully written" [...] of Terhune's works to date. In 1968, Sports Illustrateds Robert H. Boyle stated that Terhune's stories were responsible {{for many of the}} active collie breeders at the time getting involved in the sport. Calling the author a [...] "godlike figure" [...] and the hero of [...] "goggle-eyed youngsters of the 1920s, '30s and even into the '40s." [...] In comparing the work to popular collie character Lassie, Boyle noted that rather than having Lassie's seeming immortality, Terhune's dogs [...] "led epic lives and they had epic deaths".|$|E

500|$|Boyce {{was born}} on June 16, 1858 in New Texas, Pennsylvania— now Plum Borough—to a Presbyterian farm couple, David and Margaret Jane Bratton Boyce. The Boyces had three children: William Dickson, Mary, and John. During his rural childhood, Boyce {{acquired}} a love for the outdoors. He began teaching school {{at the age of}} 16 and then worked briefly as a coal miner. He returned to teaching before joining his sister at Wooster Academy in Ohio, which—according to school records—he attended from 1880 to 1881. It is uncertain if he graduated or was expelled. He then worked as a teacher, lumberjack, secretary, and salesman in the Midwest and Canada before settling in Chicago, where he quickly became known as a persuasive and shrewd salesman and learned business quickly. His books on business, travel, and expeditions often used the phrase [...] "We pushed on." [...] On January 1, 1884, Boyce married Mary Jane Beacom (1865–1959), whom he had known since his Pennsylvania childhood. Boyce called her Betsy, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> her nickname was [...] "Rattlesnake Jane" [...] because she matched his skill in poker, was an expert shot, and rode horses cross saddle. It had also become obvious that she was more masculine than Boyce himself, although he had never admitted this, it became clear out of his journal.|$|E

2500|$|AllMusic critic Greg Prato has stated: [...] "Depending {{on who you}} ask, Chris de Burgh either {{specializes in}} pretentious, bombastic art rock {{disguised}} as pop or {{is a master of}} penning soaring and majestic compositions." [...] The BBC has said of de Burgh: [...] "To his millions of fans, Chris de Burgh is the ultimate romantic singer. <b>But</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> others he's a figure of fun." [...] When the staff of Melody Maker were putting together a lampoon edition of a new arts and music magazine, they chose de Burgh for the cover. His signature song, [...] "The Lady in Red", has been repeatedly voted one of the public's most disliked songs. Neil Norman, writing for The Independent, described de Burgh as [...] "the world's naffest balladeer". In his favour, Mike DeGagne, writing for AllMusic, has acclaimed de Burgh as [...] "a genuine master of the soft ballad" [...] and [...] "one of the finest mood-invoking artists ever".|$|E
2500|$|Pareto {{originally}} {{used this}} distribution {{to describe the}} allocation of wealth among individuals since it seemed to show rather well {{the way that a}} larger portion of the wealth of any society is owned by a smaller percentage of the people in that society. He also used it to describe distribution of income. This idea is sometimes expressed more simply as the Pareto principle or the [...] "80-20 rule" [...] which says that 20% of the population controls 80% of the wealth. However, the 80-20 rule corresponds to a particular value of α, and in fact, Pareto's data on British income taxes in his Cours d'économie politique indicates that about 30% of the population had about 70% of the income. The probability density function (PDF) graph {{at the beginning of this}} article shows that the [...] "probability" [...] or fraction of the population that owns a small amount of wealth per person is rather high, and then decreases steadily as wealth increases. (Note that the Pareto distribution is not realistic for wealth for the lower end. In fact, net worth may even be negative.) This distribution is not limited to describing wealth or income, <b>but</b> <b>to</b> <b>many</b> situations in which an equilibrium is found in the distribution of the [...] "small" [...] to the [...] "large".
