She wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: [...] "Perhaps you will laugh when I say that {{the death of my}} old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment <b>between</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same fate." ...|$|E

500|$|Remixed {{versions}} {{of these songs}} were to {{form the basis of}} Herbert's album All the Ghosts, which was released by Naim Edge in July 2009 in Europe to critical acclaim, including four-starred reviews from The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian; the album was released in the United States in June 2010. This album also featured two further recordings– including a cover version of David Bowie's [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Suicide"– by Robert Harder, who had previously collaborated with Herbert as recording engineer of <b>Between</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Wardrobe. It was remastered for vinyl by Steve Rooke at Abbey Road Studios, London and reissued in LP format in 2010.|$|E
500|$|Herbert left Universal Classics and Jazz {{to pursue}} a less {{commercial}} and more personal musical direction and then self-financed a project in which she collaborated with Polar Bear's Seb Rochford in a production role. <b>Between</b> <b>Me</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Wardrobe, an album of self-penned songs, was recorded in three days and was never intended for general release. The album was initially made available, in 2006, on Herbert's own Monkeywood label before being picked up by Blue Note Records, making Herbert their first UK signing in 30 years. In a five-starred review, Stuart Nicholson of The Observer said that on this album she [...] "lets the lyrics do the work for her. They are well thought out, moving between artfully constructed soft-focus simplicities to poignant yearning".|$|E
500|$|He {{became a}} minor celebrity {{during the two}} months of {{volcanic}} activity preceding the eruption, giving interviews to reporters and expressing his opinion that the danger from the volcano was exaggerated, saying, [...] "I don't have any idea whether it will blow [...] But I don't believe it {{to the point that}} I'm going to pack up." [...] Truman discarded all of his concerns about the volcano and his situation, stating [...] "If the mountain goes, I'm going with it. This area is heavily timbered, Spirit Lake is in <b>between</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mountain, and the mountain is a mile away, the mountain ain't gonna hurt me." [...] According to The Bulletin, he responded to being knocked from his bed by precursor earthquakes by moving his mattress to his basement. At one point, Truman [...] "scoffed" [...] at the public's concern for his safety. He became something of a [...] "folk hero" [...] and from March until May, was the subject of many songs and poems by children. One group of children from Salem, Oregon, sent him banners inscribed [...] "Harry - We Love You", while Truman received fan letters including several marriage proposals.|$|E

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Subjects were 33, 417 residents (15, 819 males and 17, 598 females) aged 48 years or older in 2010 who were invited to undergo GHCs every year. Official records on GHCs from 2002 to 2007 <b>and</b> <b>MEs</b> from 2008 to 2010 were provided by Soka City, Saitama Prefecture, Japan. The utilization of GHCs was divided into zero times (non-utilizers), 1 – 3 times (low-frequency utilizers), and 4 – 6 times (high-frequency utilizers). Tweedie distributions in the generalized linear model were used to analyze <b>the</b> association <b>between</b> <b>MEs</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> subgroups of GHC utilization after adjustment for age and sex.
