500|$|The {{thematic}} {{content of}} heavy metal {{has long been}} a target of criticism. According to Jon Pareles, [...] "Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates... a party without limits... he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic." [...] Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others have objected to what they see as advocacy of misogyny and the occult. During the 1980s, the Parents Music Resource Center petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs. Andrew Cope states that claims that heavy metal lyrics are misogynistic are [...] "clearly misguided" [...] as these critics have [...] "overlook the overwhelming evidence that suggests otherwise." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau called metal [...] "an expressive mode [...] it sometimes seems will <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat".|$|E

And he wanted to do it his way and he wanted to do it the best way. His death was no different from his life—a work of art. He made Blackstar for us, his parting gift. I knew for a year this was the way it would be. I wasn't, however, prepared for it. He was an extraordinary man, full of love and life. He will always <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> <b>For</b> now, it is appropriate to cry".|$|E
2500|$|The 1994 and 1995 seasons {{established}} Kenseth as a short track star. Kenseth made a {{name for}} himself while driving at several Wisconsin tracks, beating nationally known drivers such as Dick Trickle and Robbie Reiser. He raced 60 times in three different cars in 1994, winning track championships at both Wisconsin International Raceway (WIR) on Thursday nights and Madison on Friday nights. Kenseth competed against Reiser at Madison, and won 12 of 17 features at the track. He won the 1994 Slinger Nationals at Slinger Super Speedway. In 1995, he repeated with back-to-back championships at Madison and WIR, plus he won the Red, White, and Blue state championship series at WIR on three Saturday nights.

Of all the countless millions who have fought and nursed and written and spoken and dug and sewn and worked in a thousand other ways to help on the business of killing, hardly any have laboured in real love of war. Ironical, indeed, that perhaps the most beautiful poem written these four years, Julian Grenfell's 'Into Battle!' was in heartfelt praise of fighting! But if one could gather the deep curses breathed by man and woman upon war since the first bugle was blown, the dirge of them could not be contained in the air which wraps this earth.|$|E
