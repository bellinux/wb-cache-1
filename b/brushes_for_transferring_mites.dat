40|$|We {{describe}} a novel interface for composition of polygonal meshes based around two artist-oriented tools: Geometry Drag-and-Drop and Mesh Clone Brush. Our drag-and-drop interface allows a complex surface part {{to be selected}} and interactively dragged to a new location. We automatically fill the hole left behind and smoothly deform the part {{to conform to the}} target surface. The artist may increase the boundary rigidity of this deformation, in which case a fair transition surface is automatically computed. Our clone <b>brush</b> allows <b>for</b> <b>transfer</b> of surface details with precise spatial control. These tools support an interaction style that has not previously been demonstrated for 3 D surfaces, allowing detailed 3 D models to be quickly assembled from arbitrary input meshes. We evaluated this interface by distributing a basic tool to computer graphics hobbyists and professionals, and based on their feedback, describe potential workflows which could utilize our techniques...|$|R
40|$|An “in vivo assay technique” is {{urgently}} needed for measuring protective immune {{effects of a}} myiasis vaccine in sheep. Such a technique is being developed simultaneously {{with the development of}} a vaccine against myiasis caused by the screwworm fly Chrysomya bezziana under a collaborative project undertaken by Balitvet, ITB and CSIRO (Australia) and funded by ACIAR. Experiments were conducted in naive sheep. C. bezziana larvae were allowed to develop on abraded skin in aluminium rings which had been attached to the sheep by means of a glue (Aibon) on the day prior to infection. Rings were arranged on clipped areas close to the mid line of the sheep’s back, two rings on the right side and two rings on the left. Four trials were performed, involving studies on the effects of including wet sponges in the rings to maintain humidity (Trial 1); the effects of sponge and blended meat as counting and transferring media during infection (Trial 2); the effects of the repellants citronella, eucalyptus oil and neem extract in assisting the recovery of larvae (Trial 3); and the effects of the reducing the infective dose from 50 to 25 1 st instar larvae/ring and using a fine <b>brush</b> <b>for</b> counting and <b>transferring</b> larvae instead of using a forceps as in the previous groups (Trial 4) on the larval recovery rates (LRR). The results indicated that the inclusion of wet sponges in the rings, the use of sponge and blended meat as counting and transferring media during infection, and the application of repellants all increased the LRR to some extent; however, variations among individual rings remained high. On the other hand, the reduction of infective dose of larvae from 50 to 25 1 st instar larvae/ring and using a fine <b>brush</b> <b>for</b> counting and <b>transferring</b> larvae sharply increased the LRR while substantially decreasing the coefficient variations. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{tracheal}} mite, Acarapis woodi, is {{a widespread}} parasite of honey bees {{that can lead to}} colony death. A key determinant of colony mortality is the prevalence of the parasite within a colony. Prevalence depends upon transmission rates, which vary depending upon the age of potential hosts. Honey bee cuticular hydrocarbons change with age, and have been suggested to be the cue used by tracheal mites to determine whether they move to a potential host. Recently, honey bees pupated at a reduced temperature were found to have a significantly higher susceptibility to tracheal-mite infestation. In this study experiments were conducted to determine whether this susceptibility was due to a change in chemical cues. Cuticular compounds were significantly different between bees pupated at 34 degrees C and 30 degrees C, as predicted. However, behavioural tests showed conclusively that the increased susceptibility of bees pupated at the lower temperature could not be explained by these chemical differences. Other factors, such as changes in bee physiology, reduced mobility and cognitive ability, that {{have been shown to be}} caused by reduced pupation temperature, are suggested as potential mechanisms. Interestingly, these experiments provide evidence that tracheal mites only respond to gustatory and not olfactory cues. The implications of this for the behavioural strategies adopted by mites to maximise safe transmission, and a new model <b>for</b> <b>mite</b> <b>transfer</b> are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Varroa {{destructor}} (Vd) is a honeybee ectoparasite. Its original host is the Asian honeybee, Apis cerana, but it {{has also}} become a severe, global threat to the European honeybee, Apis mellifera. Previous studies have shown that Varroa can mimic a host’s cuticular hydrocarbons (HC), enabling the parasite to escape the hygienic behaviour of the host honeybees. By <b>transferring</b> <b>mites</b> between the two honeybee species, we further demonstrate that Vd is able to mimic the cuticular HC of a novel host species when artificially transferred to this new host. Mites originally from A. cerana are more efficient than mites from A. mellifera in mimicking HC of both A. cerana and A. mellifera. This remarkable adaptability may explain their relatively recent host-shift from A. cerana to A. mellifera...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Routine toothbrushing is the {{principal}} method by which in-dividuals remove plaque and control plaque-related diseases, such as periodontitis and caries. Oral health care professionals generally rec-ommend at least 2 minutes brushing with an appropriate technique, and yet the average brushing time {{in the general population}} is closer to 45 seconds. Our understanding of the relationship between brushing time and plaque removal, in an untutored general population using a conventional manual toothbrush and dentifrice, is limited. The role of dentifrice in plaque removal is also unclear. Methods: This study was undertaken to measure plaque removal dur-ing untutored brushing over timed periods between 30 and 180 seconds with 1. 5 g dentifrice, using an Aquafresh Flex ® brush and Aquafresh Advanced ® dentifrice. Plaque removal after brushing without dentifrice was also determined (at the 60 second time point only). Forty-seven subjects participated in the study, in which plaque level was assessed using the Quigley-Hein (Turesky-modification) Index. Results: Plaque removal increased with brushing time across the range studied, tending towards a maximum at longer brushing times. At the extremes, <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 180 seconds removed 55 % more plaque than <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 30 seconds. <b>Brushing</b> <b>for</b> 120 seconds removed 26 % more plaque than <b>brushing</b> <b>for</b> 45 seconds. The use of dentifrice did not increase plaque removal during 60 seconds of brushing. Conclusions: Oral health care professionals should reinforce efforts to persuade patients to <b>brush</b> <b>for</b> longer periods of time, as increasing brushing time to the consensus minimum of 2 minutes from a more typical 45 seconds increases plaque removal to an extent likely to pro-vide clinically significant oral health benefits...|$|R
