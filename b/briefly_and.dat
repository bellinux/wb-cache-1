5|$|John's coup {{was written}} {{extensively}} about by contemporaries: the historian Niketas Choniates deals with it <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> rather dismissively, but Nicholas Mesarites left a long eyewitness account of events, in which his own role is suitably emphasized. The scholars Nikephoros Chrysoberges and Euthymios Tornikes wrote speeches in celebration of the coup's failure.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-9d's {{name comes}} from it being the third planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of Kepler-9. Kepler-9 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite that aims to discover terrestrial planets in transit around, or crossing in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth. This transit causes a regular interval in which the star <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> slightly dims as the planet crosses it.|$|E

Pugliese and Arion won the match and the title; they held the belts for six months until June 1967. The team split up when Pugliese left the country <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> Arnold Skaaland was named as co-holder of the championship in his place.|$|E

5|$|After the {{war with}} Mexico ended, Stone {{returned}} to the Watervliet Arsenal in 1848, again taking up his position as Assistant Ordnance Officer. He then was granted {{a leave of absence}} from the U.S. Army, and proceeded to Europe to study military practices of the armies there for two years. In 1850 he resumed duty at the Watervliet Arsenal <b>briefly,</b> <b>and</b> then was given command of the Ft. Monroe Arsenal into 1851. Later that year Stone was appointed Chief of Ordnance for the Pacific Department, a post he held until 1855, and also began construction of the Benicia Arsenal in California that year. During this time he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant, effective February 26, 1853.|$|E

5|$|But {{in early}} August, Holmes à Court {{contacted}} Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson only raised {{his bid to}} $47.5million, {{but he had the}} advantage of being able to close the deal faster, having completed due diligence of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement. He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes à Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university. Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5million on August 10. 1985. In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> met with two children.|$|E
5|$|Grissom re-enlisted in the {{military}} after he graduated from Purdue, {{this time in the}} newly formed United States Air Force. He was accepted into the air cadet basic training program at Randolph Air Force Base in Universal City, Texas. Upon completion of the program, he was assigned to Williams Air Force Base in Mesa, Arizona. In March 1951 Grissom received his pilot wings and commission as a second lieutenant. Betty remained in Indiana, and while he was away his first child, Scott, was born. After his birth they joined Grissom in Arizona. The family remained there only <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> in December 1951 they moved to Presque Isle, Maine, where Grissom was assigned to Presque Isle Air Force Base and {{became a member of the}} 75th Fighter Interceptor Squadron.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Emden was {{assigned}} to an operation in the Gulf of Riga to provide gunfire support to German troops. On the 16th, she was operating off Dagö with Leipzig and three torpedo boats; the ships came under fire from Soviet coastal batteries, but were undamaged. A group of four Soviet torpedo boats also made an unsuccessful attack on the German squadron. Emden was then assigned to the Baltic Fleet, centered on the newly commissioned battleship Tirpitz; the Baltic Fleet was tasked with preventing the Soviet Navy from breaking out of the Baltic. Emden and Leipzig were {{the core of the}} southern group, which was based in Libau. The fleet remained on station only <b>briefly,</b> <b>and</b> by 29 September, the ships were recalled to Gotenhafen.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{never gave}} up on a return to public service. He ran an {{unsuccessful}} campaign for the U.S. Senate against John J. Crittenden in 1842. He <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> futilely sought his party's nomination for president in 1844. He also ran as an independent candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1848, but after talking with the Democratic candidate, Lazarus W. Powell, who had replaced Linn Boyd on the ticket, Johnson decided to drop out and back Powell. Some speculated that the real object of this campaign was to secure another nomination to the vice-presidency, but this hope was denied.|$|E
5|$|Some artists {{tried to}} alter their sound, while others {{struggled}} on with their original format. In 1995, Van Halen released Balance, a multi-platinum seller {{that would be the}} band's last with Sammy Hagar on vocals. In 1996, David Lee Roth returned <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> his replacement, former Extreme singer Gary Cherone, left the band soon after the release of the commercially unsuccessful 1998 album Van Halen III. Van Halen would not tour or record again until 2004. Warrant released Ultraphobic in 1995, an album with more of an alternative/grunge approach, which had little commercial success.|$|E
5|$|After time expires, the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E

5|$|Brumfield {{arrived by}} {{helicopter}} {{on the morning}} of 8 November, just as A Company was preparing to depart from its night location at 08:00. With contact now seeming unlikely to the Australians, Healy was instructed to move to a rendezvous from which the battalion would be extracted back to Bien Hoa the following day. A Company subsequently set out on a compass bearing which would take them across the northern edge of the Gang Toi plateau. By 10:30 the Australians moved out in single file but had not gone far before a lone Viet Cong scout was observed shadowing them; he was subsequently shot and killed by the rear section. Crossing a creek line the Australians uncovered a company-sized camp of dugouts and trenches, before being fired upon at 15:40 by a single Viet Cong soldier who then fled. A Company halted <b>briefly,</b> <b>and</b> at this time two Viet Cong approached their position, before being killed by 1 Platoon.|$|E
5|$|During filming in Sierra Gorda, Chile, {{the local}} mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest {{because he was}} angry at the filmmakers' {{portrayal}} of the Antofagasta Region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained <b>briefly,</b> <b>and</b> put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area. Michael G. Wilson explained that Bolivia was appropriate to the plot, because of the country's history of water problems, and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific. In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper La Segunda, 75% of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the negative image of Chile they felt it presented, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film {{in the country in}} the future.|$|E
5|$|Dwight D. Eisenhower {{was elected}} U.S. President in 1952, {{promising}} {{to take a}} harder line against communism; the links that his staff members John Foster Dulles and Allen Dulles had to the UFC also predisposed them to act against the Guatemalan government. Additionally, the U.S. government drew exaggerated conclusions {{about the extent of}} communist influence from the presence of a small number of communists among Árbenz's advisers. Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by Carlos Castillo Armas. The coup was preceded by U.S. efforts to criticize and isolate Guatemala internationally. Castillo Armas' force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of psychological warfare. This included a radio station which broadcast anti-government propaganda and a version of military events favorable to the rebellion, claiming to be genuine news, as well as bombings of Guatemala City and a naval blockade of Guatemala. The invasion force fared poorly militarily, and most of its offensives were defeated. However, psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which eventually refused to fight. Árbenz <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> unsuccessfully attempted to arm civilians to resist the invasion, before resigning on 27 June. Castillo Armas became president ten days later, following negotiations in San Salvador.|$|E

5|$|Finucane took {{leave in}} early September and his award {{for a second}} Bar was gazetted on 9 September. Circus 100B was flown on 20 September 1941. A three pronged attack was planned {{involving}} 23 squadrons and 270 Spitfires with bomber units acting as decoys. The Kenley wing was to provide escort for bombers hitting marshalling yards at Abbeville. 452 {{was one of three}} squadrons flying high cover. Immediately after crossing the coast at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme they were engaged by enemy aircraft. Finucane hit a Bf 109 which exploded forcing him to fly through the debris but within minutes 452 had lost three Spitfires. Finding himself and his wingman, Sergeant Chisholm alone he shot down a Bf 109 that attempted to attack his squadron-mate. He followed it <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> it caught fire while emitting white smoke. Another Bf 109 turned in to attack Finucane but was shot down by Chisholm. Fighting their way back to the Channel Finucane dived and shot down a Bf 109 which went into a spin before he lost sight of it at approximately 500ft. Three successes had inflated Finucane's tally to 17.|$|E
5|$|Further {{significant}} developments did {{not come}} until the Renaissance. Vesalius discussed the cerebellum <b>briefly,</b> <b>and</b> the anatomy was described more thoroughly by Thomas Willis in 1664. More anatomical work was done during the 18th century, {{but it was not}} until early in the 19th century that the first insights into the function of the cerebellum were obtained. Luigi Rolando in 1809 established the key finding that damage to the cerebellum results in motor disturbances. Jean Pierre Flourens in the first half of the 19th century carried out detailed experimental work, which revealed that animals with cerebellar damage can still move, but with a loss of coordination (strange movements, awkward gait, and muscular weakness), and that recovery after the lesion can be nearly complete unless the lesion is very extensive. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was widely accepted that the primary function of the cerebellum relates to motor control; the first half of the 20th century produced several detailed descriptions of the clinical symptoms associated with cerebellar disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the peasant war the city authorities tried {{to suppress the}} memory of this nearly successful revolt. Resistance symbols like the flags or the weapons used by the peasants, in particular their typical clubs with nails on the hitting end (called (Bauern-) Knüttel), were outlawed, confiscated, and destroyed. Documents such as the Bundesbriefe of Huttwil were stashed away in the vaults of the city archives. Any public remembrances or pilgrimages to {{the places where the}} leaders had been executed were forbidden and carried the death penalty, as did the singing of the peasants' war songs. Bern was particularly active in trying to censor the memories of the event and also tried to suppress images of the peasant leaders. Historic texts written during the Ancien Régime of Switzerland generally follow the official diction and mention the peasant war, if they do so at all, only <b>briefly</b> <b>and</b> in negative terms. Works with differing viewpoints were often prohibited. The censorship was not entirely successful; in private, the rural population kept the memories of 1653 alive, and various accounts of the events were printed in Germany.|$|E
