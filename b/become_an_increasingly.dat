In 2009, Switzerland hosted the IIHF World Championship for the 10th time. It also became World Vice-Champion in 2013. The numerous lakes make Switzerland an attractive place for sailing. The largest, Lake Geneva, is the home of the sailing team Alinghi which was the first European team to win the America's Cup in 2003 and which successfully defended the title in 2007. Tennis has <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular sport, and Swiss players such as Martina Hingis, Roger Federer, and most recently, Stanislas Wawrinka have won multiple Grand Slams.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} are {{devices that}} convert the wind's kinetic energy into electrical power. The result of over a millennium of windmill development and modern engineering, today's wind turbines are manufactured {{in a wide}} range of horizontal axis and vertical axis types. The smallest turbines are used for applications such as battery charging for auxiliary power. Slightly larger turbines can be used for making small contributions to a domestic power supply while selling unused power back to the utility supplier via the electrical grid. Arrays of large turbines, known as wind farms, have <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>increasingly</b> important source of renewable energy and are used in many countries as part of a strategy to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{tropical}} wave {{organized into}} a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on September1 about 920mi (1,480km) west-southwest of Cabo Verde. With {{a burst of}} convection near its center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gaston six hours later and reached peak winds of 40mph (65km/h). Despite initial projections that Gaston would <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>increasingly</b> strong hurricane over the central Atlantic, exceptionally dry air began to wrap in the storm after peak. It weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on September2 and further degenerated into a remnant low by 18:00UTC that day. The system nearly regenerated into a tropical cyclone the following day as shallow convection wrapped into the center, but the increased organization was transient and it ultimately remained a remnant low until dissipating southeast on the Dominican Republic on September8. The remnants of Gaston produced sporadic rainfall across Puerto Rico, peaking at 3.03in (76.9mm) in Naguabo.|$|E

5|$|Though Virginia Beach and Williamsburg have {{traditionally}} been the centers of tourism for the region, the rebirth of downtown Norfolk {{and the construction of}} a cruise ship pier at the foot of Nauticus in downtown has driven tourism to <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>increasingly</b> important part of the city's economy. The number of cruise ship passengers who visited Norfolk increased from 50,000 in 2003, to 107,000 in 2004 and 2005. Also in April 2007, the city completed construction on a $36 million state-of-the-art cruise ship terminal alongside the pier. Partly due to this construction, passenger counts dropped to 70,000 in 2006, but is expected to rebound to 90,000 in 2007, and higher in later years. Unlike most cruise ship terminals which are located in industrial areas, the downtown location of Norfolk's terminal has received favorable reviews from both tourists and the cruise lines who enjoy its proximity to the city's hotels, restaurants, shopping, and cultural amenities.|$|E

25|$|Filter strips {{are areas}} of grass or other {{permanent}} vegetation that protect riparian areas from sediment runoff, pesticides, pathogens, organics and nutrients.

Filter strips were originally used mostly in agriculture, but now are a common practice in urban areas where water quality has <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>increasingly</b> important issue.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, Wall has used digital {{technology}} to create montages of different individual negatives, blending them into what {{appears as a}} single unified photograph. His signature works are large transparencies mounted on light boxes; he says he conceived this format when he saw back-lit advertisements at bus stops during a trip between Spain and London. In 1995, Wall began making traditional silver gelatin black and white photographs, and these have <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>increasingly</b> significant part of his work. Examples were exhibited at Kassel's documenta X.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century, however, Aceh had <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{influential}} power due to its strategic location for controlling regional trade. In the 1820s it was the producer of over half the world's supply of black pepper. The pepper trade produced new wealth for the Sultanate and for the rulers of many smaller nearby ports that had been under Aceh's control, but were now able to assert more independence. These changes initially threatened Aceh's integrity, but a new sultan Tuanku Ibrahim, who controlled the kingdom from 1838 to 1870, reasserted power over nearby ports.|$|E

25|$|As {{globalization}} {{has become more}} prevalent, international activity has also <b>become</b> <b>an</b> <b>increasingly</b> prominent element of comprehensive campaigns.
