40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), a premalignant plasma-cell disorder {{has not been}} determined in our geographic area Nigeria. Methods A cross sectional survey was carried on apparently healthy Nigerians selected by multistage sampling technique from the cosmopolitan city of Lagos, Nigeria. Subjects enrolled into the study had 2 -step screening for the presence, type and concentration of monoclonal band. Agarose-gel electrophoresis was performed on all serum samples, and any serum sample with a discrete band of monoclonal protein or thought to have a localized band was subjected to Immunofixation. Subjects were also evaluated for <b>Bence</b> <b>jones</b> proteinuria, haematological and biochemical parameters. Results Four hundred and ten subjects {{with a mean age}} of 45. 68 [*]±[*] 10. 3 years, a median of 45. 00 years and a range of 20 to 80 years were enrolled into the study. MGUS was identified in only one (0. 24 percent) of the 410 study subject. This subject was demonstrated to have a double monoclonal gammopathy; IgGλ at 16. 9 g/L and IgAκ at 8. 5 g/L. None of them including the sole subject with MGUS had a monoclonal urinary light chain. Conclusion Among residents of Lagos, Nigeria, MGUS was found in only 0. 24 % percent of apparently normal persons with a median age of 45 years. This suggests that MGUS which represents the earliest stage of monoclonal plasma/lymphoid cell proliferation is not a common finding in the relatively young population of Nigeria. Future epidemiologic studies dealing with plasma cell disorders in older people are required to carefully examine the relationship between environmental factors and {{prevalence of}} MGUS and its ultimate progression to MM. </p...|$|R

It is age-related and characterized by accumulation of bone marrow plasma cells derived from a single abnormal clone. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the pattern of MGUS in North Indian urban population. Methods: Serum and urine samples were collected from 320 suspected cases of gammopathy, were analyzed by sensitive immunological technique based protein electrophoresis followed by immunofixation for detection and type of monoclonal/polyclonal gammopathies. Twenty-five healthy subjects were included as controls. Results: Gammopathies were observed in 38 (11. 88 %) patients. Out of these 7. 5 % were &not;monoclonal and 4. 3 % were polyclonal. Overall age of presentation of these monoclonal &not;gammopathies in both sexes was between 21 and 76 years. Gender-related ratio (men:women) for these gammopathies was 1 : 1. 18. Predominant heavy chain isotype was IgG (62. 5 %) followed by IgA (37. 5 %). Among light chains, kappa (&kappa;) and lambda (&lambda;) chains appeared in 91. 6 % and 8. 4 % gammopathies respectively. Paraprotein fractions obtained were IgG&kappa; (58. 3 %), IgG&lambda; (4. 16 %), IgA&kappa; (33. 3 %), and IgA&lambda; (4. 16 %) with 25 % samples being positive for Bence Jones proteinuria. Conclusions: Clinical laboratories play an important role in confirming the immunological diagnosis of gammopathies. Determination of nature of paraproteinemia and its associated diseases calls for more extensive studies in India.
