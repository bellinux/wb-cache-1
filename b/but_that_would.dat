5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Looking for a 3-peat, the Heat {{dominated}} the 2014 postseason, going 12–3 {{in the first}} three rounds. They reached the 2014 NBA Finals and faced the Spurs in a rematch of the 2013 Finals. With James limited in Game 1 due to leg cramps, the Spurs ended the game on a 31–9 run, winning the game 110–95. The Heat would win Game 2, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be their only win of the series, as the Spurs would win Games 3, 4, and 5 to win the Championship, their first since 2007 and the fifth and final title of Duncan's career. Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP, becoming the third-youngest Finals MVP after Duncan and Magic Johnson.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to create}} the game's boss battles in-house around the game's similar elements of player choice, with their initial design inspired by the boss fights in Metal Gear Solid. As the development on the story and gameplay framework took priority, boss battles became less and less of a focus. It eventually reached a point when the main development team could not complete them {{in time for the}} game's release. The team contemplated cutting them, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have negatively impacted the story and other areas of the game's design. In the end, development of the boss battles was outsourced to Grip Entertainment. Having been given access to the game's engine, Grip Entertainment were given the task of creating the boss battles and incorporating them into the framework of Human Revolution. For this, they needed to incorporate their own technology into the system, working from Eidos' specifications while bringing their own development style to bear on the project. They also attempted to balance the boss fights' action-focused approach with the other elements within Human Revolution so it would be accessible to all players.|$|E

25|$|Next {{was another}} ranked team, as 16th ranked Auburn came to Gainesville. The first half {{may have been}} closer than most would have expected, as Auburn kicked a field goal late to trail just 21–10. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be it for the Tigers as the Gators reeled off 30 {{unanswered}} points {{en route to a}} 51–10 win.|$|E
25|$|The Patriots {{reduced the}} lead to 14-6 on Smith's 42-yard field goal early in the third quarter. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be {{as close to a}} lead as the Patriots would get. The Dolphins scored again with {{touchdown}}s from Woody Bennett, another 2-yard catch by Hardy late in the third quarter, {{and in the middle of}} the fourth. With 5:32 left in the game, Grogan threw a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Don Hasselbeck that made the final score 28-13.|$|E

25|$|The first {{dedicated}} {{word processor}} was introduced after Maxwell had already become {{established as a}} science fiction writer.

This enabled her to get ahead of her contract, so Maxwell began to look for another type of writing that she would enjoy, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> pay better.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{temple was}} found in Assyria, {{consisting}} of three consecutive rooms with the Blessed Sacrament as the last room. Around the temple columns are present, resembling a Greek temple. The fact that the columns are only on three sides, and that the front was not decorated with columns indicates a particularly Parthian fashion. In many Greek temples, columns would not be present on one side, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> rarely be the entrance or front of the temple.|$|E
25|$|A major {{turning point}} was {{the advent of}} {{civilian}} GPS in 1996. At first, GPS units were very costly and only offered basic functions, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> soon change. Towards the late 1990s the Internet was awash in weather data and free weather software, the first true cellular Internet modems for consumer use also emerged providing chasers access to data in the field without having {{to rely on a}} nowcaster. The NWS also released the first free, up-to-date NEXRAD Level 3 radar data. In conjunction with all of this, GPS units now had the ability to connect with computers, granting greater ease when navigating.|$|E

25|$|Joe Dailey {{would start}} off the scoring {{in the second}} half with a 13-yd pass to Hakeem Nicks but the Irish defense would block another XP attempt making the score 31-19. The Irish would strike back with Quinn hitting Jeff Samardzija with a 42-yd pass to make the score 38-19. UNC would repeat their earlier tandem with Dailey {{throwing}} a 72-yd pass to Nicks to cut the deficit to 38-26. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be UNC's last hurrah in this game as the Irish defense would prevent anymore scoring and the lone score of the 4th quarter was Darius Walker's 1-yd run to give 45-26 final.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{one such}} {{consequence}} of the halting problem's undecidability is that there cannot be a general algorithm that decides whether a given statement about natural numbers is true or not. The {{reason for this is}} that the proposition stating that a certain program will halt given a certain input can be converted into an equivalent statement about natural numbers. If we had an algorithm that could find the truth value of every statement about natural numbers, it could certainly find the truth value of this one; <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> determine whether the original program halts, which is impossible, since the halting problem is undecidable.|$|E
25|$|The air {{offensive}} against the RAF and British industry failed {{to have the}} desired effect. More might have been achieved had OKL exploited the vulnerability of British sea communications. The Allies did so later when Bomber Command attacked rail communications and the United States Army Air Forces targeted oil <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have required an economic-industrial analysis of which the Luftwaffe was incapable. OKL instead sought clusters of targets that suited the latest policy (which changed frequently) and disputes within the leadership were about tactics rather than strategy. Though militarily ineffective, the Blitz cost around 41,000 lives, may have injured another 139,000 people and did enormous damage to British infrastructure and housing stock.|$|E

25|$|The general {{sound design}} was handled by Masato Shindo, who {{was faced with}} a {{challenge}} new to the PlatinumGames staff: in their previous projects sound echoes had been handled by individual settings created by the team, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not work properly in an open world setting due to its scale. Instead, Shindo designed a realistic soundscape using a system to manage echoes in real time, determining how much reverberation to generate based on current surroundings. Sound implementation was handled by Masami Ueda, and it was a greater amount of work than he had experienced on any previous project. One of the factors that helped with the smooth implementation was Ueda's previous encounters and good working relationship with Okabe.|$|E
25|$|When Bakunin visited Japan {{after his}} escape from Siberia, {{he was not}} really {{involved}} in its politics or with the Japanese peasants. This might be taken as evidence of a basic disinterest in Asia, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be incorrect. Bakunin stopped over briefly in Japan {{as part of a}} hurried flight from twelve years of imprisonment, a marked man racing across the world to his European home; he had neither Japanese contacts nor any facility in the Japanese language; the small number of expatriate newspapers by Europeans published in China and Japan provided no insights into local revolutionary conditions or possibilities. Besides, Bakunin's conversion to anarchism came in 1865, towards the end of his life, and four years after his time in Japan.|$|E
25|$|City {{started the}} 2016–17 season with mixed form, winning two and losing {{two of their}} opening four games. This was {{followed}} by a run of victories that resulted in the Imps sitting top of the table after a victory at Tranmere, the first time the club had topped any table in ten years. The form again dipped with defeats to Dover and Barrow in late September, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be the last time that the Imps would taste defeat in any competition until a last minute defeat to Guiseley on Boxing Day. During that run the Imps travelled to run-away leaders Forest Green and would have fallen twelve points behind with a defeat, but three goals in the final 30 minutes turned around a 2–0 deficit.|$|E

25|$|Led {{from the}} front by Steve Waugh, Australia began the day at a {{precarious}} 291/8 <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{prove to be the}} high of the day for India. The 35 yr old Waugh batted well with Gillespie and then Glenn McGrath – and crossed numerous landmarks on the way – as he took Australia to a total of 445. In the process the Australian captain notched up his 25th Test century, crossing Sachin Tendulkar's tally of 24 hundreds at the time. Having never made a Test hundred in India, Waugh was more emotional than normal as he tugged at the red handkerchief in his pocket, took off his helmet and raised his bat to a full house Eden crowd. He also passed Javed Miandad to become the (then) 4th highest run getter in test cricket.|$|E
25|$|The Catholicon – On {{the east}} side {{opposite}} the Rotunda is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today the Greek Orthodox catholicon. The second, smaller dome sits directly over {{the centre of the}} transept crossing of the choir where the compas, an omphalos once thought {{to be the center of}} the world (associated to the site of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection), is situated. Since 1996 this dome is topped by the monumental Golgotha Crucifix which the Greek Patriarch Diodoros I of Jerusalem consecrated. It was at the initiative of Gustav Kühnel to erect a new crucifix at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem that would not only be worthy of the singularity of the site, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> also become a symbol of the efforts of unity in the community of Christian faith.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to rebound}} from their road {{loss to the}} Giants, the Buccaneers went home for an NFC South rematch with the New Orleans Saints. In the first quarter, the Bucs trailed early as Saints QB Drew Brees {{completed}} a 15-yard TD pass to WR Marques Colston and a 52-yard TD pass to WR Devery Henderson. In the second quarter, kicker John Carney helped New Orleans improve its lead with a 46-yard field goal. Tampa Bay would valiantly fight back, as QB Bruce Gradkowski completed a 44-yard TD pass and a 17-yard TD pass to WR Joey Galloway, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be as close as they would get. In the third quarter, Saints pulled away with RB Deuce McAllister completing a 3-yard TD run and Bree completing a 45-yard TD pass to Henderson.
