5|$|At 23:30 20 September, the 29th and 31st Brigades of the 10th Division {{resumed their}} advance; the 29th Brigade {{supported}} by the Hong Kong <b>Battery</b> <b>with</b> the LXVII and LXVIII Brigades RFA on the left. The 30th Brigade concentrated west of Selfit in preparation of a follow-up advance through the 29th Brigade when it reached Quza on the Damascus road.|$|E
5|$|Full {{ammunition}} loads were 1,440 rounds for the 12-inch guns (120 per gun), 3,600 rounds for the 6-inch (300), 5,600 rounds for the 4-inch (350), and 16 torpedoes {{manufactured by}} Whitehead. To assist the main <b>battery</b> <b>with</b> targeting during a battle, the two ships were equipped with two Barr & Stroud rangefinders that were located above the conning towers.|$|E
5|$|In 1815, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788-1873) of London {{published}} {{the forerunner of}} the electric clock, the electrostatic clock. It was powered with dry piles, a high voltage <b>battery</b> <b>with</b> extremely long life but the disadvantage of its electrical properties varying with the weather. He trialled various means of regulating the electricity and these models proved to be reliable {{across a range of}} meteorological conditions.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 390 battalions were mobilized - some 232 {{infantry}} and 11 pioneer battalions within the eleven infantry divisions containing 469,140 men; another 75 battalions containing 86,444 men were independent; 31 militia and 41 supplementary battalions containing 64,845 men {{remained in the}} interior of the country. The artillery of various caliber was deployed in 219 batteries - 94 <b>batteries</b> <b>with</b> 409 guns in the 1st Army, 44 <b>batteries</b> <b>with</b> 182 guns in the 2nd Army, 50 <b>batteries</b> <b>with</b> 401 guns in the 3rd Army and 31 <b>batteries</b> <b>with</b> 130 guns in the three independent divisions.

5000|$|The ban on sale {{of mercury}} oxide {{batteries}} caused numerous problems for photographers, whose equipment frequently relied on their advantageous discharge curves and long lifetime. Alternatives used are zinc-air <b>batteries,</b> <b>with</b> similar discharge curve, high capacity, but much shorter lifetime (a few months), and {{poor performance in}} dry climates; alkaline <b>batteries</b> <b>with</b> voltage widely varying through their lifetime; and silver-oxide <b>batteries</b> <b>with</b> higher voltage (1.55 V) and very flat discharge curve, which makes them possibly the best, though expensive, replacement after recalibrating the meter to the new voltage.|$|R
5|$|The Audacious-class ironclads {{were laid}} out as central battery ironclads with the {{armament}} concentrated amidships. They were the first British ironclads to have a two-deck <b>battery</b> <b>with</b> the upper deck guns sponsoned out over {{the sides of the}} hull. The ships were fitted with a short, plough-shaped ram and their crew numbered 450 officers and men.|$|E
5|$|The Fire Control Switchboard {{configured}} the <b>battery.</b> <b>With</b> it, the Gunnery Officer could mix {{and match}} the three turrets to the two GFCSs. He could have the turrets all controlled by the forward system, all controlled by the aft system, or split the battery to shoot at two targets.|$|E
5|$|Two 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 {{guns were}} mounted in barbettes {{on the upper}} deck, one gun at the forward corner of the <b>battery,</b> <b>with</b> the {{remaining}} six 274-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. Eight 138-millimetre Modèle 1870 guns were on the upper deck, fore and aft of the barbettes, and on the battery deck.|$|E

5|$|The {{third class}} of cruisers {{named after the}} capital of East Prussia marked a radical {{divergence}} from earlier cruiser designs. A new triple gun turret was adopted for the main <b>battery,</b> <b>with</b> one forward and two aft in a superfiring pair, offset from the centerline. And new, longer C/25 model guns were used. Major use of welding was also a feature of this class of cruisers, and diesel engines were used {{in combination with the}} turbines to increase their cruising radius, though only one set of engines could be run at one time.|$|E
5|$|Wisconsin arrived off Songjin, Korea on 15 March and {{concentrated}} her gunfire on enemy railway transport. Early that morning, she destroyed a communist troop train trapped outside a destroyed tunnel. That afternoon, she received the first direct hit in her history, {{when one of}} four shells from a North Korean 152mm gun battery struck the shield of a starboard 40mm mount; Although little material damage resulted, three men were injured. Wisconsin subsequently destroyed that <b>battery</b> <b>with</b> a full 16-inch (406mm) salvo before continuing her mission. After lending a hand to support once more the 1st Marine Division with her heavy rifles, the battleship returned to Japan on 19 March.|$|E
5|$|As CTroop {{reached the}} forming up {{point for the}} assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery. ATroop {{bypassed}} them to occupy houses to cover the assault. The next to arrive was DTroop, which had a special ladder to cross the anti-tank ditch around the battery. Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way to cross. They discovered wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. DTroop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the <b>battery.</b> <b>With</b> the machine guns taken, EandFTroops began their assault. The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles. The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland.|$|E

5|$|During the Williamite Wars of 1690–1691, the {{garrison}} espoused {{the cause of}} James II in contrast with that of Birr, which took the side of William. A stone bridge across the Shannon was erected in 1685, and a Williamite army advancing from Birr in 1690 attempted to break it down but abandoned the attempt as too risky in consequence {{of the presence of}} Sarsfield's Army on the Connacht side. A broken arch of this bridge is still to be seen on that side a few yards below the present bridge of seven arches, which was erected by the Commissioners for the Improvement of Navigation of the Shannon in 1841–1843. The square tower on the lower side of the bridge at the Galway end was erected to protect the old bridge, as was the Salt <b>Battery,</b> <b>with</b> emplacements for four cannons facing west and north, a few hundred yards from town along the Crank Road.|$|E
5|$|Four shipbuilders {{submitted}} bids: the Italian Gio. Ansaldo & C. led a {{group that}} also included the Austro-Hungarian Škoda Works and the French Marrel Freres Forges de La Loire et du Midi; the French Schneider-Creusot firm partnered with Société Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée and Forges et Chantiers de la Gironde; the Spanish Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval (SECN), which was formed by Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth, and John Brown & Company; {{and a group of}} Spanish industrialists backed by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company and William Beardmore and Company. Only the first three proposals were seriously considered, as the fourth was considered to be too vague. The Junta Superior de la Armada (the Navy Staff) and the Navy Minister were responsible for reviewing the three proposals. Ansaldo prepared two design variants; the first called for four twin gun turrets for the main <b>battery,</b> <b>with</b> one forward, one aft, and two offset amidships. The second proposal had two triple turrets, fore and aft, with a twin turret on the centerline amidships. Artillery experts in the Navy rejected the second variant. The SECN and Schneider designs also featured the same arrangement as the first Ansaldo proposal.|$|E
5|$|In late 1943, Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel {{in charge}} of {{improving}} the coastal defences along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion, expected to take place sometime in 1944. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In the immediate area of Gold, between Le Hamel and La Rivière, seven defensive strongpoints designed to hold 50 men apiece were constructed. Two major concrete-reinforced coastal artillery emplacements (a battery of four 122mm guns at Mont Fleury and the Longues-sur-Mer <b>battery,</b> <b>with</b> four 150mm guns) were only partially completed by D-Day. Rommel ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beach to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high tide mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry.|$|E

5|$|In net {{metering}} {{the price of}} the electricity produced {{is the same as the}} price supplied to the consumer, and the consumer is billed on the difference between production and consumption. Net metering can usually be done with no changes to standard electricity meters, which accurately measure power in both directions and automatically report the difference, and because it allows homeowners and businesses to generate electricity at a different time from consumption, effectively using the grid as a giant storage <b>battery.</b> <b>With</b> {{net metering}}, deficits are billed each month while surpluses are rolled over to the following month. Best practices call for perpetual roll over of kWh credits. Excess credits upon termination of service are either lost, or paid for at a rate ranging from wholesale to retail rate or above, as can be excess annual credits. In New Jersey, annual excess credits are paid at the wholesale rate, as are left over credits when a customer terminates service.|$|E
5|$|No. 4 Commando {{made the}} {{crossing}} to Dieppe on board HMS Prins Albert. The crossing was uneventful and at 04:50 just before daybreak Group one landed unopposed. Using two Bangalore torpedos to blow {{a hole in}} the barbed wire, they managed to scale the cliffs. As they approached the battery at 05:45 it opened fire on the main landing force coming ashore at Dieppe. This was 30 minutes before Group one was expected {{to be in a position}} but Mills-Roberts responded by speeding up the advance to get their guns into action sooner. Once in position they opened fire on the <b>battery</b> <b>with</b> their mortars, Bren machine guns and sniper rifles. One of the mortar bombs landed inside the battery and exploded the stored charges, putting the guns out of action.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} Tarawa {{commenced}} on 20 November. In her first offensive {{action of the}} war, Marylands guns opened fire at 05:00, destroying a shore <b>battery</b> <b>with</b> five salvos on the southwestern point of Betio Island in the Tarawa Atoll. At 06:00 she commenced a scheduled shore bombardment to soften up Japanese defenses ahead of the landings. Maryland moved closer to shore to attract Japanese fire and locate artillery emplacements, in the process raking Japanese gun emplacements, control stations, pillboxes and any Japanese installations she could spot. At 09:00 as Marine landing forces encountered heavy Japanese resistance and began taking casualties to emplaced crossfire, Maryland provided covering fire to eliminate several Japanese machine gun nests. Her scouting plane then began to cover {{the progress of the}} Marines' assault, with Maryland providing artillery support. The plane was damaged and pilot wounded in this action.|$|E

5|$|The {{division}} {{was supported by}} a number of artillery units including the 2nd and 4th Field Regiments and the 2nd Mountain Battery, and various anti-aircraft units. Later, also 'U' Heavy <b>Battery,</b> <b>with</b> four 155mm howitzers was transferred from Lae, as was the 2/11th Field Regiment. In order to provide organic fire support during the advance, the decision was made at this time to place the divisional artillery assets directly underneath the subunits they were supporting. At the outset, the division's allocation of engineers consisted of only two field companies, the 5th and 11th, however {{over the course of the}} campaign others arrived including the 10th, 15th and the 7th, which was the last to arrive in June 1945. Ultimately the division had almost 1,600 engineers across five field companies and various supporting plant, park and other units. This represented one of the largest engineer contingents within an Australian division during the war. Initially the {{division was}} deployed without armoured support, however, in December 1944, 'B' Squadron, 2/4th Armoured Regiment, equipped with Matilda II tanks, arrived and subsequently took part in operations on the island attached to elements of the division.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of shell guns and steam ships during the 1840s {{created a new}} risk that the French might successfully attack along the south coast, and fears grew of a conflict in the early 1850s. Further worries about France, combined {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears about the security of the south coast. As a result, the Grand Battery at Dartmouth Castle was rebuilt and retitled the Dartmouth Point <b>Battery,</b> <b>with</b> shell-proof, granite defences protecting three traversing gun emplacements looking out to sea, and a further two guns on the roof; one small howitzer protected the entrance to the harbour itself. It was manned by three professional soldiers, and a team of over fifty-five reservists, drawn from the newly formed Sixth Devonshire Artillery Volunteer Corps. The castle, however, was of low military priority, only of importance because the harbour might be used to as a staging post to attack Plymouth, and the guns allocated it were old-fashioned. A further upgrade in 1888 again installed only out-dated artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car <b>battery),</b> <b>with</b> a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters on the roof of tower blocks.|$|E
