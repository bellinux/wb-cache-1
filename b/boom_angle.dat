50|$|The {{advantage}} of the telehandler is also its biggest limitation: as the boom extends or raises while bearing a load, it acts as a lever and causes the vehicle to become increasingly unstable, despite counterweights in the rear. This means that the lifting capacity quickly decreases as the working radius (distance between {{the front of the}} wheels and the centre of the load) increases. When used as a loader the single boom (rather than twin arms) is very highly loaded and even with careful design is a weakness. A vehicle with a 5,000 lb (2.2ton) capacity with the boom retracted may be able to safely lift as little as 400 lb (225 kg) with it fully extended at a low <b>boom</b> <b>angle.</b> The same machine with a 5,000 lb lift capacity with the boom retracted may be able to support as much as 10,000 lb (5ton) with the boom raised to 70°. The operator is equipped with a load chart which helps him determine whether a given task is possible, taking into account weight, <b>boom</b> <b>angle</b> and height. Failing this, most telehandlers now utilize a computer which uses sensors to monitor the vehicle, and will warn the operator and/or cut off further control input if the limits of the vehicle are exceeded, the latter being a legal requirement in Europe controlled by EN15000. Machines can also be equipped with front stabilizers which extend the lifting capability of the equipment while stationary, as well machines with are fully stabilised with rotary joint between upper and lower frames, which can be called mobile cranes although they can typically still use a bucket, and are also often referred to as 'Roto' machines. They are a hybrid between a Telehandler and small crane.|$|E

The ship was designed to meet precise deepening requirements around the dockyard and port installations and in riverine or other places where deepening is needed. The ship which can hold upto 300 cubic metres or 500 tons of dredged material, has a set of 8 openable hopper bottom doors for disposal of dredged material out at sea. The main equipment of the ship is a 320-HP Cummins-855-powered forward-mounted crane supplied by Titagarth Wagons.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an open-loop control method for suppressing payload oscillation or swing caused by operator commanded maneuvers in rotary boom cranes and {{the method is}} experimentally verified on a one-sixteenth scale model of a Hagglunds shipboard crane. The crane configuration consists of a payload mass that swings like a spherical pendulum {{on the end of}} a lift-line which is attached to a boom capable of hub rotation (slewing) and elevation (luffing). Positioning of the payload is accomplished through the hub and <b>boom</b> <b>angles</b> and the load-line length. Since the configuration of the crane affects the excitation and response of the payload, the swing control scheme must account for the varying geometry of the system. Adaptive forward path command filters are employed to remove components of the command signal which induce payload swing...|$|R

5000|$|In these {{diagrams}} {{the direction}} of travel changes {{with respect to the}} apparent wind (VA), which is constant for the purpose of illustration. In reality, for a constant true wind, apparent wind would vary with point of sail. Constant VA in these examples means that either VT or VB varies with point of sail; this allows the same polar diagram to be used for comparison with the same conversion of coefficients into units of force (in this case Newtons). In the examples for close-hauled and reach (left and right), the sail's angle of attack (α [...] ) is essentially constant, although the <b>boom</b> <b>angle</b> over the boat changes with point of sail to trim the sail close to the highest lift force on the polar curve. In these cases, lift and drag are the same, but the decomposition of total aerodynamic force (FT) into forward driving force (FR) and lateral force (FLAT) vary with point of sail. Forward driving force (FR) increases, as {{the direction of}} travel is more aligned with the wind, and lateral force (FLAT) decreases.|$|E
40|$|An {{adaptive}} aircraft {{has been}} designed with new degrees of freedom, morphing control inputs, that will allow it to morph its structure to perform a new range of maneuvers. In particular is the capability to land through a perching maneuver, similar to that performed by large, migratory birds. Proper control of the new degrees of freedom is important for improved performance over conventional aircraft. This paper compares {{the ability of the}} aircraft to track a reference trajectory using error feedback control both with and without a morphing input. Controlling the wing incidence angle relative to the fuselage decouples the pitch angle of the wings from that of the fuselage, allowing for better pitch tracking performance.

40|$|Lifting {{operation}} on a FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel) {{is much more}} demanding for the crane and the crane driver than similar operations on a fixed offshore platform. Due to {{the motion of the}} FPSO in heavy sea and strong wind, the crane is subjected to additional dynamic forces as well as swinging loads. The present paper deals with numerical simulation of the dynamic behaviour of the Norne offshore crane during lifting operation. The simulations are performed by FEDEM – a general nonlinear dynamic analysis program for flexible multibody systems. The pedestal, “king ” and boom are flexible links modelled by shell finite elements and connected together by different joints. The hoisting rope and the hydraulic cylinders are modelled by linear and nonlinear spring and damper elements. A control system is implemented in the model making it possible to control the movement of the boom and the winch to compensate for the relative motion between the ship and the supply vessel and keep the load in rest relative to the vessel. Examples are shown of calculated natural frequencies and mode shapes as function of hoisting rope length and <b>boom</b> <b>angle.</b> Furthermore, maximum dynamic stresses in different sections/details are presented as function of how the crane is operated. Besides giving necessary stress data for design verification against overload and fatigue, the presented model can be used to optimise the operation procedure, determine the maximum allowable load for various sea states and to calculate necessary power to control the motion of the load...|$|E
40|$|Hydropower {{plants are}} {{the main source of}} {{renewable}} energy from moving water. However, traditional dam systems are somewhat controversial since they are large and often require population relocation, disrupt fish migration, and change the natural flow of the river. Hydrokinetic systems are currently being developed which can harness energy from flowing water with less ecological impact. One hydrokinetic system that may be promising, a hydrokite system, consists of an oscillating arm, boom, and a translating hydrofoil. Due to the hydrodynamic forces caused by the water 2 ̆ 7 s velocity, the hydrokite moves back and forth extracting energy from the flow. Previous simulations have shown that power production for this system depends on at least ten different parameters. Little experimental work has been done on hydrokite systems to validate the results of these simulations. This work focused on the experimental testing of a lab-scale hydrokite system. Tests were run to determine the system power trends with respect to hydrofoil <b>angles,</b> <b>boom</b> flip <b>angles,</b> pivot-point location on hydrofoil, tow speed, and hydrofoil submerged depth. Single dimension parameter tests were done to determine the changes in average cycle power for the system as a function of a given parameter. Power production was highly sensitive to changes in hydrofoil angles (for hydrofoils pivoting at both the quarter and half-chord point). The optimal hydrofoil angle for the tests that were run was approximately β = 60 ° - 80 °. As predicted, the power production increases with increased tow speed and submerged depth, neglecting energy used to flip the hydrofoil. Changes in <b>boom</b> flip <b>angle</b> did not significantly affect power production for the quarter-chord tests, but appeared to be significant in the half-chord tests. Although the largest power produced in all of this testing was approximately 0. 14 Watts, this initial testing of the lab-scale system has given us some insight into the important design decisions that will need to be made in order to scale-up the system...|$|R
40|$|Cranes {{used in the}} {{construction}} and transportation industries are generally devices with multiple degrees of freedom including variable load-line length, variable jib length (usually via a trolley), and variable <b>boom</b> <b>angles.</b> Point-to-point payload maneuvers using cranes are performed {{so as not to}} excite the spherical pendulum modes of their cable and payload assemblies. Typically, these pendulum modes, although time-varying, exhibit low frequencies. Current crane maneuvers are therefore performed slowly contributing to high construction and transportation costs. This investigation details a general method for applying command shaping to various multiple degree of freedom cranes such that the payload moves to a specified point without residual oscillation. A dynamic programming method is used for general command shaping for optimal maneuvers. Computationally, the dynamic programming approach requires order M calculations to arrive at a solution, where M is the number of discretizations of the input commands. This feature is exploited for the crane command shaping problem allowing for rapid calculation of command histories. Fast generation of commands is a necessity for practical use of command shaping for the applications described in this work. These results are compared to near-optimal solutions where the commands are linear combinations of acceleration pulse basis functions. The pulse shape is required due to hardware requirements. The weights on the basis functions are chosen as the solution to a parameter optimization problem solved using a Recursive Quadratic Programming technique. Simulation results and experimental verification for a variable load-line length rotary crane are presented using both design procedures...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{researches}} several novel {{high power}} wideband antennas with omnidirectional, horizon- and broadside-directional, and bi-directional coverage for various electronic warfare (EW) systems. The developed antennas are designed and analyzed with the considerations in frequency domain (FD), time domain (TD), and power domain (PD) using full-wave electromagnetic simulations, transient analysis, multiphysics simulations, field analysis, equivalent circuit modeling, spherical mode decomposition, etc., as needed. The theoretical models of all antenna configuration are carefully validated with measurements. Equivalent circuit models of monopole-like antennas are derived {{based on the}} physical structure and field distribution around a monopole. These models are used to ease physical understanding, analyze antenna impedance, and design derivatives with improved performance. A novel wideband omnidirectional antenna with consistent monopole-like patterns is proposed for millimeter-wave integrated towed decoy receiving subsystems by combining annular slot mode with a monopole into a single structure. The bandwidth of the combined antenna is improved to cover {{the wide range of}} radar signals from 18 GHz to 45 GHz, and its operating principle is analyzed using the proposed equivalent circuit model. In addition, compact paraboloid reflector fed by the combined antenna is designed for the same platform but with enabled horizon-directional coverage. The path toward using the proposed combined antenna for transient high power electromagnetics (HPEM) applications with good TD and PD performances is described. Reconfigurability between steerable horizon-directional and omnidirectional modes for transient HPEM pulses is demonstrated by a monocone fed reflector antenna system. To do so, a conventional monocone is modified to a conical monopole first. The spherical mode expansion (SME) analysis shows that this structure has consistent monopole-like patterns and {{can be used as a}} feeder of a wideband reflector antenna system. Owing to the small diameter and consistent patterns of the modified monocone feeder, a paraboloid reflector is engineered and stable impedance and far-field performances from 1. 66 GHz to 20 GHz are demonstrated. Analysis in TD and PD proves the suitability of the proposed antenna concept for transient HPEM applications. The electrical size of the monocone is also reduced by loading shorted semi-helical wires. The circuit model analysis demonstrates that typical miniaturization techniques require large monocone diameter though height can be greatly reduced. The proposed loading does not contribute to additional antenna volume, while lowering its electrical size by 34 %, and the prototype monocone achieves good impedance match and gain from 1. 23 GHz to 11 GHz. Planar bi-directional and flush-mountable broadside unidirectional log-periodic (LP) antennas for long range communication, radar, or jammer systems with over a decade wideband performance are also introduced. To maintain inherent bi-directionality of a planar LP antenna, microstrip feed is preferred over a typical coax-based exciter. However, this leads to deteriorated impedance match and pattern distortion when the <b>boom</b> <b>angle</b> is not wide enough. To resolve this issue, a novel wide-boom geometry of the LP antenna is proposed. Since the wide-boom provides wide ground plane for the feeding microstrip line, good impedance match and gain performances can be achieved without sacrificing the antenna size. Moreover, electro-thermal multiphysics analysis of the antenna shows that the wide-boom also improves the temperature response, and thus, the average power handling capability is increased. The multiphysics simulation results are validated using a non-contact infrared (IR) camera. To achieve broadside unidirectional coverage, a slot-loaded cavity backing design is engineered. Instead of filling the cavity with carbon loaded absorber, the proposed slot-cavity backed LP antenna is loaded with the slot terminated by a coax cable that can be easily used for energy recycling. Fabricated prototype maintains high gain and efficiency with good impedance match over a wide bandwidth from 0. 59 GHz to 5 GHz. All ideas and concepts proposed in this thesis are thoroughly validated with circuit and full-wave simulations as well as experiments on representative prototypes...|$|E

Modern {{equipment and the}} development of improved chemical product application techniques contribute toward the constant search for improved revenue from the potato as a crop. Field experiments were carried out in a random block design of a potato crop of the "Ágata" variety. The aim was to evaluate the effect of air assistance combined to different angles of spray application on the chemical deposition on the potato plant, as well as to assess spray losses to the soil. For this a sprayer with and without boom air assistance was used in the experiments. <b>Boom</b> <b>angles</b> of 0 º, + 30 º and - 30 º were directed to a vertical position as well as forward and backward movements. The trial plants were sprayed at a volume rate of 400 L ha- 1 using JA- 4 hollow cone nozzles at 633 kPa and copper oxychloride as a tracer for the deposit evaluation. Trace deposits on both surfaces of leaflets were removed by washing with destilled water and were quantified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Spray losses were measured by placing plastic measuring collectors between rows. The deposit levels at different positions in the plant were analyzed by the Hotelling T² statistical test. Larger deposits were detected at both upper and lower positions of the plant when the spray boom was positioned at 0 º and + 30 º in the presence of air assistance. The presence of air, in addition to the increasing spray deposits in the lower parts of the plant, helped to create greater distribution uniformity. Spray loss was below 4 %...|$|R

40|$|Six sonic booms, {{generated}} by F- 4 aircraft under steady fight {{at a range}} of altitudes (610 - 6100 m) and Mach numbers (1. 07 - 1. 26), were measured just above the air/sea interface, and at five depths in the water column. The measurements were made with a vertical hydrophone array suspended from a small spar buoy at the sea surface, and telemetered to a nearby research vessel. The sonic boom pressure amplitude decays exponentially with depth, and the signal fades into the ambient noise field by 30 - 50 in, depending {{on the strength of}} the boom at the sea surface. Low-frequency components of the boom waveform penetrate significantly deeper than high frequencies. Frequencies greater than 20 Hz are difficult to observe at depths greater than about 10 m. Underwater sonic boom pressure measurements exhibit excellent agreement with predictions from analytical theory, despite the assumption of a flat air/sea interface. Significant scattering of the sonic boom signal by the rough ocean surface is not detected. Real ocean conditions appear to exert a negligible effect on the penetration of sonic booms into the ocean unless steady vehicle speeds exceed Mach 3, when the <b>boom</b> incidence <b>angle</b> is sufficient to cause scattering on realistic open ocean surfaces...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Achieving {{accurate}} excavation profiles is {{a challenging}} task for excavator operators who typically use the directions of a grade-person to achieve design grades and levels. Allocation of an extra person is costly and requires constant communication between an operator and the grade-person, which reduces productivity.

Booms are successful in collecting oil on water for recovery but their performance is not the same in every case. Booms fail to retain oil under certain circumstances. This boom failure occurs by several modes of which Drainage and Entraimnent are the common modes of boom failure. This phenomenon of Boom Drainage which causes a boom to fail is the focus of this thesis and has been explained. It is also differentiated from Entrainment (the other mode of boom failure). This is accomplished by means of both visual aids and text. Further, a mathematical model developed in 1969, which is a comprehensive work, and uses mathematical equations and design charts to explain the phenomena of Boom drainage as well as Entraimnent is evaluated. This mathematical model is critically analyzed to test for its validity. This is done by comparing the results of this mathematical model to other literature citations. From this analysis it was concluded that Wicks' mathematical model is a valuable piece of literature and is a comprehensive work, but certain discrepancies and gaps were found to exist which need further explanation.
