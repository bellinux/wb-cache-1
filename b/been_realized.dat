5|$|In 2002, O'Neill {{claimed to}} have {{obtained}} the rights to make a sequel to Summer of '42, based on a short story she wrote, {{which took place in}} an alternate reality where Herman Raucher had a son and divorced his wife, went back to Nantucket in 1962 with a still-living Oscar Seltzer, and encountered Dorothy again and married her. As of 2017, this project – which O'Neill had hoped to produce with Lifetime television – has not <b>been</b> <b>realized,</b> and it is unknown whether O'Neill is still attempting to get it produced, or if Raucher consented to its production.|$|E
5|$|Several {{films have}} been remade or {{influenced}} by Tiga Dara. A remake, Tiga Dara Mencari Cinta (Three Maidens Seek Love), {{was directed by}} Djun Saptohadi and released in 1980. This comedy starred Ingrid Fernandez, Nana Riwayatie, and Winny Aditya Dewi as three sisters who live with their father and face the trials and tribulations of dating. Eight years later, when Teguh Karya was directing Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta (Lover Left by the Train, 1989), he insisted that {{the cast and crew}} watch Tiga Dara in an attempt to transcend it. In Tempo, the writer Putu Wijaya later described Pacar Ketinggalan Kereta as seemingly trying to recapture the family and musical dynamics of Ismail's story. In 2004 a remake of Tiga Dara, to be directed by Rudi Soedjarwo and involve Dian Sastrowardoyo, Siti Nurhaliza, and Krisdayanti, was announced, though this production has not <b>been</b> <b>realized.</b>|$|E

25|$|Well-controllable {{experiments}} in chemical reaction-diffusion systems {{have up to}} now <b>been</b> <b>realized</b> in three ways. First, gel reactors or filled capillary tubes may be used.

However, stabilization of cubic zirconium oxide had <b>been</b> <b>realized</b> early on, with the synthetic product stabilized zirconia introduced in 1929.

25|$|On {{learning}} that Béla IV {{had given his}} daughter in marriage to Rostislav, his father believed that his efforts to form an alliance with the Árpád dynasty had finally <b>been</b> <b>realized.</b> Mikhail Vsevolodovich therefore rode to Hungary expecting to negotiate the agreements that normally accompanied such an alliance. However, Béla IV rebuffed him, and he, greatly angered also by his son, returned to Chernigov and disowned Rostislav.|$|E
25|$|Power {{transmission}} via {{radio waves}} {{can be made}} more directional, allowing longer-distance power beaming, with shorter wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, typically in the microwave range. A rectenna {{may be used to}} convert the microwave energy back into electricity. Rectenna conversion efficiencies exceeding 95% have <b>been</b> <b>realized.</b> Power beaming using microwaves has been proposed for the transmission of energy from orbiting solar power satellites to Earth and the beaming of power to spacecraft leaving orbit has been considered.|$|E

Subsequently, Tay [7] and Whiteley [11] independently {{characterized the}} multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-hinge frameworks. We adapt Whiteley’s proof technique {{to characterize the}} multigraphs which can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-bar-and-hinge frameworks. More importantly, we obtain a sufficient condition for a multigraph to <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-and-hinge framework in which all hinges lie in the same hyperplane. This result is related to a longstanding conjecture of Tay and Whiteley [8] which would characterize when a multigraph can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid d-dimensional body-andhinge framework {{in which all the}} hinges incident to each body lie in a common hyperplane. As a corollary we deduce that if a graph G has two spanning trees which use each edge of G at most twice, then its square can <b>be</b> <b>realized</b> as an infinitesimally rigid 3 -dimensional bar-and-joint framework...|$|R

The combination of Surface Laplacian with automated techniques for removing muscle components using ICA proved particularly effective in a follow up study.|$|E

The text of Compactata based on the Four Articles of Prague was accepted by the Czech (Bohemian and Moravian) political representation {{as well as by}} the Council of Basel, but the Pope refused to recognize it.|$|E

The gyroplane pilots also form the backbone of the pilot crew of the Kurdish police, who are trained to pilot on Eurocopter EC 120 B helicopters.|$|E
