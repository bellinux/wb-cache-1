5|$|A {{version of}} deep-fried <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> a stick debuted at the Iowa State Fair 2011, which was {{prepared}} using frozen butter that is dipped in a honey- and cinnamon- flavored batter, deep-fried until browned, and then {{topped with a}} confectioner's sugar glaze. This concoction on a stick was invented by Larry Fyfe, an entrepreneur and concessionaire at the fair. Versions at the Iowa State Fair have also been prepared and served formed as balls. Deep-fried butter has also been served on a stick at the State Fair of Texas.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter {{is made by}} {{spreading}} peanut <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> a slice of bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals Bobby's phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick {{go inside}} while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy {{attack from the}} peanut <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> the litter. Dale saves Harken by {{stabbing}} him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale reluctantly wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen) is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness.|$|E

5000|$|Terry and Gerry {{took their}} style from {{nineteen}} fifties pop artists - they wore black evening suits and ribbon ties {{in the style}} of the Everly Brothers while sounding more akin to Britain’s Lonnie Donegan. The songs written by Colvin/Lilley were remarkable for their brevity with the three songs on the first side of their debut EP <b>Butter’s</b> <b>On</b> the Bread totalling just four minutes and five seconds. <b>Butter’s</b> <b>on</b> the Bread referred to the miners’ strike of 1984.|$|R

25|$|The Swedish word smörgåsbord {{consists}} of the words smörgås (sandwich, usually open-faced) and bord (table). Smörgås in turn {{consists of}} the words smör (butter, cognate with English smear) and gås. Gås literally means goose, but later referred to the small pieces of butter that formed and floated {{to the surface of}} cream while it was churned. These pieces reminded the old Swedish peasants of fat geese swimming to the surface. The small butter pieces were just the right size to be placed and flattened out on bread, so smörgås came to mean buttered bread. In Sweden, the term att breda smörgåsar (to spread <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> open-faced sandwiches) has been used since at least the 16th century.|$|E
500|$|The truffle is edible, and {{has been}} {{harvested}} for culinary purposes, although with less frequency than other Pacific Northwest truffles. Both the flavor and odor of the edible fruit body resemble mature Camembert cheese. One source described the taste as follows: [...] "Served in melted <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> sliced baguette, they reminded of buttered lobster." ...|$|E

50|$|Cartman, {{terrified of}} Butters' plan of revenge, {{searches}} desperately for the tape, {{but to no}} avail. Cartman soon begins to starve because Butters believes that, since he is a robot, he {{does not need to}} eat. Butters also forces the robot to do all his chores for him, including some of the more unpleasant tasks. With the agreement of Ms. Cartman, Butters' parents (knowing who AWESOM-O really is, but thinking it is an elaborate game that <b>Butters</b> is in <b>on)</b> decide to let AWESOM-O come along with <b>Butters</b> <b>on</b> a trip to Los Angeles to see his aunt. Cartman realizes that he will have to accompany <b>Butters</b> <b>on</b> the trip, in order to keep up his disguise. Upon arriving, he is so hungry and worn out after wearing the suit for a whole airplane ride that he makes up an excuse to use the bathroom and proceeds to eat toothpaste.|$|R
500|$|Frenetic in {{progression}} {{and explicit}} in lyrical content, Adkins {{was known for}} having an unconventional take on traditional rockabilly. His unpolished sound was a praised by-product of the makeshift studio equipment used {{for the majority of}} his career. [...] "I didn't try to be primitive, I just had bad microphones", he wrote. His lyrics explored topics such as eating peanut <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> the moon and the suggestive strut of a chicken. Recurring themes in Adkins' catalogue included sex, heartbreak, decapitation, aliens, hot dogs and poultry. Together with country and honky-tonk, Adkins' assortment of styles helped delineate a genre known as psychobilly.|$|E
500|$|Larwood {{has been}} widely {{acknowledged}} as the greatest fast bowler of his generation and, according to his Wisden obituary, was [...] "one of the rare fast bowlers in the game's long history to spread terror in opposition ranks by {{the mere mention of}} his name". Timing technology was primitive in his day, but various tests indicated speeds of between 90 and 100mph (140 to 160km/h). [...] Fingleton commented that Larwood was [...] "about twice as fast as anyone out there", indicating a match in progress at Trent Bridge. However, one Australian from an earlier cricketing generation, Ernie Jones, dismissed Larwood: [...] "He wouldn't knock a dint in a pound of <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> a hot day".|$|E
500|$|We {{have found}} these fish {{when they were}} {{too small to be}} worth cooking in the usual way, {{excellent}} when quite simply baked in the following manner, the flesh being remarkably sweet and tender, much more so than it becomes by frying or broiling. After they have been cleaned, dry them in a cloth, season the insides slightly with fine salt, dredge a little flour on the fish, and stick a few very small bits of <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> them, but only just sufficient to prevent their becoming dry in the oven; lay them singly on a flat dish, and bake them very gently from fourteen to sixteen minutes. Serve them with the same sauce as baked soles.|$|E

2500|$|Marshmallow creme, {{better known}} as {{marshmallow}} [...] "fluff" [...] in the United States, is a food item that is a sweet, spreadable, marshmallow-like confection. It is typically used with peanut <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> the fluffernutter sandwich. In addition, marshmallow creme and Nutella can be spread on graham crackers to emulate s'mores. Marshmallow creme is a New England creation invented in 1917 by Archibald Query of Somerville, Massachusetts.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the double}} entendre in the {{question}} [...] "Johnny always put <b>butter</b> <b>on</b> his _____" [...] marked a turning point {{in the question}}s on the show. Soon, the tone of Rayburn's questions changed notably, leaving behind the staid topics that The Match Game had first disposed of in 1963 for more risqué humor. Celebrity panelists Brett Somers (Klugman's wife at the time) and Charles Nelson Reilly began as guest panelists on the program, with Somers brought in at the request of Klugman, who felt she would make a nice fit on the program. The chemistry between Somers and Reilly prompted Goodson-Todman and CBS to hire them as regular panelists; Somers remained on the show until 1982, while Reilly continued appearing through the 1983–84 and 1990–91 revivals, with a brief break in 1974–75 when Gary Burghoff, Nipsey Russell, and Rip Taylor substituted for him.|$|E
