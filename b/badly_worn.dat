On 9 February, the ships began shelling Soviet positions. Between 18 and 24 February, German forces launched a local counterattack; Admiral Scheer and the torpedo boats provided artillery support, targeting Soviet positions near Peyse and Gross-Heydekrug. The German attack temporarily restored the land connection to Königsberg. The ship's guns were <b>badly</b> <b>worn</b> out by March {{and in need of}} repair. On 8 March, Admiral Scheer departed the eastern Baltic to have her guns relined in Kiel; she carried 800 civilian refugees and 200 wounded soldiers. An uncleared minefield prevented her from reaching Kiel, and so she unloaded her passengers in Swinemünde. Despite her worn-out gun barrels, the ship then shelled Soviet forces outside Kolberg until she used up her remaining ammunition.|$|E

25|$|After the Continuation War {{ended with}} Moscow Armistice Allied Control Commission demanded that all coastal guns larger than 120mm in calibre east of Porkkala {{had to be}} removed and placed in storage. This {{included}} the coastal fortifications around Porkkala, fortifications of the capital Helsinki (18 152mm guns) and the Kotka-Hamina area forts (17 152/45 C guns). This restriction was lifted in 1947 after signing of the Paris Peace Treaty. 152/45 C guns were <b>badly</b> <b>worn</b> out after the war, and several had cracked or broken barrels. An investigation of the barrel failures concluded that the guns could not withstand the pressures created by the gunpowder used. This led to a development of a new light weight high explosive shell which could be fired by a half-charge of gunpowder. The worn out gun barrels were replaced with newly developed 50 caliber 152 50 Tampella barrels.|$|E

50|$|Deliberate {{shaping of}} moulded tyre tread design, {{rather than merely}} concentrating on a rubber surface that didn't fail rapidly, began {{at the start of}} the 1920s. There was little {{theoretical}} background to this though until the mid-1920s. The 1922 London Motor Show displayed a range of tread patterns that were reported on by The Autocar. Some of these, from Miller and the French firm of , display what would now be recognised as the classic bar grip pattern of sharp-edged transverse bars with a wide central rib. However these were supplied for narrow high-pressure tyres, for use on roads and at relatively high speeds. Their design was based on simple notions of transverse bars giving fore-and-aft traction, without any developed theory of tread design or experimental measurements of their performance. In practice, such square-edged tread blocks <b>wore</b> <b>badly</b> and unevenly, the initially flat blocks tending to wear with a sloping top surface. This wear pattern was one reason for the practicing of rotating tyres between wheels, so that they spent equal periods wearing in each direction.|$|R

25|$|From 1989 until 2005, it {{was common}} {{practice}} for the Marching Band to only purchase a few new uniforms each season to replace <b>badly</b> <b>worn,</b> damaged, or lost pieces.

The benefactor wanted to uniform the entire band and not just have the money used for replacement uniforms. Dr. Jon Woods decided that additional small changes would help to give the band a new, fresh look for the 2006 season. The minimal changes include updated sleeve stripes (new stripes consist of one red and one gray stripe) to minimize the wearing out that the old stripes suffered, uniform patch alignment, and a slit placed underneath the left breast pocket flap for the snare drums to attach their drums through (the common practice through band history was to cut a hole underneath the pocket flap to allow the attachment clip to pass through the uniform).|$|E

5000|$|The tooling that {{produced}} the components for the Hasbro designed manikin were <b>wearing</b> <b>badly</b> and delivering poor quality mouldings; and because the tooling was, {{what is known as}} [...] "family tools" [...] ( [...] all components to produce the limbs of the manikin were moulded on the same tool [...] ) it meant that if one component was below standard the whole shot was potentially scrap. However what was happening in production was that the good components were used but there became an imbalance in the numbers of good components, so substandard mouldings were reworked to make them acceptable and good components were ground up with bad components and the sprues for remoulding. This was becoming very uneconomic. The mouldings for the new Dynamique Physique manikin were moulded on non-family hot-runner tools ( [...] no sprues to be recycled [...] ). That is a separate tool for each component. So it was easy to maintain equal numbers of components to make up the figures; and the quality was assured. Prototype tooling using the hot-runner system was organised by Alec Langton to prove the manufacturing and design, as well as provide sales samples and product for toy fairs.|$|R

5000|$|Bruh-Man (Brother Man) (Reginald Ballard) (1993-1997): Martin's neighbor, {{who lives}} on the fifth [...] "flo" [...] (yet he always puts 4 fingers up when {{relating}} this fact), directly upstairs from Martin. Whenever Martin asks what he is doing, Bruh-Man replies, [...] "Nuttin'…just chillin'." [...] He often climbs down the [...] "f-a-a-a-ah 'scape" [...] (fire escape), to enter Martin's apartment, taking food, borrowing assorted items, and generally lounging around as if he lives there. At first, this greatly annoyed Martin but he eventually got used to it. In fact, fire escapes seem to be his only means of movement throughout buildings—he is seldom seen entering or exiting the apartment through the front door. When he attended Martin and Gina's engagement party at Gina's apartment, he {{went as far as}} climbing the building since there was no fire escape. Bruh-Man always <b>wears</b> <b>badly</b> fitting clothing a size or two too small (frequently, items he's [...] "borrowed" [...] from Martin), and has a characteristic gait consisting of a slow and lazy, rather limping, plodding walk, with his head cocked to one side. Martin, as Bruh-Man was heading toward the window to make his exit, once referred to it as his [...] "slow bop". Bruh-Man speaks in a deep voice and with a long drawl, not unlike that of Shaquille O'Neal. Despite being a popular character, Bruh-Man was quietly phased out of the series. His last appearances were in the fourth season, and he explains his absence by stating that he only comes around when Martin and Gina are away out of respect for their marriage. This is proven true as he does appear in the fifth and final season of the series, however he is shown briefly. In episode 13, [...] "Ain't That About a Ditch", when Gina's mother locks Martin out of his apartment, he pauses to think, then whispers [...] "Bruh-Man" [...] to himself as he walks off to climb in through the fire escape, then Martin shows up in his apartment.|$|R

500|$|Not {{much remains}} of Stela 18, {{and what is}} left is <b>badly</b> <b>worn.</b> However, {{archaeologist}} Sylvanus Morley claimed that it expressed a Calendar Round date of 6 Ahaw 13 K'ayab (corresponding to a Long Count date of 9.17.5.0.0 or Dec. 27, 775), which Martin and Grube note is within Ha' K'in Xook's reign. Stela 23 is the king's accession monument. Originally carved on all four faces, this stela is in poor condition because it tipped over and shattered. The largest portions remaining include the base, and remnants of a basal panel of glyphs that feature the feet of two individuals. Similar to Stela 18, Martin and Grube argue that Stela 23 dates to the rulership of Ha' K'in Xook because the Calendar Round date on the monument is contemporary with the date found on Stela 13. This stele details a puluuy utz'itil ceremony for Ha' K'in Xook's dead father, Itzam K'an Ahk II, and, when translated, reads [...] "Ruler 6 , child of Ruler 4 [...] … acceded to the rulership", seemingly proving that Ha' K'in Xook was indeed the offspring of Itzam K'an Ahk II.|$|E

40|$|A GIRL, {{forced to}} marry her father after he sees her playing in his dead wife’s wedding gown, runs away wearing five dresses. Four dresses are of silk and they are beautiful. The last dress is of wood. It is in this dress that the girl escapes, {{throwing}} herself into the river to float away. A prince saves the girl but treats her <b>badly,</b> for she <b>wears</b> an ugly wood frock. Her suffering is eased at night when the girl takes off the wood dress and dances in her silk ones. The prince discovers {{the girl in the}} silk dresses and falls in love. They live happily ever after. This thesis is based on a fairy tale in which a girl’s life is changed by what she wears. In Fair Maiden Wood clothing is a means to identity. Costume is what identifies this girl as her father’s new bride, and it reveals to the shallow prince who his true love is. It is through clothing that we identify the fairy tale. But more significantly, it is through clothing that the girl experiences the outside world. The girl lives through her wood frock – it is the vessel by which she escapes the threat of incest, it is the prison that disguises her beauty from the prince; it is her armor, her cage, her temporary home. 	The wood frock becomes the girl’s first architecture, protecting and sheltering the girl in the most intimate manner, controlling her most immediate environment. But its role is not limited to enclosure; the wood dress also changes the girl’s experience of her surroundings, extending her bodily influence while also constraining it. The wood dress dictates how the girl moves, how much space she needs, how others see her, and how they treat her. It is an environment, elusively defined by the dialogue between her moving body and the surface of the wood shell surrounding her, which changes the girl’s quality of existence. In this in-between silhouette is a most potent, and poetic, form of architecture. 	In my thesis I continue the story of the girl in the wood frock through the design of three of her five gowns. The gowns reference the work of designers such as Cristobal Balenciaga or Issey Miyake whose clothes, by virtue of their construction and materiality, affect wearer and observer in startling and profound fashion. Their garments show a symbiotic relationship between body and shell, where the shell is not simply a passive enclosure but a responsive and independent extension of the body. My dresses are made with this symbiosis in mind, and I use their (painstaking) construction in order to propose that in clothing is the potential to create spatial environments that change fundamental perceptions by filtering and extending the wearer’s experience of the world and her effect on it. These dresses and the spaces they create are unique. They are not costumes of the everyday, used to suppress sensation in order to function; instead they are of the special day, when the girl seeks to be stimulated, enlightened, and also saved. They are dresses of heightened awareness, integrating both sense and action within their shifting boundaries, shaping a dynamic, albeit fleeting, architecture...|$|R
