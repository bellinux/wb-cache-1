2500|$|In January 2014, it was {{reported}} that Israel and the United States had been quietly discussing the prospect of ending US aid, with representatives from both countries agreeing at <b>bilateral</b> <b>meetings</b> that Israel no longer needs US military aid. According to Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former US ambassador to Israel, [...] "we may be reaching a point that after discussion of how to assure the security and intelligence cooperation, we can actually phase out the security assistance".|$|E
2500|$|A final {{meeting was}} decided on {{before the end}} of 2007. [...] However, this was never {{realized}} because despite the DPRK issuing a report of its inventory in November 2007 and thus claiming that since it fulfilled its side of the bargain, it was waiting for its promised shipment of aid, the US claimed the inventory list was definitely incomplete and until the complete list was given by the DPRK, aid would be suspended. [...] There have been numerous US-DPRK <b>bilateral</b> <b>meetings</b> held in Beijing and Geneva since the end of this phase of this round of talks.|$|E

During subsequent <b>bilateral</b> <b>meetings,</b> Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali conveyed deep apprehensions about funding for terrorists flowing from India to Bangladesh to Ajit Doval, the Indian National Security Advisor (NSA).

2500|$|With time, Ghenadie became {{close to}} the Conservative Party, whose {{cabinets}} appointed him to high office. In 1874, when Titu Maiorescu was Minister of Religious Affairs, Ghenadie was unanimously voted an Archiereus by the Romanian Synod. He {{was assigned to the}} Argeș Bishopric in February 1875, when Petre P. Carp was head of the Ministry. His selection coincided with a period of [...] "consolidation", which cemented the reforms of the previous period, when the United Principalities had become the modern Romanian state and the church hierarchies had been fused together. The former Bishop of Argeș, also named Ghenadie, had taken part in the effort to consolidate the international prestige of Romanian Orthodoxy, by participating in <b>bilateral</b> <b>meetings</b> with the Old Catholic Church.|$|E
2500|$|African delegates {{arrived in}} Yokohama {{with a number}} of their own well-thought out agendas. Some voices argued {{that it would be better}} if Africa {{attended}} TICAD-V (2013) with a continental-wide agenda which could then be broken up into country-specific strategies which could be more fully explored during the subsequent <b>bilateral</b> <b>meetings.</b> [...] Drawing up a common agenda detailing the trade and investment issues would seem a plausible strategy because the nations of the continent are grappling with similar challenge which include poor infrastructure and trade terms that are weighted heavily against Africa. [...] In a sense, Thabo Mbeki embraced this continental strategy as he suggested that Africa's future economic growth should happen through trade and not aid. Mbeki said, [...] "Without discounting the importance of aid, improved terms of trade for Africa are critical to ensure its full integration into the global economy." [...] He also observed that [...] "market access alone does not always translate in the ability for the developing countries to penetrate competitive world markets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Relations between Japan and its {{immediate}} neighbours, China and South Korea, remained poor after Abe's return to office. While {{he declared that}} the [...] "doors are always open on my side", no <b>bilateral</b> <b>meetings</b> between Abe and the Chinese leadership took place for the first 23 months of his second term. Neither did Abe hold any meetings with President Park Geun-hye of Korea during his 2012-14 term of office. Both countries criticised Abe's visit to Yasukuni Shrine in December 2013, with China's Foreign Minister describing the action as moving Japan in an [...] "extremely dangerous" [...] direction. In addition, China has continued to criticise Abe's defense reform policies, warning that Japan should not abandon its post-war policy of pacifism. Abe's speech at the World Economic Forum in 2014 was interpreted as a criticism of Chinese foreign and defense policy {{when he said that}} [...] "the dividends of growth in Asia must not be wasted on military expansion" [...] and called for greater preservation of the freedom of the seas under the rule of law, although he did not specifically refer to any one country during his remarks.|$|E
