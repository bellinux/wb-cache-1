5|$|Andromeda Galaxy {{was formed}} roughly 10 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> from the {{collision}} and subsequent merger of smaller protogalaxies.|$|E
5|$|Free {{oxygen gas}} was almost nonexistent in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago).</b> For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E
50|$|Mare Nectaris {{is located}} in the central part of 860-km-diameter impact basin, which was formed 3.8-3.9 <b>billions</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> This event marks the {{beginning}} of Nectarian period of the lunar geologic timescale. Best-preserved (southwestern) part of the rim of this basin is called Rupes Altai.|$|R

5|$|Hesperian period (named after Hesperia Planum): 3.5 {{to between}} 3.3 and 2.9 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The Hesperian period {{is marked by}} the {{formation}} of extensive lava plains.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{inhabited}} the Earth from approximately 3–4 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> No obvious changes in morphology or cellular organisation occurred in these organisms {{over the next}} few billion years. The eukaryotic cells emerged between 1.6–2.7 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The next major change in cell structure came when bacteria were engulfed by eukaryotic cells, in a cooperative association called endosymbiosis. The engulfed bacteria and the host cell then underwent coevolution, with the bacteria evolving into either mitochondria or hydrogenosomes. Another engulfment of cyanobacterial-like organisms {{led to the formation of}} chloroplasts in algae and plants.|$|E
5|$|The Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly is a hotspot (volcanic complex) on the Moon. It {{is on the}} {{far side}} of the Moon and was found by a gamma-ray {{spectrometer}} in 1998. It is an area of concentrated thorium, a radioactive element. Lunar rock samples from the Apollo missions reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> but could have been as recent as 1 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> due to the unknown history of the moon's far side.|$|E
50|$|The Moon {{was much}} closer to Earth <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and {{therefore}} produced considerably more tidal heating.|$|R

5|$|Amazonian period (named after Amazonis Planitia): between 3.3 and 2.9 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> to the present. Amazonian regions {{have few}} {{meteorite}} impact craters, but are otherwise quite varied. Olympus Mons formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{hypothesis}} suggested {{it was possible}} that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of RNA on Mars with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
5|$|Minnesota {{has some}} of the Earth's oldest rocks, gneisses that are about 3.6 billion years old (80 percent as old as the planet). About 2.7 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> basaltic lava poured out of cracks in the floor of the {{primordial}} ocean; the remains of this volcanic rock formed the Canadian Shield in northeast Minnesota. The roots of these volcanic mountains and the action of Precambrian seas formed the Iron Range of northern Minnesota. Following a period of volcanism 1.1 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> Minnesota's geological activity has been more subdued, with no volcanism or mountain formation, but with repeated incursions of the sea, which left behind multiple strata of sedimentary rock.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{limestone}} mountains throughout Sagada. This part of Luzon {{used to be}} {{submerged in}} the ocean <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and fossilised seashells {{can be found in}} the walls of Sumaguing Cave.|$|R
5000|$|... "Gamma-ray bursts are {{so bright}} {{we can see}} them from <b>billions</b> of light <b>years</b> away, which means they {{occurred}} <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and we see them as they looked then," [...] stated Charles Meegan of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center.|$|R
5|$|In the past, astronomers {{once thought}} the rings formed {{alongside}} the planet when it formed <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Instead, {{the age of}} these planetary rings is probably some {{hundreds of millions of}} years.|$|R
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of life {{may have begun}} shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> during a habitable epoch when the Universe was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the rest}} of the {{southern}} Blue Ridge Mountains, Vogel State Park and the surrounding area consists of many valleys, ridges and mountains formed by repeated plate tectonic movement and collisions, starting with the Grenville Orogeny nearly 1.5 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The resulting landscape created diverse topology containing many different species of plants and animal.|$|E
5|$|Noachian period (named after Noachis Terra): Formation of {{the oldest}} extant {{surfaces}} of Mars, 4.5 to 3.5 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> Noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters. The Tharsis bulge, a volcanic upland, {{is thought to have}} formed during this period, with extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period.|$|E

50|$|NGC 1818 {{is a young}} rich {{star cluster}} in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It is {{expected}} {{it will become a}} globular cluster, but is only about 25 million years old while almost all known globular clusters formed <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rhinns complex {{consists}} {{of a set of}} Palaeoproterozoic igneous rocks that were intruded about 1.78 Ga (<b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago).</b> They had been metamorphosed by 1.71 Ga. The overall chemistry of the rocks is consistent with magmatism associated with an Andean type subduction complex.|$|R
5|$|Rain {{falling on}} loosely packed {{material}} such as newly fallen ash can produce dimples {{that can be}} fossilized. The air density dependence of the maximum raindrop diameter together with fossil raindrop imprints {{has been used to}} constrain the density of the air 2.7 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{prominent}} families in the asteroid belt (in order of increasing semi-major axes) are the Flora, Eunoma, Koronis, Eos, and Themis families. The Flora family, one of the largest with more than 800 known members, may have formed from a collision less than a <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
5|$|Such {{large-scale}} {{interactions are}} rare. As time passes, mergers of two systems of equal size become less common. Most bright galaxies have remained fundamentally unchanged {{for the last}} few billion years, and the net rate of star formation probably also peaked approximately ten <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E
50|$|Extinct {{isotopes}} of superheavy {{elements are}} isotopes of elements whose half-lives were {{too short to}} have lasted through {{the formation of the}} solar system and, because they not replenished by natural processes, can nowadays only be found within sediment and meteorite samples dating <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{dust and}} gas {{comprising}} the comet's nucleus {{is part of}} the same primordial materials from which the Sun and planets were formed <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The complex carbon-rich molecules they contain may have provided some of the raw materials from which life originated on Earth.|$|R
5000|$|The Quiet War (2008) by Paul J. McAuley. Europa's {{subsurface}} {{ocean is}} home to the only non-Terran (microbial) life in the Solar System, although as a result of panspermia from a microbe-laden meteorite from an early Solar System body's collision with Earth <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Moon {{is thought}} to have formed about 4.51 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> not long after Earth. The most widely {{accepted}} explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.|$|E
5|$|The first {{form of life}} {{to develop}} on the Earth were microbes, and they {{remained}} the only form of life until about a <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see. They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{energetic}} {{chemistry is}} thought to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 <b>billion</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of all life existed. The current scientific consensus is that the complex biochemistry that makes up life came from simpler chemical reactions. The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{lines of}} {{evidence}} suggest that Mars {{lost most of}} its atmosphere <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago.</b> The MAVEN orbiter is studying {{the current rate of}} atmospheric loss with an emphasis {{on the role of the}} solar wind, whose rapidly moving ions and magnetic field may be responsible for Mars' current condition.|$|R
50|$|Brown {{has stated}} {{that it is more}} likely that one or more non-companion stars, passing near the Sun <b>billions</b> of <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> could have pulled Sedna out into its current orbit. In 2004, Kenyon {{forwarded}} this explanation after analysis of Sedna's orbital data and computer modeling of possible ancient non-companion star passes.|$|R
40|$|Pictures of Mars {{from the}} Viking and Mariner 9 {{missions}} {{provide evidence of}} liquid water in Mars' past, indicating a warmer climate. It is speculated that outflow channels and valley networks were formed 3. 5 to 4 <b>billions</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> {{at the same time}} life was developing on Earth. Current theories suggest that chemical reactions in Mars' early atmosphere depleted the original amounts of carbon dioxide with no mechanism to recycle it back into the atmosphere. Ecosystems in the cold, dry Antarctic valleys provide models of Mars on Earth and indicate that if life evolved on Mars there may be organic or fossil evidence under the surface. Lake beds on Mars surface are considered to be the best place to hunt for fossils...|$|R
