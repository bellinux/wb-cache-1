40|$|Aspects {{of rolling}} on tandem four-high {{cold-rolling}} tube mills are studied. The article examines how the gear {{ratio of the}} diagonal transmission of the stand {{is related to the}} axial force on the semifinished product and loss of stability by the tube. An improved method is developed for designing the rolls so that the deformation process is divided between a pair of <b>breakdown</b> <b>rolls</b> and a pair of sizing rolls. The study is performed using an expert automated system developed to design technologies for the cold periodic rolling of tubes. The laws that govern the accumulation of damage resulting from the effects of the main process parameters are described and technical recommendations are made on mastering the use of the given type of mill. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} weak (2 sigma) {{evidence}} for a running spectral index seen in the three-year WMAP dataset {{and its implications for}} single field, slow roll inflation. We assume that the running is comparable to the central value found from the WMAP data analysis, and use the Hubble Slow Roll formalism to follow the evolution of the slow roll parameters. For all parameter choices consistent with a large, negative running, single field, slow roll inflation lasts less than 30 efolds after CMB scales leave the horizon. Thus, a definitive observation of a large negative running would imply that any inflationary phase requires multiple fields or the <b>breakdown</b> of slow <b>roll.</b> Alternatively, if single field, slow roll inflation is sources the primordial fluctuations, we can expect the observed running to move much closer to zero as the CMB is measured more accurately at small angular scales.

40|$|We {{present an}} study from PLANCK 2013 +WP+BAO:ΛCDM+r+α_s data, where 49 slow roll inflationary {{potentials}} are tested, {{showing that the}} theoretical value of the running provided by 48 of these potentials has a deviation to the expected observational value larger than 1. 6 σ, and its modulus is smaller than the modulus of the expected observational one, what disfavours these models at 94. 5 % of Confidence Level (C. L.), concluding from these results that, inflationary cosmology may require multiple fields or a <b>breakdown</b> of slow <b>roll</b> condition. This conclusion has drastically changed with the last data provided by PLANCK 2015 where the modulus of the expected observational value of the running has been reduced one order, getting shorter the distance to its theoretical value 1 σ or more, what allows {{the viability of the}} majority of the potentials disfavored by the running provided by PLANCK 2013 data. However if one takes into account the running of the running, its theoretical value, which in the slow roll regime depends on the slow roll parameters at third order, is incompatible with the expected observational value provided by PLANCK 2013 and PLANCK 2015, disfavouring at 92. 8 % C. L. or more, 39 of the 49 slow roll potentials tested. Moreover, if one restricts the number of e-folds to be between 30 and 80, then only two potentials will survive to this test.
