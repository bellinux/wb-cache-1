5|$|Her {{skills were}} in high demand and she formed many collaborations in Vienna, working with Ewald Schmidt on the {{modification}} of 's method of vaporizing polonium; with Marietta Blau on photographic emulsions of hydrogen rays; and with Hans Pettersson. In 1928, Pettersson asked her to analyze a sample of sea <b>bottom</b> <b>sediment</b> to determine its radium content. Because the lab she was working in was contaminated, she took the samples to the oceanographic laboratory at Bornö Marine Research Station on Stora Bornö in Gullmarsfjorden, Sweden, which would become her summer research destination for the next 12 years. Her analyses with Berta Karlik on the half-lives of uranium, thorium, and actinium decay identified radiometric dating and elemental alpha particle ranges. In 1933, Rona and Karlik won the Austrian Academy of Sciences Haitinger Prize.|$|E
5|$|When {{they are}} newly hatched, frog larvae {{feed on the}} yolk of the egg. When this is {{exhausted}} some move on to feed on bacteria, algal crusts, detritus and raspings from submerged plants. Water is drawn in through their mouths, which are usually {{at the bottom of}} their heads, and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out. Others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth. They scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the <b>bottom</b> <b>sediment,</b> filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths. Some, such as the spadefoot toads, have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>sediment.</b> Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of energy return. The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

The background ranges of the Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Cd concentrations in <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> of streams of the eastern and central Sikhote-Alin were defined. The {{concentrations of}} Zn are elevated, and the concentrations of Cd are comparable in the <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> of the reserve compared to the approximate permissible concentration in the soil.

40|$|The {{vertical}} temperature {{structure of}} <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> in lakes is discussed. Observations {{indicate that the}} temperature profile in the <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> has {{the form of a}} thermal wave. The wave starts at the water-sediment interface and propagates downward as the lake water and the <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> are heated during spring and summer. When heating ceases and cooling sets in, a new wave starts at the water-sediment interface and propagates downward as the lake water and the sediments are cooled over autumn and winter. Although the temperature in the thermally active layer of <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> varies considerably with time, a characteristic shape of the temperature-depth curve remains approximately the same. Based on this observational evidence, a two-layer parametric representation of the temperature profile in lake <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> was proposed. In this note, a theoretical explanation for the observed self-similarity of the temperature profile is offered. Assuming a travelling wave-type behaviour of the temperature profile in <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments,</b> an analytical solution to the heat transfer equation is found. This solution is compared with data from measurements in a number of lakes and in a laboratory tank. ...|$|R

Akinete abundance in <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> {{is found to be}} related with type of sediments and presence of higher water plants. The highest abundance of akinetes was observed in silty sediments at stations located in higher plants bed (mainly emerged plants Typha latifolia L. and Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud.). These results demonstrate that macrophyte beds could increase the size of the potential cyanobacterial inoculum by accumulation of akinetes in shallow <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> and, as a result, favour cyanobacterial bloom development. In addition, seasonal dynamics of Anabaena flos-aquae, including vegetative cells and akinetes, in <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> and water column in open water and littoral of the reservoir was studied. Dynamics of Anabaena abundance in the water column at the central station and littoral stations were very similar, but the number of cells in the littoral achieved higher year maximum than that at the central station.

However, at this part of the reservoir lowest intensity of akinete production was recorded. Deposition of akinetes to <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> occurred both in open water and littoral. Nevertheless, seasonal dynamics of akinetes in <b>bottom</b> <b>sediments</b> differed between these sites.
