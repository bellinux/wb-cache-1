In a neighborhood with few public spaces, it provided a consumer version of the public square. It educated workers to approach shopping as an exciting social activity, not just a routine exercise in obtaining necessities, in the same way as the bourgeoisie did at the famous {{department store}}s in the central city. Like the bourgeois stores, it helped transform consumption from a <b>business</b> <b>transaction</b> into a direct relationship between consumer and sought-after goods. Its advertisements promised the opportunity to participate in the newest, most fashionable consumerism at reasonable cost. The latest technology was featured, such as cinemas and exhibits of inventions such as X-ray machines (that could be used to fit shoes) and the gramophone.|$|E
25|$|After his {{accession}} as the tributary {{ruler of}} Upper Assam under British Government, Purandar Singha began well with his accounts of payments of revenue. But within three year, {{he began to}} make default in his payments. He begged for a considerable reduction {{in the amount of}} revenue, as he explained that the country was badly ravaged by the Burmese invaders, affecting all spheres of life of the people, which includes social and economical. Imposing taxation was also difficult because unlike other parts of India, common people in Assam did not use or very rarely use money for any <b>business</b> <b>transaction</b> or in daily business. Captain Jenkins, the new Commissioner and Political Agent, held an enquiry into Purandar Singh’s administration and found it a hot bed of corruption and misfeasance. His subjects were oppressed and misgoverned and his rule is very distasteful to the bulk of the population. Purandar Singha was himself found guilty of gathering personal fortune rather than concentrating on good governance for his people.|$|E

The court also took into consideration that Tjøntveit was an aviator and had no education in management.

40|$|Title: Are like <b>business</b> <b>transactions</b> {{reflected}} {{similar in}} the financial reports? A study of Swedish construction companies’ appliance of IFRIC 15 Background and Problem: Since 2005 all listed companies within the European Union are obligated to establish their consolidated financial statements according to IFRS. IASB is responsible for issuing these accounting standards. The revenue standards - IAS 11 and IAS 18 express very different methods for revenue recognition and since no clear {{distinction between the two}} seemed to exist - IFRIC 15 was issued to help clarify this matter. Confusion still, however, seems to exist since in regards to construction of cooperative apartments some companies apply IAS 11 and some apply IAS 18. Previous studies observe that this divergence in practice exists, but do not examine the reasons for it. The divergence could be caused by differences in <b>business</b> <b>transactions</b> and it is therefore essential to study the underlying <b>business</b> <b>transactions</b> in detail in order to conclude the reasons for the divergence. Aim of the study: This thesis has examined the underlying <b>business</b> <b>transactions</b> that occur in the process of construction of cooperative apartments. These have then in combination with the companies’ presented arguments been used to help explain the reason for the differences in the applied accounting methods. Methodology: The divergence in practice has been examined by studying the four listed construction companies in Sweden. Interviews have been conducted with respondents at these companies {{as well as with the}} companies’ signing auditors. The interviews have addressed both the <b>business</b> <b>transactions</b> of the underlying construction process and the arguments presented for the used accounting method in regards to IFRIC 15. Analysis and conclusion: This thesis shows that the <b>business</b> <b>transactions</b> in regards to the construction of cooperative apartments are very similar between the studied companies. These similarities are, however, not reflected in the financial reports since both IAS 11 and IAS 18 are applied to reflect the same <b>business</b> <b>transactions</b> even after the issuing of IFRIC 15. Our study indicates that it is rather the room for interpretation in IFRIC 15 than differences in <b>business</b> <b>transactions</b> that causes the divergence in practice...|$|R
