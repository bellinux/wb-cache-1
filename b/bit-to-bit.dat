RZ modulation format is commonly used in long-haul wavelength-division multiplexing transmission systems and the dominating noise source in those systems is amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise, which is signal dependent and requires special study when direct detection is employed. In this paper, based on the <b>bit-to-bit</b> error probability estimation using Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion and decorrelation of noise components, we use the steepest descent method to obtain sequence-to-sequence error probability and achieve the performance evaluation of MLSE receiver with arbitrary input signal pulse shape, optical filtering and electrical filtering taken into consideration. Monte Carlo simulations of a 10 -Gb/s RZ system are demonstrated and agree with the theory well. The results show that the power penalty induced by TM and PMD can be effectively reduced by MLSE receiver, which thus validates its capability to enhance tolerance to both TM and PMD with shared electrical devices.

40|$|International audienceUsing a {{combination}} of synchrotron radiation based magnetic imaging and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy we reveal systematic correlations between the magnetic switching field and the internal nanoscale structure of individual islands in bit patterned media fabricated by Co/Pd-multilayer deposition onto pre-patterned substrates. We find that misaligned grains at the island periphery are a common feature independent of the island switching field, while irregular island shapes and misaligned grains specifically extending {{into the center of}} an island are systematically correlated with a reduced island reversal field. Bit patterned media (BPM) is a leading candidate for extending high-density magnetic recording in hard disk drives beyond 1 Tb/in 2. BPM technology aims at increasing the recording density by pre-defining the bits, i. e., the magnetic volume storing one information unit, as lithographically separated islands. 1 The <b>bit-to-bit</b> variation of the coercive fields is expressed in the switching field distribution (SFD). In order to reliably write a bit, i. e., to reverse the magnetization of an island, the SFD of the island array has to be sufficiently narrow. Currently the controlled reduction of the SFD remains a major challenge in the development of BPM. The SFD is determined by two different contributions. 2 First the magnetic islands are influenced by the stray fields of neighboring islands. In case of perpendicular anisotropy systems that are especially considered for applications in BPM the stray fields from neighbors tend to broaden the SFD. Second the switching field of every single island is influenced by its individual properties. Due to island-to-island variations of these properties, the switching fields show a so-called intrinsic distribution. Variations in island reversal fields are assumed to be induced by variations of the magnitude or direction of the local anisotropy, such as originating from island size, shape, composition, and (crystalline) structure as well as localized strain, corrupted island edges, or misaligned grains. 3 –...|$|E

40|$|In this work, an {{analysis}} of a Type-II Hybrid ARQ Protocol in slotted DS-CDMA packet radio systems is performed, and a MAP receiver for Rayleigh fading DS-CDMA channels is designed. In {{the first part of}} this work, the application of a type-II hybrid ARQ protocol in a slotted direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) packet radio system is investigated. In the physical layer, packet error and packet success probabilities are computed using the improved Gaussian approximation technique, which accounts for the <b>bit-to-bit</b> error dependence within a packet. In the data-link layer, the systems with transmitter buffer length equal to 1 and greater than 1 are analyzed separately. For the first case, two-dimensional Markov chains are employed to model the system dynamic. Based on this model, the performance of the type-II hybrid ARQ protocol is upper and lower bounded by considering, respectively, a superior scheme and an inferior scheme. Steady state throughput and delay performances of the two bounding schemes are obtained. For the second case, Equilibrium Point Analysis (EPA) technique is employed to approximately compute the system performance including throughput and delay, and to analyze stability. Simulations are also performed to check the accuracy of the EPA technique. In the second part of this work, a decision-feedback MAP receiver is proposed for time-selective fading CDMA channels. The receiver consists of a sequence-matched filter and a MAP demodulator. Outputs samples (more than one per symbol) from the matched filter are fed into the MAP demodulator. The MAP demodulator exploits the channel memory by delaying the decision and using a sequence of observations. This receiver also rejects MAI and estimates channel fading coefficients implicitly to give good demodulation decisions. Moreover, computer simulations are performed to evaluate the BER performance of the receiver under various channel conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the current progress in thin bismuth layer-structured ferroelectric films (BLSFs) including SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 and (Bi,La) (4) Ti 3 O 12, particularly those developed {{in the last ten}} years. BLSF thin films can be applied to ferroelectric random access memories because of their durable fatigue-free properties and lead-free composition. We will briefly introduce epitaxial thin films grown on a variety of substrates. Because of the difficulty in growing single crystals of sufficient size to characterize the ferroelectric behavior in specific crystal growth directions, we will characterize epitaxially grown thin films to obtain basic information about the anisotropic switching behavior, which is important for evaluating the performance of emerging materials. We will then discuss the fiber-textured growth on the (111) Pt-covered Si substrates of SrBi 2 Ta 2 O 9 and Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 thin films. Because we expect that the spread crystal orientation will affect the <b>bit-to-bit</b> errors, we believe that the fiber-textured growth and the characterization technique for the deposited film orientation are interesting from a practical standpoint. Another specific challenge of thin film growth is the growth of a-axis-(polar axis) -oriented films. a-/b-axis-oriented films are characterized both crystallographically and by electric hysteresis loop. The hysteresis performance was in accordance with the volume fraction of the a/b domains; however, no evidence for 90 degrees switching of the b domain by an external electric field was obtained. The control of film orientation also allows systematic studies on the effects of a structural modification and relation between spontaneous polarization and Curie temperature, examples of which are given in this paper. After a short description of the piezoelectric properties, we will conclude with a summary and the future prospects of BLSF thin films for research and applications.

40|$|In recent years, {{random access}} {{protocols}} have received considerable attention as useful multiple access techniques for systems with high peak to average traffic ratios (bursty traffic). In most conventional random access protocols, when a single packet is transmitted {{in a given}} time period, it is received correctly, while if two or more transmissions occur, then all the packets are destroyed. If direct sequence {{code division multiple access}} (DS-CDMA) is used, this need not to be the case, because the DS-CDMA system allows many packets to coexist in a given slot. Thus packets are correctly received with certain probability which depends on the simultaneous number of packets in the slot. This suggests the possibility of using the DS-CDMA in a random access mode of operation. In addition, {{it is well known that}} CDMA transmission can provide other benefits, such as greater immunity to interference and interception; and its inherent resistance to multipath fading. In this thesis we propose to use the DS-CDMA in a random access mode of operation for the mobile satellite data packet networks. First, we analyze the DS-CDMA over a multipath fading channel and develop new and accurate approximations of the probability of bit error and probability of packet success. In these approximations an improved Gaussian process is used to model the multiple access interference (MAI) and the <b>bit-to-bit</b> dependence caused by the MAI and fading is taken into account. These approximations are used to investigate the performance of the DS-CDMA packet networks. The second stage of our work is to propose a new DS-CDMA system referred to as partial DS-CDMA in which a limited number of spread spectrum codes is required. It is well known that a major problem in the design of a DS-CDMA packet networks is the required large number of spreading codes when the network is aimed to serve a large population of users. The proposed partial DS-CDMA copes with this problem and suggests the use of only a limited number of spreading codes at the price of relatively small degradation on the performance. The last stage of this work is to propose a collision resolution algorithm (CRA) as random access protocol to be used in conjunction with the proposed partial DS-CDMA system. The combined protocol is analyzed under Poisson traffic and the delay-throughput performance is analyzed for different system parameters and under different fading conditions. By combining the partial DS-CDMA with the proposed CRA we obtain a new protocol which is stable, implementable and has many advantages as we prove throughout the thesis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceModel {{exchange}} coupled composite media, namely ͓Co/ Pd͔ 5 / Pd͑(t) / ͓Co/ Ni͔ 3 / Co multilayers, deposited onto prepatterned substrates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in bit patterned recording. Optimizing {{the thickness of the}} Pd interlayer allows decreasing the switching field ͑Hc and switching field distribution SFD ͒while maintaining thermal stability. The dependence of the remanent coercivity on the external field angle indicates that the gain in H C and SFD originates from the incoherent magnetization reversal introduced by slightly decoupling the hard and soft multilayer stacks. This tendency is confirmed by further reductions in H C and SFD, when inserting another Pd interlayer within the hard ͓Co/ Pd͔ 5 stack. Bit patterned recording ͑BPR͒ is a leading candidate to extend the densities in magnetic data storage beyond those achievable by conventional continuous perpendicular magnetic recording ͑PMR͒ based on granular media. BPR involves a lithographically patterned media, where each magnetic island corresponds to a single bit. At remanence, each discrete island maintains a single domain state with its uniform magnetization aligned to a well defined uni-axial aniso-tropy axis ͑commonly perpendicular to the disk͒. The thermal stability of a BPR magnetic bit is given in the macrospin approximation by the product K u V, where K u is the magnetic anisotropy energy density and V is the volume of one island. The bits are considered thermally stable for KuV = 60 k B T, where k B is the Boltzman constant and T is the temperature. Increasing the areal density implies decreasing V. However, any loss in V needs to be compensated for by an increase in K u in order to maintain a proper thermal stability. But the maximum anisotropy is limited by the maximum field that the write head can provide in a hard disk drive. Therefore, improving both thermal stability and writability of bit pat-terned media ͑BPM͒ is an important issue for reaching areal densities higher than 1 Tb/ in 2. Another critical issue for implementing BPM is that the switching field distribution ͑SFD͒, i. e., the <b>bit-to-bit</b> variation in coercive field needs to be narrow enough to secure exact addressability of individual predefined bits without overwrit-ing adjacent bits. The SFD has the two following main components: the dipolar interactions between neighboring islands within the array and the so-called intrinsic SFD of each individual island. 1, 2 Depending on the head field gradient, the head-media spacing and the write-synchronization tolerances, a SFD value lower than 1 kOe is required for areal density beyond 1 Tb/ in 2, considering a media with a static coercive field of around 5 to 7 kOe ͑Ref. 3 ͒. This value is about two times lower than the SFD measured in current PMR media. While in a single spin approximation, writability, and thermal stability are correlated via K u, it has been recently demonstrated that an improved PMR writability to thermal stability ratio can be achieved by changing the magnetization reversal mechanism. For instance, incoherent reversal is obtained in exchange-spring or exchange coupled composite ͑ECC͒ structures. 4, 5 These heterogeneous systems consist of at least two coupled layers with different anisotropies. During the reversal process, the soft layer ͑SL͒ moment starts reversing first and forces the hard layer ͑HL͒ moment to follow via the interlayer exchange coupling. The torque or the spring produced by the SL moment allows decreasing the switching field of the HL stack, while conserving thermal stability. A large number of theoretical calculations 6 and experimental studies have been reported on PMR media...|$|E
40|$|Read/Write Radio Frequency Identification (R/W RFID) {{chips are}} {{commonly}} used to tag stock in retail shops. The security risk of RFID has been well established in the literature and hence there is potential for fraudulent use of RFID networks in commercial settings. This study proposes the identification of all possible data storage locations in a RFID system, a method for forensic extraction of the data, preservation, analysis and best practice recommendations for digital forensic investigators working on RFID systems. The research shows {{that it is possible}} to identify theft from a RFID business system (RIFD BS) after a tag poisoning attack. In order to conduct the proposed research, a trial system was set up in the lab to simulate a commercial retail situation where theft occurred. The normal operation of the trial system was documented as the trusted operation of a stable RFID retail system. The simulation context was the retail environment of clothing and electronic goods, as in such environments Stock Items (SI) could vary in price from a few dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. Hence, the stabilized BS was stressed by using a malicious poisoning attack to change the value of the stock item from the backend SQL Server. Then the entities of BS such as SI, point of sale (POS), business information system (BIS) were investigated in order to locate the potential evidence for the theft of the SI. The methodology used in a simulated environment was based on descriptive methods in which the case scenario of the replicated SQL poisoning attack through a R/W RFID Tag was initiated. To investigate the presence of digital evidence after the theft of a SI, a customized RFID middleware and ReaderLogExtraction tool (to acquire <b>bit-to-bit</b> evidence from RFID reader’s memory) were developed based on Software Development Kit (SDK) of the RFID reader’s manufacturing company. Live forensic investigation was performed by using customized incident response toolkits (Helix_RFID_IR and dcfldd toolkits) and a hardware write-blocker. The descriptive methodology allowed the elaboration of precise details relevant to the research question. The purpose of the main research question was to perform the complete and accurate forensic examination of a compromised RFID stock management system in the retail sector. As a result, the digital forensic investigation (DFI) procedures such as acquisition, extraction, preservation and analysis of potential evidence data were carried out in a forensically sound manner. Hence, such DFI procedures were the important phases of this descriptive research. During the forensic investigation, the traces of evidence after the poisoning attack were able to be identified, acquired, preserved, analysed and presented according to DFI principles and guidelines. The significant findings were found in each entity of the simulated RFID BS. For instance, changes to the original values of SIs were found in the backend database and evidence of the malicious poisoning code was found in the transaction log of the backend server. Moreover the evidential traces of the fake tag ID, date and timestamp were also found in the memories of RFID reader and POS host station. In the simulated research experiment, the theft of a SI through an orchestrated test scenario of hardware, software and social engineering illustrates the potential vulnerability of RFID based retail systems. To conclude, the research conducted confirms that the DFI procedures used were able to obtain viable digital evidence from a compromised RFID stock management system in the retail sector. The learning from conducting this research provided not only additional knowledge in DFI of RFID BS, but also best practices for digital forensic researchers and practitioners. Consequently, providing assurance of the DFI process to present trustworthy digital evidence could prove the theft of stock items in a RFID retail system...|$|E
