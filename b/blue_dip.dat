Get a {{shilling}} cake of Prussian <b>blue.</b> <b>Dip</b> {{the end of}} it {{in water}} so as to take up a drop, and rub it in a white saucer till you cannot rub much more, and the color gets dark, thick, and oily-looking. Put two teaspoonfuls of water to the color you have rubbed down, and mix it well up with a camel's-hair brush about three quarters of an inch long.|$|E
50|$|Harley Quinn sports two new outfits {{following}} {{the events of}} DC Rebirth. She wears tight, blue and red shorts, ripped white tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos and her hair color is blonde hair with <b>blue</b> <b>dip</b> dye {{on the left side}} and pink dip dye on the right.|$|E
50|$|Following 2016's DC Rebirth, Harley Quinn debuts a {{new look}} in the third volume of her eponymous series, {{as well as the}} fifth volume of Suicide Squad. Her hair color is now blonde with <b>blue</b> <b>dip</b> dye on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit {{consists}} of tight, blue and red shorts, ripped tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, fishnet stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like Margot Robbie's depiction of the character in the 2016 Suicide Squad film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots.|$|E

50|$|A {{serving of}} wings is {{typically}} served with small sticks of celery, sometimes baby carrots, and <b>blue</b> cheese <b>dipping</b> {{sauce on the}} side. Ranch dressing {{can be used as}} a substitute for blue cheese; it is nonetheless considered a faux pas to do so in western New York.|$|R
50|$|Due to a {{color change}} from blue to red at pH 3.0-5.2, Congo red {{can be used}} as a pH indicator. Since this color change is an {{approximate}} inverse of that of litmus, it can be used with litmus paper in a simple parlor trick: add a drop or two of Congo red to both an acid solution and a base solution. Dipping red litmus paper in the red solution will turn it <b>blue,</b> while <b>dipping</b> <b>blue</b> litmus paper in the blue solution will turn it red. This property gives Congo red a metachromatic property as a dye, both in strongly acidic solutions and with strongly acidophilic tissue.|$|R
50|$|The bar's {{association}} with Buffalo wings originates in the 1960s. Then-owner Teressa Bellissimo {{is credited with}} the creation of the dish when she deep-fried some wings and covered them in Frank's RedHot hot sauce and butter. Chicken wings were previously used for soup or thrown away. She served them with <b>blue</b> cheese <b>dip</b> as hors d'oeuvres at the bar. They were initially offered for free. Anchor Bar sauces are sold in the United States at Tops Friendly Markets, and in Canada at Sobey's and Metro stores.|$|R
60|$|In {{the full}} noon of a {{cloudless}} day, beneath them a tumultuous sea of pines surged, heaved, rode in giant crests, stretched and lost {{itself in the}} ghostly, snow-peaked horizon. The thronging woods choked every defile, swept every crest, filled every valley with its dark-green tilting spears, and left only Table Mountain sunlit and bare. Here and there were profound olive depths, over which the gray hawk hung lazily, and into which <b>blue</b> jays <b>dipped.</b> A faint, dull yellowish streak marked an occasional watercourse; a deeper reddish ribbon, the mountain road and its overhanging murky cloud of dust.|$|R
50|$|Welch {{made his}} major league debut in , winning 34 {{games for the}} Troy Trojans. On July 6, 1880, he pitched a one-hitter against the Cleveland <b>Blues.</b> Welch's totals <b>dipped</b> during the {{following}} two seasons, {{when he began to}} split starts with Tim Keefe, who also went on to win more than 300 games. The duo would only enjoy moderate success over the course of three seasons with the Trojans, a team that never finished higher than fourth in the National League during its four-season run.|$|R
6000|$|Johnny sat breathless, wondering, expectant, but not {{daring to}} move. The men might {{come out at}} any moment; he had seen {{enough to know that}} their {{enterprise}} as well as their cave was a secret, and that the desperado would subject any witness to it, however innocent or unwilling, to horrible penalties. The time crept slowly by,--he heard every rap of a woodpecker in a distant tree; a <b>blue</b> jay <b>dipped</b> and lighted on a branch within his reach, but he dared not extend his hand; his legs were infested by ants; he even fancied he heard the dry, hollow rattle of a rattlesnake not a yard from him. And then the entrance of the cave was darkened, and the two men reappeared. Johnny stared. He would have rubbed his eyes if he had dared. They were not the same men! Did the cave contain others who had been all the while shut up in its dark recesses? Was there a band? Would they all swarm out upon him? Should he run for his life? ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1922, {{the colour}} of the RAAF winter uniform was {{determined}} by Williams {{on a visit to}} the Geelong Wool Mill. [...] He asked for one dye dip fewer than the RAN <b>blue</b> (three indigo <b>dips</b> rather than four). There was a change to a lighter blue when an all-seasons uniform was introduced in the 1970s. The original colour and style were re-adopted around 2005. Slip-on rank epaulettes, known as [...] "Soft Rank Insignia" [...] (SRI), displaying the word [...] "AUSTRALIA" [...] are worn on the shoulders of the service dress uniform. When not in the service dress or [...] "ceremonial" [...] uniform, RAAF personnel wear the Auscam DPCU as a working dress. Commencing in mid-2014 DPCU began to be replaced, only in the non-deployed environment, with the General Purpose Uniform (GPU) which is a blue version of the Australian Multicam Pattern.|$|R
5000|$|A Buffalo wing, in {{the cuisine}} of the United States, is an unbreaded chicken wing section (flat or drumette) that is {{generally}} deep-fried then coated in a sauce {{consisting of a}} vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and melted butter prior to serving. The Buffalo wing was invented in 1964 at Anchor Bar in Buffalo, New York by Teressa Bellissimo. They are generally served hot, along with celery sticks and/or carrot sticks with <b>blue</b> cheese for <b>dipping.</b> [...] Buffalo wings have gained in popularity in the United States and abroad through the years {{with a number of}} North American restaurant chains featuring them as a main menu item. Currently, the appellation [...] "Buffalo" [...] is also now commonly applied to foods other than wings. Some of these include chicken fingers, chicken fries, chicken nuggets, popcorn chicken, shrimp, and pizza along with a host of other items that are seasoned with the Buffalo-style sauce or a Buffalo flavor seasoning.|$|R
40|$|Mastitis {{research}} has shown that 40 - 50 % of intramammary infections (IMI) are contracted during the dry or non-lactating period with the greatest percentages of these occurring during the first and last two weeks of the dry period. The ability to develop and apply external persistent barrier teat dip products (like a liquid bandage) that can persist for these 1 week periods could decrease IMI, thus improving animal health and performance, and product quality and safety. The specific aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate teat dip characteristics (drip amounts and times, drying times, effects on teat health) and adherence times of two novel fast drying prototype dry cow barrier teat dip products compared to a commercial product. Dipping with the new fast drying dips (FG and FP) compared to T-Hexx <b>Blue</b> (commercial <b>dip</b> Hydromer, Inc.) resulted in similar excellent teat end and skin health, reduced drip amounts, dripping times, and drying times (~ 50 %) (FG slightly better than FP); but both fast drying dips showed decreased persistency in teat coverage with FG being lowest persistency and FP intermediate between FG and Blue. Some other important observations to consider is that drying times were significant less when dip was applied to teats compared to test tubes with Blue being ~ 2 - 4 min. Also, when animals bumped or kicked while dipping, significantly more dip is wasted than what drips off teats. These 2 points, in conjunction with the above points on persistency, should be highly considered when deciding to alter or put new dips into the marketplace...|$|R
60|$|And {{thus the}} {{wonderful}} Blue Grotto is suggested to me. It is {{situated on the}} Island of Capri, twenty-two miles from Naples. We chartered a little steamer and went out there. Of course, the police boarded us and put us through a health examination, and inquired into our politics, before they would let us land. The airs these little insect Governments put on are in the last degree ridiculous. They even put a policeman on board of our boat {{to keep an eye}} on us as long as we were in the Capri dominions. They thought we wanted to steal the grotto, I suppose. It was worth stealing. The entrance to the cave is four feet high and four feet wide, and is in the face of a lofty perpendicular cliff--the sea-wall. You enter in small boats--and a tight squeeze it is, too. You can not go in at all when the tide is up. Once within, you find yourself in an arched cavern about one hundred and sixty feet long, one hundred and twenty wide, and about seventy high. How deep it is no man knows. It goes down to the bottom of the ocean. The waters of this placid subterranean lake are the brightest, loveliest blue that can be imagined. They are as transparent as plate glass, and their coloring would shame the richest sky that ever bent over Italy. No tint could be more ravishing, no lustre more superb. Throw a stone into the water, and the myriad of tiny bubbles that are created flash out a brilliant glare like <b>blue</b> theatrical fires. <b>Dip</b> an oar, and its blade turns to splendid frosted silver, tinted with blue. Let a man jump in, and instantly he is cased in an armor more gorgeous than ever kingly Crusader wore.|$|R
