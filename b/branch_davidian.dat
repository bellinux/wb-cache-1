5|$|The chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic {{training}} for the U.S. Army. Michael Fortier, McVeigh's accomplice, was his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge {{as well as the}} Waco siege—a 1993 51-day standoff between the FBI and <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> members which began with a botched ATF attempt to execute a search warrant leading to a fire fight (it is unknown whether ATF agents or Branch Davidians fired the first shot) and ended with the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and then again after its conclusion. McVeigh later decided to bomb a federal building {{as a response to the}} raids.|$|E
5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives {{parked in front of the}} building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> compound in Waco, Texas.|$|E

50|$|After a {{jury trial}} lasting nearly two months, the jury acquitted four of the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> on all charges. Additionally, the jury acquitted all of the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> on the murder-related charges, but convicted five of them on lesser charges, {{including}} aiding and abetting the voluntary manslaughter of federal agents. Eight <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> were convicted on firearms charges.|$|R
50|$|In all, 4 ATF {{agents were}} killed, 16 were wounded, 6 <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> {{were killed in}} the initial raid on February 28 and 76 more {{were killed in the}} final siege on April 19. The events at Waco spurred {{criminal}} prosecution and civil litigation. A federal grand jury indicted 12 of the surviving <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> charging them with aiding and abetting in murder of federal officers, and unlawful possession and use of various firearms. Eight <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> were convicted on firearms charges, 5 convicted of voluntary manslaughter, and four were acquitted of all charges. As of July 2007, all <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> had been released from prison.|$|R
50|$|The {{events at}} Waco spurred both {{criminal}} prosecution and civil litigation. On August 3, 1993, {{a federal grand}} jury returned a superseding ten-count indictment against 12 of the surviving <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians.</b> The grand jury charged, among other things, that the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> had conspired to, and aided and abetted in, murder of federal officers, and had unlawfully possessed and used various firearms. The government dismissed the charges against one of the 12 <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> pursuant to a plea bargain.|$|R

While the event had taken place before he became Director, a highly controversial investigation ensued, including allegations of a cover-up by the FBI, and tensions developed between Freeh and Janet Reno, then-Attorney General. Reno, who had herself been blamed for mishandling of the confrontation and investigation, sent United States Marshals to FBI headquarters to seize Waco-related evidence.|$|E
500|$|McVeigh {{believed}} that the bomb attack had {{a positive impact on}} government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> compound. McVeigh stated, [...] "Once you bloody the bully's nose, and he knows he's going to be punched again, he's not coming back around." ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the integration of}} the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> into the Waco, Texas community during the years immediately preceding the BATF siege of 1993. An examination of media and biographical sources indicates that the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> were better integrated in the community than is commonly suggested. Survivor accounts describe the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> working and relaxing in Waco, rather than hiding in their compound. A survey of local newspaper coverage reveals that the press in Waco had a positive view of Koresh and the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> in the late 1980 s. In particular, coverage of a 1988 trial involving David Koresh and his followers in the Waco Tribune Herald was markedly more positive than the later and more famous coverage of the group in 1993...|$|R

(McVeigh himself argued that [...] "imminent" [...] did not necessarily mean [...] "immediate.") They would have argued that his bombing of the Murrah building was a justifiable response to what McVeigh believed were the crimes of the U.S. government at Waco, Texas, where the 51-day siege of the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> complex resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians.

2500|$|McVeigh {{later said}} he {{considered}} [...] "a campaign of individual assassination," [...] with [...] "eligible" [...] targets including Attorney-General Janet Reno, Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Federal District Court, {{who handled the}} <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> trial, and Lon Horiuchi, {{a member of the}} FBI hostage-rescue team who shot and killed Vicki Weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992. He said he wanted Reno to accept [...] "full responsibility in deed, not just words." [...] Such an assassination seemed too difficult, and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers, it was necessary to strike against them at their command centers. According to McVeigh's authorized biography, he ultimately decided that he would make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building. After the bombing, he was ambivalent about his act; as he expressed in letters to his hometown newspaper, he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead.|$|E

5000|$|Because the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> {{were heavily}} armed, the FBI's arms {{included}} [...]50 caliber (12.7 mm) rifles and armored Combat Engineering Vehicles (CEV).

CEVs used explosives to puncture holes in the walls of buildings of the compound so they could pump in CS gas ("tear gas") and try to flush out the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> without harming them. The stated plan called for increasing amounts of gas to be pumped in over two days to increase pressure. Officially, no armed assault was to be made, and loudspeakers were used to tell the <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> {{that there would be}} no armed assault and to ask them not to fire on the vehicles. FBI agents had been permitted to return any incoming fire, but no shots were fired by federal agents on April 19. When several <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> opened fire, the FBI's response was to increase the amount of gas being used.|$|R
