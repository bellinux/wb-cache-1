40|$|International audienceRaman {{spectroscopy}} of bromine in {{the liquid}} phase and in water illustrates uncommon principles and yields insights regarding hydration. In liquid Br 2, resonant excitation over the B(3 Π 0 u +) ← X(1 Σg +) valence transition at 532 nm produces a weak resonant Raman (RR) progression {{accompanied by a}} five-fold stronger non-resonant (NR) scattering. The latter is assigned to pre-resonance with the C-state, which in turn must be strongly mixed with inter-molecular charge transfer states. Despite the electronic resonance, RR of Br 2 in water is quenched. At 532 nm, the homogeneously broadened fundamental is observed, as in the NR case at 785 nm. The implications of the quenching of RR scattering are analyzed in a simple, semi-quantitative model, {{to conclude that the}} inertial evolution of the Raman packet in aqueous Br 2 occurs along multiple equivalent water-Br 2 coordinates.

40|$|The SRT Group is {{developing}} a process that produces hydrogen from the electrolysis of hydrobromic acid. Compared to conventional water electrolysis, HBr electrolysis requires about 25 % less electricity per unit of hydrogen produced. The capital and O and M costs are higher though, because of equipment that is required to regenerate HBr from the bromine formed in the electrolyzer (as a comparison a water electrolyzer discards the oxygen product and imports new water feedstock). Exhibit 1 presents summary statistics for the HBr and water electrolysis systems. All else equal, the HBr electrolysis process will be favorable to water electrolysis in situations where electricity is more expensive. A cost model is developed for water and HBr electrolysis systems. It indicates that HBr electrolysis is favored when {{the average cost of}} electricity exceeds 5. 9 cents/kWh, at which price the cost of hydrogen 2. 8 $/kg (20 $/MMBtu).

Specifically this method include the production and application of a mechanism of chemical speciation of elements of periodic table that due to their different form have different toxicity, bioavailability and effect on living organisms.

The above procedure is accomplished {{by the use of}} anion selective membrane, an analytical tool which allows the selective bound of the desirable element on a membrane polymer matrix. This polymer structure is immobilized on a quartz that have been enriched with certain chemical reagents which provide the membrane with anionic activity and selectivity towards their ability to complex several elements. Typical examples that are examined at the present thesis are the chemical speciation of toxic hexavalent chromium from the trivalent chromium and the discrimination of toxic bromates ions from the <b>bromines</b> in a <b>water</b> solution.
