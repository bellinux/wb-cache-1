The Hitchin integrals of motion depend on the W-structures of the <b>basic</b> <b>curve.</b> The parameters of the W-structures {{play the role of}} times. In particular, the quadratic integrals dependent on the complex structure (W_ 2 -structure) of the <b>basic</b> <b>curve</b> and times are coordinate on the Teichmuller space. The corresponding flows are the monodromy preserving equations such as the Schlesinger equations, the Painleve VI equation and their generalizations. The equations corresponding to the highest integrals are monodromy preserving conditions with respect to changing of the W_k-structures (k> 2). They are derived by the symplectic reduction from the gauge field theory on the <b>basic</b> <b>curve</b> interacting with W_k-gravity.

However, {{controlling the}} macroscopic feature is difficult using conventional microscopic shape- information such as dimension and curvature. Therefore, in curve design, a design-support system that uses macroscopic shape- information to represent the macroscopic feature is desired. In the our past study, the information entropy calculated by the discrete curvature function as Markov Process was found to represent the complexity of <b>basic</b> <b>curved</b> profiles described by three-dimensional Bézier curve. Besides, it was showed {{the effectiveness of the}} information entropy as a shape-generation index.

Firstly, the total absolute curvature was applied to the <b>basic</b> <b>curved</b> profiles. The relationship between the total absolute curvature and complexity was analyzed. As a result, the total absolute curvature was found to represent the complexity as well as the information entropy.

40|$|Abstract- The use of {{empirical}} models {{is an integral}} part of the design and analysis of civil and environmental engineering systems. One of the most commonly used methods for parameter estimation is linear regression. This technique is also applied to nonlinear models with two unknown parameters when the equation can be linearized through transformation. Equations with more than two unknown parameters can be solved using matrices that expand on the basic form of the solution for linear equations. The use of spreadsheets in engineering education and research is a common tool used for <b>basic</b> <b>curve</b> fitting (two unknown parameters) as well as smaller matrix solutions. This paper presents a different approach for the use of spreadsheets, namely, parameter estimation using optimization. Spreadsheet optimization is a practical platform that easily determines the parameters of equations. The number of unknown variables is not constrained. In addition, the analysis can be expanded to include minimizing a range of nonlinear error functions, consequently allowing for a broader mathematical approach to parameter estimation.

40|$|A method using curved vortex {{elements}} {{was developed}} for helicopter rotor free wake calculations. The <b>Basic</b> <b>Curve</b> Vortex Element (BCVE) {{is derived from the}} approximate Biot-Savart integration for a parabolic arc filament. When used in conjunction with a scheme to fit the elements along a vortex filament contour, this method has a significant advantage in overall accuracy and efficiency when compared to the traditional straight-line element approach. A theoretical and numerical analysis shows that free wake flows involving close interactions between filaments should utilize curved vortex elements in order to guarantee a consistent level of accuracy. The curved element method was implemented into a forward flight free wake analysis, featuring an adaptive far wake model that utilizes free wake information to extend the vortex filaments beyond the free wake regions. The curved vortex element free wake, coupled with this far wake model, exhibited rapid convergence, even in regions where the free wake and far wake turns are interlaced. Sample calculations are presented for tip vortex motion at various advance ratios for single and multiple blade rotors. Cross-flow plots reveal that the overall downstream wake flow resembles a trailing vortex pair. A preliminary assessment shows that the rotor downwash field is insensitive to element size, even for relatively large curved elements...|$|E
