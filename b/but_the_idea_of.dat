Los Angeles Times also reported that rights to a book were bought. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio had started working on a script in 2007, but they were interrupted by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, and only resumed in mid-2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} botanical gardens is {{closely linked to}} the history of botany itself. The botanical gardens of the 16th and 17th centuries were {{medicinal}} gardens, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of the beautiful, strange, new and sometimes economically important plant trophies being returned from the European colonies and other distant lands. Later, in the 18th century, they became more educational in function, demonstrating the latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in the associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures. Then, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating many aspects of both horticulture and botany.|$|E

5|$|Jason Voorhees {{went from}} {{deceased}} child to full-grown man for Friday the 13th Part 2, and Warrington Gillette {{was hired to}} play the role. Gillette auditioned {{for the role of}} Paul; that role eventually went to John Furey. Under the belief that he had attended the Hollywood Stuntman's School, Gillette was offered the role of Jason Voorhees. Initially Gillette was unsure about the character, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> starring in his first film grew on Gillette, and he also thought the role was amusing. It became apparent Gillette could not perform the necessary stunts, so the stunt coordinator Cliff Cudney brought in Steve Daskawisz. Daskawisz filmed all of the scenes except the opening sequence and the unmasking shot at the end; Gillette returned for the unmasking scenes. Gillette received credit for playing Jason, while Daskawisz was given credit as the stunt double. When Part 3 was released the following year, Daskawisz was credited as Jason for the reused footage from the climax of the film. Initially, Daskawisz was asked to return to the role for Part 3, but it would have required him to pay for his own transportation and housing during filming. Having secured a part on Guiding Light, Daskawisz declined.|$|E
5|$|Simon de Montfort {{had seized}} power in England {{following}} his victory over Henry III at the Battle of Lewes during the Second Barons' War, but {{his grip on}} the country was under threat. In an attempt to gather more support he summoned representatives from not only the barons and the knights of the shires, as had occurred in previous parliaments, but also burgesses from the major towns. The resulting parliament in London discussed radical reforms and temporarily stabilised Montfort's political situation. Montfort was killed at the Battle of Evesham later that year, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> inviting both knights and burgesses to parliaments became more popular under the reign of Henry's son Edward I. By the 14th century this had become the norm, with the gathering becoming known as the House of Commons. This parliament is sometimes referred to as the first English parliament and Montfort himself is often termed the founder of the Commons.|$|E

As part of the Eugene Centennial Celebration in 1959, a section of Broadway from Oak Street to Charnelton Street was closed to motor traffic, and pedestrians were delighted.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{source of}} abstract groups is given by {{the construction of a}} factor group, or quotient group, G/H, of a group G by a normal subgroup H. Class groups of algebraic number fields were among the earliest examples of factor groups, of much interest in number theory.

Design changes were not as few as the public perceived, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an unchanging model was kept intact.

25|$|The {{city had}} a {{deepwater}} port. In the early 19th century, many business leaders in Maryland were looking inland, toward the western frontier, {{for economic growth}} potential. The challenge was to devise a reliable means to transport goods and people. The National Road and private turnpikes were being completed throughout the state, but additional routes and capacity were needed. Following {{the success of the}} Erie Canal (constructed 1817–25) and similar canals in the northeastern states, leaders in Maryland were also developing plans for canals. After several failed canal projects in the Washington, D.C. area, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C) began construction there in 1828. The Baltimore business community viewed this project as a competitive threat. The geography of the Baltimore area made building a similar canal to the west impractical, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> constructing railroads was beginning to gather support in the 1820s.|$|E

25|$|During {{the tenure}} of mayor Dragan Đilas (2008–13), the idea of {{expanding}} the zoo to Donji Grad, which it occupied prior to the World War II, resurfaced, but the experts were against it. The urban plan for the fortress from 1965 already projected the complete relocation of the zoo outside of the fortress, {{on some of the}} suburban locations, which in later plans included Veliko Blato, Stepin Lug or Jelezovac. The expansion of the zoo would cut the pedestrian communication between the Danube's and Sava's parts of the fortress, which was already cut in 1949 but was restored in 2009 with the reconstruction and opening of the Sava Gate. Also, it would prevent the exploration of Donji Grad, which is still largely unexplored and leave the Gate of Charles VI, a masterpiece of Balthasar Neumann, within the zoo itself. As of 2017, the zoo was not relocated <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> expansion was dropped, too.|$|E
25|$|On 29 July 1940, {{manufacturers}} Albright & Wilson of Oldbury {{demonstrated to}} the RAF how their white phosphorus {{could be used}} to ignite incendiary bombs. The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned, resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a self-igniting petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an A.W. bomb, it was officially named the No. 76 Grenade, but more commonly known as the SIP (Self-Igniting Phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was white phosphorus, benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve, making the contents slightly sticky, and the mixture would separate into two layers– this was intentional, and the grenade should not be shaken to mix the layers, as this would only delay ignition. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite, liberating choking fumes of phosphorus pentoxide and sulfur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat. Strict instructions were issued to store the grenades safely, preferably underwater and certainly never in a house. Mainly issued to the Home Guard as an anti-tank weapon, it was produced in vast numbers; by August 1941 well over 6,000,000 had been manufactured.|$|E
