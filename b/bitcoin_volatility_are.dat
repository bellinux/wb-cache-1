40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential of}} Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency, to pose competition to fiat currencies. To accomplish that, Bitcoin would have to become efficient as a store of value. Thus far, high volatility makes it inferior in that respect. We analyze the dynamics and drivers of <b>Bitcoin</b> <b>volatility</b> using GARCH and HAR models. Moreover, we test for presence of asymmetries displayed by stock, commodity and currency markets. That way we can conclude, whether <b>volatility</b> of <b>Bitcoin</b> behaves similarly to currencies, commodities or stocks. Lastly we reveal interconnections between these markets and market for Bitcoin. We find significant evidence for the leverage effect documented for stock market. Furthermore, the effect of trading volume, documented for currency markets, displays an opposite sign in our research. Results of spillover estimation suggest Bitcoin is the most interconnected with commodity market. Thus, we conclude Bitcoin does not behave similarly to currencies in terms of volatility; hence {{is not a good}} candidate to substitute them.

40|$|Created in 2009, {{the digital}} {{currency}} of bitcoin {{is a relatively}} new phenomenon. During this short period of time, it has however displayed a strong development of both price and trade volume. This has led to increased media attention, but also regulators and researchers have developed an interest. At this moment, the amount of available research is however limited. With a focus on the price <b>volatility</b> of <b>bitcoin</b> and an aim of finding drivers of this <b>volatility,</b> this study <b>is</b> taking a unique position. The research has its basis in the philosophical position of positivism and objectivism. This has shaped the research question as well as the construction of the study. The result is a describing and explaining research with a deductive research approach, a quantitative research method and an archival research strategy. This has in turn stimulated an extensive literature review and information search. Areas of discussion are microstructure theory, the efficient market hypothesis, behavioural finance and informational structures. Due to the limited amount of previous bitcoin research within the area of price volatility, the study has drawn extensively on research performed on more classical assets such as stocks. Nevertheless, when available, bitcoin research {{has been used as a}} foundation/reference and an inspiration. Reviews of academic literature and economic theories, as well as public news helped to identify the variables for the empirical study. These variables are; information demand, trade volume, world market index, trend and six specified events, occurring during the chosen sample period and included in the study as dummy variables. The variables are all analysed and included in a GARCH (1, 1) model, modified following a similar research by Vlastakis & Markellos (2012) on stocks. This GARCH (1, 1) model is then fitted to the <b>bitcoin</b> <b>volatility</b> registered for the sample period and is able thereby able to generate data of if and how the variables affect the <b>bitcoin</b> <b>volatility.</b> The test result suggests that five of the ten variables are significant on a 5 %-level. More specifically it suggests that information demand is a significant variable with a positive influence on the <b>bitcoin</b> <b>volatility,</b> something that corresponds to the literature on information demand and price volatility. This also relates to the events found significant, as they generated bitcoin related information. The significant events of the Cypriot crisis and the failure of the bitcoin exchange MtGox are thus specific examples of how information affects price volatility. Another significant variable is trade volume, which also displays a positive influence on the volatility. The last significant variable turned out to be a constructed positive trend, suggesting that increasing acceptance of <b>bitcoin</b> decreases its <b>volatility...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} the new concept of implied {{integrated}} volatility. When {{the stock price}} <b>volatility</b> <b>is</b> stochastic, the integrated vo-latility is the time-average of the stock price variance.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} time-series of higher-order volatilities for the S&P 500 and EURUSD. We use a 3 -volatility model {{which accounts}} for non-normal skewness and kurtosis. The volatilities control the level, slope and curvature of the Black-Scholes implied volatility smile; accordingly we term them "base", "skew" and "smile" volatility. We define instantaneous skewness and kurtosis as simple ratios of the volatilities, and show that when these metrics are held constant, the model is relative sticky-delta. For the S&P 500 in 2008, skew and smile <b>volatility</b> <b>are</b> highly correlated with base volatility. Instantaneous skewness and kurtosis are remarkably stable, including over the market dislocation {{of the last four}} months of the year. Daily changes in all three <b>volatilities</b> <b>are</b> correlated with daily returns.

40|$|This article {{describes}} volatility {{evolution of a}} stochastic process. Evolution of <b>volatility</b> <b>is</b> affected by 'North-East Volatility Wind Effect' described in previous papers. 'North-East <b>Volatility</b> Wind Effect' <b>is</b> describing behavior of stock market indices. An exposure of this allows to predict stock indices volatility bursts. Analysis of 'North-East <b>Volatility</b> Wind Effect' <b>is</b> based on signal decomposition by using the wavelet filtering. Wavelet filtering is applied by using Direct and Inverse CWT for each scaling parameter [2, 3]. Thus for each scaling parameter the signal component (which {{is part of the}} original signal) is obtained. For subsequent research <b>volatility</b> indicator <b>is</b> analyzed by using 20 -days time window, which is shifted on the time axis. <b>Volatility</b> analysis <b>is</b> done for each signal component.

40|$|The low {{predictive}} {{power of}} implied volatility in forecasting the subsequently realized <b>volatility</b> <b>is</b> a well-documented empirical puzzle. As suggested by e. g.

Our {{findings show that}} expectations of infrequently occurring jumps in <b>volatility</b> <b>are</b> indeed priced in implied volatility. This has two important consequences. First, implied <b>volatility</b> <b>is</b> actually expected to exceed realized volatility {{over long periods of}} time only to be greatly less than realized volatility during infrequently occurring periods of very high volatility. Second, the slope coefficient in the classic forecasting regression of realized volatility on implied <b>volatility</b> <b>is</b> very sensitive to the discrepancy between ex ante expected and ex post realized jump frequencies.
