5|$|CsF is more soluble than sodium {{fluoride}} or potassium fluoride. It {{is available in}} anhydrous form, and if water has <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> {{it is easy to}} dry by heating at 100°C for two hours in vacuo. CsF reaches a vapor pressure of 1 kilopascal at 825°C, 10 kPa at 999°C, and 100 kPa at 1249°C.|$|E
5|$|London's vast {{urban area}} is often {{described}} using a set of district names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.|$|E
5|$|Unlike First Nations {{people and}} Inuit, {{there has been}} no {{distinction}} between status and non-status, and the Métis, their heritage and Aboriginal ancestry have often <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> and assimilated into their surrounding populations.|$|E
50|$|This new {{incarnation}} was short-lived, however. On 20 November 1919 Y Battery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in A Battery, on 7 January 1920 Z Battery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in B Battery and on 11 February 1920 AA Battery <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> in M Battery, all of I Brigade, RHA.

50|$|In 1901, part of {{the civil}} parish <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Bristol, and further parts <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Bristol between then and 1933. In 1935, the civil parish was abolished, when the {{remaining}} parts <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the civil parishes of Pilning and Severn Beach, and Almondsbury.|$|R

5|$|Aspects of pop, rock, and {{classical}} music, including German Romanticism, have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Mehldau's writing and playing. Through {{his use of}} some traditional elements of jazz without being restricted by them, simultaneous playing of different melodies in separate hands, and incorporation of pop and rock pieces, Mehldau has influenced musicians in and beyond jazz in their approaches to writing, playing, and choice of repertoire.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} studies demonstrating {{the central role}} of ammonia, ammonia levels do not always correlate with the severity of the encephalopathy; it is suspected that this means that more ammonia has already <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the brain in those with severe symptoms whose serum levels are relatively low. Other waste products implicated in hepatic encephalopathy include mercaptans (substances containing a thiol group), short-chain fatty acids, and phenol.|$|E
5|$|The temperance movement, {{which had}} <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the moralistic {{system of the}} Nonconformist chapels, caused a shift in social attitudes in the mid- to late-19th- and early-20th century Rhondda. Alcohol was looked down upon and so were the {{increasingly}} violent sports such as rugby, so young men looked for different and more acceptable pastimes. Voice choirs were a natural progression from chapel society, and brass bands would eventually gain acceptance by the movement.|$|E
50|$|Although 95% {{of medium}} chain {{triglycerides}} <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> through the portal vein, only 25-30% of lauric acid <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> through the portal vein.|$|R

50|$|In clear open waters, {{visible light}} <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> at the longest {{wavelengths}} first. Thus, red, orange, and yellow wavelengths <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> at higher water depths, {{and blue and}} violet wavelengths reach the deepest in the water column. Because the blue and violet wavelengths <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> last {{compared to the other}} wavelengths, open ocean waters appear deep-blue to the eye.|$|R
5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the standard beagle bloodline.|$|E
5|$|By 1953 Quatermass is {{the head}} of the British Experimental Rocket Group, which has a {{programme}} to launch a manned rocket into space from a base in Tarooma, Australia. Although Quatermass succeeds in launching a three-man crew, the rocket vastly overshoots its projected orbit and returns to Earth much later than planned, crash-landing in London. Only one of the crew, Victor Carroon, remains, and he has been taken over by an alien presence, eventually forcing Quatermass to destroy him and the other two crewmembers who have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into him in a climax set in Westminster Abbey.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, {{as during}} the Principate, these forces were {{organised}} into ill-defined units based on a single ethnic group called numeri ("troops", although numerus was also {{the name of a}} regular infantry unit). They served alongside the regular army for the duration of particular campaigns or for a specified period. Normally their service would be limited to the region where the tribe lived, but sometimes could be deployed elsewhere. They were commanded by their own leaders. It is unclear whether they used their own weapons and armour or the standard equipment of the Roman army. In the late army, the more useful and long-serving numeri appear to have <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the regular late army, rapidly becoming indistinguishable from other units.|$|E
5000|$|Strike Command {{was formed}} on 30 April 1968 by {{the merger of}} Bomber Command and Fighter Command, which became No. 1 Group and No. 11 Group respectively.

5000|$|When {{an object}} <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the PC version, it disappears {{abruptly}} and generates {{a number of}} [...] "energy rings" [...] which quickly disappear. In the PS1 version, it disassembles into rotating polygons, while a seed (when a tree <b>is</b> <b>absorbed)</b> or 2/3 [...] "energy clusters" [...] (when a boulder, a synthoid or a sentry <b>is</b> <b>absorbed)</b> fly to the player's POV.|$|R
5|$|In {{the adult}} fish, the four {{chambers}} are not {{arranged in a}} straight row but, instead form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described {{as part of the}} aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes, presumably having <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable.|$|E
5|$|No. 73 Wing was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) wing of World WarII. It {{was formed}} in February 1943 at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, as part of No.9 Operational Group. The wing {{initially}} comprised three attack squadrons flying CAC Wirraways, Douglas Bostons, and Bristol Beaufighters, with which it {{took part in the}} New Guinea campaign until mid-year. It was then reorganised with three fighter squadrons operating P-40 Kittyhawks and Supermarine Spitfires; in this form it saw action in the New Britain and Admiralty Islands campaigns through 1943–44. The wing was disbanded at Los Negros in August 1944, and by the beginning of 1945 its squadrons had <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into other RAAF wings under No.10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force).|$|E
5|$|Over {{the past}} 2 billion years, star {{formation}} throughout Andromeda's disk {{is thought to}} have decreased to the point of near-inactivity. There have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> by Andromeda Galaxy. These interactions have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream. A galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1935 Misterton was {{the centre}} of the Misterton Rural District, which <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the East Retford Rural District. This in turn <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> by Bassetlaw in 1974.|$|R
50|$|In 1815 Omalur taluk <b>was</b> <b>absorbed</b> into Salem taluk, but was recreated in 1819. It <b>was</b> again <b>absorbed</b> by Salem taluk in 1860, {{and again}} recreated in 1910.

50|$|A part of {{ethyl alcohol}} is {{hydrophobic}}. This hydrophobic or lipophilic end can diffuse across cells {{that line the}} stomach wall. In fact, alcohol {{is one of the}} rare substances that can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the stomach. Most food substances <b>are</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the small intestine. However, even though alcohol can <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the stomach, it <b>is</b> mostly <b>absorbed</b> in the small intestine because the small intestine has a large surface area that promotes absorption. Once alcohol <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> in the small intestine, it delays the release of stomach contents from emptying into the small intestine. Thus, alcohol can delay the rate of absorption of nutrients. After absorption, alcohol reaches the liver where it is metabolized.|$|R
5|$|The {{independence}} of the East Anglians was restored by a successful rebellion against Mercia led by Æthelstan in 825. Beornwulf of Mercia's attempt to restore Mercian control over East Anglia resulted in his defeat and death, and his successor Ludeca met the same end in 827. The East Angles appealed to Egbert of Wessex for protection against the Mercians and Æthelstan then acknowledged Egbert as his overlord. Whilst Wessex {{took control of the}} south-eastern kingdoms which had <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> by Mercia during the eighth century, East Anglia could maintain its independence.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{respiratory}} organs, {{and both}} cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide {{into the surrounding}} water. When {{the water in the}} digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> will be expelled with it. Some Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.|$|E
5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs v. United States, the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams v. United States, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} July 1941, the Fourth Army {{began to}} dissolve. The Fourth Army's staff members <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the general staff of the Central Front, and the troops <b>were</b> <b>absorbed</b> into other armies.|$|R
50|$|Sound may <b>be</b> <b>absorbed</b> by {{losses at}} the fluid boundaries. Near {{the surface of}} the sea losses can occur in a bubble layer or in ice, while at the bottom sound can {{penetrate}} into the sediment and <b>be</b> <b>absorbed.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{joint line}} through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had {{approached}} the railways using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), approached the Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|Railways reached Lincoln in August 1848, 15 {{years after}} the first proposal. The Wakefield, Lincoln and Boston Railway hoped to build {{railways}} in the area, and negotiated with the proprietors and those of the Fosdyke. Under the arrangement, they would take over both navigations, and guarantee a fixed income for the proprietors. They would then merge with the London and York Railway. Both proposals had <b>been</b> <b>absorbed</b> into the Great Northern Railway (GNR) by the time an Act of Parliament was obtained, but the original agreement was retained, and the GNR leased the Witham for 999 years for a payment of £10,545 per year to the proprietors. This figure represented the average profits for the previous three years, plus five per cent. The railway company also agreed to pay the interest on mortgages amounting to £24,692 which the proprietors held, but had redeemed them by 1857. The railway from Lincoln to Boston ran along the eastern bank of the river, and opened on 17 October 1848.|$|E

25|$|Earth {{receives}} {{energy from}} the Sun {{in the form of}} ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared radiation. Of the total amount of solar energy available {{at the top of the}} atmosphere, about 26% is reflected to space by the atmosphere and clouds and 19% <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the atmosphere and clouds. Most of the remaining energy <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> at the surface of Earth. Because the Earth's surface is colder than the photosphere of the Sun, it radiates at wavelengths that are much longer than the wavelengths that <b>were</b> <b>absorbed.</b> Most of this thermal radiation <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the atmosphere, thereby warming it. In addition to the absorption of solar and thermal radiation, the atmosphere gains heat by sensible and latent heat fluxes from the surface. The atmosphere radiates energy both upwards and downwards; the part radiated downwards <b>is</b> <b>absorbed</b> by the surface of Earth. This leads to a higher equilibrium temperature than if the atmosphere were absent.|$|R
