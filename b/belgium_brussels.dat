2500|$|Among {{his most}} {{important}} paintings is the Triptych of Virtue of Patience (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of <b>Belgium,</b> <b>Brussels),</b> also called the Job altarpiece, commissioned in 1521 by Margaret of Austria to illustrate a poem she wrote about the virtue of patience. The interior panels represent the trials of Job, while the outer panels recount the parable of Lazarus and Dives (instead of the usual grisaille paintings of saints). This triptych is completely by the hand of Bernard van Orley. He must have been especially proud of his work as he signed it twice and added his coat of arms {{as well as his}} monogram BVO and the motto [...] 'ELX SYNE TYT' ("each his own time"). This relates to his artistic opinion that an artist should be a man fully integrated in his time.|$|E
