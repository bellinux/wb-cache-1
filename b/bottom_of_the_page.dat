5|$|By 1860, Smith {{was doing}} very well; {{he had moved}} to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real {{property}} was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages did not change.) No one on this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are given at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b>|$|E

25|$|Paperweights {{are used}} to hold down paper. A {{paperweight}} is often placed {{at the top of}} all but the largest pages to prevent slipping; for smaller pieces the left hand is also placed at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> for support. Paperweights come in several types: some are oblong wooden blocks carved with calligraphic or pictorial designs; others are essentially small sculptures of people or animals. Like ink stones, paperweights are collectible works of art on their own right.|$|E
25|$|Pearce's {{design for}} the new Parliament House was revolutionary. The {{building}} was effectively semi-circular in shape, occupying nearly 6,000m² (1.5 acres) of ground. Unlike Chichester House, which was set far back from Hoggen Green, the new building was to open up directly onto the Green. The principal entrance consisted of a colonnade of Ionic columns extending around three sides of the entrance quadrangle, forming a letter 'E' (see picture at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page).</b> Three statues, representing Hibernia (the Latin name for Ireland), Fidelity and Commerce (later carved by Edward Smyth) stood above the portico. Over the main entrance, the royal coat of arms were cut in stone.|$|E

25|$|The Greek {{alphabet}} and its successors {{settled on}} a left-to-right pattern, from the top to the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> Other scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, came to be written right-to-left. Scripts that incorporate Chinese characters have traditionally been written vertically (top-to-bottom), from the right {{to the left of}} the page, but nowadays are frequently written left-to-right, top-to-bottom, due to Western influence, a growing need to accommodate terms in the Latin script, and technical limitations in popular electronic document formats. Chinese characters sometimes, as in signage, especially when signifying something old or traditional, may also be written from right to left. The Old Uyghur alphabet and its descendants are unique in being written top-to-bottom, left-to-right; this direction originated from an ancestral Semitic direction by rotating the page 90° counter-clockwise to conform to the appearance of vertical Chinese writing. Several scripts used in the Philippines and Indonesia, such as Hanunó'o, are traditionally written with lines moving away from the writer, from bottom to top, but are read horizontally left to right. While Ogham is written bottom to top and read vertically, commonly on the corner of a stone.|$|E

500|$|The webpage {{originally}} {{displayed a}} small text disclaimer at the bottom, {{stating that the}} site was satirical. Eiland-Hall later placed two prominent disclaimers {{at the top of}} the page, which identified it as parody. The disclaimer {{at the top of the}} website's main page stated its entire contents was parody, and [...] included a link to a larger disclaimer at the <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>page.</b> The site criticized Beck's tactic of challenging those he opposes to prove a negative. Eiland-Hall told Politics Daily that after reading the initial thread at Fark which started the meme, he came to the conclusion that for those involved online participation in its propagation was a form of catharsis. He explained in an interview with Ars Technica that it was a means of utilizing Beck's strategies to criticize him and a way to focus exasperation around Beck's style of commentary into action. Eiland-Hall's website inspired copycat parodies.|$|E
