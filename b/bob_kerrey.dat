5|$|In 1992, Brown was a {{delegate}} to the 1992 Democratic National Convention from the New York's 33rd congressional district. He was originally pledged to <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey,</b> but switched to Bill Clinton after Kerrey bowed out of the 1992 Democratic Primary campaign on March 5, 1992. In 1993, Brown was invited to attend Bill Clinton's Inauguration.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been several {{developments}} along the Missouri River waterfront in downtown. The <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> Pedestrian Bridge was opened to foot and bicycle traffic on September 28, 2008. Started in 2003, RiverFront Place Condos first phase was completed in 2006 and is fully occupied and the second phase was opened in 2011. The development along Omaha's riverfront is attributed with prompting the City of Council Bluffs to move their own riverfront development time line forward.|$|E
5|$|Beshear {{did little}} in the {{political}} arena for almost a decade after his 1987 primary defeat, but in late 1995, he was encouraged by Democratic leaders – including former governor Ned Breathitt, Senator Wendell H. Ford, and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee chair <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> – to challenge incumbent Republican Senator Mitch McConnell. Beshear entered the primary as a heavy favorite against Tom Barlow, a former one-term Congressman from Kentucky's First District, and Shelby Lanier, a retired Louisville police officer. During the primary campaign, Beshear virtually ignored Barlow and Lanier and focused his rhetoric on McConnell. Despite Barlow's tour of all 120 Kentucky counties, Beshear cruised to victory in the primary, garnering 177,859 votes (66.38%) to Barlow's 64,235 (23.97%) and Lanier's 25,856 (9.65%).|$|E
50|$|During the 2000 presidential campaign, Murray {{supported}} Green Party candidate Ralph Nader. He also donated $1,000 {{to former}} Governor of Nebraska <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey's</b> successful {{election to the}} United States Senate in 1988.|$|R
50|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1988, Devine got his start managing national campaigns when he served as Campaign Manager for the Vice Presidential nominee, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. In 1992, Devine served as Campaign Manager for Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey's</b> campaign for President.|$|R
25|$|Webb {{supported}} Nebraska Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey's</b> {{campaign for}} the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination. In 1994, he endorsed incumbent Democrat Charles Robb for reelection to his Senate seat, over Webb's former Naval Academy classmate Oliver North; like Webb, both Robb and North were decorated Marine veterans of the Vietnam war. Webb subsequently endorsed Republican George Allen over Robb in 2000, and then ran against Allen himself in 2006.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, Hagel {{endorsed}} Democratic Pennsylvania Congressman Joe Sestak in his {{run for the}} United States Senate. In 2012 he endorsed Democrat <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> in {{the race}} for an open U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska.|$|E
25|$|Al Gore from Tennessee was a {{consistent}} front-runner for the nomination. Other prominent Democrats mentioned as possible contenders included <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey,</b> Missouri Representative Dick Gephardt, Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone, and famous actor and director Warren Beatty, {{who declined to}} run. Of these, only Wellstone formed an exploratory committee.|$|E
25|$|Fisher's 1942 {{book with}} the concept behind the Unlimited Savings Accumulation Tax, a reform {{introduced}} in the United States Senate in 1995 by Senator Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico), former Senator Sam Nunn (D-Georgia), and Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> (D-Nebraska). The concept was that unnecessary spending (which is hard to define in a law) can be taxed by taxing income minus all net investments and savings, and minus an allowance for essential purchases, thus making funds available for investment.|$|E
2500|$|In 1990, O'Malley {{ran for the}} Maryland State Senate in the 43rd State Senate District in {{northeast}} Baltimore. He challenged one-term incumbent John A. Pica in the Democratic Party primary, and lost by just 44 votes. He was considered an underdog when he first filed to run, but [...] "came out of nowhere" [...] to lead Pica on election night. Eventually he lost when the absentee ballots were later counted. In 1991, {{he was elected to}} the Baltimore City Council representing the 3rd Councilmanic District (when each of six districts had three members) and served from 1991 to 1999. As Councilman, he served as Chairman of the Legislative Investigations Committee and Chairman of the Taxation and Finance Committee. During the 1992 Democratic primaries, he served as Nebraska Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey's</b> Maryland coordinator.|$|R
40|$|Important to Nebraska and Important Globally Ken Cassman offered three {{thoughts}} {{to guide the}} Water for Food Institute: 1) engaging young people is important; 2) irrigated agriculture has a reputation, even in Nebraska, as being bad for {{the environment and the}} economy, yet irrigated agriculture will {{play a significant role in}} a Green Revolution in Sub-Saharan Africa, although that role has yet to be defined; and 3) research and education conducted at the institute must benefit Nebraska, contribute to the university’s land-grant mission and be fundamentally important internationally. “What that means to me is the institute, early on, has to be very successful at picking foci and priorities for their efforts that can be articulated very clearly as important to Nebraskans and important globally,” Cassman said. Because resources won’t be enough for separate agendas, issues the institute focuses on must benefit Nebraska’s interests and international interests while using the same teaching and research expertise. Cassman said one example would be to answer the questions: Can high-yield, irrigated agriculture be sustainable in terms of food supply, economics and social acceptance? How can policymakers be convinced that irrigation is sustainable? How can purchasers or donors be convinced that irrigated agriculture can be part of development plans? A second example might be to conduct life cycle assessments of agricultural systems’ water footprints. For example, studies demonstrate that lettuce grown efficiently and trucked elsewhere contributes fewer greenhouse gases than locally produced lettuce. Similarly, feedlot cattle have lower greenhouse gas emissions per unit of meat produced than do grass-fed beef. Understanding agriculture’s water footprint will require interdisciplinary integration, Cassman said. An Unbiased Source of Information Eugene Glock emphasized the importance of compiling and disseminating information. “If you’re trying to push it on people, it’s not going to happen. But if you can show people some way that it’s going to benefit them personally, economically, socially, some way that it will be helpful, they’ll adopt that pretty quickly. ” He gave the example of high-pressure pivot irrigation, which uses less water. Although lower pressure pivots are less expensive, when diesel fuel reached $ 4 per gallon and it cost up to $ 30, 000 to add an inch of water to a field, people reconsidered high-pressure irrigation. “That’s what we have to strive for, and that’s what this institute has to have a hand in doing – getting people excited about doing something that is right, not trying to force them,” Glock said. He also urged the institute to avoid becoming a lobbying agency, but rather to be available to help policymakers make good decisions. Glock, who was the state agriculture representative on former U. S. Sen. <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey’s</b> staff, said he believes policymakers need an unbiased center to help determine worthwhile projects to fund...|$|R
25|$|After the {{successful}} performance by U.S. and coalition {{forces in the}} Persian Gulf War, President George H.W. Bush's approval ratings were 89%. His re-election was considered very likely. As a result, several high-profile candidates, such as Mario Cuomo, refused to seek the Democratic nomination. In addition, Senator Al Gore refused to seek the nomination {{due to the fact}} his son was struck by a car and was undergoing extensive surgery as well as physical therapy. However, Tom Harkin, Paul Tsongas, Jerry Brown, <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey,</b> Douglas Wilder and Bill Clinton chose to run as candidates.|$|E
25|$|Cleland served from 1971 to 1975 in the Georgia Senate, {{and became}} an {{advocate}} for affairs relating to veterans. He was the administrator of the United States Veterans Administration under President Jimmy Carter, a fellow Georgian, from 1977 to 1981. He then served 14 years as Secretary of State of Georgia from 1982 to 1996, working closely with his future Senate colleague, Zell Miller. During this period, Cleland promoted a penny stock law in Georgia which would become the template for national regulations to curb stock manipulation abuses. In the 1992 Democratic presidential primaries, Cleland supported fellow Vietnam veteran <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey.</b>|$|E
25|$|U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (Iowa) ran as {{a populist}} liberal with labor union support. Former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas (Massachusetts) {{highlighted}} his political independence and fiscal conservatism. Former California Governor Jerry Brown, {{who had run}} for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and 1980 {{while he was still}} Governor, declared a significant reform agenda, including Congressional term limits, campaign finance reform, and the adoption of a flat income tax. Nebraska Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> was an attractive candidate based on his business and military background, but made several gaffes on the campaign trail. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton positioned himself as a centrist, or New Democrat. He was still relatively unknown nationally before the primary season. That quickly changed however, when a woman named Gennifer Flowers appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair. Clinton rebutted the story by appearing on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary Clinton.|$|E
500|$|Bill Hoppner, {{a former}} staffer for elected {{officials}} J. James Exon and <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey.</b> [...] Hoppner had served on Exon's staff from 1973 to 1982, initially as legal counsel while Exon was governor, then {{as chief of}} staff when Exon was elected to the U.S. Senate. [...] He had then returned to Nebraska and served {{as chief of staff}} for governor Kerrey from 1982 to 1984; in 1989, when Kerrey took a seat in the U.S. Senate, Hoppner had again served for a year as his chief of staff.|$|E
500|$|The general {{pattern of}} {{reaction}} has been typified by <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey,</b> {{president of the}} New School and former Senator from Nebraska, who originally stated that Hsu had been [...] "a terrific member" [...] of the New School board. After Hsu resigned as a board member, Kerrey said the university did not do background checks of prospective trustees and that he hoped that Hsu [...] "didn't break the law." [...] After Hsu became a two-time fugitive, Kerrey remarked, [...] "I thought that I knew him, but obviously I didn’t." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{registered}} Republicans outnumbered Democrats in the 2nd congressional district, {{which includes}} Omaha, Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama opened three campaign {{offices in the}} city with 15 staff members to cover the state in fall 2008. Mike Fahey, the former Democratic mayor of Omaha, {{said he would do}} whatever it took to deliver the district's electoral vote to Obama; and the Obama campaign considered the district [...] "in play". Former Nebraska U.S. Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> and former Senator Ben Nelson campaigned in the city for Obama, and in November 2008 Obama won the district's electoral vote. This was an exceptional win, because with Nebraska's split electoral vote system Obama became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win an electoral vote in Nebraska since 1964.|$|E
500|$|Orr's {{popularity}} {{was further}} {{damaged by the}} proposed siting of a low-level nuclear waste disposal facility in the state. [...] In 1983, during the tenure of governor <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey,</b> Nebraska had joined Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma to form the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, under which a single disposal site would be constructed for all five states. [...] In 1987, {{the members of the}} compact voted 4–1 to place the facility in Nebraska. [...] At that time, Orr declared that she was not pleased with the choice, but had to acquiesce in the other states' decision. [...] U.S. Ecology, the company chosen to construct and operate the facility, considered a variety of sites in the state. [...] In January 1989, they announced that they had narrowed their choices to sites in Boyd, Nemaha, and Nuckolls counties; in January 1990, they declared that they had chosen the Boyd County location.|$|E
500|$|Although Gore was {{considered}} the party favorite, Bradley received a number of high-profile endorsements, including senators Paul Wellstone, <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey,</b> and Daniel Patrick Moynihan; former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich; former New York City mayor Ed Koch; former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker; and basketball stars Michael Jordan and Phil Jackson. Bradley and Jackson have been close friends since they were teammates playing for the New York Knicks. Jackson was a vocal supporter of Bradley's {{run for the presidency}} and often wore his campaign button in public. Jackson announced his acceptance of the position of head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers while Bradley was campaigning in California in 1999, and he was a [...] "regular draw on the Bradley money trail" [...] during the campaign. Bradley later called it a [...] "great honor" [...] to be the presenter when Jackson was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> (D-Neb.), vice {{chairman}} of the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Deutch's refusal to deem the three former CIA directors responsible, saying that they [...] "should have known" [...] about the tainted reports. Kerrey also cited an October 30 letter from the three former directors to Deutch, in which they defended themselves and suggested investigating the CIA's Inspector General; the trio insisted that they knew nothing of the reports and said they should not be faulted for the incident. Webster, Gates, and Woolsey stated that Hitz, in a 1991 report on the SE Division, did not highlight the problem of faulty intelligence. The trio claimed they had never seen the report and argued that Hitz had failed to detect the disinformation operation. The former directors also asked Deutch to publicly announce that he would not hold them accountable, which Kerrey denounced, saying that accountability was needed to improve Agency morale. Richard Kerr, the CIA's Deputy Director in 1991, stated that the CIA debated the authenticity of 1988 Soviet military documents provided by suspected double agents, which were forwarded to the Pentagon regardless. Kerr said he never saw Hitz's 80-page report, although a CIA spokesman confirmed that Webster's office had received it.|$|E

2500|$|Nelson was {{nominated}} by the Democrats for the Senate in the 2000 election after his fellow Democrat, incumbent <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey,</b> announced his retirement. [...] His opponent was Attorney General Don Stenberg. Nelson won that election with 50.99% {{of the vote}} after a campaign in which he spent 50% more ($1,004,985) than his opponent. Despite initially pledging to work together, Nelson and Hagel had a somewhat frosty relationship.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the entire}} {{course of the}} campaign, Stinner raised {{contributions}} of $109,000 and spent $101,000. [...] Meister raised $39,000 in contributions and spent $35,000. [...] Stinner contributed $2,500 to his own campaign; other major contributions included $9,000 from a Scottsbluff farm-implement dealer, $5,000 from a Gering welding-and-fabrication business, and $5,000 from a Gering electrical contractor. [...] Meister contributed over $12,800 to his own campaign; he also received $3,100 from the <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> Senate campaign, and nearly $1,000 from the Nebraska Democratic Party.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997 the United States Navy named a roll-on/roll-off ship [...] in a {{ceremony}} at the National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, San Diego, California. The ceremony was attended {{by a number of}} Naval officers and politicians including John W. Douglass, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition; Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> (D); as well as his Commanding officer {{at the time of his}} death, and others. The ship was the first [...] "Large Medium Speed Roll On/Roll Off (LMSR) ship" [...] to undergo conversion from a commercial container vessel to a sealift cargo ship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary season}} began with U.S. Senator Tom Harkin winning his native Iowa as expected. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts won the New Hampshire primary on February 18, but Clinton's second-place finish, helped by his speech {{labeling}} himself [...] "The Comeback Kid," [...] energized his campaign. Jerry Brown won the Maine caucus and <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> won South Dakota. Clinton {{won his first}} primary in Georgia. Tsongas won the Utah and Maryland primaries and a caucus in Washington. Harkin won caucuses in Idaho and Minnesota while Jerry Brown won Colorado. <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> dropped out two days later. Clinton won the South Carolina and Wyoming primaries and Tsongas won Arizona. Harkin dropped out. Jerry Brown won the Nevada caucus. Clinton swept {{nearly all of the}} Super Tuesday primaries on March 10 making him the solid front runner. Clinton won the Michigan and Illinois primaries. Tsongas dropped out after finishing 3rd in Michigan. Jerry Brown, however, began to pick up steam, aided by using a 1–800 number to receive funding from small donors. Brown scored surprising wins in Connecticut, Vermont and Alaska. As the race moved to the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, Brown had taken the lead in polls in both states. Then he made a serious gaffe by announcing to an audience of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider Reverend Jesse Jackson as a Vice Presidential candidate. Clinton won dramatically in New York (41%–26%) and closely in Wisconsin (37%–34%). Clinton then proceeded to win a long streak of primaries leading up to Jerry Brown's home state of California. Clinton won this primary 48% to 41% and secured the delegates needed to clinch the nomination.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the final {{primaries}} concluded, Mondale had a considerable lead in total delegates, though he was 40 delegates short of clinching victory. Superdelegates voted overwhelmingly for Mondale at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco on July 16, making him the presidential nominee. Hart, already aware that the nomination was all but Mondale's after the final primaries, lobbied for the vice presidential slot on the ticket, claiming {{that he would do}} better than Mondale against President Ronald Reagan (an argument undercut by a June 1984 Gallup poll that showed both men nine points behind the president). While Hart was given serious consideration, Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro instead. [...] In his address to the convention, after his name was placed in nomination for president by Nebraska governor <b>Bob</b> <b>Kerrey</b> and he received a 15-minute standing ovation, Hart concluded, “Our party and our country will continue to hear from us. This is one Hart you will not leave in San Francisco.” ...|$|E
