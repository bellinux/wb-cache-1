5|$|In early 1957, Tubb persuaded Hamilton {{to switch}} the {{magazine}} from pocket-book to digest size format, {{in the hope}} that this would improve the magazine's visibility on bookstalls.

However, later that year, Hamilton made the decision to invest a substantial sum in the UK paperback rights of an American best-seller: it is not known for certain which book this was, but it is thought to have been Evan Hunter's The Blackboard Jungle. Hamilton could no longer afford to have cash tied up in Authentic, and in the summer of 1957 Tubb was given two months to close down the magazine, printing stories that had already been paid for. The last issue was dated October 1957.|$|E

5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published {{on the front page of}} the Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash.

Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident.
