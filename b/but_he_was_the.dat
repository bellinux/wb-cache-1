5|$|López {{returned}} to the postseason with Houston in 1986, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> losing pitcher in Game Five of that year's National League Championship Series. By {{the end of his}} MLB career, López earned a 6236 win–loss record, 93 saves and a 3.56 earned run average (ERA). After his retirement from baseball, López served as municipal president of his hometown of Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico from 1989 until his death. He was killed in an automobile accident in 1992. López was inducted into the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame the following year.|$|E
5|$|In Game {{three of}} the 2010 NLDS against the Atlanta Braves, Sánchez struck out eleven batters in a game the Giants won 3–2. Sánchez gave up three runs over six innings in Game two of the 2010 NLCS, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> losing pitcher in a 6–1 loss. Sánchez also started Game six. He only lasted two innings, giving up two runs and getting pulled from the game after an {{argument}} with Chase Utley. However, the Giants won the game 3–2 {{and returned to the}} World Series. Sánchez's only World Series game was unsuccessful, as he gave up all four runs in 4.2 innings in the Giants' 4–2 loss to the Texas Rangers in Game three. However, the Giants ultimately won the World Series {{for the first time in}} fifty-six years.|$|E
5|$|Lemon {{began the}} 1955 {{season with a}} 5–0 record in April, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only Cleveland {{starting}} pitcher with a winning record that month. His 18 wins tied for {{the most in the}} AL that year. He recorded five complete games through May 30 but none after that date. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg got Lemon to agree to his first reduction in contract salary since joining the organization. Lemon earned his 200th career win against the Baltimore Orioles on September 11, 1956, and he also hit a home run that day. He finished the season with a 20–14 record, the last of his seven career 20-win seasons, and led the AL in complete games (21). On August 13, 1957, it was announced that Lemon would not finish the season due to continued irritation to his elbow after bone chips were found earlier in the season. Lemon ended the season with a record of 6–11, his first losing record since 1946.|$|E

5|$|There were no hits in {{the seventh}} inning, as both {{pitchers}} retired the first three batters they faced. In {{the top of the}} eighth inning, Irvin hit the third home run of the game, his 24th of the year, to make the score 3–1. Lockman then reached first base on an error and was able to advance to third base, but Mays and Hearn both struck out to keep the score intact. No Dodgers managed a hit {{in the bottom of the}} eighth, though the Dodgers brought in Jim Russell to use as a pinch hitter for Branca. In the ninth inning, Alvin Dark doubled for the Giants, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only player on either team to earn a hit; Hearn retired all three Dodgers hitters to end the game with the 3–1 victory, earning a complete game win after allowing five hits to the Dodgers. Those in attendance included Bill Dickey, a coach for the Yankees who attended the game to scout both teams.|$|E
5|$|Voce {{missed the}} fourth Test of the series, being {{replaced}} by a leg spinner, Tommy Mitchell. Larwood continued to use bodyline, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only bowler in the team using the tactic; even so, he used it less frequently than usual and seemed less effective in high temperatures and humidity. England won the game by eight wickets, {{thanks in part to}} an innings of 83 by Eddie Paynter who had been admitted to hospital with tonsillitis but left in order to bat when England were struggling in their innings. Voce returned for the final Test, but neither he nor Allen were fully fit, and despite the use of bodyline tactics, Australia scored 435 at a rapid pace, aided by several dropped catches. Australia included a fast bowler for this final game, Harry Alexander who bowled some short deliveries but was not allowed to use many fielders on the leg side by his captain, Woodfull. England built a lead of 19 but their tactics in Australia's second innings were disrupted when Larwood left the field with an injured foot; Hedley Verity, a spinner, claimed five wickets to bowl Australia out; England won by eight wickets and won the series by four Tests to one.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year, Grant {{led the team}} to a divisional {{championship}} and his first NFL playoffs appearance. In 1969, he led the team to its first NFL Championship and their first appearance in the Super Bowl. The Vikings lost in Super Bowl IV to the American Football League champion Kansas City Chiefs. Prior to the 1970 season, Minnesota released Joe Kapp. After starting Gary Cuozzo at quarterback in 1970 and 1971, the Vikings re-acquired Fran Tarkenton prior to the 1972 season. During the 1970s, the Vikings would appear in three more Super Bowls (VIII, IX, and XI) under Grant and lose each one, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first coach to lead a team to four Super Bowls. He retired after the 1983 NFL season and was succeeded by Les Steckel, who led the team to a 3-13 record the following season. Steckel was fired as head coach after the 1984 season and Grant returned as coach for the Vikings in 1985. After one season where he returned the club to a 7-9 record, he stepped down again. Grant retired as the eighth most successful coach in NFL history with an overall record of 161 wins, 99 losses, and 5 ties. As of 2014, he also remains the most successful coach in Vikings history. During his tenure with the Vikings, he led the Vikings to four Super Bowls, eleven division titles, one league championship and three NFC conference championships.|$|E

25|$|With so {{many players}} under consideration, it was {{difficult}} to predict who would go to the West Indies in the winter and that question became even more complex when several players decided not to go. Bedser, Compton, Edrich, Hutton, Wright and Yardley from the 1947 series all declined the tour before the squad was selected, as did Trevor Bailey who was in contention for a place. With Yardley missing, MCC reappointed pre-war captain Gubby Allen to lead the party <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first in a spate of injuries when he damaged a leg muscle on the outward voyage. Following further injuries to Dennis Brookes and Joe Hardstaff junior, Allen asked MCC to send reinforcements and Hutton then changed his mind, flying out just in time to play against British Guiana.|$|E

Robin Uthappa(8 run from 11 ball), Yuvraj Singh(14 run from 19 ball), MS Dhoni(6 run from 10 ball) all departed soon and while Gambhir was stuck to the other end. His 75 from 56 hit 8 four and 2 six and Rohit Sharma's 30 not out of 16 hit 2 four and one six at last stage took India to 157–5 in 20 overs.

25|$|Tyndall {{explained}} {{the heat in}} the Earth's atmosphere {{in terms of the}} capacities of the various gases in the air to absorb radiant heat, also known as infrared radiation. His measuring device, which used thermopile technology, is an early landmark in the history of absorption spectroscopy of gases. He was the first to correctly measure the relative infrared absorptive powers of the gases nitrogen, oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, etc. (year 1859). He concluded that water vapour is the strongest absorber of radiant heat in the atmosphere and is the principal gas controlling air temperature. Absorption by the other gases is not negligible but relatively small. Prior to Tyndall it was widely surmised that the Earth's atmosphere has a Greenhouse Effect, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first to prove it. The proof was that water vapour strongly absorbed infrared radiation. Relatedly, Tyndall in 1860 was first to demonstrate and quantify that visually transparent gases are infrared emitters.|$|E
25|$|Carp did {{not hold}} an {{official}} post, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> éminence grise, arranging the removal of most bureaucrats who {{had been left behind}} by the Brătianu cabinet, or drafting plans for a future Carp cabinet in conversations with German military ruler August von Mackensen. The proposed government was to include Kostaki, Barnoschi, Radu Rosetti and Dimitrie S. Nenițescu, alongside zoologist Grigore Antipa and Colonel Victor Verzea. The Carpists were still committed to the cause of Bessarabia, and Kostaki assured his backers that, with German help, the province would eventually be made part of Romania. Early in 1917, Carp's son in law, Colonel Alexandru D. Sturdza, deserted from the Moldavian front and made his way to Bucharest. He claimed that Russia had effectively occupied Moldavia, and wanted to organize a rival Romanian Army to liberate Iași. Some sources state that Carp immediately repudiated him upon arrival, but one account places Sturdza among Carp's visitors and confidants, as late as December 1917.|$|E

Denly top scored with 36, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> third man down, neatly stumped by James Foster.
