5|$|From {{the time}} of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied {{supplies}} and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> ammunition and provisions to withstand the several Japanese drives to retake the islands.|$|E
5|$|In {{her final}} years, Santoso and Sastrosatomo lived off of their {{pensions}} in Jakarta; in her obituary, Tempo magazine {{reported that the}} pension was <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> for day-to-day expenses. She died at 2:15 am on 15 April 1988, after being treated at Gatot Subroto Air Force Hospital in Jakarta {{for more than a}} month. She was buried at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E

5|$|The Glebe's {{profits were}} <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> for Breckinridge's growing family. His legal career {{provided}} {{enough money for}} some comforts but required long hours and difficult work. Patrick Henry regularly represented clients opposite Breckinridge, and John Marshall both referred clients to him {{and asked him to}} represent his own clients in his absence. Though still interested in politics, Breckinridge refused to campaign for the people's support. He believed changes were needed to the Articles of Confederation and agreed with much of the proposed U.S. constitution, but he did not support equal representation of the states in the Senate nor the federal judiciary. Heeding the advice of his brother James and his friend, Archibald Stuart, he did not seek election as a delegate to Virginia's ratification convention.|$|E
5|$|The Whitestone Branch {{would have}} had to be rebuilt if it were leased to the subway, with {{railroad}} crossings removed and the single track doubled. The PSC located 14 places where crossings needed to be eliminated. However, by early 1917, there was <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> money to build the subway to Flushing, let alone a link to Whitestone and Bayside. A lease agreement was announced on October 16, 1917, but the IRT withdrew from the agreement a month later, citing that it was inappropriate to enter such an agreement at that time. Thereafter, the PSC instead turned its attention back to the Main Street subway extension.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{insisted on}} going to Cincinnati to attend the funeral of his brother Charles, who died on December 31, 1929; the strain did not improve his own health. When the court reconvened on January 6, 1930, Taft had not {{returned}} to Washington, and two opinions were delivered by Van Devanter that Taft had drafted but {{had been unable to}} complete because of his illness. Taft went to Asheville, North Carolina for a rest, {{but by the end of}} January, he could barely speak and was suffering from hallucinations. Taft was afraid that Stone would be made chief justice; he did not resign until he had secured assurances from Hoover that Hughes would be the choice. Returning to Washington after his resignation on February 3, Taft had <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> strength to sign a reply to a letter of tribute from the eight associate justices. He died at his home in Washington on March 8, 1930.|$|E

5|$|The war also {{provided}} opportunities for advancement onto the General Staff, {{especially in the}} early days, when many former senior officers were recalled from retirement. Some of these were found wanting, due to their advanced age, their unwillingness to serve, {{or a lack of}} competence and fitness; most were sent back into retirement before {{the first year of the}} war was over, leaving a gap that had to be filled by lower-ranking officers. Criticism of the quality of staff work in the Crimean War and the Second Boer War had led to sweeping changes under Haldane. The Staff College, Camberley was greatly expanded and Lord Kitchener established another staff college at Quetta for Indian Army officers in 1904. Nonetheless, when war broke out in August 1914, there were <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> graduates to staff the BEF. Four-month-long staff courses were introduced, and filled with regimental officers who, upon completing their training, were posted to various headquarters. As a result, staff work was again poor, until training and experience slowly remedied the situation. In 1918, staff officers who had been trained exclusively for static trench warfare were forced to adapt to the demands of semi-open warfare.|$|E
25|$|In early 1995, South Africa won one-off tests {{against both}} Pakistan and New Zealand, in Auckland Cronje scored the only century {{of the match}} before a final day {{declaration}} left his bowlers <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> time to dismiss the Kiwis.|$|E
25|$|Groundwater is {{unevenly}} distributed and {{can only}} be extracted in certain areas, specifically in weathered areas above the bedrock and fractured zones. Even there yields are limited to about 10 m3/day per borehole, which is <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> to supply a small village with water.|$|E
60|$|The patch was small. Moreover, the shrubs were <b>barely</b> tall <b>enough</b> {{to conceal}} a horse. In five minutes it became quite {{certain that the}} horses were not there.|$|R

25|$|The sole {{surviving}} English Electric Wren (G-EBNV) flies occasionally at the Shuttleworth Collection at Old Warden and {{is powered}} by an ABC 8hp engine.

25|$|The years 1640 to 1642 were {{comparatively}} quiet, but in 1643 French Weimar regiments were in occupation, {{along with}} the entire French general staff. The so-called “Weimar occupation” lasted until May 1643, when victory was achieved {{after three days of}} fighting by the Bavarian army under the command of Graf Fugger. In 1645, the town was again plundered by French and Hessian troops. Subsequently, the Bavarians moved back, but provisions were <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> to feed them. Virtually all that remained were cabbages, beets and new wine.|$|E
25|$|Although actual harvests were reduced, local officials, under {{tremendous}} pressure from central authorities to report record harvests {{in response to}} the innovations, competed with each other to announce increasingly exaggerated results. These were used as a basis for determining the amount of grain to be taken by the State to supply the towns and cities, and to export. This left <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> for the peasants, and in some areas, starvation set in. A 1959 drought and flooding from the Yellow River in the same year also contributed to famine.|$|E
50|$|Wild trout {{naturally}} reproduce in Silver Creek {{from its}} headwaters downstream to its mouth. According to Trout Unlimited's Guide to Pennsylvania Limestone Streams, it is <b>barely</b> large <b>enough</b> to support trout, and none were observed when the author visited.|$|R

25|$|Douglass thought such a {{strategy}} was too risky, that there was <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> support for black men's suffrage. He feared that linking the cause of women's suffrage to that of black men would result in failure for both. Douglass argued that white women, already empowered by their social connections to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. African-American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African-American men had the vote. Douglass assured the American women that at no time had he ever argued against women's right to vote.|$|E
25|$|To the amazement of the Confederates, and {{the dismay}} of President Abraham Lincoln, McClellan chose not to attack without more {{reconnaissance}} and ordered his army to entrench in works parallel to Magruder's and besiege Yorktown. McClellan reacted to Keyes's report, {{as well as to}} reports of enemy strength near Yorktown, but he also received word that the I Corps, under Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell, would be withheld for the defense of Washington, instead of joining him on the Peninsula as McClellan had planned. For the next 10 days, McClellan's men dug while Magruder steadily received reinforcements. By mid April, Magruder commanded 35,000 men, <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> to defend his line.|$|E
25|$|When {{he first}} pitched {{the idea of}} Pokémon to Nintendo, they could not quite grasp the concept, but were {{impressed}} enough with Tajiri's game design reputation that they decided to explore the concept. Shigeru Miyamoto began to mentor Tajiri, guiding him during the creation process. Pokémon Red and Blue took six years to produce, and nearly bankrupted Game Freak in the process; often, there was <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> {{money to pay the}} employees. Five employees quit, and Tajiri did not take a salary, instead living off of his father's income. Investment from Creatures Inc. allowed Game Freak to complete the games, and in return, Creatures received one-third of the franchise rights.|$|E
25|$|Members of Czechoslovakia's {{parliament}} (the Federal Assembly), divided along national lines, <b>barely</b> cooperated <b>enough</b> to {{pass the}} law officially separating the two nations in late 1992. On 1 January 1993, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic (Slovakia) were simultaneously and peacefully founded.|$|R
60|$|The opening was but <b>barely</b> large <b>enough</b> {{to admit}} her. Upon the {{opposite}} side {{she found herself in}} a small chamber. Before her squatted Luud. Against the opposite wall lay a large and beautiful male rykor. He was without harness or other trappings.|$|R
50|$|The Founding Convention {{was held}} at the Kremlin in Moscow in a small hall in the Courts of Justice. The long, narrow hall was <b>barely</b> large <b>enough</b> for 100 people, with the delegates seated upon flimsy chairs at small tables spaced {{throughout}} the room.|$|R

25|$|The {{change was}} publicized {{as a way}} to {{increase}} the ability for missionaries to serve. At the time, missionaries paid for all their expenses in their country of service. Recession during the Carter presidency pushed inflation higher and the exchange rate lower. This sudden increase in costs together with already high costs of living in Europe and other industrialized nations resulted in a steady {{decline in the number of}} missionaries able to pay for two full years of service. The shortening of the required service time from 24 to 18 months cut off this decline in numbers, leveling out in the period following the reinstatement. For those in foreign missions, this was <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> time to learn a more difficult language and difficulty with language was reported.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Vicksburg Campaign most of Johnston’s army was transferred back to the Army of Tennessee. By August 10, 1863, Colonel McCray had requested transfer to the Department of the Trans-Mississippi and reported to General Kirby Smith, at Shreveport Louisiana by mid September. Several additional consolidations occurred in McNair’s Brigade during the month of August and were made official September 1, 1863. Depleted by deaths and desertions, the 31st Arkansas Regiment and the 4th Arkansas Infantry Battalion were permanently consolidated with the 4th Arkansas Infantry Regiment on September 1, 1863. With <b>barely</b> <b>enough</b> men left to fill up two companies in the consolidated regiment, the 31st Arkansas boys served under the 4th Arkansas Regiment’s Colonel Henry Gaston Bunn {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

50|$|In 1893, William Hogg, a local businessman, {{built the}} area's first {{electrical}} generator {{on the river}} below the falls.
