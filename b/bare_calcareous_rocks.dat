40|$|Anisotropy in compressional-wave {{velocities}} in {{sedimentary rocks}} recovered by DSDP {{has been recognized}} by several investigators (Boyce, 1976; Tucholke et al., 1976; Carlson and Christensen, 1977). The anisotropy is also observed at elevated pressures in laboratory experiments, and thus probably persists at depth in some <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> (Schreiber et al., 1972; Christensen et al., 1973; Carlson and Christensen, 1979). Carlson and Christensen (1979) suggested that the observed velocity anisotropy was produced not by the alignment of cracks but by the alignment of c axes of calcite perpendicular to bedding during compaction, diagenesis, and recrystallization. On DSDP Leg 62, <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> were recovered from the western Mid-Pacific Mountains (sub-bottom depths of 452 - 823 m, Site 463) and southern Hess Rise (276 - 412 m, Site 465). Most of the <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> are horizontally laminated and color-banded, and ages are early Cenomanian to late Barremian (Site 463 and 465 reports, this volume). The {{purpose of this study}} is to confirm the velocity anisotropy in the <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> and to identify any relationship of anistropy to bulk density, mean velocity, and burial depth...|$|R

40|$|EnThe Monti di Palermo are a Sicilian Segment of the Appenninico-Maghrebide chain, where {{different}} tectonic units, primarily {{made up of}} <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> (Late Triassic-Early Oligocene) are present. These <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> {{are covered}} by clay deposits (Flysch Numidico, Late Oligocene-Early Miocene). The tectonic units are characterised by a very complicated geometrical arrangement influencing their geomorphologic features and consequently the groundwater flow and {{its relationship with the}} seawater. <b>Calcareous</b> <b>rocks,</b> particularly limestone, are characterised by karstic forms with diversified dimensions and different evolution stadiums. Particularly, the great karstic forms are located on tectonic or morphoselected depressions and along geostructural lines. The water chemical aspects reflect the aquifer rock characteristics (limestone and dolomitic limestone) and the actual hydrogeochemical processes (ionic exchange with argillitic minerals). The large amounts of karstic forms determine a very fast infiltration and groundwater flow. In the Monti di Palermo some hydrostructures are used intensively for the water supply of urban areas and agricultural use. The over exploitation of the hydrostructures has caused great seawater intrusion, present along the coastal zone, fault lines and associated karstic channels...|$|R

The tesserae used in Ancient Rome were made of <b>calcareous</b> <b>rocks</b> obtained from local sources of natural stone, with additions of crushed brick, tile and pottery creating coloured shades of, predominantly, black, red, white, blue and yellow [13].
