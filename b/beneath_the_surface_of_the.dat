5|$|The {{bivalves}} are {{a highly}} successful class of invertebrates found in aquatic habitats throughout the world. Most are infaunal and live buried in sediment on the seabed, or in the sediment in freshwater habitats. A large number of bivalve species {{are found in the}} intertidal and sublittoral zones of the oceans. A sandy sea beach may superficially appear to be devoid of life, but often {{a very large number of}} bivalves and other invertebrates are living <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sand. On a large beach in South Wales, careful sampling produced an estimate of 1.44 million cockles (Cerastoderma edule) per acre of beach.|$|E

While some industrialists funded student movements and the opposition parties (DMK and Swatantara party) helped move it politically, it is well observed that agitation was a spontaneous reaction, which directly reflected the anger of the common people, especially the students.|$|E
25|$|The {{primarily}} nocturnal anaconda species tend {{to spend}} most of its life in or around water. Anacondas are also sometimes known as the water boa; they spend more time in water than any of the boas. They seem rather slow and sluggish when traveling on land due to their size, although they have the potential to reach high speeds in the water. They tend to float <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water with their snouts above the surface. When prey passes by or stops to drink, the anaconda will strike (without eating or swallowing it) and coil around it with its body. The snake will then constrict until it has suffocated the prey.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{mountains}} and canyons in the Sierra Nevada are formed in granitic rocks. These rocks, such as granite, diorite and monzonite, formed when molten rock cooled far <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. The molten rock was a by-product of a geologic process known as subduction. Powerful forces in the earth forced the landmass under {{the waters of the}} Pacific Ocean beneath and below an advancing North American Continent. Super-hot water driven from the subjecting ocean floor migrated upward and melted rock as it went. This process took place during the Cretaceous Period, 100 million years ago. Granitic rocks have speckled salt and pepper appearance because they contain various minerals including quartz, feldspars and micas. Valhalla or the Angel Wings are prominent cliffs that rise above the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River.|$|E

Along with the stories in this collection are photographs that I have taken that compliment the stories. I hope to have given the readers entertaining and moving stories and photographs that will leave them thinking about what they???ve seen and read long after they???ve finished.

25|$|People {{also claimed}} that the Indians were not the Mound Builders because the mounds and related {{artifacts}} were older than Indian cultures. Caleb Atwater's misunderstanding of stratigraphy caused him {{to believe that the}} Mound Builders were a much older civilization than the Indians. In his book, Antiquities Discovered in the Western States (1820), Atwater claimed that Indian remains were always found right <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earth. Since the artifacts associated with the Mound Builders were found fairly deep in the ground, Atwater argued that they must be from a different group of people. The discovery of metal artifacts further convinced people that the Mound Builders were not Native Americans. The Indians encountered by the Europeans and Americans were not thought to engage in metallurgy. Some artifacts that were found in relation to the mounds were inscribed with symbols. As the Europeans did not know of any Indian cultures that had a writing system, they assumed a different group had created them.|$|E
25|$|With no {{constitutional}} amendment done, Annadurai declared 26 January 1965, the 15th Republic Day of India {{and also the}} day the Constitution, which in essence enshrined Hindi as the official language of India, came into practice, as a day of mourning. This move was opposed by the then Chief Minister of Madras State, Bhakthavatchalam, as blasphemous. Hence Annadurai, who by then {{had been trying to}} shake off the secessionist image of his party, declared 24 January as a day of mourning. He also replaced the slogan of the protests to Down with Hindi; Long live the Republic. Nevertheless, violence broke out on 26 January, initially in Madurai which within days spread throughout the state. Robert Hardgrave Jr, professor of humanities, government and Asian studies, suggests that the elements contributing to the riots were not instigated by DMK or Leftists or even the industrialists, as the Congress government of the state suggested, but were genuine frustrations and discontentment which lay <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people of the state.|$|E
25|$|Associations with {{species of}} pitcher plants {{are so many}} and varied {{that the study of}} Nepenthes infauna is {{something}} of a discipline in its own right. Camponotus schmitzi, the diving ant, has an intimate degree of mutualism with the pitcher plant Nepenthes bicalcarata; it not only retrieves prey and detritus from <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liquid in the pitchers, but repels herbivores, and cleans the pitcher peristome, maintaining its slippery nature. The ants have been reported to attack struggling prey, hindering their escape, so there might be an element of myrmecotrophy to the relationship. Numerous species of mosquitoes lay their eggs in the liquid, where their larvae play various roles, depending on species; some eat microbes and detritus, as is common among mosquito larvae, whereas some species of Toxorhynchites also breed in pitchers, and their larvae are predators of other species of mosquito larvae. Apart from the crab spiders on pitchers, an actual small, red crab Geosesarma malayanum will enter the fluid, robbing and scavenging, though reputedly it does so at some risk of being captured and digested itself.|$|E

25|$|Thanks to the {{considerable}} {{economies of scale}} Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required absolutely no heavy masonry for supporting walls or foundations, and the relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could {{be left in the}} ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today just <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site). The modules could be erected as quickly as the parts could reach the site - indeed, some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory - and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.|$|E
25|$|For {{display of}} {{extraordinary}} heroism {{in the line}} of his profession above and {{beyond the call of duty}} during the diving operations in connection with the sinking in a depth of water 304 feet, of the U.S.S. F-4 with all on board, as a result of loss of depth control, which occurred off Honolulu, T.H., on 25 March 1915. On 17 April 1915, William F. Loughman, chief gunner's mate, U.S. Navy, who had descended to the wreck and had examined one of the wire hawsers attached to it, upon starting his ascent, and when at a depth of 250 feet <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, had his lifeline and air hose so badly fouled by this hawser that he was unable to free himself; he could neither ascend nor descend. On account of the length of time that Loughman had already been subjected to the great pressure due to the depth of water, and of the uncertainty of the additional time he would have to be subjected to this pressure before he could be brought to the surface, it was imperative that steps be taken at once to clear him. Instantly, realizing the desperate case of his comrade, Crilley volunteered to go to his aid, immediately donned a diving suit and descended. After a lapse of time of 2 hours and 11 minutes, Crilley was brought to the surface, having by a superb exhibition of skill, coolness, endurance and fortitude, untangled the snarl of lines and cleared his imperiled comrade, so that he was brought, still alive, to the surface.|$|E
