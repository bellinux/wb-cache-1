5|$|At its widest aperture, the {{sharpness}} {{does not}} meet the 1800 threshold at either 8mm (1572, f/4.5) or 12mm (1356, f/5), but at 16mm (f/5.6) it achieves over 2000 lines per picture height. However, stopping down improves the sharpness at all focal lengths, according to PC Magazine. At 8mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12mm it is still only at 1509 by f/8. The image quality is asymmetric with better performance on the right side. At 8mm and f/4.5, it has 1 blur unit in the center and 1.5 in the corners. Although the images are slightly sharper at f/5.6, SLR Gear claims sharpness declines significantly at f/11 to almost 2 blur units with further stopping down increasing <b>blur</b> <b>to</b> 3.5 at f/22. At the longer focal lengths for this lens, stopping down to f/29 yields a 5 blur unit result.|$|E

25|$|Mathematically, {{applying}} a Gaussian <b>blur</b> <b>to</b> an image {{is the same}} as convolving the image with a Gaussian function. This is also known as a two-dimensional Weierstrass transform. By contrast, convolving by a circle (i.e., a circular box blur) would more accurately reproduce the bokeh effect. Since the Fourier transform of a Gaussian is another Gaussian, {{applying a}} Gaussian blur has the effect of reducing the image's high-frequency components; a Gaussian blur is thus a low pass filter.|$|E

25|$|High-pass and {{low-pass}} filters {{are also used}} in digital image processing to perform image modifications, enhancements, noise reduction, etc., using designs done in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain. The unsharp masking, or sharpening, operation used in image editing software is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass. A high-pass filter, if the imaging software does not provide one, {{can be achieved by}} duplicating the image, applying a Gaussian <b>blur</b> <b>to</b> the dupe, inverting the colors, and blending the images using a low opacity (say 50%) for the dupe.|$|E
500|$|Romano and Glazer {{compared}} Silent Alarm to U2's early work, while Walters {{claimed that}} it distills [...] "twenty-five years of spiky British rock, from The Cure to <b>Blur</b> <b>to</b> hot Scots Franz Ferdinand". Pitchfork Media's Nitsuh Adebe noted particular similarities between [...] "Banquet" [...] and Franz Ferdinand's second single [...] "Take Me Out", calling both songs [...] "wonderfully tight and energetic—the {{same kind of}} spiffy half-dancing rock". Phares suggested that Bloc Party are more comfortable with lyrical proclamations than their contemporaries Franz Ferdinand or The Futureheads, while Imran Ahmed of NME concluded, [...] "Silent Alarm is no Franz Ferdinand.

500|$|The {{most infamous}} of Gallagher's {{controversial}} statements {{was in a}} 1995 interview with The Observer, where he expressed a wish for Damon Albarn and Alex James of rivals <b>Blur</b> <b>to</b> [...] "catch AIDS and die", a comment which he quickly apologised publicly for, and stated that [...] "AIDS is no laughing matter". This statement was preceded {{by the success of}} (What's the Story) Morning Glory?, which led to a well-documented feud with fellow Britpop band Blur. The differing styles of the bands, coupled with their prominence within the Britpop movement, led the British media to seize upon the rivalry between the bands. Both factions played along, with the Gallaghers taunting Blur at the 1996 BRIT Awards by singing a rendition of [...] "Parklife" [...] when they collected their [...] "Best British Band" [...] award (with Liam changing the lyrics to [...] "Shite-life").|$|E

500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was the next thing I did... everything was such a <b>blur</b> <b>to</b> me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E
500|$|Modern Life Is Rubbish was {{released}} in the United States by Blur's American record label SBK in December 1993—seven months after the album's UK release. This delay was because SBK's alternative-music department had closed down; Blur manager Chris Morrison later quipped, [...] "When I asked [...] why, {{they said it was}} because the girl had left." [...] Despite fears that Modern Lifes overt Englishness would be lost on the American market, SBK insisted on marketing the album to MOR stations and aimed for Top 40 airplay. The label largely ignored Morrison's arguments that Blur's best chance of exposure in America would be to court college radio-stations. SBK's strategy was to list the album at a developing-artist price (around three dollars less than standard), send the band on an intensive tour in 1994 and to target modern rock airplay with debut single [...] "Chemical World". The record company believed this would help expand on the base audience who bought Leisure, and eventually open <b>Blur</b> <b>to</b> Top 40 radio. Further, to lessen the anglocentric feel of the record, SBK added additional songs to the track-listing—including [...] "Popscene". The plan fared rather poorly, as Modern Life barely had any impact in the US; the album didn't chart on the US Billboard 200 and sold only 19,000 copies, a sharp decline compared to the 87,000 units that Leisure shifted.|$|E
2500|$|Parklife is {{the third}} studio album by the English rock band Blur, {{released}} in April 1994 on Food Records. After disappointing sales for their previous album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife returned <b>Blur</b> <b>to</b> prominence in the UK, helped by its four hit singles: [...] "Girls & Boys", [...] "End of a Century", [...] "Parklife" [...] and [...] "To the End".|$|E

60|$|The mode {{of vision}} {{is not one}} and final. The mode of vision is manifold. And the optical image is a mere {{vibrating}} <b>blur</b> <b>to</b> a child--and, indeed, to a passionate adult. In this vibrating blur the soul sees its own true correspondent. It sees, in a cow, horns and squareness, and a long tail. It sees, for a horse, a mane, and a long face, round nose, and four legs. And in each case a darkly vital presence. Now horns and squareness and a long thin ox-tail, these are the fearful and wonderful elements of the cow-form, which the dynamic soul perfectly perceives. The ideal-image is just outside nature, for a child--something false. In a picture, a child wants elemental recognition, and not correctness or expression, or least of all, what we call understanding. The child distorts inevitably and dynamically. But the dynamic abstraction is more than mental. If a huge eye sits {{in the middle of}} the cheek, in a child's drawing, this shows that the deep dynamic consciousness of the eye, its relative exaggeration, is the life-truth, even if it is a scientific falsehood.|$|E

Unlike traditional restoration algorithms that {{operate on a}} <b>blurred</b> image <b>to</b> recover the original, {{the nature of our}} problem requires that the correction be applied to the original image before <b>blurring.</b> <b>To</b> accomplish this, a camera is used to estimate a series of spatially varying point-spread-functions (PSF) across the projector’s image. These discrete PSFs are then used to guide a pre-processing algorithm based on Wiener filtering to condition the image before projection. Results show that using this technique can help ameliorate the visual effects from out-of-focus projector blur. 1...|$|R
