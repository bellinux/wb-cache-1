40|$|Introduction: Both {{pregnancy}} and childbirth are important {{risk factors for}} urinary stress incontinence in women. For its prevention, exercies of the pelvic floor musculature {{have been shown to}} be effective. Guidelines for urinary stress incontinence management recommend offering pelvic floor muscle training to women during their first pregnancy as a preventive measure. Objective: To update the information provided in the scientific literature on urinary stress incontinence during postpartum and possible forms of treat it. Methodology: A systematic bibliographic review was carried out in the following databases: PUBMED, COCHRANE, CINHAL, MEDLINE, SciELO and SCOPUS. The date was restricted to the last 5 years (2012 - 2017), in Spanish, English and Portuguese. Restrictions were made regarding the type of study, and Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) were considered for this review. Results: After reviewing the literature consulted, it is concluded that the training of the pelvic floor musculature <b>is</b> <b>beneficial</b> to <b>prevent</b> the occurrence of urinary stress incontinence during {{pregnancy and}} the postpartum period. Conclusions: The results obtained in this review are consistent with previous studies and bibliographic reviews of the same topic. It follows that training of the pelvic floor muscles <b>is</b> <b>beneficial</b> in <b>preventing</b> the occurrence of urinary stress incontinence during pregnancy or postpartum. ...|$|R
