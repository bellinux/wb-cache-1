40|$|There are {{presently}} no recommended practises, defined by standards, for closing time calculation of <b>Blow</b> <b>Out</b> <b>Preventers</b> (BOPs), when designing BOP control systems. As the closing {{time is a}} safety critical design parameter for BOPs and BOP control systems, this paper proposes a model for calculating this value. A guideline is included in order to recreate an equivalent model, applicable for most BOP control system designs. Models are constructed and compared to an equivalent prototype system, comparing closing times and pressure trends throughout the closing function. The model assumes that the BOP control system has hydraulic pressure supplied from an accumulator bank, where the interfacing BOP is a blind/blind shear ram. The models consider closing operations for both situations of drill pipe (DP) being either present or not in the bore. The modelling is done primarily using simple hydro mechanics and thermal mechanics in conjunction with API 16 D. All data sources, as far as practical, are published and per-reviewed literature. Results from the model are promising for BOP closing times without DP in the bore. Inaccuracies were found when comparing to a BOP with DP present in bore. However the model does require some preliminary information about the BOP {{in order to give}} accurate predictions. In addition the model is not applicable for systems using rotating machinery as pressure source or where there are several independent pressure sources...|$|R
40|$|Global {{increase}} in oil demand and depleting reserves has derived {{a need to}} find new oil resources. To find these untapped reservoirs, oil companies are exploring various remote and harsh locations such as deep waters in Gulf of Mexico, remote arctic regions, unexplored deep deserts, etc. Further, the depth of new oil/gas wells being drilled has increased considerably to tap these new resources. With the {{increase in}} the well depth, the bottomhole temperature and pressure are also increasing to extreme values (i. e. up to 500 F and 35, 000 psi). The density and viscosity of natural gas and crude oil at reservoir conditions are critical fundamental properties required for accurate assessment of the amount of recoverable petroleum within a reservoir and the modeling of the flow of these fluids within the porous media. These properties are also used to design appropriate drilling and production equipment such as <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>preventers,</b> risers, etc. With the present state of art, there is no accurate database for these fluid properties at extreme conditions. As we have begun to expand this experimental database it has become apparent that there are neither equations of state for density or transport models for viscosity {{that can be used to}} predict these fundamental properties of multi-component hydrocarbon mixtures over a wide range of temperature and pressure. Presently, oil companies are using correlations based on lower temperature and pressure databases that exhibit an unsatisfactory predictive capability at extreme conditions (e. g. as great as {+-} 50 %). From the perspective of these oil companies that are committed to safely producing these resources, accurately predicting flow rates, and assuring the integrity of the flow, the absence of an extensive experimental database at extreme conditions and models capable of predicting these properties over an extremely wide range of temperature and pressure (including extreme conditions) makes their task even more daunting...|$|R

Their primary conclusion was that while the rams succeeded in partly shearing through the drill pipe they failed to seal the bore because the drill pipe had buckled out of the intended line of action of the rams (because the drill string was caught at a tool joint in the upper annular BOP valve), jamming the shears and leaving the drill string shear actuator unable to deliver enough force to complete its stroke and fold the cut pipe over and seal the well. They did not suggest any failure of actuation as would be caused by faulty batteries.

As with all deep-dive systems, each chamber on the supervisor’s control panel was represented by a series of valves and gauges. Redundancy in plumbing schemes was common and necessary, and with this particular system, by turning several valves on the console, any one depth gauge could be made to monitor the depth of a chamber other than for which it was normally intended. On chamber one’s panel, there was a 1000‑foot Heise gauge considered to be the most accurate. And because of the cross-referencing capabilities of the system, it became the practice of the shift supervisor to set the valves of this gauge to read the internal depth of the bell prior to the divers leaving bottom, then track their ascent through the lock‑on/transfer procedure. The rationale behind using this particular gauge throughout the operation was to avoid any potential decompression problems that might arise from using two separate gauges with a discrepancy problem. Once the divers had safely passed from the bell to the entrance lock to chamber one, the supervisor was then supposed to turn the valves back to their original positions in order to monitor the depth of the divers.|$|E

40|$|Within {{drilling}} {{of oil and}} gas wells, the Managed Pressure Drilling (MPD) method {{with active}} control of wellbore pressure during drilling has partly evolved from conventional well control procedures. However, for MPD operations the instrumentation is typically more extensive compared to conventional drilling. Despite this, any influx of formation fluids (commonly known as a kick) during MPD operations is typically handled by conventional well control methods, at least if the kick is estimated to be larger than a threshold value. Conventional well control procedures rely on manual control of the <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>preventer,</b> pumps, and choke valves and do not capitalize on the benefits from the instrumentation level associated with MPD. This paper investigates two alternative well control procedures specially adapted to backpressure MPD: the dynamic shut-in (DSI) procedure and the automatic kick control (AKC) procedure. Both methods capitalize on improvements in Pressure While Drilling (PWD) technology. A commercially available PWD tool buffers high-resolution pressure measurements, which can be used in an automated well control procedure. By using backpressure MPD, the choke valve opening is tuned automatically using a feedback-feedforward control method. The two procedures are evaluated using a high fidelity well flow model and cases from a North Sea drilling operation are simulated. The results show that using AKC procedure reduces the time needed to establish control of the well compared to DSI procedure. It also indicates that the AKC procedure reduces the total kick size compared to the DSI procedure, and thereby reduces the risk of lost circulation...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the lay-up {{decision in the}} North Sea offshore rig market from 2010 through march 2017. Using empirical analysis, we have specified a logistic regression model to investigate how rig characteristics, firm size and market variables affect the decision to both cold- and ready-stack a jackup or a semi-submersible rig. We find that that younger jackups with deep water depth owned by companies with multiple rigs in the North Sea, {{are less likely to}} be laid up. In a period with varying market conditions, a higher value of the rig characteristics variable deck load, quarters capacity and <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>preventer</b> (BOP), as well as the specification severe environment, increase the probability of laying up a jackup. For semi-submersibles, we find that younger rigs with a higher value of max water depth and quarters capacity, equipped with self-propulsion, DP- 3 system and classified for severe environment, were less likely to be laid up. While a higher value of variable deck load increased the likelihood of cold-stacking a semi-submersible. The regression results show that a higher day rate and expectations for a higher future oil price strongly decrease the likelihood for both jackups and semi-submersibles being laid up. The thesis supplements the existing literature of the offshore rig market. To our knowledge, no economical investigation regarding the lay-up decision have been carried out on the North Sea offshore rig market. This thesis therefore provides a basis for further research of this market. We hope the findings will be of interest for drilling operators when deciding which rig to send into lay-up. In addition, the findings may be of interest for brokers and banks when evaluating rig companies...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe growing {{need for}} new {{technology}} {{in the pursuit of}} oil is creating new challenges related to well control. Drilling in HPHT (High Pressure High Temperature) reservoirs, arctic areas, and depleted zones might imply that the drilling window between the pore pressure and the fracturing pressure is narrow. This presents challenges in terms of gas influx. As of today kick handling is a manual procedure with the driller in charge. Automation of well control procedures can be the solution to several problems related to kick detection and kick handling. This thesis introduces theory about conventional well control as well as control theory and automated well control. A part of the work was experimental, and was performed at a simplified rig model at the two-phase laboratory at the University of Stavanger. The results are presented in chapter 6. The main focus in the experimental part is on the Command Take-over procedure. Several experiments were performed leading to the main experiment. The main principle of this procedure is that the drilling operation is run in MPD (Managed Pressure Drilling) mode with a PI-controller (Proportional Integral controller) on the MPD valve. When a gas kick occurs, the WCV (Well Control Valve) mode is activated with a PI-controller on the WCV. Further the BOP (<b>Blow</b> <b>Out</b> <b>Preventer)</b> is closed and the kick is circulated out of the well through the WCV. After the circulation, the operation is back to MPD mode, and the operation continues as planned. The results show that the Command Take-Over Procedure is feasible on actual drilling rigs. It is further possible to assume that the procedure is safer, because the procedure is automated, without the dependence of human judgement and ability to make good decisions in well control incidents. However, {{it is important to have}} a drilling crew available on the rig in case of mechanical failure. The procedure is also more efficient and time saving since the pump are constantly running during the procedure, and there might not be a need for a new mud with higher density to regain well control after a gas kick...|$|E
40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{hydrocarbons}} increases, the oil companies are forced to start {{oil and gas exploration}} in complicated and remote fields. When drilling such environment, the requirement for safety, reliability and operational efficiency of down hole tools is vital. An evaluation of different drill pipe convoyed seal plugs is performed with respect to plug features, benefits,operational procedure and limitations. A comparison based on the different plug design and a review of applications for such plugs is made. Design requirements stated in ISO 14310 :Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries, Downhole Equipment, Packers and Bridge Plugs, is presented and related challenges and technology gaps discussed. An investigation of plug failure and reason for failure between January 2009 and March 2010 is carried out. Normally, down hole seal plugs uses an elastomeric sealing element to provide the seal against the casing wall. The plugs are rated to different temperatures and pressures due to the variation {{in the design of the}} elastomeric sealing element. When operating with elastomers, proper material selection is important to construct a wide performance envelop of the seal,making the seal more flexible with respect to working area. A possible new technology for down hole sealing application is metal-to-metal sealing. Metal-to-metal sealing shows superior seal reliability compared conventional a resilient elastomer seal with respect to pressure and temperature rating. This technology may become the new solution to provide a seal with ahigh integrity level in extreme well environments. This technology is new, and does not meet the requirements stated in ISO 14310. V 0 qualication is required for casing plugs acting as a secondary well barrier used by Statoil. The survey of application utilizing drill pipe convoyed seal plugs shows the most common application for casing suspensions plugs is to act as a secondary well barrier and to provide a gas tight seal for temporary abandonment of the wellbore when pulling the <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>preventer</b> and the marine drilling riser. The present plugs used by Statoil shows good reliability and are efficient in use. However,limitations are seen when operating in extreme wells with difficult well trajectories. An improvement in design on plugs to be used in such wells is to make the plug able to be set and retrieved without rotation, making control of the applied forces on the plug more easily. The investigation of plug failure shows a decrease in failure trend after the implementation of ISO 14310 in 2005. In the time period investigated, a total of 350 plug runs where performed with a recorded failure rate of 9 %. The main reason of failure in this period is pressure test failure of the plug, making up 57 % of the reason of failure. Before the ISO 14310 become operative the main area of failure was when latching on the running/retrieving tool to the plug. </p...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. With the depleting reservoirs on land and increasing demand for hydrocarbons, the exploration for reservoirs has been moving to deeper and deeper water. The current technology has reached its limit in water depth, and new technology needs to be introduced if exploration is to be continued into even deeper water. One proposed method is subsea mudlift drilling (SMD), which is a joint industry project. The method uses a seafloor pump, which pumps the mud from the annulus at seafloor, through a separate small diameter pipe, such as the choke and kill line, to the rig floor. Because of the expected problems with u-tubing, a drillstring valve (DSV) has been developed to be installed in the drillstring. With new drilling technology comes new well control procedures. The toolkit is a well control tool that is used for almost any well control situation that may arise. The purpose of the research at hand was to develop and present a toolkit for subsea mudlift drilling on the basis of conventional toolkits. The DSV had not previously been modeled, and its response to changes in mudweight, flowrate, water depth etc. has been unknown to this point in time. The toolkit includes a model for the DSV, which can generate plots of pressure drop over the DSV for any changes. The results were examined for several cases, and the pressure response and characteristics of the DSV were mapped. The optimum location for the DSV in the drillpipe also was investigated. It was found that if the DSV were located just above the <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>preventer</b> (BOP), the pressure differential over the DSV would be maximized. Maximizing the pressure difference over and under the flowcone on the DSV will result in a larger opening in the DSV, and thus less pressure will be lost through the DSV choke. If logging tools are to be run in the drillstring, the DSV must be placed {{in the bottom of the}} drillstring, near the bit. It is also recommended that all measurement while drilling (MWD) tools be installed between the bit and the DSV, as this will also increase the pressure differential over the DSV flowcone. During conventional drilling a straight-line approximation is often used to predict the drillpipe pressure-decline schedule. This research also established that for low flowrates, with no geometric well deviation, such a method might also be used for SMD. However, using a well control method as that is tailored for subsea mudlift drilling, the flowrate will be relatively high and the straight-line approximation will not be valid. In the case of high flowrates and a deviated well, the drillpipe pressure-decline schedule should always be calculated using the toolkit...|$|E

40|$|A concept {{review of}} {{concentric}} coiled tubing drilling (CTD) system is performed in this Master thesis, hereafter named DualCTD. The main {{purpose is to}} investigate and present the advantages, limitations and applications for the DualCTD system. A feasibility study {{has been carried out}} for subsea drilling of drainage holes from an existing well, and drilling of subsea production wells in the Barents Sea. The DualCTD system consists of two concentric coiled tubing (CT) strings that form a separate circulation system for the drilling fluid. Drilling fluid is pumped down the annulus between the two CT strings to the bottom hole assembly (BHA) where a mud motor generates rotation of the drill bit. The drilling fluid cleans the bit for cuttings and transports the cuttings through a circulating sub/dual float valve and into the inner string. This separated circulating system provides effective hole cleaning {{from the bottom of the}} well. The drilling fluid can be a light fluid, that is optimized for hole cleaning capabilities. A secondary annulus, formed between the DualCTD string and the borehole, is filled with a barrier fluid (BF). Viscous BF is used to separate the two fluid systems in the secondary annulus. Placing the BF in the secondary annuls below seafloor results in an optimized stabilized hydrostatic head. The BF can also be optimized for formation preserving properties. A choke valve in the return fluid line is used to control the back pressure and match the downhole pressure for the two fluid systems with the formation pressure. A light drilling fluid and a heavy BF will also increase the buoyancy of the DualCTD string. Buckling calculations conducted show that longer horizontal sections could be drilled due to increased buckling resistance and reduced friction drag for the buoyant DualCTD string. Horizontal sections of up to 2300 m can be drilled with a 3, 5 x 2, 375 DualCTD setup with a 6 bit for vertical kick-off points of 2000 m and deeper. This is more than three times as long as for conventional CTD. A hydraulic model for calculating the pressure loss in the circulating system is developed. Burst and collapse pressure was found to be limiting for the maximum flow rate due to high frictional pressure loss in the circulation system in deep wells. Cutting transport capacity of the circulation system was found to be low due to the low acceptable flow rates. Cutting transport capacity will therefore limit the maximum rate of penetration. The DualCTD system will also make it possible to drill through challenging pressure regimes, depleted reservoirs and problematic zones with its unique potential for managed pressure drilling. Well control approach for the DualCTD concept will be much of the same as in underbalanced-/managed pressure CTD operations The DualCTD <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> <b>preventer</b> needs to be verified for cutting of the DualCTD string. Running of casing and cementing operations may have to be performed on drill string due to the large weight of the casing and the low axial load capacity of the DualCTD string.

40|$|Material fatigue is {{a failure}} mode that {{has been known to}} {{researchers}} and engineers since the 19 th century. Catastrophic accidents have happened due to fatigue failures of structures, machinery and transport vehicles. The capsizing of the semisubmersible rig Alexander L. Kielland in Norwegians waters in 1980 killed 123 people, and investigations pointed at the fatigue failure of a weld as one of the direct causes. This accident led to a number of improvements to the design of offshore structures. The noticeable safety principle ”No single accident should lead to escalating consequences” has since been adopted in a widespread manner. Since 1992 the Petroleum Safety Authority in Norway has enforced a risk based safety regime. Wells are designed to hold back reservoir pressures and avoid uncontrolled escape of hydrocarbons. In other words a well is a pressure containing vessel. Norwegian safety regulations require a dual barrier construction of wells. This safety principle ensures that one “barrier” is preventing an escalating situation should the other barrier fail. A wellhead is a heavy walled pressure vessel placed {{at the top of the}} well. The wellhead is part of the second well barrier envelope during drilling. The subsea wellheads are located at sea bottom and during subsea drilling the <b>Blow</b> <b>Out</b> <b>Preventer</b> (BOP) is placed on top of the subsea wellhead. The drilling riser is the connection between the BOP and the floating drilling unit. Waves and current forces acting on the drilling riser and drilling unit will cause dynamic movement. Flexible joints at top and bottom of the drilling riser protects the drilling riser from localised bending moments. The subsea wellhead is both a pressure vessel and a structurally load bearing component resisting external loads transmitted from a connected riser. These external loads can be static and cyclic combinations of bending and tension (compression). Cyclic loads will cause fatigue damage to the well. The well can take a certain amount of fatigue damage without failing. A fatigue failure of a WH system may have serious consequences. Should the WH structurally fail its pressure vessel function will be lost and for this reason WH fatigue is a potential threat to well integrity. The structural load bearing function will also be affected. Wellhead fatigue analysis can be used as a tool to estimate the accumulated fatigue damage. Analysis results then compares to a safe fatigue limit. This thesis addresses selected aspects of fatigue damage estimations of subsea wellheads and surface casings. The presented work is a contribution to the fatigue analysis methodology currently being developed within the industry. The well cement role as a boundary condition for surface casings in analytical models is particularly addressed. The majority of research focuses on the casing shoe and formation sealing, which is the primary objective of well cementing. Recent research focus on the cement limits conditions e. g. elevated temperatures. The “near-seabed” conditions of lead cements have seen less scrutiny. Some researchers have shown interest in this issue related to deep water cementing. Deep water bottom temperature is low all year round regardless of location latitude. Low sea water temperatures will depress the normal thermal gradient of the upper parts of the soil. Subsea wells are typically cemented using a lead and tail cement system, and the lead top casing cement will be pumped all the way to seabed. This lead cement will then be left curing in a low temperature environment. Hydration of cement is an exothermic chemical reaction, and the reaction rate is dependent on temperature. Laboratory measurements of low temperature early compressive strength of typical lead cement slurries are presented herein. In the North Sea the duration between placement of surface casing lead cement and installation of BOP/drilling riser will typical be around 24 hrs. Then dynamic riser loads will start acting on the upper part of a subsea well. Bending of the well causes relative motions between the conductor and surface casing. The cement around these casings will experience these relative motions. The combination of delayed cement setting due to low temperature and surface casing motions will cause localized failure of cement bonding in the upper part of the well. In subsea wellhead fatigue analysis finite element models are used. Boundary conditions in analytical models are important in ensuring similar behaviour of model and reality. One boundary condition in wellhead models is the lateral cement support of the surface casing. Modelling this cement support as infinitely stiff with a discrete vertical transition is the existing solution. In this work a modified boundary condition is presented based on low curing temperatures in combination with “premature” loading of the supporting cement. An overall analysis methodology approach has been suggested. Using a detailed local model of the well to define the lower boundary condition for the global riser load analytical model is one of its features. The implementation of a modified cement boundary condition will change the global stiffness of the local well model. The possible effect on global riser load from variations to the lower boundary condition has been studied. The conclusion supports the suggested analysis approach. Overall well ultimate structural strength will be reduced by the presence of a fatigue crack in a non pressurised load bearing part of a subsea well. An analysis methodology with case results are presented and indicate that the location of a fatigue crack affects the reduction in ultimate strength. Cases of significant reduction are expected to impact normal operating limitations. To be able to include the wellhead fatigue failure mode in an overall risk management system, the failure probability needs to be estimated. This can be done by applying a structural reliability analysis methodology to the problem. A suggested structural analysis methodology approach is suggested and notational failure probabilities are presented. Future improvements to wellhead fatigue analysis may emerge from calibrations from measurements of the reality. A comparison between analytical fatigue loading and measured fatigue loading has been presented and results indicate that the analysis results are conservative. This is evidence that analytical estimate on acceptable fatigue limits can be trusted from a safety point of view. It also indicates the monetary potential that measurements can present to the well...|$|E
