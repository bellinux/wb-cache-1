50|$|In 1907 the {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} new domed boilers, replacing the domeless versions originally fitted. This increased their weight by 3 tons which improved their adhesion factor. Power reversing gear was fitted in 1922, making them {{the first class}} in New South Wales to be so fitted. It was a hydraulic type and was excellent when shunting at Sydney station, however this was only short lived and Johnson <b>bar</b> <b>lever</b> reversing gear was fitted shortly after.|$|E
50|$|Edward Thorndike did {{research}} in this area and developed the law of effect, where associations between a stimulus and response are affected by the consequence of the response. For example, behaviors increase in strength and/or frequency when they have been followed by reward. This occurs because of an association between the behavior and a mental representation of the reward (such as food). Conversely, receiving a negative consequence lowers the frequency of the behavior due to the negative association. An example of this would be a rat in a cage with a <b>bar</b> <b>lever.</b> If pressing the lever results in a food pellet, the rat will learn to press the lever to receive food. If pressing the lever resulted in an electric shock {{on the floor of the}} cage, the rat would learn to avoid pressing the lever.|$|E

50|$|The {{other common}} lever/grip size {{is used for}} {{mountain}} and city handlebars, including flat bars, riser bars, some porteur bars, etc. On these <b>bars</b> the <b>lever</b> and grip areas have a 22.2 mm diameter. Hence, thumb shift levers, grip type shifters, MTB brake levers and Rapidfire type shifters will only fit on this smaller diameter - none could fit on a road or cyclocross bar.|$|R
50|$|A torque {{multiplier}} {{is generally}} used {{when there are}} space limitations that disallow the use of long handles. They are also used as a safer alternative to a cheater <b>bar</b> as <b>lever</b> length and operator effort are both reduced. Finally, torque multipliers allow for more accurate torque. By {{reducing the amount of}} effort needed to tighten, a torque multiplier allows for slow and smooth application, ensuring more accurate torque levels.|$|R
5000|$|To {{inspect the}} engine, {{it can be}} {{manually}} [...] "barred over" [...] with a lever, but manual engine rotation is slow and inefficient. In some applications manually barring the engine over can be difficult or impossible. The preferred tool for engine rotation is an electrically powered, hydraulically operated [...] "turning jack". The turning jack uses a hydraulic cylinder and ram assembly that automatically advances to engage {{a hole in the}} flywheel. When the ram reaches its limit, it automatically retracts and advances again to engage another hole. The engine is then progressively rotated through its cycle and can be rotated in either direction by installing the jack {{on either side of the}} engine. Not only is a turning jack faster and more efficient, it is also safer since there is no risk of a <b>barring</b> <b>lever</b> coming loose and causing injury or damage. Also, with a turning jack, there is no need for the mechanic to be in physical contact with the engine at any point during the inspection process.|$|R
50|$|A lever {{is modeled}} as a rigid bar {{connected}} to a ground frame by a hinged joint called a fulcrum. The lever is operated by applying an input force FA at a point A located by the coordinate vector rA on the <b>bar.</b> The <b>lever</b> then exerts an output force FB at the point B located by rB. The rotation of the lever about the fulcrum P {{is defined by the}} rotation angle θ.|$|R

40|$|Control {{engineering}} {{had been}} the core of all engineering fields all the time. As the name depicts, control of different parameters of various industrial or commercial equipment like plants, vehicles, aircrafts and etc is obtained. Robust and optimal control of these equipments plays a vital role. This paper presents a design of H 2 and H ∞ control for a Twin Rotor System (TRS). TRS is a multi input multi output (MIMO) nonlinear system. The main objective is to control the angular position of the <b>lever</b> <b>bar</b> of TRS. It is having strong coupling between inputs and outputs. The model is first linearized and then controllers are designed to control the positions of <b>lever</b> <b>bar.</b> Simulations are made in MAT - LAB/SIMULINK.

5000|$|Travelers {{heading west}} in 1848 and later, crossed Forty Mile Desert, then {{followed}} the trail blazed by the Mormons in 1848 up the Carson River valley {{from what is}} now Fallon, Nevada, in 1850 the town was called [...] "Ragtown". Then, {{to get over the}} Carson Range, it was a very rough road through Carson River Canyon where the wagons had to be wrestled over the boulders by ropes, pry <b>bars,</b> <b>levers</b> and a few improvised bridges before the wagon trains finally entered beautiful 7100 ft Hope Valley. Westward travelers from Hope Valley had to climb a steep, rocky and tortuous path over the back wall of a glacier carved cirque to reach Carson Pass. The section of trail at the end of Hope Valley near Red Lake is called [...] "The Devil's Ladder" [...] where the trail has to climb over 700 ft of very steep mountain in the final half mile (1 km). Today, a hiker's careful eye can still find notches, grooves and rust marks left by iron rimmed wagon wheels. Nearby, trees scarred by ropes, chains and pulleys used to haul the heavy wagons up the precipitous slope, can be seen. Travelers could get {{to the top of the}} pass in about one day of hard work, an acceptable trade-off for many emigrants. The trail crossed the Sierra Crest through 8574 ft Carson Pass.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{behaviour}} of Musicodamon atlanteus differs markedly {{from that}} of most other amblypygid species. First, this species has modified fighting behaviour. The fighting prelude with the “fencing posture ” of other species has become the final fight during which opponents tap and beat {{at each other with}} their third legs. Further, Musicodamon has greatly reduced its mating behaviour. The spermatophore clearly shows similarities to those of Phrynichus and Trichodamon. Finally, its female genitalia resemble those of Trichodamon and, in particular, Damon uncinatus. This raises the possibility that complex spermatophores with <b>bars</b> and <b>levers</b> like those of the Phrynichinae are plesiomorphic within the Phrynichinae; they are apomorphic for the genera Damon, Musicoda-mon, Trichodamon, Phrynichus, and Euphrynichus. The spermatophores of most Damon species with their large sperm masses and simple mechanism are probably simplified and apomorphic. Key words. Reproductive biology, amblypygid taxonomy. 1...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{main feature}} of a vision mixer is the {{transition}} lever, also called a T-bar or Fader <b>Bar.</b> This <b>lever,</b> similar to an audio fader, {{is used to}} transition between two buses. Note that in a flip-flop mixer, {{the position of the}} main transition lever does not indicate which bus is active, since the program bus is always the active or hot bus. Instead of moving the lever by hand, a button (commonly labeled [...] "mix", [...] "auto" [...] or [...] "auto trans") can be used, which performs the transition over a user-defined period of time. Another button, usually labeled [...] "cut" [...] or [...] "take", swaps the preview signal to the program signal instantaneously. The type of transition used can be selected in the transition section. Common transitions include dissolves (similar to an audio cross fade) and pattern wipes.|$|R
5000|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 28 was {{a machine that}} would run at 100 words-per-minute with less maintenance than that required by a contemporary teletypewriter running at 60 words-per-minute. Additional design criteria included the requirements to run quieter and be lighter than previous teleprinters. The Model 28 equipment was also designed to successfully operate in {{a wider range of}} temperatures and operate in moving vehicles. [...] The Model 28 equipment adjustments are made by turning screws and not by bending metal <b>bars</b> and <b>levers</b> as is done in the later Model 32 and Model 33 series of teleprinters. The Model 28 printing unit frame is lighter due to the use of stamped sheet metal instead of cast iron. The Model 28 ASR allowed the user to operate the keyboard to punch tape while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing an incoming message.|$|R
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{standard}} is a 31.8 mm (1.25") clamp for both MTB and road bars. This is rapidly taking {{over from the}} previous mix of sizes, although other accessories such as some light or computer brackets may {{also need to be}} oversized to fit the thicker <b>bars.</b> Standard brake <b>levers</b> can be used as it is only the stem clamp central section that is oversized. Shims are available to fit a 31.8 mm stem to either a 25.4 mm or 26.0 mm bar, so many new models of stems are oversize-only.|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{operation}} of the swing span was adapted in 1974. Previous to that time the bridge was manually operated by lifting a steel plate in {{the deck of the}} bridge and inserting a ten-foot <b>bar</b> into a <b>lever.</b> The operator would walk in a clockwise circle to open the span for marine traffic and then reverse the operation to close. The bridge still has this manual capacity. Remarkably a single-armed gentleman operated the bridge in this fashion until the age of 71, retiring when the electrical motor was installed.|$|R
50|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 33 was {{a machine that}} would fit into a small office space, match with other office equipment {{of the time and}} operate up to two hours per day on average. Since this machine was designed for light duty use, adjustments that Teletype made in previous teleprinters by turning screws were made by bending metal <b>bars</b> and <b>levers.</b> Many Model 33 parts were not heat treated and hardened. However, the base was die cast, but self-tapping screws were used, along with parts that snapped together without bolting. In another cost saving measure, the paper tape equipment was dependent on the keyboard and page printer mechanisms. Earlier Teletype machine designs, such as the Model 28 ASR, allowed the user to operate the keyboard to punch tape while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing something else. Independent use of the paper tape punch and reader is not possible with the Model 33 ASR.|$|R

50|$|Thorndike {{emphasized}} the importance of the situation in eliciting a response; the cat would not go about making the lever-pressing movement if it was not in the puzzle box but was merely in a place where the response had never been reinforced. The situation involves not just the cat's location but also the stimuli it is exposed to, for example, the hunger and the desire for freedom. The cat recognizes the inside of the box, the <b>bars,</b> and the <b>lever</b> and remembers what it needs to do to produce the correct response.

40|$|Optical {{rigidity}} {{will play}} an important role in future generations of gravitational wave (GW) interferometers which employ high laser power in order to reach and exceed the standard quantum limit. Several experiments have demonstrated the optical spring effect for very low weight mirror masses. In this paper we extend this to a mass and frequency regime more directly applicable to GW detectors. Using a end mirror mass we demonstrate an optical spring resonant at and a stiffness of 9. 4 × 105 N m− 1.

60|$|The {{mechanism}} {{it certainly}} was that held my attention first. It {{was one of those}} complicated fabrics that have since been called handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an enormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first, it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs, and with an extraordinary number of jointed <b>levers,</b> <b>bars,</b> and reaching and clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently strengthened the walls of the cylinder. These, as it extracted them, were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it.|$|R
50|$|The {{detachable}} barrel {{is locked}} in place with a dowel at the receiver and a nut at the magazine tube. The barrel and chamber are chrome-coated for increased durability and corrosion protection. The chamber is sealed by rotating the sealing wedge, which locks into the port in the shank of the barrel. Its trigger mechanism is located on a detachable mounting plate. Cartridges are fed from a tubular magazine under the barrel, and shells are ejected {{from the side of}} the receiver. The forearm is located on the magazine, and is connected to the slide frame by two action <b>bars.</b> A blocking <b>lever</b> blocks the forearm when the hammer is cocked. A cross-bolt trigger safety prevents an accidental pull of the trigger from firing the gun.|$|R
50|$|The Focus RS was {{available}} in one metallic colour, Imperial Blue. The body looked similar to the standard Focus or to the ST170, although the RS featured unique front and rear bumper assemblies required for the wider wheel arches which accommodated the 65 mm wider front track. Internally, the theme is blue and black with sections of blue leather trim on the door trim panels, {{the steering wheel and}} the Sparco seats which were trimmed in blue/black leather and Alcantara. A green starter button starts the engine. The instruments have a blue background and in place of the coolant temperature gauge, the RS was equipped with a boost pressure indicator (up to 1.5 <b>bar).</b> The gear <b>lever</b> knob, handbrake lever, and pedals were all custom made by Sparco.|$|R
50|$|This tool {{is used by}} {{businesses}} that need to open a large volume of wine efficiently and without waste or breakage. It is a large brass tubular device, fixed at a 45° angle to the <b>bar,</b> with a <b>lever</b> pivoted halfway and extending towards the user. The bottle's neck is inserted firmly in the lower aperture of the tube and the lever pulled down firmly and steadily to the bottom. This drives a corkscrew into the cork at a regular depth each time. When the lever is returned to its original position it extracts the cork. When the bottle is removed pull the lever to expose the cork at the bottom, it loosens the cork and returns the lever firmly to its starting position, whereupon the cork will then fall out.|$|R
50|$|Foot pedals can be raised, {{relocated}} (for instance swapped {{to be used}} by {{the opposite}} leg) or replaced with hand-controlled devices. The common form of hand controls consists of a push-pull handle mounted below and projecting {{to the side of the}} steering wheel housing. The <b>bar</b> connects by <b>levers</b> to the accelerator and brake pedals, and is typically pivoted so that pushing applies the accelerator while pulling applies the brake. As there is no facility to work a clutch pedal, hand controls must generally be used in cars with automatic transmissions. With one hand continuously engaged working the hand controls, the steering wheel will generally also be fitted with a steering knob to allow one-handed use. More complex fittings may also connect into the electronic circuitry of the vehicle to place indicator and other switches in easy reach of the driver without requiring them to release the hand controls or steering knob. A guard plate may be fitted to prevent inadvertent contact between the driver's feet and the pedals. Extension levers or adapted grips may also be fitted to the parking brake to allow it to be applied by a driver with limited hand or arm strength.|$|R
