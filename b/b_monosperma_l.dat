The result showed that the methanol and ethyl acetate extract of the seeds of A. concinna and the ethyl acetate extract of the leaves of A. concinna were the most effective among all the extracts causing 100 % larval mortality even with least concentration (0. 25 %).

30|$|Cyanobacteria are {{primitive}} photosynthetic bacteria, {{which are}} considered as {{an excellent source}} of pigments, vitamins, polysaccharides, proteins, pharmaceuticals, and other biologically active compounds [15 - 17]. However, there are certain cyanobacteria that are responsible for the production of algal blooms. Algal blooms cause depletion of dissolved oxygen in water leading to anoxia and subsequently death of fishes. These cyanobacteria also produce various toxins (microcystin, saxitoxin, etc.) which are extremely toxic to mammals including humans [18, 19]. Therefore, there is urgent need to identify chemicals and metabolites which inhibit algal bloom formation [18]. Recent studies have demonstrated that silver nanoparticles can inhibit bloom formation by the toxin-producing cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa [19].

The n-butanol extracts (150 mg/kg) decreased the ACF formation (per rat) by 92 % and 78 % in short- and long-term in vivo treatments, respectively. All the compounds in the n-butanol extract were isolated and purified using column and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).
