5000|$|In ancient Jain thought, living <b>beings</b> have {{souls and}} exist in myriad of realms, {{and within the}} earth realm shared by human <b>beings,</b> {{there are two kinds}} of beings: mobile and immobile. The mobile <b>beings</b> - which {{includes}} tiny insects, birds, aquatic life, animals and human <b>beings</b> - have two or more senses, while the immobile <b>beings</b> have only a single sense (ekenderiya). Among the single sense <b>beings</b> are plant <b>beings,</b> air <b>beings</b> (whirlwind), earth <b>beings</b> (clay), water <b>beings</b> (dew drop) and fire <b>beings</b> (burning coal, meteor, lightning). The last class of <b>beings</b> are Agni-bodies, and these are believed to contain soul and fire-bodied <b>beings.</b> Ahimsa, or non-violence, is the highest precept in Jainism. In their spiritual pursuits, Jain monks go to great lengths to practice Ahimsa; they neither start Agni nor extinguish Agni because doing so is considered violent to [...] "fire beings" [...] and an act that creates harmful Karma.|$|R
25|$|The {{whole world}} {{is said to be}} filled with living <b>beings.</b> In all the three parts, there is the {{existence}} of very small living <b>beings</b> called nigoda. Nigoda are of two types: nitya-nigoda and Itara-nigoda. Nitya-nigoda are those which will reborn as nigoda throughout eternity where as Itara-nigoda will be reborn as other <b>beings</b> too. The mobile region of universe (Trasandi) is one Rajju wide, one Rajju broad and fourteen Rajju high. Within this, there are animals and plants everywhere where as Human <b>beings</b> are restricted to 2.5 continents of middle world. The <b>beings</b> inhabiting lower world are called Naraki (Hellish <b>beings).</b> Deva (roughly demi-gods) live in whole of the top and middle world and top three realms of lower world. Living <b>beings</b> are divided in fourteen classes (Jivasthana) : 1. fine <b>beings</b> with one sense. 2. Crude <b>beings</b> with one sense. 3. <b>beings</b> with two sense. 4. <b>beings</b> with three sense. 5. <b>Beings</b> with four sense. 6. <b>beings</b> with five sense without mind. 7. <b>beings</b> with five sense with a mind. These can be under-developed or developed which makes it a total of fourteen. Human <b>beings</b> get any form of existence and are the only ones which can attain salvation.|$|R

5|$|A.J. Styles {{went on to}} Destination X {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship in an Ultimate X Challenge match. An Ultimate X Challenge match has three stages.

Then it becomes a standard match involving three people, with the one <b>being</b> pinned in that phase <b>being</b> eliminated from the match. The final two then fight to climb the ropes and retrieve the championship that hangs in the middle. The participants were announced for the match on the March 11 episode of Impact!, with Elix Skipper and Ron Killings <b>being</b> added to face Styles.

50|$|Getz (2004: p. 760) {{provides}} a generalist Western Buddhist encyclopedic definition:Sentient <b>beings</b> {{is a term}} used to designate the totality of living, conscious <b>beings</b> that constitute the object and audience of Buddhist teaching. Translating various Sanskrit terms (jantu, bahu jana, jagat, sattva), sentient <b>beings</b> conventionally refers to the mass of living things subject to illusion, suffering, and rebirth (Saṃsāra). Less frequently, sentient <b>beings</b> as a class broadly encompasses all <b>beings</b> possessing consciousness, including Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.|$|R
50|$|The term deva {{refers to}} a class of <b>beings</b> or a path of the six paths of the {{incarnation}} cycle.

The lowest classes of these <b>beings</b> are closer in their nature to human <b>beings</b> than to the higher classes of deva. Devas can be degraded to humans or the <b>beings</b> in the three evil paths once they have consumed their merits.|$|R
5000|$|For Zubiri {{there is}} no need for a realist/anti-realist {{discussion}} on if there is or not a reality that is external and independent to human <b>beings,</b> or if reality is a bulk of internal illusions to human <b>beings.</b> It is both, but not in the sense critical realism pretends (where human <b>beings</b> are seen as a reality that can be separated from an objective outer reality). For Zubiri, human <b>beings</b> are imbedded in reality and cannot exist without it. They need air, food, water and other <b>beings.</b> The [...] "outer" [...] and objective world must also come inside human <b>beings</b> for them to continue existing. Sentient intelligence should be able to make sense of this existence in a way that allows human <b>beings</b> to realise their capabilities in the world.|$|R

40|$|At {{the end of}} 1975, Shuihudi Qinmu Bamboo-scripts 睡虎地秦墓竹簡 were unearthed, half {{of which}} were "Rishu 日書". Recent study has {{revealed}} that inscriptions on the "Rishu" are descriptions of various methods for divination, purification and prayer. Many parts od the "Rishu" deal with methods to select auspicious days (see Liu Lexian 劉楽賢, Shuihudi Qinjian Rishu yanjiu 睡虎地秦簡日書研究, Taibei: Wenjin Press, 1994). This paper explores the relationship between living humans and spiritual <b>beings</b> and classifies the spiritual <b>beings</b> by examining descriptions of their deification and taboo days inscribed on the "Rishu". According to the "Rishu", some spiritual <b>beings</b> become deified while others do not. Furthermore, "taboo days" are associated with some spiritual <b>beings</b> but not with others. There are auspicious days and inauspicious days for deifying spiritual <b>beings.</b> The inauspicious days are included among "taboo days". Spiritual <b>beings</b> that are deified are closely associated with people. For example, the sprits of one's father and mother (ancestral spirits) and of Wusi 五祀 are deified. If spiritual <b>beings</b> are deified on an auspicious day, a positive outcome will be gained; however, if they are deified on an inauspicious days, curses will result. Various taboos are associated with spiritual <b>beings</b> that are not deified. Those <b>beings</b> included Di 帝, Shen 神, and Shensha 神煞(star-spirits), {{all of whom are}} high-ranking deities. People can do nothing but observe the taboo days. If people do not respect the taboos, they will suffer curses. There is no way to avoid the curses. There are some spiritual <b>beings</b> that are neither deified nor associated with taboos (e. g., Cigui 刺鬼 and Guqiugui 故丘鬼, which are inscribed on the "Jie" 詰 Chapter). Such spiritual <b>beings</b> bring curses whether or not the taboos are respected. It is thought that these curses can be avoided, and people can stave off the spiritual <b>beings</b> in various ways. The standing of the these spiritual <b>beings</b> is relatively low. In light of the above, the author classifies the spiritual <b>beings</b> inscribed on the "Rishu" into three kinds: 1. Spiritual <b>beings</b> that are closely associated with people, such as ancestral spirits(father and mother), Wusi (Shizhong 室中, Hu 戸, Men 門, Xing 行, Zao 竃) and occupation deities (Shixian 史先, Wuxian 巫咸, Nongyeshen 農業神, Nüwa 女媧). 2. High-ranking spiritual <b>beings,</b> such as supreme gods(Di and Shen) and Shensha (e. g., Tianli 天李, Sui 歳 and others). 3. Other spiritual <b>beings</b> inscribed on the "Jie" Chapter or elsewhere...|$|R
