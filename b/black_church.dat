5|$|Brașov and its surroundings, {{including}} the city's <b>Black</b> <b>Church,</b> were severely affected. According to local chronicles, {{in the village}} of Bod, more than 50 houses and several churches were damaged or destroyed.

5|$|During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian {{was home}} to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a {{community}} center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans {{in the area to}} prepare to regain their constitutional franchise, after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a <b>black</b> <b>church</b> that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam.|$|E
50|$|Speller, {{following}} {{the research of}} Nelson and Nelson in the 1970s, notes how each of the above three models placed <b>black</b> <b>churches</b> within a reactive rather than a proactive mode. Finding that problematic, and unsatisfied that previous interpretive models accurately depicted <b>black</b> <b>churches</b> {{that emerged in the}} 1960s, Nelson and Nelson developed a fourth model, The Ethnic Community-prophetic Model. <b>Black</b> <b>churches</b> that have been categorized as such are those that have been marked by blacks who spoke out and undertook activism against economic and political injustices from a heightened awareness of black pride and power.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the first}} groups of Black Hebrews, the Church of God and Saints of Christ, was founded in Kansas in 1896, but it {{retained}} elements of a messianic connection to Jesus. During the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established, {{and some of them}} had no connection to Christianity. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an immigrant from Saint Kitts, founded a Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the Commandment Keepers of the Living God. Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure {{similar to that of the}} <b>Black</b> <b>church.</b> He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to Brooklyn, where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{official}} retirement as {{the flag of}} South Africa, the flag was adopted by some white South Africans as being a symbol of Afrikaner heritage and history. Many South Africans still {{view it as a}} symbol of apartheid, and therefore strongly discouraged its use. Despite the negative associations, it was never banned by the Government of South Africa post-1994 and the right to display it in South Africa is protected under Chapter Two of the Constitution of South Africa as an expression of free speech. In the 21st century, usage of the old South African flag experienced a revival of display as a symbol by white supremacists worldwide. A particular awareness of this followed the shooting at a Charleston, South Carolina <b>black</b> <b>church</b> in 2015, as the suspect Dylann Roof had previously been pictured wearing a jacket with the flag and the flag of Rhodesia on it. This association with apartheid and racism often led to calls for the flags that were used in a historical context, to be removed from display. An example of this is Cooma, Australia, where it is flown to commemorate South African workers in the Snowy Mountains Scheme alongside the Canadian Red Ensign and other flags from 1956 when the scheme was created.|$|E
