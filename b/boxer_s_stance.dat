These studies were performed in part to unravel details of the previously observed isolated rupture of dye-labeled PC vesicles on glass (Johnson, J. M.; Ha, T.; Chu, S.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Biophys. J. 2002, 83, 3371 - 3379), specifically to differentiate partial rupture, that is, pore formation and leakage of entrapped dye, from full rupture to form bilayer disks. In addition, the adhesion potential of PC vesicles on glass was calculated based upon the adhesion-driven flattening of adsorbed vesicles and a newly developed theoretical model. The vesicles were found to flatten considerably upon adsorption to glass (width-to-height ratio of approximately 5), which leads to an estimate for the adhesion potential and for the critical rupture radius of 1. 5 × 10 - 4 J/m 2 and 250 nm, respectively. Independent of vesicle size and loading with dye molecules, the adsorption of intact vesicles was observed at all concentrations below a threshold concentration, above which the formation of smooth lipid bilayers occurred. In conjunction with previous work (Johnson, J. M.; Ha, T.; Chu, S.; <b>Boxer,</b> <b>S.</b> G. Biophys.

40|$|The {{absorption}} and Stark effect {{spectra of}} the 1250 nm hand {{associated with the}} oxidized special pair (P+) in Rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centers have been measured. The absorption spectrum in the 1000 - 1450 nm region is essentially identical whether P+ is generated by chemical oxidation or continuous illumination. The Stark effect on the 1250 nm band of P+ is relatively small compared to the Stark effect seen for the Qv transition of P. A quantitative analysis indicates that the change in dipole moment for the 1250 nm band is very small. These results are compared with data for two model systems: a lanthanide-bridged porphyrin dimer, Eu(OEP) 2, and a mixed valence coordination complex, the Creutz-Taube ion.

Laws essentially prohibit pro forma financial reporting and regulate the selective flow of futuristic information to financial analysts.

Here we report that the fluorescence anisotropy of YFP 10 C depends on protein concentration in the low micromolar range that was not expected. We propose that the negative anisotropy is a result of unidirectional Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a dimer of YFP, with the donor chromophore in the neutral form and the acceptor chromophore in the anionic form. This unusual mechanism is supported by studies of a monomeric YFP (A 206 K YFP) and transient-absorption spectroscopy of YFP 10 C.

The anisotropy and rate constant of this energy transfer are consistent with values produced by an analysis of the dimer structure observed in crystals. 1372...|$|R
40|$|Scholars {{have argued}} that the lack of {{international}} copyright frustrated the development of authorship in nineteenth-century America, but I argue instead that the law 2 ̆ 7 s limitations enabled the development of female professional authorship and contributed to the dominance of women in the market. Women writers worked astutely within the constraints imposed by a law which privileged readers 2 ̆ 7 access to literature over authors 2 ̆ 7 property rights. Chapter One focuses on Catharine Sedgwick 2 ̆ 7 s signing of a petition to Congress in favor of copyright and how her presence highlights the ambiguous place of women writers in the emerging national literary culture. The chapter reads Sedgwick 2 ̆ 7 s negotiations of these conflicts in her private writings and her use of her novels A New England Tale and Clarence to craft a simultaneously self-effacing and powerful authorial persona. Chapter Two considers Harriet Beecher Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s copyright suit Stowe v. Thomas and Stowe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>stance</b> as an aggressive proprietary author attempting force the law to serve authors 2 ̆ 7 interests. The chapter considers the implications of Stowe 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>stance</b> in relation to the critique of market economics offered in her novel and how the novel encodes Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s fantasies of an author 2 ̆ 7 s truly perfect and inviolable title to her literary 2 ̆ 2 children. 2 ̆ 2 Chapter Three focuses on the unauthorized circulation of Fanny Fern 2 ̆ 7 s sketches through periodical reprinting as a context for reading her novel Ruth Hall. Fern cleverly exploited the unauthorized circulation of her works in local weeklies to build a national audience for her works, but once she had negotiated the transition to the national book market and stable proprietary authorship, she used Ruth Hall to rewrite the history of her early career and to anchor a stable authorial persona in the past to secure future proprietary claims. Chapter Four returns to international copyright, focusing on the International Copyright Act of 1891 as a context for reading Sarah Orne Jewett 2 ̆ 7 s 1896 novel The Country of the Pointed Firs, considering how Jewett, {{in the face of a}} newly masculinized literary marketplace and the disappearance of the author in realist fiction, wrote a fiction of female authorship which attempted to negotiate this new literary territory. ...|$|R

More broadly, in this thesis I develop that consumerism is a space for identity building and interaction in our society. I intend that consumption generates a space for negotiation of meaning and values within a consumer society. This is a space through which consumers can make reflective choices about companies and actions that they support or oppose.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of 9 / 11 and other terrorist attacks on U.

The contradictory findings for the effects of religious references on both positive and negative behavior call for a closer examination of individual or contextual factors that influence the effect of religion on social behaviors. To address these contradictory findings and to identify the underlying mechanism involved, Study 1 examined the extent to which god-related or church-related religious references impact the salience of individual or group identities. Study 2 served two goals: (1) to test the extent exposure to religious references increases self-ratings of attitude certainty and ratings {{of the extent to which}} one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>stance</b> is the correct stance (2) to test under what conditions the influence of religious references will lead to increased support for collective action or over-claiming of religious knowledge.

To this end, the linguistics and literature section of the Norwegian subcorpus of the Varieties of English for Specific Purposes dAtabase (VESPA) is investigated within the phraseological framework of Douglas Biber s Lexical Bundles methodology. This approach to phraseology aims {{to identify}} the most frequent recurrent expressions in a corpus, regardless of their idiomaticity or structural status, {{in order to identify}} the most productive phrases of the sample. These bundles are then sorted according to their function in discourse.

What functions to they serve in discourse? Are any bundles over- or underused in the Norwegian sample? This analysis reveals that Norwegian university-level learners are in fact using lexical bundles in a largely native-like manner in terms of overall frequency and function, but also that certain areas continue to be problematic, owed mainly to their comparatively limited repertoir of bundles that express the writer <b>s</b> <b>stance</b> or contribute to the explicit ordering of discourse...|$|R

I examine the honor and shame value system of the Greco-Roman world, both generally and in specific reference to head adornment, since head coverings and hairstyles were connected to honor and status.

Turning to 1 Cor 11 : 2 - 16, I argue that Paul 2 ̆ 7 s advice that the women cover their heads comes out of his concern for the gospel value of unity among believers. By covering their heads, the women will avoid self-promotion, acknowledge the value of their male human counterpart, and honor God.
