40|$|International audienceThe COMPASS {{experiment}} at CERN uses hadron and lepton beams for nucleon structure studies. Most of {{the data}} collected so far with a muon beam and either proton or deuteron polarised target were analysed in terms of longitudinally or transversely polarised parton distribution functions and transverse momentum-dependent distributions in the nucleon. A negative hadron beam is used to perform Drell-Yan measurements. The COMPASS large polarised target gives access to several momentum-dependent singlespin asymmetries and provides a stringent test of the fundamental QCD factorisation assumptions. With positive and negative muon <b>beams</b> <b>COMPASS</b> also studies Generalised Parton Distributions using exclusive deeply virtual Compton scattering and meson production experiments.

40|$|The report {{deals with}} beam {{instrumentation}} {{of the electron}} cooler for COSY storage ring. The electron cooler is an electrostatic accelerator designed for beam energy up to 2 MeV and electron current up to 3 A with recuperation. The electron beam is immersed in longitudinal magnetic field so the electron motion is strongly magnetized. The control electrode in the electron gun is composed of four electrically isolated sectors. Applying AC voltage to one sector allows tracing of motion of that particular part of the beam. The electron beam shape is registered with the combination of 4 -sector electron gun and the BPMs. This method allows observing both dipole and quadruple (galloping) modes of electron <b>beam</b> oscillation. <b>Compass</b> probe for measuring and tuning the direction of magnetic field in the cooling section is described.

50|$|Prior {{work on the}} {{development}} of gear cutting machines had prepared the way. Such devices were required to cut a circular plate with uniform gear teeth. Clockmakers were familiar with these methods and they were important in developing dividing engines. George Graham devised a process of using geometric methods to divide the limb of an instrument. He developed a sophisticated <b>beam</b> <b>compass</b> to aid marking of the graduations. John Bird and Jeremiah Sisson followed on with these techniques. These <b>beam</b> <b>compass</b> techniques were used into the 19th century, as the dividing engines that followed did not scale up to the largest instruments being constructed.|$|E

For slow density measurements a charged coupled device (CCD) camera has been installed and is already working. For fast twodimensional density profile and density fluctuation measurements an array of avalanche photodiode detectors (APDs) will be used. The two-dimensional resolution of the measurement will be possible using fast poloidal deflection and chopping of the beam. Apart from routine density profile measurement, the diagnostic will be capable of investigating the turbulent structures in the edge plasma by cross-correlating the signals coming from poloidally deflected virtual beams...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the LHC Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system is the active {{protection}} of the LHC accelerators' elements against the quench of superconducting magnets and the damage of equipment caused {{by the loss of}} circulating protons. The lost protons initiate a shower of secondary particles, which deposit their energy in the equipment and partly in a radiation detector. If thresholds in the BLM system are exceeded, the circulating LHC beam is directed towards a dump to stop the energy deposition in the fragile equipment. The LHC BLM system will use ionization chambers as standard detectors, and in the areas with very high dose rates Secondary Emission Monitor (SEM) chambers will be employed to increase the dynamic range. The SEM is characterized by a high linearity and accuracy, low sensitivity, fast response and a good radiation tolerance. The emission of electrons from the surface layer of metals by the passage of charged particles is only measurable in a vacuum environment. This requirement leads together with the foreseen operation of 20 years to an ultra high vacuum preparation of the components and even to an additional active pumping realized by a getter pump (NEG). The signal and bias electrodes are made of Ti to make use of its Secondary Emission Yield (SEY) stability and favorable vacuum properties. The sensitivity of the SEM was modeled in GEANT 4 via the Photo-Absorption Ionization module together with a custom parameterization for the very low energy secondary electron production using the modified Sternglass formula. The simulations were validated by comparative measurements of several prototypes with proton beams of the CERN PS Booster dump line, the SPS transfer line, the PSI Optis line and by a muon <b>beam</b> in the <b>COMPASS</b> <b>beam</b> line. Tests of the complete acquisition chain were performed in the LHC test collimation area of the SPS and compared to the combined Fluka and GEANT 4 simulations. The linearity and long term stability was also tested in the high energy beam dump area of the SPS. A dedicated fixed target experiment was designed in the CERN H 4 secondary beam line for testing all the 400 detectors produced in IHEP Protvino. The simulations were also used for the prediction of the signal levels expected in the LHC and for an absolute dose calibration. The comparison of simulations and measurements and of SEM and ionisation chamber measurements resulted in the relative difference range between 8 and 43 % for different setups and radiation fields...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For the small-area {{tracking}} of particles within COMPASS (common muon and proton apparatus for structure and spectroscopy), a new fixed target experiment at CERN/SPS, several large-size (31 31 cm 2) detectors {{based on the}} gas electron multiplier (GEM), have been built. These new devices, consisting of several GEM amplification stages with a two-coordinate readout, combine good spatial resolution with high rate capability, which is required by the large particle flux near the beam. At the same time, the material exposed to the beam is minimized {{in order not to}} spoil the mass resolution of the spectrometer. The first detectors {{out of a total of}} 20 were subject to extensive tests in the beam and in the laboratory, showing that full (i. e., 98 %) detection efficiency for minimum ionizing particles can be achieved at a total effective gain of 6000. Ongoing research work focuses on discharges triggered by heavily ionizing particles entering the detectors. Systematic studies of the energy released in discharges and their probability of occuring at all as a function of a variety of parameters suggest several means to minimize their impact on detector performance. First results of the operational characteristics of these detectors in the real <b>COMPASS</b> <b>beam</b> are presented.

50|$|The {{first true}} {{circular}} dividing engine was probably constructed by Henry Hindley, a clockmaker, around 1739. This {{was reported to}} the Royal Society by John Smeaton in 1785. It was based directly on a gear cutting machine for clockworks. It used a toothed index plate and a worm gear to advance the mechanism. Duc de Chaulnes created two dividing engines between 1765 and 1768 for dividing circular arcs and linear scales. He desired to improve on the graduation of instruments by removing the skill of the maker from the technique where possible. While <b>beam</b> <b>compass</b> use was critically dependent on the skill of the user, his machine produced more regular divisions {{by virtue of its}} design. His machines were also inspired by the prior work of the clockmakers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>beam</b> <b>compass</b> is used {{to scribe}} a circle, either by drawing with lead, penning by ink, or {{scratching}} with a sharpened point. The radius can be adjusted by sliding the metal point holder across a wood beam or metal rod, and locking it by turning a knob at the desired location. Some have a fine radius adjustment. The threaded adjustment {{is similar to that}} of a Screw. The only limitation is the rigidity of the wood beam or metal rod being used. Longer wooden beams tend to sag depending on the species of wood used. Metal rods can be used as an alternative, but they also have length limitations. Some trammel sets include a support roller for attachment at mid span of the beam or rod, to take out the sag. Trammel points score a precise line by using a sharpened point, or draw a line using a lead clutch, or an ink nib. When the circular knob is turned, it micro adjusts the radius of the circle. On some, a spring and screw mechanism locks the compass at the precise desired location. Turning clockwise decreases the radius while turning counterclockwise increases the radius slightly.|$|E
40|$|A new {{electronic}} readout for CsI-coated multiwire proportional chambers (MWPC), used as photon detectors in the COMPASS ring imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector, is described. A prototype system comprising {{more than}} 5000 channels has been built and tested in high-intensity beam conditions. It {{is based on the}} APV 25 -S 1 analogue sampling chip, and replaces the GASSIPLEX chip readout used previously. The APV 25 chip, although originally designed for Silicon microstrip detectors, is shown to perform well even with “slow” signals from an MWPC, maintaining a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 9. For every trigger the system reads out three consecutive amplitudes in time, thus allowing to extract information on both the signal amplitude and its timing. This information is used to reduce pile-up events in a high-rate environment. Prototype tests of the new readout electronics on a central RICH photocathode in nominal <b>COMPASS</b> <b>beam</b> conditions showed that the effective time window is reduced from more than for the GASSIPLEX to less than for the APV 25 chip. This leads to a significant improvement of the signal-to-background ratio (SBR) with respect to the original readout. A gain by a factor of 5 – 6 was experimentally verified in the very forward region of phase space, where pile-up due to the muon beam halo is most significant. Owing to its pipelined architecture, the new readout system also considerably reduces the dead time per event, thus allowing to make use of trigger rates exceeding...|$|R
