5|$|By the summer, 1940, the Chain Home radar {{stations}} {{along the}} English and Scottish coasts {{was able to}} track incoming aircraft from continental Europe at all but the lowest altitudes. The best detection altitude was 20,000 feet. Aircraft at this height could be detected over 100 miles away. To assess their identity, IFF (Identification Friend or Foe) could, {{by means of a}} distinctive <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> radar screens, distinguish German and British aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Each pair of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1940, British {{aircraft}} {{were increasingly}} {{equipped with the}} IFF Mk. II system, which allowed radar operators {{to determine whether a}} <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> their screen was a friendly aircraft. IFF was a responder that sent out a pulse of radio signal immediately on reception of a radio signal from a radar system. The IFF's transmission mixed with the radar's own pulse, causing the blip to stretch out in time from a small peak to an extended rectangular shape.|$|E
5000|$|Basic radars {{present the}} target {{information}} on a display and displayed targets {{are referred to as}} <b>blips.</b> Based <b>on</b> the relative size of the <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> the display, a radar operator could determine large targets from small targets. When a blip enhancing technique is used, small targets returns are augmented to look like large targets.|$|R
50|$|The online series premiered <b>on</b> <b>Blip</b> (website) <b>on</b> January 18, 2012. A {{second season}} {{is rumored to}} be in development, but no release date has been announced.|$|R
50|$|Later systems {{modified}} the time base {{to include a}} second signal that periodically produced <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> the display, providing a clock signal that varied with the time base and thus {{did not need to}} be aligned. In UK terminology, these were known as strobes.|$|R
5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred in the display, popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E
25|$|As {{the system}} was being developed, a further {{improvement}} was introduced that allowed for continuous following as opposed to periodic re-setting. The switching system was modified such that the range {{was sent to the}} upper line for 2.5milliseconds (ms), and the range and radiogoniometer signals for 7.5ms. If the signal was properly nulled, the two upper signals would mix and produce a single bright <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the upper trace, while the lower trace would be nulled, as before. If the signal was not nulled, a faint second blip would appear to smear out the upper trace, noticeable even before the <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the lower trace became visible.|$|E
25|$|In testing, it {{was found}} that the faint range-only signal became hard to see when the signal was noisy and jumping about. A final change added a slight fixed delay to the range-only signal, causing its trace to shift to the right. Now three {{distinct}} blips appeared on the elevation display, the range <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the right, and the two elevation signals aligned vertically just to the left.|$|E
25|$|Google Wave {{extensions}} are add-ins {{that may}} be installed on Google Wave to enhance its functionality. They may be Internet bots (robots) to automate common tasks, or gadgets to extend or change user interaction features, e.g., posting <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> microblog feeds or providing RSVP recording mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} actions taken by the hijackers on 9/11 was to turn off or disable {{each of the four}} aircraft's on board {{transponder}}s. Without these transponder signals to identify the airplane's tail number, altitude, and speed, the hijacked airplanes would have been only blips among 4,500 other <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> NORAD’s radar screens, making them very difficult to track.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "closest" [...] {{peripheral}} ties involve {{mutual recognition}} and repeated interactions (in one another’s physical presence or online). A treasured accountant or a cherished priest might be among one’s closest consequential strangers. At {{the other extreme}} are relationships that are barely <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> the social radar, such as people with adjoining season seats for a game or same-time-next-year conventioneers.|$|R
25|$|The spiral and helical scan systems {{produced}} {{very different}} displays {{from the same}} basic data. With the helical-scan system, the radar dish was moving horizontally, producing a series of stripes across the screen while scanning up and down so subsequent lines were above or below the last pass. This created a raster scan display, not unlike a television. Echoes caused the signal to brighten, producing a spot, or <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the display. The blip's location indicated the direction to the target relative {{the nose of the}} fighter, represented by the centre point of the display. The further the blip was from the centre of the screen, the further away the target was from the centreline. The range was not directly indicated in this sort of display.|$|E
25|$|According to Pelin, {{he walked}} to the upper sector console holding JP550's flight {{progress}} strip. He asked Tasić if the DC-9 could climb to FL350. Tasić took the strip from Pelin and looked at it, then asked where the aircraft was at the moment. Pelin then pointed to a <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the screen approaching Kostajnica. Tasić's response was 'yes, it could climb'. Pelin then noticed an aircraft on the screen coming from the direction of Metlika and asked Tasić about it, who said 'wait until they cross'. Pelin referred to the middle-sector screen {{to make sure that he}} had identified the DC-9 positively on the upper-sector screen. He then returned to Tasić and they both watched the targets pass each other, at which point Tasić authorised JP550 to climb. Pelin then called out to Erjavec and said 'yes, climb it'. Upon Erjavec receiving the OK from Pelin, he instructed the DC-9 to climb to FL350. That was at 10:07:40.|$|E
25|$|Anthony {{commuted}} to Towson Catholic High School for {{his first}} three years of high school. During the summer of 1999, Anthony grew five inches into the frame of a 6–5 swingman. He suddenly became one of the area's top players and {{made a name for himself}} in the area, being named The Baltimore Suns metro player of the year in 2001, as well as Baltimore Catholic League player of the year. During his sophomore year, he averaged 14 points, 5 rebounds, 4 assists and 2 steals. Towson Catholic surged to a record of 26–3 and finished third in the state tournament. Anthony enjoyed a successful high school basketball career as a junior, almost doubling his numbers in scoring and rebounds, averaging 23 points and 10.3 rebounds. Despite his successful year, Anthony was distracted by all of the attention, and was suspended on several occasions for skipping classes. He barely registered a <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the radars of pro scouts with his skinny frame and lack of strength; many scouts felt that he was not ready for the physical demands of the NBA. In the end, Towson Catholic fell short of the state title, although he was named Baltimore's County Player of the Year, All-Metropolitan Player of the Year and Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year.|$|E
5|$|For interception, {{the radar}} {{operator}} had {{to compare the}} length of the <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> the displays. If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort to centre the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This {{image from}} an AI Mk. IV radar {{is similar in}} concept to the GL Mk. II, {{although}} it displays <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> {{either side of a}} centreline rather than as two peaks on one side. The blips are just visible about half-way along the baseline. The large triangles at the top and right are caused by ground reflections, and are not present in GL systems.|$|R
5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single direction, {{the length of the}} <b>blips</b> depended <b>on</b> the position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long <b>blip</b> to appear <b>on</b> the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see {{directly in front of the}} fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter <b>blips,</b> one <b>on</b> either side of the centreline.|$|R
500|$|In the 1930s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was {{the most}} {{respected}} movie production studio in Hollywood. When Tracy arrived there, his own reputation was not strong. Biographer James Curtis writes: [...] "Tracy was scarcely a <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the box office barometer in 1935, a critics' darling and little more". He was, however, well known for being a troublemaker. Producer Irving G. Thalberg was nevertheless enthusiastic about working with the actor, telling journalist Louella Parsons: [...] "Spencer Tracy will become one of MGM's most valuable stars." ...|$|E

Since it's a product of the post-ideological, post-Xbox 21st century, 300 will instead be talked about as a technical achievement, the next <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{gameplay}} {{was praised}} by several reviewers, some found {{the game to}} be unnecessarily long, repetitive and unforgiving. In a mixed review, McCaffrey felt that the game does not offer many options of survival, requiring players {{to spend most of}} their time hiding in lockers [...] "staring at the motion tracker". Polygon criticised the overexposure to the alien creature, turning Alien: Isolation into an irritating experience. As Gies explained, [...] "Every time I thought I heard the monster, every <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> my motion tracker, was a cause for a tightness in my chest at first. By the 300th time I dived under a table or into a locker, I wasn't scared anymore — I was annoyed." [...] Despite the criticism, Alien: Isolation was considered a [...] "brave" [...] title due to its difficult and unforgiving gameplay, a feature that is uncommon in games with large development costs. As of January 2015, Alien: Isolation has sold over one million copies worldwide according to Sega. As of March 2015, the game has sold over 2.1 million copies in Europe and the US.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{successful}} deployment of radar systems for air defence during World War II, combatants were immediately {{confronted with the}} difficulty of distinguishing friendly aircraft from hostile ones; by that time, aircraft were flown at high speed and altitude, making visual identification impossible, and the targets showed up as featureless <b>blips</b> <b>on</b> the radar screen.This led to incidents such as the [...] "battle of Barking Creek", over Britain,and the [...] "air attack on the fortress of Koepenick", over Germany.|$|R

2500|$|Defensive {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a single 20mm (0.79in) T-171E-3 rotary cannon with 1,200 rounds of ammunition in a radar-aimed tail barbette. It was remotely controlled through the Emerson MD-7 automated radar fire-control system only requiring the DSO to lock-on a selected target <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> his scope and then fire the gun; the system computing all aiming, velocity or heading differential, and range compensation. Offensive armament typically {{consisted of a}} single nuclear weapon, along with fuel tanks, in a streamlined MB-1C pod under the fuselage. Incurable difficulties with fuel leakage resulted in {{the replacement of the}} MB-1C with the TCP (Two Component Pod), which placed the nuclear weapon in an upper section while the lower fuel component could be independently jettisoned.

But when it comes to picking our battles, for many of us in Alaska, legalization of marijuana just was never really a bright <b>blip</b> <b>on</b> the radar screen, so it didn't surprise me when the voters of Alaska went back to legalizing it. For some years there, it had not been legalized. I look on the national scene and think, 'Wow, of all things to be fighting over and battling over.'
