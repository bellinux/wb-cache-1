5|$|Despite {{the many}} <b>books</b> <b>written</b> about him (Holroyd counts 80 by 1939) Shaw's autobiographical output, {{apart from his}} diaries, was {{relatively}} slight. He gave interviews to newspapers—"GBS Confesses", to The Daily Mail in 1904 is an example—and provided sketches to would-be biographers whose work was rejected by Shaw and never published. In 1939 Shaw drew on these materials to produce Shaw Gives Himself Away, a miscellany which, a year before his death, he revised and republished as Sixteen Self Sketches (there were seventeen). He {{made it clear to}} his publishers that this slim book was in no sense a full autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Feynman was a keen popularizer {{of physics}} through both books and lectures, {{including}} a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume {{publication of his}} undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and <b>books</b> <b>written</b> about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.|$|E

5|$|However, {{he still}} {{preferred}} Arabic authors more than Persian ones. There {{is very little}} evidence which shows his interest in Persian poetry. He spoke Arabic, wrote in Arabic and was {{proud to be a}} student of a famous Arab grammarian. He studied science in Arabic, including astronomy and mathematics. Many <b>books</b> <b>written</b> in Arabic were dedicated to him whether religious or secular content. Apparently showing interest in Arabic rather than Persian, Adud al-Dawla followed the mainstream of intellectual life in a provincial town where culture was dominated by Arabic and Persian.|$|E

She is critical of cookery <b>books</b> <b>written</b> by men who conceal their secrets, preventing readers from using their recipes successfully.|$|E

5|$|While at the University of Iowa, Godwin's {{dissertation}} {{became her}} first novel, The Perfectionists. By 1976 {{she had become}} a successful writer and author of three books. In particular, two <b>books</b> <b>written</b> by her in the 1980s, A Mother and Two Daughters (1982) and A Southern Family (1987), resulted in further acclaim and expanded the readership of her books. Following The Finishing School (1984), readership of her books dramatically declined until 2006, when Queen of the Underworld was published. Flora (2013) became one of her more commercially successful novels.|$|E
5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular <b>books</b> <b>written</b> on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in the political fallout from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{published}} The Messianic Legacy, {{a sequel}} to The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail. The authors assert that the Priory of Sion {{is not only the}} archetypal cabal but an ideal repository of the cultural legacy of Jewish messianism that could end the “crisis of meaning” within the Western world by providing a Merovingian sacred king as a messianic figure in which the West and, by extension, humanity can place its trust. However, the authors are led to believe by Plantard that he has resigned as Grand Master of the Priory of Sion in 1984 and that the organisation has since gone underground in reaction to both an internal power struggle between Plantard and an “Anglo-American contingent” as well as a campaign of character assassination against Plantard in the press and <b>books</b> <b>written</b> by skeptics.|$|E

The earliest reference to a Khitan state {{is found in the}} Book of Wei, a history of the Northern Wei Dynasty (386–534) that was completed in 554. Several <b>books</b> <b>written</b> after 554 mention the Khitans as being active during the late third and early fourth centuries. The Book of Jin (648), a history of the Jin dynasty (265–420), refers to the Khitans in the section covering the reign of Murong Sheng (398–401). Samguk Sagi (1145), a history of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, mentions a Khitan raid taking place in 378.|$|E
5|$|The Bloomberg Businessweek rankings, {{which are}} based on three sources of data (a student survey, a survey of {{corporate}} recruiters, and an intellectual capital rating), are published in mid-October of even numbered years. The 2006 student survey of 45 online questions of students' ratings of their programs was distributed to 16,595 students three weeks before graduation; there were 9,290 responses. The recruiter survey determines how many MBAs a recruiter's company hired in the previous two years and which schools it actively recruits from. 223 respondents participated out of 426 solicited. The intellectual capital is determined based on a formula incorporating academic publications in journals, <b>books</b> <b>written,</b> and faculty size.|$|E
5|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{is one of}} the world's best-known and most-researched animals, with {{probably}} more <b>books</b> <b>written</b> about it than any other wildlife species. It {{has a long history of}} association with humans, having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock, while conversely being respected in some agrarian and hunter-gatherer societies. Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies, the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from rabies. Non-rabid wolves have attacked and killed people, mainly children, but this is rare, as wolves are relatively few, live away from people, and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds.|$|E
