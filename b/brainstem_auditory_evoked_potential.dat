50|$|Some horses {{with the}} splashed white pattern {{have been shown}} to have {{congenital}} deafness, though many or most have normal hearing. This type of deafness is probably similar to instances of deafness in white or piebald, blue-eyed examples in other species. In white-coated cats and dogs with deafness, an absence of melanocytes in the inner ear leads to death of the hair cells, which are necessary for perceiving sound. The presence of pigment around the outside of the ears - which most splash horses have - does not prove the presence of that necessary pigment in the inner ear. There must be pigment inside the inner ear to prevent this problem.Domestic horses often cope well with deafness, and deaf horses may go undiagnosed.

40|$|SUMMARY Brainstem {{auditory}} evoked potentials {{and clinical}} findings were examined in 18 children {{over the age of}} 5 years who were born with myelomeningocoele which was closed at birth, and whose hydrocephalus was managed by long term shunting in most of them. The potentials were compared with age and sex matched normal subjects and with four patients with hydrocephalus only. All but one had an abnormal <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> with 72 % showing a delay in the III-V and I-V interpeak latencies of more than three standard deviations. It is proposed that the abnormalities are a reflection of brainstem dysgenesis which is part of an associated Arnold-Chiari malformation, though the malformation was clinically asymptomatic in all. The usefulness of the <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> for assessing the course of hydrocephalus and for predicting symptomatic Arnold-Chiari malformation is questioned.

40|$|We {{recruited}} 128 neonates with hyperbilirubinemia over a 5 -year period (1995 - 2000) {{to study}} the short- and long-term effects of hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia on the auditory brainstem pathway and neurodevelopmental status. These children {{were divided into two}} groups: (1) a hemolytic group (n = 29; ABO incompatibility [n = 19], Rh incompatibility [n = 1], glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [n = 8] and both ABO incompatibility and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [n = 1]) and (2) a nonhemolytic group (n = 99). All received phototherapy. Exchange transfusions were performed for four (13. 8 %) in the hemolytic group and three (3 %) in the nonhemolytic group. The <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> was recorded at a mean age of 3. 2 months in the hemolytic group and 3. 1 months in the nonhemolytic group. Serial <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> assessments were performed until 2 years of age (3 in the hemolytic group and 18 in the nonhemolytic group). All had regular physical, neurologic, visual, and auditory evaluation until 3 years of age. The rate of exchange transfusion was significantly higher in the hemolytic group than in the nonhemolytic group (P <. 05). <b>Brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> abnormalities at the initial assessment occurred in three (10. 4 %) in the hemolytic group (all related to ABO incompatibility) and nine (9. 1 %) in the nonhemolytic group. At 2 years, the <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> returned to normal except in three cases with a slightly increased hearing threshold (one [3. 5 %] in the hemolytic group at 60 dB nHL and two [2 %] in the nonhemolytic group at 50 dB nHL]). There {{were no significant differences in}} the rate of <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> abnormalities at the initial or subsequent assessments between both groups. All except five cases had a normal neurodevelopmental outcome at 3 years (three [two with ABO incompatibility and one with glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency] in the hemolytic group [10. 4 %] and two [2 %] in the nonhemolytic group). All had mild motor delay and hypotonia, which returned to normal at 3 years. The rate of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome was higher in the hemolytic group than in the nonhemolytic group, although with no significant difference between both groups (P =. 08). All five cases in both groups with abnormal neurodevelopment had a normal <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> at the initial assessment. There was no relationship between the abnormal initial <b>brainstem</b> <b>auditory</b> <b>evoked</b> <b>potential</b> and the final neurodevelopmental outcome. The toxic effect of hyperbilirubinemia on the auditory brainstem pathway and neurodevelopmental status in our cohort was transient. The prognosis of neonatal hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia in our Chinese cohort is excellent, possibly owing to an aggressive early-intervention approach. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
