5|$|Fats are catabolised by {{hydrolysis}} to free {{fatty acids}} and glycerol. The glycerol enters glycolysis and the fatty acids are <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> beta oxidation to release acetyl-CoA, which then is fed into the citric acid cycle. Fatty acids release more energy upon oxidation than carbohydrates because carbohydrates contain more oxygen in their structures. Steroids are also <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> some bacteria in a process similar to beta oxidation, and this breakdown process involves the release of significant amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and pyruvate, which can all {{be used by the}} cell for energy. M. tuberculosis can also grow on the lipid cholesterol as a sole source of carbon, and genes involved in the cholesterol use pathway(s) have been validated as important during various stages of the infection lifecycle of M. tuberculosis.|$|E
5|$|Crime rates {{vary widely}} by area, ranging from parts with serious issues to parts {{considered}} very safe. Today crime figures are made available nationally at Local Authority and Ward level. In 2015 there were 118 homicides, a 25.5% increase over 2014. The Metropolitan Police have made detailed crime figures, <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> category at borough and ward level, available on their website since 2000.|$|E
5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} chewed food is <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong {{muscles in the}} pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dopamine}} {{is normally}} <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> an oxidoreductase enzyme, {{it is also}} susceptible to oxidation by direct reaction with oxygen, yielding quinones plus various free radicals as products. The rate of oxidation can be increased {{by the presence of}} ferric iron or other factors. Quinones and free radicals produced by autoxidation of dopamine can poison cells, and there is evidence that this mechanism may contribute to the cell loss that occurs in Parkinson's disease and other conditions.|$|E
5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes. Most of this food is ingested {{in the form of}} macromolecules and other complex substances like proteins, polysaccharides, fats and nucleic acids. These macromolecules must be <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> catabolic reactions into smaller molecules like amino acids and simple sugars before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.|$|E
5|$|Ethylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet liquid, {{commonly}} found in antifreeze. It may be drunk accidentally or purposefully {{in an attempt to}} cause death. When <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> the body it results in glycolic acid and oxalic acid which cause most of the toxicity. The diagnosis may be suspected when calcium oxalate crystals are seen in the urine or when acidosis or an increased osmol gap is present in the blood. Diagnosis may be confirmed by measuring ethylene glycol levels in the blood; however, many hospitals do not have the ability to perform this test.|$|E

30|$|With the {{increase}} in the pits size, the electrolyte has the chance to infiltrate into the interface of oxide layer/metal and the second oxide layer is formed and then <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> again <b>by</b> the electric field. Thereafter, the oxide is formed and <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> layer <b>by</b> layer and the current curve exhibits oscillations correspondingly. The pores are formed due to the longitudinal prolongation and the lateral expansion of the pits with {{the increase}} in oxide layer number.|$|R
5|$|Model {{first came}} to Hitler's {{attention}} before World War II, but their relationship did not become especially close until 1942. His tenacious style of fighting and dedication to the Nazi cause won him plaudits from Hitler, who considered him {{one of his best}} field commanders and repeatedly tasked him with retrieving desperate situations. However, their relationship had <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> {{the end of the war}} after Model was defeated at the Battle of the Bulge. In April 1945, with the Third Reich's defeat imminent, Model committed suicide rather than be captured and stand trial for war crimes.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolytic}} finishing {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At this plant the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% heavy water, was <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends to be drawn off first, leaving the heavy water behind. This process was repeated through several stages to yield a finished product that was 99.75% heavy water.|$|E

5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate toxic substances by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{had contributed}} more {{manpower}} to the Allied cause in World War II, proportional to white population, {{than any other}} British dominion or colony, and more than the UK itself. According to figures compiled by MacDonald for his War History of Southern Rhodesia, 26,121 Southern Rhodesians served {{in the armed forces}} during the conflict, of whom 2,758 were commissioned officers. <b>Broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> race and gender, there were 15,153 black men, 9,187 white men, 1,510 white women and 271 coloured and Indian men. Of the 8,390 who served outside the territory, 1,505 were black men, 6,520 were white men, 137 were white women and 228 were coloured or Indian men.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was launched on 16 December 1944 and enjoyed initial success, but it quickly {{suffered from a}} lack of air cover and the inexperience in some of its infantry component, and critically short fuel supply. Sixth SS Panzer Army met heavy allied resistance, and while Fifth Panzer Army managed to make a deep thrust into Allied line, Model was unable to exploit the breakthrough there. He had failed to capture a vital road junction at Bastogne, and this in combination with poor weather and difficult terrain, caused the German columns to back up into huge traffic jams on the roads behind the front. Starved of fuel and ammunition, the attack had <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> 25 December, and was abandoned on 8 January.|$|E

5|$|Also, Norway was {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to have all-electric cars topping the new car sales monthly ranking. The Tesla Model S has been the top selling new car four times, and the Nissan Leaf has topped the monthly new car sales ranking twice. In March 2014 the Tesla Model S also broke the 28-year-old record for monthly sales of a single model {{regardless}} of its power source, surpassing the previous record set in May 1986. In July 2016, when new car registrations are break down by type of powertrain, {{for the first time a}} plug-in hybrid, the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV, listed as the top selling new car.

5|$|Equines are {{monogastric}} hindgut fermenters. They {{prefer to}} eat grasses and sedges, {{but may also}} consume bark, leaves, buds, fruits and roots if their favored foods are scarce, particularly asses. Compared to ruminants, equines have a simpler and less efficient digestive system. Nevertheless, they can subsist on lower quality vegetation. After food is passed though the stomach, it enters the sac-like cecum. where cellulose is <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> micro-organisms. Fermentation is quicker in equines than in ruminants; 30–45 hours for a horse compared to 70–100 hours for a cow. Equines may spend 60-80 {{percent of their time}} feeding, depending on the availability and quality of vegetation. In the African savannas, the plains zebra is a pioneer grazer; mowing down the upper, less nutritious grass canopy and preparing the way for more specialized grazers like blue wildebeests and Thomson's gazelles which depend on shorter and more nutritious grasses below.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of clan or lineage groups {{were not very}} influential in local society. However, prominent kinship groups could enjoy {{a great deal of}} ad hoc influence, especially if a member served as a government official. Wealthy scholars or officials often shared the same kinship group with poor commoners. Since clan members were expected to defend fellow members (even to the point of murder), government authorities constantly struggled to suppress powerful kinship groups. Local lineage groups formed the backbone of rebel forces in the popular uprising against Wang Mang in the early 1st century CE. When central government authority broke down in the late Eastern Han, less-developed areas of the country remained relatively stable due to entrenched kinship groups, while in heavily developed areas (where kinship groups had been effectively <b>broken</b> <b>down</b> <b>by</b> the state) there were many more peasants willing to turn to rebel movements for protection and survival.|$|E
