500|$|Rhythm {{games have}} been used for health purposes. For example, {{research}} has found that dancing games dramatically increase energy expenditure over that of traditional video games, and that they <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> than walking on a treadmill. Scientists have further suggested that, due to the large amount of time children spend playing video games and watching television, games that involve physical activity could be used to combat obesity. Studies have found that playing Dance Dance Revolution can provide an aerobic workout, in terms of a sufficiently intense heart rate, but not the minimum levels of VO2 max. Based on successful preliminary studies, West Virginia, which {{has one of the highest}} rates of obesity and its attendant diseases in the US, introduced Dance Dance Revolution into its schools' physical education classes. According to The New York Times, more than [...] "several hundred schools in at least 10 states" [...] have used Dance Dance Revolution (along with In the Groove) in their curricula. Plans have been made to increase the number into the thousands in an effort to mitigate the country's obesity epidemic. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor of California, was a noted proponent of the game's use in schools. In Japan, celebrities reported losing weight after playing Dance Dance Revolution, which drove sales of the game's home console version. Bemani's testers also found themselves losing weight while working on the game. There is further anecdotal evidence that these games aid weight loss, though the University of Michigan Health System has cautioned that dance games and other exergames should only be a starting point towards traditional sports, which are more effective. Dance games have also been used in rehabilitation and fall-prevention programs for elderly patients, using customised, slower versions of existing games and mats. Researchers have further experimented with prototypes of games allowing wider and more realistic stepping than the tapping actions found in commercial dance games.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIncreasing caloric {{expenditure}} {{in physical}} education is considered an effective school-based approach to addressing the child obesity epidemic. This {{study was designed to}} determine synergistic influences of student characteristics and lesson factors on caloric expenditure in elementary and middle school physical education. MethodsThe study used a multi-level design. Level- 1 factors included personal characteristics: age, gender, and body mass index. Level- 2 factors included lesson length, content, and school level. Based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention age–gender adjusted growth chart, students in 87 classes from 14 elementary and 15 middle schools were pre-screened into “Overweight”, “Healthy weight”, or “Thin” groups. One boy and one girl were randomly selected from each group in each class as data providers (264 elementary and 294 middle school students). Caloric expenditure was measured in 243 physical education lessons using accelerometers. ResultsAnalysis of variance revealed and hierarchical linear modeling confirmed separate age by body mass index, age by gender, and content by lesson–length interaction effects, suggesting that the personal and lesson factors influenced caloric expenditure independently. Older male and heavier students <b>burned</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> in all lessons. Students <b>burned</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> in 45 – 60 min sport skill or fitness lessons than in shorter (30 min) or longer (75 – 90 min) game or multi-activity lessons. ConclusionsThe hypothesized cross-level interaction was not observed in the data. Caloric expenditure can be optimized in 45 – 60 min sport skill or fitness development lessons. It can be recommended that schools adopt 45 – 60 min lesson length and provide skill and fitness development tasks {{in physical education}} to maximize caloric expenditure...|$|R

50|$|The satiating {{property}} of dietary protein {{is influenced by}} the time of protein consumption. Studies have shown that protein intake at breakfast has a greater satiety effect than later meal times. There are several explanations as to why this is the case. Firstly, protein has a greater thermogenic effect than carbohydrates and fat, which enables the body to <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories.</b> Secondly, a high protein breakfast appears to slow gastric emptying, which attributes to the fact that protein appears to be the most satiating macronutrient. Finally, a high protein breakfast increases the activity of glucagon, which activates the pathways for glucose synthesis. One study showed that fat loss was approximately twice as much in the high-protein diet group than the moderate-protein diet group in overweight and obese individuals.|$|E

50|$|Studies {{show that}} the EPOC effect exists after both {{anaerobic}} exercise and aerobic exercise.

For exercise regimens of comparable duration and intensity, aerobic exercise <b>burns</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> during the exercise itself, but the difference is partly offset by the higher increase in caloric expenditure that occurs during the EPOC phase after anaerobic exercise. Anaerobic exercise in the form of high-intensity interval training was also found in one study to result in greater loss of subcutaneous fat, even though the subjects expended fewer than half as many calories during exercise. Whether this result was caused by the EPOC effect has not been established, and the caloric content of the participants' diet was not controlled during this particular study period.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the caloric intake and energy output of {{swimmers}} and runner during normal daily activities and training. Daily and energy expenditure of twenty college varsity swimmers and runners were measured. Four groups of subjects were categorized as male runners, female runners, male swimmers, and female swimmers with five subjects in each group. An additional twenty runners and swimmers recorded only dietary intake. Despite a large difference in body weight and body fat, the mean daily caloric intake was similar for the two groups (male swimmers: 3377 Kcal/d- 1, male runners: 3463 Kcal/d- 1, female swimmers: 2491 Kcal/d- 1, female runners: 2037 Kcal/d- 1).

50|$|Some {{experts believe}} aerobic {{interval}} training may benefit exercisers {{by allowing them}} to <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> in a shorter period, and by improving aerobic capability at a faster rate, when compared with continuous-intensity exercise. In overweight and obese individuals, high intensity interval training employing 4 sets of 4-minute intervals has been shown to improve VO2max {{to a greater extent than}} isocaloric moderate continuous training, as well as to a greater extent than with a protocol using shorter, 1-minute intervals Some exercisers find interval training less monotonous than continuous-intensity exercise. A number of studies confirm that in young and healthy individuals, sprint interval training appears to be as effective as continuous endurance training of moderate intensity, and has the benefit of requiring a reduced time commitment. There is some evidence that interval training is also beneficial for older individuals and for those with coronary artery disease, but further study is required.|$|E
5000|$|High {{intensity}} {{interval training}} (HIIT) consists of repeated, short bursts of exercise, completed {{at a high}} level of intensity. These sets of intense activity are followed by a predetermined time of rest or low intensity activity. [...] Studies have shown that exercising at a higher intensity has increased cardiac benefits for humans, compared to when exercising at a low or moderate level. When your workout consists of an HIIT session, your body has to work harder to replace the oxygen it lost. Research into the benefits of HIIT have revealed that it can be very successful for reducing fat, especially around the abdominal region. Furthermore, when compared to continuous moderate exercise, HIIT proves to <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> and increase the amount of fat burned post- HIIT session. Lack of time {{is one of the main}} reasons stated for not exercising; HIIT is a great alternative for those people because the duration of an HIIT session can be as short as 10 minutes, making it much quicker than conventional workouts.|$|E
5000|$|The Iberian pig can {{be either}} red or dark in colour, if black ranging from dark to grey, {{with little or no}} hair and a lean body, thus giving rise to the {{familiar}} name pata negra, or [...] "black hoof". In traditional management, animals ranged freely in sparse oak forest (dehesa), they are constantly moving around and therefore <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> than confined pigs. This, in turn, produces the fine bones typical of this kind of jamón ibérico. At least a hectare of healthy dehesa is needed to raise a single pig, and since the trees may be several hundred years old, the prospects for reforesting lost dehesa are slim at best. True dehesa is a richly diverse habitat with four different types of oak that are crucial in the production of prime-quality ham. The bulk of the acorn harvest comes from the holm oak (Quercus ilex) from November to February, but the season would be too short without the earlier harvests of Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) and Portuguese or gall oak (Quercus lusitanica), and the late cork oak (Quercus suber) season, which between them extend the acorn-production period from September almost to April.|$|E

While stair-riser banners had no effect, the poster intervention increased stair climbing. The high pedestrian volumes as the wave of disembarking passengers seek to leave the station would have obscured the visibility of the banner for many commuters.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Education, Dept. of Human Performance StudiesCaloric {{expenditure}} {{of hundreds of}} activities, including conditioning exercises, occupational activities such as masonry work, self-care activities such as dressing, and lawn care activities such as mowing, have been previously reported (Ainsworth et al., 2000). However, there is little research {{that has been done}} in this specific area of MET calculation in regards to elastic resistance training. Elastic resistance training is a type of training in which one uses an elastic band to create tension during resistance/strength exercise. While {{there are a variety of}} ways to evaluate exercise intensity, METs (Metabolic Equivalence of Tasks) were used to evaluate the energy cost for elastic resistance exercises. The purpose of this study was to determine the METs and caloric expenditure per minute associated with elastic resistance exercise. 15 undergraduate and graduate exercise science students (6 male; 9 female) ages 18 - 25 (21. 60 plus/minus 1. 99 years), completed 10 repetitions of 10 upper and lower body exercises using two different strengths of Thera-bands (blue; black). METs and caloric expenditure were calculated from participants' relative oxygen consumption. Data were analyzed and a significant difference (p< 0. 01) was found between upper and lower body exercise as well as between the blue and black elastic bands. Lower body exercises performed by the black Theraband yielded significantly (p< 0. 01) higher energy costs (5. 13 kcal plus/minus 1. 54; 3. 85 MET plus/minus 0. 5) compared to pre-exercise (2. 06 kcal plus/minus 0. 67; 1. 57 MET plus/minus. 046), black upper body (4. 06 kcal plus/minus 1. 17; 3. 05 MET plus/minus 0. 44), blue upper body (3. 94 kcal plus/minus 1. 24; 2. 95 MET plus/minus 0. 43) and blue lower body (4. 69 kcal plus/minus 1. 48; 3. 51 MET plus/minus 0. 49) trials.

Caloric expenditure of 821 activities, including conditioning exercises, occupational activities such as masonry work, self-care activities such as dressing, and lawn care activities such as mowing, have been previously reported (Ainsworth et al., 2011). However, there is little research regarding this in regards to elastic resistance training. Caloric expenditure of 821 activities, including conditioning exercises, occupational activities such as masonry work, self-care activities such as dressing, and lawn care activities such as mowing, have been previously reported (Ainsworth et al., 2011). However, there is little research regarding this in regards to elastic resistance training. PURPOSE: To determine the MET level and caloric expenditure per minute associated with elastic resistance exercise. METHOD: Caloric expenditure was measured by determining oxygen consumption. After participants were fitted with noseclips and a mouthpiece, they lay prone for 5 minutes to assess resting metabolic rate. 20 university students (8 male; 12 female) ages 18 - 25 (21. 80 ± 1. 8 years) completed 15 min of upper and lower body exercises using two different strengths of elastic resistance bands (blue, black) while expired air was analyzed. A video led them through 10 exercises using the blue band and then again using the black band. Each exercise was performed for 10 reps. METs were calculated from participants’ relative oxygen consumption and caloric expenditure per minute was derived from: 0. 0175 x MET x body mass (kg). RESULTS: Differences (p< 0. 05) were found between upper- and lower-body exercise {{as well as between}} the blue and black elastic bands. Lower-body exercises performed with the black elastic band yielded higher energy costs (4. 06 ± 0. 7 MET; 5. 26 ± 1. 5 kcal/min) compared to pre-exercise (1. 42 ± 0. 4 MET; 1. 84 ± 0. 5 kcal/min), black upper-body (3. 29 ± 0. 6 MET; 4. 26 ± 1. 3 kcal/min), blue upper-body (3. 10 ± 0. 5 MET; 4. 05 ± 1. 3 kcal/min) and blue lower-body (3. 66 ± 0. 6 MET; 4. 75 ± 1. 4 kcal/min) trials. In addition, energy expenditure was higher in exercises with black (3. 52 ± 0. 6 MET; 4. 56 ± 1. 3 kcal/min) compared to blue (3. 27 ± 0. 6 MET; 4. 26 ± 1. 3 kcal/min) elastic bands. CONCLUSION: Participants <b>burned</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> with greater resistance and when performing lower-body versus upper-body exercise.

These results will provide therapists, personal trainers, and other professionals with guidelines for optimal use and maximum impact of this equipment on weight loss/management...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Replacing {{physical}} activity with videogaming has {{been implicated in}} causing obesity. Studies have shown that using motion-sensing controllers with activity-promoting videogames expends energy comparable to aerobic exercise; however, effects of motion-sensing controllers have not been examined with traditional (non–exercise-promoting) videogames. Materials and Methods: We measured indirect calorimetry and heart rate in 14 subjects during rest and traditional videogaming using motion sensor and joystick controllers. Results: Energy expenditure was higher while subjects were playing with the motion sensor (1. 30 ± 0. 32 [*]kcal/kg/hour) than with the joystick (1. 07 ± 0. 26 [*]kcal/kg/hour; P< 0. 01) or resting (0. 91 ± 0. 24 [*]kcal/kg/hour; P< 0. 01). Oxygen consumption during videogaming averaged 15. 7 percent of predicted maximum for the motion sensor and 11. 8 percent of maximum for the joystick. Minute ventilation was higher playing with the motion sensor (10. 7 ± 3. 5 L/minute) than with the joystick (8. 6 ± 1. 8 L/minute; P< 0. 02) or resting (6. 7 ± 1. 4 L/minute; P< 0. 001), predominantly because of higher respiratory rates (15. 2 ± 4. 3 versus 20. 3 ± 2. 8 versus 20. 4 ± 4. 2 beats/minute for resting, the joystick, and the motion sensor, respectively; P< 0. 001); tidal volume did not change significantly. Peak heart rate during gaming was 16. 4 percent higher than resting (78. 0 ± 12. 0) for joystick (90. 1 ± 15. 0; P= 0. 002) and 17. 4 percent higher for the motion sensor (91. 6 ± 14. 1; P= 0. 002); mean heart rate did not differ significantly. Conclusions: Playing with a motion sensor <b>burned</b> significantly <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> than with a joystick, but the energy expended was modest. With both consoles, the increased respiratory rate without increasing tidal volume and the increased peak heart rate without increasing mean heart rate are consistent with psychological stimulation from videogaming, rather than a result of exercise.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) results in a higher energy expenditure and is more enjoyable when compared to moderate exercise. Methods: On two different days, ten college age men and women exercised on a treadmill at either 50 % of their maximum heart rate for 20 consecutive minutes or 90 % of their maximum heart rate for one minute, alternated by one minute of recovery walking, which was repeated 10 times for a total of 20 minutes of exercise. Heart rate and calories burned were assessed with a heart rate monitors. Assessments were continued during a 30 -minute recovery period as participants sat quietly in a chair. PACES, a survey based on enjoyment of the exercise was also completed. Results: Moderate exercise burned an average of 139 ± 40 calories while exercising and 64 ± 15 calories during recovery. HIIT burned an average of 204 ± 40 calories while exercising and 117 ± 47 calories during recovery. The PACES score for moderate exercise was 14. 2 while HIIT was 12. 5, which was not statistically different and indicates no difference in enjoyment between the conditions.

40|$|Four active collegiate level {{students}} were asked to participate in a 3 day study, conducted in a strict environment. These {{students were}} required to perform the same exact exercise each day at the same time upon waking on an empty stomach following a fasted sleep. All individuals performed the exercise at 7 : 00 AM. On day one, the participant was to perform the exercise with no caffeine consumption. The following day, the participant was to drink one cup of coffee and perform the required exercise. On {{the last day of the}} experiment, each participant drank two cups of coffee before the exercise was performed. The exercise was one mile of walking on a flat treadmill at a speed of 3. 5 mph. These individuals were wearing a Garmin fitness watch and the heart rate strap that was included in the packaging. Immediately following exercise, these individuals took note of both their heart rate and calories burned. The basis of this study is to show the effects of caffeine on calorie burn and heart rate fluctuation. Following this study, it is important to note that all four participants showed a slight increase in both calories burned and heart rate following the required exercise on each day. The average calories burned with no caffeine was 109. 25 and a heart rate of 103 beats per minute. When one cup of coffee was consumed by each individual, the average readings were 118. 5 calories burned and a heart rate of 110. 25 beats per minute. On the third and final day, the averages were 123. 75 calories burned and a heart rate of 120 beats per minute.

Based on data from the Survey on Health, Well-being and Aging (SABE project, PAHO-WHO), a bivariate probit model is estimated controlling by the potential endogeneity of obesity. The results obtained confirm {{the appropriateness of the}} joint estimation of both outcomes, and led us to state that being obese raises the probability of suffering from hypertension in 50 percentage points. This effect should have been understated in the probit estimation. At the same time, the instruments chosen that pick up religiosity, smoking and eating habits were relevant and valid with the expected coefficient signs. Tobacco consumption reduces the probability of being obese, showing that either smokers have different metabolism that make them <b>burn</b> <b>more</b> <b>calories</b> than non-smokers, or that smokers tend to ingest less amounts of food given the well-known appetite-suppressant effect of tobacco. On the other hand, the results show a positive association between obesity and religiosity, probably meaning that religion acts as a support once the problem is present, more than a mechanism of self-control or censorship. Finally, the thermic effect of food is confirmed, in the sense that as more meals one eats per day less the probability of being obese. The results do not show a significative association between poor health, measured through morbidity (presence of chronic disease hypertension), and low socioeconomic status. Given the fact that the variable that captures socioeconomic status is positive and statistically significative in the obese equation, the negative effects on health status of a worst socioeconomic status might operate through nutritional outcomes. On the other hand, there might be a problem of selection bias, in the sense that individuals of lower status have higher probability of early death (survival effect), and that public provision of health services with an emphasis on the elderly, reduce the gap between purchasing power and access to health care services. obesity, hypertension, endogeneity, elderly...|$|E
