It is uncertain whether that was the original rising or whether it formed when the main rising at Wookey was blocked.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>base</b> <b>level</b> of a {{river or}} stream is the lowest point to which it can flow, often {{referred}} to as the 'mouth of the river'. For large rivers, sea level is usually the <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> but a large river or lake is likewise the <b>base</b> <b>level</b> for tributary streams. All rivers and streams erode toward sea level, which is also known as the [...] "ultimate base level." [...] A rather rare exception can be seen in the Jordan River, for which the <b>base</b> <b>level</b> is the Dead Sea, 417 m below modern sea level. If a river is dammed, a new <b>base</b> <b>level</b> (the level of the reservoir) replaces the ultimate <b>base</b> <b>level.</b> As a result, the stream’s <b>base</b> <b>level</b> is raised. Consequently, this reduces the stream’s velocity, leads to deposition, and a reduction of the gradient upstream from the reservoir.|$|R
50|$|A {{very hard}} layer of rock can form a {{temporary}} <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> {{until it is}} cut through. For example, Lockport dolomite has created a temporary <b>base</b> <b>level</b> for the Niagara River. Eventually this will be cut through as Niagara Falls recedes, and Lake Erie will be drained to near the lower <b>base</b> <b>level</b> of Lake Ontario.|$|R
50|$|In {{geological}} terms, {{the stream}} will erode down through its bed {{to achieve the}} <b>base</b> <b>level</b> of erosion throughout its course. If this <b>base</b> <b>level</b> is low, then the stream will rapidly cut through underlying strata and have a steep gradient, and if the <b>base</b> <b>level</b> is relatively high, then the stream will form a flood plain and meander.|$|R

30|$|APS use an HPS {{architecture}} {{to support}} strategic, tactical, and operative decisions. According to Schneeweiss (2003), an HPS consists {{of at least}} two linked planning levels with one sub-problem each: a top and a <b>base</b> <b>level.</b> Commonly, an anticipated <b>base</b> <b>level</b> is used at the top level to predict a possible base-level reaction, which in turn influences top-level decisions. While the top <b>level</b> instructs the <b>base</b> <b>level</b> (top–down signal), the <b>base</b> <b>level</b> considers the instructions and may provide reactions to the top level (bottom–up influence). After final decisions are made at the <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> these are implemented in the object system (e.g., the shop floor). Subsequently, ex-post feedback is provided to the planning system. According to Fleischmann and Meyr (2003), an HPPS is characterized by three major features (top–down): an increasing level of detail, a decreasing planning horizon and an increasing planning frequency.|$|R

50|$|<b>Base</b> <b>level</b> is the {{elevation}} of {{the surface of the}} water body into which a river ultimately drains, usually the ocean. A drop in <b>base</b> <b>level</b> causes a response by the river system to carve into the landscape.

5000|$|Downcutting, {{also called}} erosional downcutting, {{downward}} erosion or vertical erosion is a geological process by hydraulic action that deepens the channel {{of a stream}} or valley by removing material from the stream's bed or the valley's floor. The speed of downcutting depends on the stream's <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> the lowest point to which the stream can erode. Sea level is the ultimate <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> but many streams have a higher [...] "temporary" [...] <b>base</b> <b>level</b> because they empty into another body of water that is above sea level or encounter bedrock that resists erosion. A concurrent process called lateral erosion refers to the widening of a stream channel or valley. When a stream is high above its <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> downcutting will take place faster than lateral erosion; but {{as the level of}} the stream approaches its <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> the rate of lateral erosion increases. This is why streams in mountainous areas tend to be narrow and swift, forming V-shaped valleys, while streams in lowland areas tend to be wide and slow-moving, with valleys that are correspondingly wide and flat-bottomed. The term gradient refers to the elevation of a stream relative to its <b>base</b> <b>level.</b> The steeper the gradient, the faster the stream flows. Sometimes geological uplift will increase the gradient of a stream even while the stream downcuts toward its <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> a process called [...] "rejuvenation." [...] This happened {{in the case of the}} Colorado River in the western United States, resulting in the process that created the Grand Canyon.|$|R
50|$|Movements of land {{can greatly}} affect <b>base</b> <b>levels.</b> As an illustration, the uplift of the Colorado Plateau, {{combined}} {{with the opening of}} the Gulf of California to the sea, established sea level as the base level for the Colorado River and led to the (geologically) rapid erosion that resulted in the Grand Canyon.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{characteristics}} of sedimentary microfacies, unique vertical depositional sequences and well logging response, the authors propose that a shallow water delta was widely developed in the Neogene of the Laibei area, Bohai Bay Basin of northern China. Based on seismic minimum amplitude slices, well logging data, test analytical data and so forth, detailed research {{on the evolution of}} the shallow water delta of the Neogene Lower Member of Minghuazhen Formation was conducted. The results indicate that the third-order sequence <b>base</b> <b>level</b> controls sandbody types. During a period of low <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> a distributary channel sandbody of shallow water deltaic plain was developed. With <b>base</b> <b>level</b> rising, the sandbody type gradually changed into a subaqueous distributary channel sandbody and a sheet sand can be found as well. The fourth-order sequence <b>base</b> <b>level</b> controls medium–short term evolution of the sandbody. Within a sequence, due to the rising and falling of <b>base</b> <b>level,</b> the sandbody assemblages are identified as an upward-coarsening type, an upward-fining and a compound type respectively. Regionally, from the Laibei Low Uplift to the Huanghekou Sag, the shallow water delta evoluted from a dendritic shape, to a cuspate shape and finally to a sheet shape...|$|R

30|$|However, grain-coating {{chlorite}} {{is rarely}} observed in study area sand bodies which developed {{during periods of}} decreasing <b>base</b> <b>level.</b> The shift in <b>base</b> <b>level</b> {{may be related to}} megamonsoons during the Carnian-Raleigh of Late Triassic Epoch (Shi et al. 2010) in the Middle and Upper Yangtze regions of the Sichuan Basin. The monsoon climate resulted in uneven rainfall distribution and seasonal humidity. During periods of increased rainfall, river discharges increased and more Fe particulates were deposited. Water was relatively more saturated in Fe, and Fe-rich minerals such as chlorite became easier to deposit. The rising <b>base</b> <b>level</b> resulted in the formation of additional sand body cycles because of increased river discharges. During the even longer seasonal dry periods, river flow decreased and less Fe particulates were deposited.
