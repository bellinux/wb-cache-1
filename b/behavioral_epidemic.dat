40|$|In {{distributed}} wireless networks, nodes {{are expected}} to spend their own resources so as to relay other nodes messages. This setup is governed by the trade-off between connectivity across the network and minimum interference, which maps to the standard Random Geometric Graph model. Even though smart network helps here, problem is that cognitive nodes may violate rules of cooperation with selfish intention of reaping the benefits from other nodes without bearing its cost. This leads to a <b>behavioral</b> <b>epidemic</b> causing nodes to follow non-cooperative strategy bringing down the network performance. In this paper, we examine the optimal way to choose control nodes using a central coordinator. We show by analysis that contrary to the general intuition, there exists a range of interest where random selection of control nodes outperforms that by highest degree ordering {{for the number of}} control nodes. We then simulate the mechanisms of inspections and counter-epidemic for these two control node selection procedures and verify the result...|$|E
40|$|Obesity {{has become}} a {{worldwide}} epidemic and limiting one 2 Ì† 7 s food intake, or dieting, is usually unsuccessful. The {{purpose of the study}} was to explore the effect of food addiction (FA) on the current clinical and <b>behavioral</b> <b>epidemic</b> of obesity. FA, synonymous with food-dependency, is tentatively defined as an eating disorder based on substance dependence, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Measurement of FA has been operationalized by the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) by applying the diagnostic criteria of substance dependence to eating behaviors. This study was based on the biological theory of chemical addiction and the evidence that highly processed, high-fat, and high-sugar foods may be addictive and may contribute to unsuccessful dieting. To explore the difficulty of adhering to healthy food choices, 6 women were identified who satisfied the diagnostic criteria of FA using the YFAS. These women were invited to participate in a qualitative study. The full transcripts, which were coded via interpretative phenomenological analysis, revealed 6 major themes. The most salient master themes were the loss of control over food intake, the need for external control for successful weight loss, and the significant distress caused by food and eating. All the women interviewed agreed that FA is an eating disorder and that (a) best results were obtained from sugar and flour abstinence and (b) success was found in a 12 Step program for FA based on an addiction model. Once identified with the YFAS, FA has a large impact for social change. Those recognized as having a FA can be offered a specific treatment, based on an addiction model, which differs from the usual treatment for obesity and offers a solution for successful weight management...|$|E

The interplay between infectious disease dynamics and network adaptation dynamics {{was investigated in}} regard to the disease transmission and the cumulative number of infection cases. We found that the cumulative case was reduced and associated with an increasing network adaptation probability but was increased with an increasing disease transmission probability. It was found that the topological changes of the adaptive random networks were able to reduce the cumulative number of infections and also to delay the epidemic peak. Our results also suggest the existence of a critical value for the ratio of disease transmission and adaptation probabilities below which the epidemic cannot occur...|$|R
40|$|In real world, {{there is}} a {{significant}} relation between human behaviors and epidemic spread. Especially, the reactions among individuals in different communities to epidemics may be different, which lead to cluster synchronization of human behaviors. So, a mathematical model that embeds community structures, <b>behavioral</b> evolution and <b>epidemic</b> transmission is constructed to study the interaction between cluster synchronization and epidemic spread. The epidemic threshold of the model is obtained by using Gersgorin Lemma and dynamical system theory. By applying the Lyapunov stability method, the stability analysis of cluster synchronization and spreading dynamics are presented. Then, some numerical simulations are performed to illustrate and complement our theoretical results. As far as we know, this work is the first one to address the interplay between cluster synchronization and epidemic transmission in community networks, so it may deepen the understanding of the impact of cluster behaviors on infectious disease dynamics.

40|$|Background: Four {{clinical}} trials {{have shown that}} oral and topical pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) based on tenofovir may be effective in preventing HIV transmission. The expected reduction in HIV transmission and the projected prevalence of drug resistance due to PrEP use vary significantly across modeling studies {{as a result of}} the broad spectrum of assumptions employed. Our goal is to quantify the influence of drug resistance assumptions on the predicted population-level impact of PrEP. Methods: All modeling studies which evaluate the impact of oral or topical PrEP are reviewed and key assumptions regarding mechanisms of generation and spread of drug-resistant HIV are identified. A dynamic model of the HIV epidemic is developed to assess and compare the impact of oral PrEP using resistance assumptions extracted from published studies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity is {{a global}} <b>epidemic.</b> <b>Behavioral</b> change {{approaches}} towards improving nutrition, increasing physical activity level, improving sleep, and reducing sitting time are recommended as best practices in adolescent obesity management. However, access to evidence-based treatment is limited and portable technologies such as mobile apps may provide a useful platform to deliver such lifestyle interventions. No evidence-based validated app exists for obesity intervention; therefore, a novel mobile app (Reactivate) was developed {{for use in the}} Temple Street W 82 GO Healthy Lifestyles Program (W 82 GO). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the usability (technical effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction) of the Reactivate mobile app in obese adolescents. METHODS: Ten adolescents (7 males and 3 females, aged 12 - 17 years) who had been treated for obesity (> 98 th percentile for body mass index) at the Temple Street Children's University Hospital were recruited. Participants were given 8 tasks to complete in order to test the technical effectiveness of the app. A research assistant timed the user while completing each task in order to test the relative user efficiency of the app (time-on-task). The tasks fell into 5 categories and required the user to enter personal settings, find and answer surveys, create a message, use the goal setting feature, and enter details regarding their weight and height. In exploration of user satisfaction, each participant completed the standardized software usability measurement inventory (SUMI), which measures 5 aspects of user satisfaction: efficiency, effect, helpfulness, controllability, and learnability. Descriptive statistics were used to explore the mean relative user efficiency and SUMI scores. RESULTS: Mean age was 14. 26 (SD 1. 58) years. All adolescents completed each of the tasks successfully. The mean relative user efficiency scores were two to three times that of an expert user. Users responded that they would use Reactivate to monitor their growth over time, for motivation, and for goal setting. All users described Reactivate as an important mobile app. CONCLUSIONS: Our study describes the usability of a mobile app used in adolescent obesity management. Adolescents found Reactivate easy to use and their SUMI results indicated that the app scored high on user satisfaction. Usability testing is an important step towards refining the development of the Reactivate app, which can be used in the treatment of obesity. The study on the clinical efficacy of the Reactivate app is currently underway...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The {{coverage}} of HIV/AIDS behavioral surveillance among MSM in China falls {{far short of}} what is necessary as the current approach is expensive and time consuming. In addition MSM are difficult to reach in China. Internet-based behavioral surveys have demonstrated a number of advantages compared with the traditional paper-pen method. Chinese MSM are avid users of the Internet. Use of the internet provides an opportunity to access this hard-to-reach population and explore {{their use of the}} Internet for sexual purposes as well as to assess risk behaviors among MSM internet users. This thesis aimed to explore the trends in risk behaviors and HIV prevalence among MSM using traditional community-based surveys and Internet surveys, and to analyze the potential of web-based behavioral surveillance among MSM by comparing the differences between Internet and community-based MSM samples, and then to provide insights for the future HIV/AIDS <b>behavioral</b> surveillance, <b>epidemic</b> estimation and prediction as well as health intervention among the Chinese MSM population. METHODS This study has three components. The first focuses on trends in HIV risk behaviors and prevalence among MSM in Harbin in northeast China, based on community-based surveys. Eligible participants were approached by peer recruiters in traditional gay venues and then interviewed by health professionals with a standard questionnaire. Urine samples were collected to screen their HIV status. The second part presents two cross-sectional, Internet-based surveys among MSM in China in 2006 and 2007. The study website was advertised on three selected gay websites using a series of banners, pop-ups and text notifications. After providing consent to the survey, eligible participants were invited to complete an online questionnaire. The third component compares the demographic characteristics and risk behaviors of two samples of Chinese MSM. Participants living in Heilongjiang Province were extracted from the 2006 online survey dataset to compare with the community sample of MSM recruited in Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang Province in the same year. KEY FINDINGS Community-based behavioral surveillance Among MSM in Harbin, a trend was observed towards more self-identifying as homosexual (from 58 % to 80 %) and more living with a male partner (from 12 % to 41 %) over the study period 2002 - 06. Although there was a trend towards a reduction in the rate of never using a condom and an increase in the rate of always using condoms during anal sex in the past six months, the prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) still remained at high level (from 90 % in 2002 to 72 % in 2006). Most respondents reported having multiple male sexual partners (â‰¥ 2) in the past six months: 86. 5 % in 2002, 76. 0 % in 2004 and 91. 6 % in 2006. The HIV prevalence (2. 2 %, 15 / 674) among MSM in Harbin in 2006 was higher than that in previous survey years (1. 3 % in 2002 and 0. 94 % in 2004), but no statistically significant change was detected. Internet-based behavioral surveys Gay website users in China are young and well educated. The majority (85 %) have used the Internet to seek sex and meeting sexual partners online, {{which is one of the}} most common reasons for visiting gay websites. Traditional gay venues still play an important role in the sex seeking process, especially for MSM who are older and less educated. Gay website users are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS given their high prevalence of UAI (56. 6 %) and multiple male sexual partners (66. 5 %). The type of partners plays an important role in determining consistent condom use. An increase in condom use was observed among MSM having sex between commercial partners relative to those having sex with non-regular partners and regular partners. Among the Internet sample, participants who have regular partners are less likely to have sex with females, less likely to have multiple partners and less likely to engage in commercial sex behaviors than those who do not. Comparisons between Internet and community samples There are significant differences in terms of demographic characteristics and risk behaviors between the Internet and community samples of MSM. The Internet sample was significantly younger, more educated and more likely to be students and self identify as homosexual. Among those who had anal sex in the past six months, the Internet sample tended to use condoms less consistently than the community sample. However, using the total sample size as the denominator to calculate the prevalence of UAI, no significant difference between the two samples was observed (AOR 1. 02, CI 0. 73 - 1. 43, p = 0. 905). After adjusting for differences in demographic characteristics, the community sample was more likely to have had sex with females (AOR 2. 01, CI 1. 22 - 3. 30, p = 0. 006) and have had â‰¥ 6 male partners in the previous six months than the Internet sample (46. 1 % vs. 20. 2 %; AOR 4. 88, CI 3. 51 - 6. 80, p < 0. 001). The mean number of male partners for the community sample was 13. 5 Â± 16. 8, whereas it was 6. 0 Â± 12. 2 for the Internet sample. CONCLUSIONS Although there is a trend towards an increase in condom use among MSM in China, they are vulnerable to HIV/AIDS infection given their high prevalence of UAI and multiple sexual partners. Public sector officials at all levels need to recognize this risk for HIV transmission. Health promotion and behavioral interventions should be enforced and scaled up to meet the need for controlling HIV transmission among MSM in China. Since the Internet has become a risk environment for MSM and the online MSM population is significantly different from the traditional community MSM group, online MSM should be included as a risk group in national HIV sentinel and behavioral surveillance and the {{coverage of}} surveillance for this specific group should be expanded to better understand the health promotion needs of this community as part of an HIV/AIDS strategy in China.
