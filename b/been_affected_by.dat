Three experiments, using convenience sampling were conducted to investigate the effect of auditory interference on the cognitive performance of 24 adult men and women during the Stroop test, perception of object recognition and spatial location tasks, {{and the perception of}} object size, shape, and spatial location tasks. The data were analyzed using univariate analysis of variance and 1 -way multivariate analysis of variance.

The Experiment 2 b results demonstrated reaction time performance for detecting the spatial location of objects <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> auditory interference between age groups. In addition, reaction time <b>was</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the type of interference and spatial location.
