500|$|K. Fulford, A. Smirnov, and E. Snow state: [...] "An {{important}} vulnerability factor, therefore, for {{the abuse}} of psychiatry, is the subjective nature of the observations on which psychiatric diagnosis currently depends." [...] The concerns about political abuse of psychiatry as a tactic of controlling dissent have been regularly voiced by American psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, and he mentioned that these authors, who correctly emphasized the value-laden nature of psychiatric diagnoses and the subjective character of psychiatric classifications, failed to accept the role of psychiatric power. Musicologists, drama critics, art historians, and many other scholars also create their own subjective classifications; however, lacking state-legitimated power over persons, their classifications do not lead to anyone's being deprived of property, liberty, or life. For instance, plastic surgeon's classification of beauty is subjective, but the plastic surgeon cannot treat his or her patient without the patient's consent, therefore, there cannot be any political abuse of plastic surgery. The bedrock of political medicine is coercion masquerading as medical treatment. What transforms coercion into therapy are physicians diagnosing the person's condition a [...] "illness," [...] declaring the intervention they impose on the victim a [...] "treatment," [...] and legislators and judges legitimating these categorizations as [...] "illnesses" [...] and [...] "treatments." [...] In the same way, physician-eugenicists advocated killing certain disabled or ill persons {{as a form of}} treatment for both society and patient long before the Nazis came to power. Szasz argued that the spectacle of the Western psychiatrists loudly condemning Soviet colleagues for their abuse of professional standards was largely an exercise in hypocrisy. Psychiatric abuse, such as people usually associated with practices in the former USSR, was connected not with the misuse of psychiatric diagnoses, but with the political power built into the social role of the psychiatrist in democratic and totalitarian societies alike. Psychiatrically and legally fit subjects for involuntary mental hospitalization had always been [...] "dissidents." [...] It is the contents and contours of dissent that has changed. Before the American Civil War, dissent was constituted by being a Negro and wanting to escape from slavery. In Soviet Russia, dissent was constituted by wanting to [...] "reform" [...] Marxism or emigrate to escape from it. As Szasz put it, [...] "the classification by slave owners and slave traders of certain individuals as Negroes was scientific, in the sense that whites were rarely classified as blacks. But that did not prevent the [...] "abuse" [...] of such racial classification, <b>because</b> (<b>what</b> <b>we</b> call) its abuse was, in fact, its use." [...] The collaboration between psychiatry and government leads to what Szasz calls the [...] "Therapeutic State", a system in which disapproved actions, thoughts, and emotions are repressed ("cured") through pseudomedical interventions. Thus suicide, unconventional religious beliefs, racial bigotry, unhappiness, anxiety, shyness, sexual promiscuity, shoplifting, gambling, overeating, smoking, and illegal drug use are all considered symptoms or illnesses that need to be cured.|$|E
2500|$|Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, {{in a video}} message, {{said that}} the Scottish have avoided serious {{consequences}} and [...] "have chosen the most favourable option for everyone; for themselves, for all of Britain {{and for the rest}} of Europe". Iñigo Urkullu, the President of the Basque Country, stated on the day of the referendum that as the British Government had allowed Scotland to freely decide its own future, the responsibility of the Basque government was to [...] "follow Scotland's footsteps" [...] in securing a similar agreement in Spain. Artur Mas, President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, described the referendum as a model for a future vote in the Catalonia, and said [...] "What happened in Scotland is not a setback for us, <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> really want in Catalonia is to have the chance to vote". On the day after the Scottish referendum, the Catalan parliament voted to hold a [...] "popular consultation" [...] on Catalan independence. The Spanish government said that such a vote would be unconstitutional, but a referendum was held on 9 November 2014 anyway. The large majority (80%) voted for Catalonia to be an independent country, although two-thirds of Catalans did not participate in the referendum.|$|E

2500|$|About ninety animators {{worked on}} the film {{at one point or}} another; some {{worked on the}} project for as long as two years. [...] In terms of the film's {{animation}} style and settings, the film combines Eastern world culture (predominantly Japanese) with Western world culture (predominantly California). In May 2013, Disney released concept art and rendered footage of San Fransokyo from the film. San Fransokyo, the futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo, was described by Hall as [...] "an alternate version of San Francisco. Most of the technology is advanced, but much of it feels retro … Where Hiro lives, it feels like the Haight. I love the Painted ladies. We gave them a Japanese makeover; we put a cafe on the bottom of one. They live above a coffee shop." [...] According to production designer Paul Felix, [...] "The topography is exaggerated <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> do is caricature, I think the hills are 1½ times exaggerated. I don't think you could really walk up them … When you get to the downtown area, that's when you get the most Tokyo-fied, that pure, layered, dense kind of feeling of the commercial district there. When you get out of there, it becomes more San Francisco with the Japanese aesthetic. … (It's a bit like) Blade Runner, but contained to a few square blocks. You see the skyscrapers contrasted with the hills." ...|$|E

[...] Variety noted that it was [...] "an expert telling of a supernatural horror story... The climactic {{sequences}} assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror." [...] In Castle of Frankenstein, Joe Dante called it [...] "an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic. Director Friedkin's film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see... Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a 4-out-of-4 star review, praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the convincing special effects {{but at the end of}} the review wrote, [...] "I am not sure exactly what reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment won’t be one, <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> get here aren’t the delicious chills of a Vincent Price thriller, but raw and painful experience.

And this the righteous are assured of here; for he saith it in words at length, 'The desire of the righteous shall be granted.'

The righteous! Who so vilified as the righteous? He, by the wise men of the world, is counted a very Abraham,[2] a fool; like to him who is the father of us all. But as he left all for the desire that he had of a better country, and at last obtained his desire; for after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise; so those that walk in the steps of that faith which our father Abraham had, even those also in the end shall find place in Abraham's bosom; wherefore it is meet that we should cheer up and be glad, <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> desire shall be granted unto us (Heb 6).|$|E
