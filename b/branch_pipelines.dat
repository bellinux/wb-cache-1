However, drainage roadways serve only one working face and are discarded after mining, thus weakening sustainable mining practices.

To achieve this aim there were made objective and common technical validity and formed several distribution construction models. These models were examined technically, environmentally and economically afterwards framing summarizing conclusions. In general feasibility study branches were chosen from Marijampolė to Kalvarija, as the main criteria were demand for natural gas. Furthermore, there was found that a more detailed examination of the project is targeted: the demand of annual natural gas exceeds the minimum statutory amount. Simultaneously, on the technical analysis the decision was made, that Marijampolė gas distribution station capacity is sufficient to supply natural gas not only to existing customers, {{but also to the}} planned distribution <b>pipeline</b> <b>branch,</b> as well as the optimal source of gas supply and distribution system functional elements. From the environmental point of view, based on atmospheric pollution dispersion modeling software environment AERMOD program results, thus gas supply to the existing industrial facilities to ensure lower emissions and were would be eliminated environment pollution at this moment. The evaluation of the investment, operating and other expenses, estimated that the planned <b>pipeline</b> <b>branch</b> is not appropriate when natural gas is deployed for domestic and industrial facilities. Generally, investments in the natural gas networks of this development would exceed several times the expected revenue.

50|$|Furthermore, modern CPUs have {{instruction}} pipelines that queue {{instructions for}} execution. A processor with multiple execution units can perform {{more than one}} instruction per cycle if more than one instruction {{is available in the}} <b>pipeline.</b> <b>Branching</b> (the use of conditionals like if) makes it harder for the processor to fill its pipeline(s) because the CPU cannot tell what it needs to do in advance.

As a consequence, the random sampling is done over α different PDFs, where α different generations are constructed. This approach uses more computational calculations in each iteration which can be handled by parallel-processing supporting hardware. In the other hand, we obtain two significant advantages including conservative behavior in impacting by local minima trapping and lower number of iterations in convergence. Thus, utilizing PCE-based pilot allocation will confirm two critical aspects of pilot allocation algorithms.|$|R

A relationship between the length of the path along any subtree of the pipeline and the corresponding drainage area has been found for the leaf venation.
