40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} polymer brushes grafted from {{conductive polymer}} films which display dynamic surface switching dependent on salt, temperature and electrode potential. The electroactivity {{presented by the}} conductive polymer and the responsiveness of the grafted <b>brushes</b> <b>leads</b> to an interface with multiple control parameters. Here, we demonstrate this concept by grafting of uncharged brushes of poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylates from conducting polymer poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), and observe a temperature- and salt-induced switch of brush conformation, and their effect on the electrochemistry of the material. The switching conditions can be tailored by copolymerizing monomers with different numbers of ethylene glycol units. In addition, these surfaces exhibit antifouling properties, leading to potential applications such as electrically-addressable biointerfaces...|$|R

40|$|Polymer <b>brushes</b> <b>lead</b> {{to small}} {{friction}} and wear and thus hold {{great potential for}} industrial applications. However, interdigitation of opposing brushes makes them prone to damage. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations revealing that immiscible brush systems can form slick interfaces, in which interdigitation is eliminated and dissipation strongly reduced. We test our findings with friction force microscopy experiments on hydrophilic and hydrophobic brush systems in both symmetric and asymmetric setups. In the symmetric setup both brushes are chemically alike, while the asymmetric system consists of two different brushes that each prefer their own solvent. The trends observed in the experimentally measured force traces and the friction reduction {{are similar to the}} simulations and extend to fully immersed contacts. These results reveal that two immiscible brush systems in mechanical contact slide at a fluid–fluid interface while having load-bearing ability. This makes them ideal candidates for tribological applications...|$|R

A pilot study was performed to relate in vitro lubrication with mouthfeel in human volunteers. Coefficient of friction (COF) on 16 -h-old SCFs after manual, rotary-oscillatory, and sonically driven brushing was measured using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM was also used to assess the roughness of SCFs prior to and after brushing. Dehydrated layer thicknesses and glycosylation of the SCFs were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Mouthfeel after manual and both modes of powered brushing were evaluated employing a split-mouth design.

Good contrast was visible owing to the dark brown colour of the developed fingermarks on light coloured non-porous surfaces. Appreciable results have been obtained on semi-porous surfaces too. Surfaces selected in present study are generally encountered in the scene of crime. Although powder dusting method is an efficient and simple mean of latent fingermark development, excessive powdering or <b>brushing</b> can <b>lead</b> {{to the destruction of}} ridge details necessary for identification.

40|$|Providing piglets with {{repeated}} stroking and <b>brushing</b> <b>leads</b> to behaviours of affinity towards their handler, {{but there is}} still no evidence of physiological modifications. In addition, other tactile stimulations like scratching have not yet been studied while there are used by pig-keepers. Thus, the present experiment aimed at determining the consequences of stroking and scratching weaned piglets on their later behavioural, cortisol and cardiac responses to human presence and gentle tactile interactions. Four groups of four piglets were weaned at 28 days of age (Day 0) and handled twice a day for 10 min, five days a week, from Day 1 to 28. Handling consisted in standing for 30 s, sitting for 1 min and then stroking and scratching each piglet for 2 min. Four groups of four piglets were used as controls and received only the minimal contact for routine husbandry practices. Behavioural reactions to the presence of the handler in the home pen (Day 25) and to her presence and departure in an arena test (Days 26 – 27) were observed. Behavioural and cardiac responses to the handler’s presence and contact were compared in a test pen (Days 33 – 35). Salivary cortisol levels were measured in another test pen after 15 -min of either contact with the handler or isolation (Days 40 – 43). In the home pen, handled piglets investigated sooner the handler (P 0. 05). Overall this study shows that scratching and stroking piglets during three weeks after weaning changed the way that they interacted with the handler, being more attracted than control piglets. However, there was no clear difference in cardiac reactions to scratching and stroking between handled and control piglets, suggesting that these contacts are perceived positively, regardless of the previous experience. The body region stimulated may be of importance but it needs further investigation...|$|R

30|$|One such {{alternative}} {{is the use}} of surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method to covalently attach polymer brushes in a tunable and controllable manner [33 – 35]. This approach allows the preparation of polymer brushes bearing reactive pendant groups, such as hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, or epoxide groups, which provide highly reactive binding sites for bioactive macromolecules at the brush interfaces [36]. Hence, surface-initiated ATRP is a promising approach for the functionalization of the PCL surface, as it allows for the control of the length and density of the polymer <b>brushes,</b> which <b>leads</b> to tunable grafting efficiency for the desired biologically active molecules. However, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, few studies have been devoted to modifying biodegradable polyester polymers using surface-initiated ATRP for the improvement of their cytocompatibility [37]. Moreover, no systematic study has been performed to investigate the relationship between the surface density of the grafted bioactive molecules and cellular functions in order to demonstrate the tunable grafting efficiency of this approach.|$|R

40|$|Even though {{titanium}} (Ti) has {{the ability}} to develop a highly stable passive oxide layer (TiO 2) that provides an excellent corrosion resistance; it’s not inert to corrosive attack. Under in vivo conditions, such as in orthopedic and dental implants, a tribological contact may be formed in association with a chemical aggressive environment. Consequently, wear debris and corrosion products or ions can lead to inflammatory reactions, such as osteolysis (bone resorption), provoking peri-prosthetic bone loss and subsequent loosening of the implant/prosthesis [1]. The microbial effect on the corrosion of metallic biomaterials remains unknown. Chang et al. [2] reported an increase on the corrosion behaviour of dental metallic materials in the presence of Streptococcus mutans and its growth byproducts. Moreover, <b>brushing</b> can <b>lead</b> to the production of wear debris, which together with the attachment of microbes can disturb the passivity of the metal oxide. In addition, the organic acids produced by bacteria may reduce the pH, favoring the corrosion and tribocorrosion of implants.

40|$|Friction between ring-polymer brushes at melt densities sliding past {{each other}} are studied using {{extensive}} course-grained molecular dynamics simulations and scaling arguments, {{and the results are}} compared to the friction between linear-polymer brushes. We show that for a velocity range spanning over three decades, the frictional forces measured for ring-polymer brushes are half the corresponding friction in case of linear brushes. In the linear-force regime, the weak inter-digitation of two ring brushes compared to linear <b>brushes</b> also <b>leads</b> to a lower number of binary collisions between the monomers of opposing brushes. At high velocities, where the thickness of the inter-digitation layer between two opposing brushes is on the order monomer size regardless of brush topology, stretched segments of ring polymers take a double-stranded conformation. As a result, monomers of the double-stranded segments collide less with the monomers of the opposing ring brush even though a similar number of monomers occupies the inter-digitation layer for ring and linear-brush bilayers. The numerical data obtained from our simulations is consistent with the proposed scaling analysis. Conformation-dependent frictional reduction observed in ring brushes can have important consequences in non-equilibrium bulk systems. Comment: 10 pages, Latex, two columns forma...|$|R

By skillful labeling, we access both the monomer density in the corona {{as well as the}} conformation of the grafted chains. While the corona profile follows a r− 1 power law, the conformation of a grafted chain is identical to that of a chain in a reference melt, implying a high mutual penetration of the coronas from different particles. The <b>brush</b> crowding <b>leads</b> to topological confinement of the chain dynamics: (i) At local scales, the segmental dynamics is unchanged compared to the reference melt, while (ii) at the scale of the chain, the dynamics appears to be slowed down; (iii) by performing a mode analysis in terms of end-fixed Rouse chains, the slower dynamics is tracked to topological confinement within the cone spanned by the adjacent grafts; (iv) by adding 50 % matrix chains, the topological confinement sensed by the grafted chain is lifted partially and the apparent chain motion is accelerated.

40|$|The {{complement}} system is being increasingly {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of progressive renal disease resulting from persistent proteinuria. It has recently been established that renal tubular cells can produce complement, activate complement, and respond to complement activation. Complement proteins that pass through the glomerular barrier along with other serum proteins in the proteinuric state may become activated at the tubular epithelial <b>brush</b> border, and <b>lead</b> to a cascade of events culminating in cell injury. Furthermore, nephrotic components in the urinary space may cause direct activation of the tubular cells to overexpress complement and contribute to local tissue injury.

All stationary contacts were superconducting at low currents when the members themselves were superconducting. Two types of contacts were found; one whose abrupt resistance transition is accompanied by hysteresis, and the other whose transition is gradual. The difference may be connected with the properties of the contact surface. Moving contacts between superconducting <b>lead</b> <b>brushes</b> and a rotating lead cylinder exhibited resistance whose magnitude was 10 ^- 3 of the normal conduction resistance.

40|$|Inspired by nature, we have {{successfully}} directed the deposition of inorganic oxide materials on polymer templates via {{a combination of}} top-down and bottom-up fabrication methods. We have functionally mimicked the hierarchical silica exoskeletons of diatoms, where specialized proteins chaperone the condensation of silicic acid into nanoscale silica networks confined by microscopic vesicle walls. We replaced the proteins with functionally analogous polyamines and vesicles with lithographically defined polymer templates. We grafted the polyamines either to the surface or throughout the template by changing the template chemistry and altering our grafting strategy. Exposure to an inorganic oxide precursor solution led to electrostatic aggregation at the polyamine chains, catalyzing hydrolysis and condensation to form long-range inorganic oxide nanoparticle networks. Grafted to epoxy surfaces, swelling effects and the hyperbranched <b>brush</b> morphology <b>lead</b> {{to the formation of}} nanofruit features that generated thin, conformal inorganic coatings. When the polyamines were grafted throughout hydrogel templates, we obtained composite networks that yielded faithful inorganic replicas of the original patterns. By varying the polyamine chain length and combustion parameters, we controlled the nanoparticle size, morphology, and crystalline phase. The polyamine morphology affected the resulting inorganic network in both fabrication schemes and we could control the depostion over multiple length scales. Because our methods were compatible with a variety of lithographic methods, we were able to generate inorganic replicas of 1 D, 2 D, and 3 D polymer structures.

40|$|The temperature-dependence of {{the volume}} and surface {{hydrophilicity}} {{of a series of}} water-swollen dense polymer brushes is measured by contact angle measurements in the captive bubble configuration, by ellipsometry, and by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). Thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and poly(di(methoxyethoxy) ethyl methacrylate) (PMEO 2 MA), strongly hydrophilic poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PDMA) and poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (POEGMA), and weakly hydrophilic poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) brushes were synthesized by surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP). Conditions leading to reproducible measurements of the contact angle are first provided, giving access to the surface hydrophilicity. Volume hydrophilicity is quantified by measuring the swelling of the brushes, either by QCM-D or by ellipsometry. A model-free methodology is proposed to analyze the QCM-D data. Comparison between the acoustic and optical swelling coefficients shows that QCM-D is sensitive to the maximal thickness of swollen brushes, while ellipsometry provides an integral thickness. Diagrams of surface versus volume hydrophilicity of the <b>brushes</b> finally <b>lead</b> to identify two types of behavior: strongly water-swollen brushes exhibit a progressive decrease of volume hydrophilicity with temperature, while surface hydrophilicity changes moderately; weakly water-swollen brushes have a close-to-constant volume hydrophilicity, while surface hydrophilicity decreases with temperature. Thermoresponsive brushes abruptly switch from one behavior to the other, and do not exhibit an abrupt change of surface hydrophilicity across their collapse transition contrarily to a common erroneous belief. In general, there is no direct correlation between surface and volume hydrophilicity, because surface properties are dependent on the details of conformation and composition at the surface, whereas volume properties are averaged over a finite region within the brush...|$|R

The sliding contact resistance was periodic in nature, the comparison of contact resistance was by their average values rather than their peak values; an integrator was employed to facilitate the averaging operation. The magnitude of sliding contact resistance was found to be approximately one-thousandth of the normal resistance at liquid air temperature.

40|$|Background: Painters are chronically {{exposed to}} lead based paints, which causes anemia by {{impairing}} heme biosynthesis {{and increasing the}} red cell destruction. The present {{study was conducted to}} assess the lead exposure and haematological effects of <b>lead</b> in <b>brush</b> painters as they are chronically exposed to lead based paints. Objective: To estimate prevalence of anemia among <b>brush</b> painters and <b>lead</b> exposure among them. Methodology: Community based cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 occupational residential brush painters of Mysore city of India during July 2012 and September 2012. Subjects were interviewed using standardized questionnaire, mainly, for lead toxicity symptoms and personal hygiene. Venous blood samples were drawn and haematological parameters were determined (n= 100). The marker of anaemia was haemoglobin concentration. Through Systematic random sampling, 30 samples were selected for blood lead concentration (PbB) estimation. Results: The prevalence of anemia among the subjects was 3 %. The mean hemoglobin concentration was 15. 5 ± 1. 4 g/dL and mean blood lead concentration (PbB) was 12. 9 ± 10. 9 µg/dL. There was no significant correlation found between the PbB and haematological parameters. There was a high prevalence of lead toxicity symptoms and the symptoms were more in the less hygienic subjects than the hygienic subjects. Conclusion: The blood lead concentration among painters is less than the threshold (PbB > 50 µg/dL) for hematological alterations. Hence lead induced anaemia is not a health risk among brush painters. The PbB is also less than the recommended threshold for occupational exposure (30 µg/dL). But the high prevalence of lead toxicity symptoms indicates the long term health effects of lead even at low levels of exposure.

Isolates were obtained from saliva samples of 34 young mothers who had high or moderate salivary levels of mutans streptococci at baseline. Samples were collected on three occasions, before childbirth, when each child was 6 months old, and 1 year later. Of these isolates, 50 % were inhibited at 1 microgram of CHX per ml, 90 % were inhibited at 2. 0 micrograms/ml, and all were inhibited at 4. 0 micrograms/ml. The MICs for Streptococcus mutans isolates (serotypes c, e, and f) were lower than those for Streptococcus sobrinus isolates (serotypes d and g). In some subjects, the MICs for isolates of the same serotype were different. This phenomenon was studied by ribotyping isolates (n = 45) from selected subjects (n = 7). It was found that if there were intraindividual differences in the MICs for isolates of the same serotype, then the ribotypes of these isolates were different.
