5|$|Despite the honours and {{financial}} security she enjoyed, Catherine was preoccupied with reuniting with her children. Intent on finding {{a proxy for}} negotiations with the Sublime Porte, as well as obtaining resources for their release, she turned to Ludovico III Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, on 23 July 1470. On 11 February 1474, she addressed {{a letter to the}} Duke of Milan, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, asking him to help her reach the Ottoman border and enter negotiations. Sforza obliged. In the summer of 1474, the Queen was in Novi, a city in her family's possession. She was accompanied by her brother Vlatko's wife, Margarita Marzano, and probably wanted Vlatko's help in establishing contact with their younger half-brother, Hersekzade Ahmed Pasha, who had converted to Islam and become an Ottoman statesman. Whether she succeeded in that endeavor is not clear, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case she failed to reunite with either of her children. They both followed in their uncle's footsteps, becoming Muslims and, in Sigismund's case, also attaining high-ranking posts in the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

During the early 16th century Vieques became a center of Taíno rebellion against the European invaders, prompting the Spanish to send armed forces to the island to quell the resistance. The native Taíno population was decimated, and its people either killed, imprisoned or enslaved by the Spanish.|$|E

25|$|This anticlericalism was {{not left}} unanswered.

Possibly by Voetius also, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case by someone close to him, was the Resurrected Barnevelt, in which the anonymous writer, writing in Dutch, attacked the provincial-supremacy doctrine and the prayer formulary as an insidious attempt to make the other six provinces subservient to Holland. To which possibly De Witt himself replied with a scalding pamphlet, entitled Schotschen Duyvel in which he denounced Voetius by name as a master-mutineer.|$|E

25|$|Conflicting reports {{survive as}} to when Heke signed the Treaty of Waitangi. He may have signed with the other chiefs on 6 February 1840, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> event, he soon found the {{agreement}} not to his liking. Among other things, Heke objected to the relocation of the capital to Auckland; moreover the Governor-in-Council imposed a customs tariff on staple articles of trade {{that resulted in a}} dramatic fall in the number of whaling ships that visited Kororareka (over 20 whaling ships could anchor in the bay at any time); a {{reduction in the number of}} visiting ships caused a serious loss of revenue to Ngāpuhi. Heke and his cousin Titore also collected and divided a levy of £5 on each ship entering the bay. Pomare felt aggrieved that he could no longer collect payment from American whaling and sealing ships that called at Otuihu across from Opua.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all crops}} and plants, Christmas trees require a {{specific}} set of nutrients to thrive. There are 16elements crucial for growth; of those, three are obtained through air and water: hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, copper, chlorine, manganese, molybdenum, iron, and zinc are obtained from the soil. If the necessary elements are not available in the local soil, nutritious fertilizers are used. Other important soil considerations include pH and drainage. Certain types of soil are preferable, {{depending on the type of}} tree. Pine trees are usually better adapted to a sandy or sandy loam soil, while white spruce trees and fir trees, such as the Douglas-fir, prefer fine-texture loams and clay loam soils. Some trees grow well in all types of soil, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case, the land must be well-drained for a Christmas tree farm to have a chance of thriving.|$|E
25|$|However, they {{recovered}} {{to combine}} in a 382-run partnership in the Fourth Test in Bridgetown, Barbados. Lawry {{went on to}} make 210, his highest Test score, and added a further unbeaten 58 in the second innings of a high-scoring draw before Australia declared. This proved to be rather risky, as the hosts were only 10 runs short of the target when time ran out, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case, the draw was enough to ensure an unassailable 2–0 series lead. Primarily due to that match, he ended the series with 368 runs at 52.57, having made only 3 and 18 not out in the ten-wicket win in a low-scoring Fifth Test. Lawry was consistent in the tour matches against the various countries of the West Indies, his lowest score being 49 in six innings. He made 62 and 134 not out against Trinidad and Tobago and ended with 423 runs at 84.60 in these matches.|$|E

25|$|The traps {{are very}} similar, with leaves whose {{terminal}} section {{is divided into}} two lobes, hinged along the midrib. Trigger hairs (three on each lobe in Dionaea muscipula, many more in the case of Aldrovanda) inside the trap lobes are sensitive to touch. When a trigger hair is bent, stretch-gated ion channels in the membranes of cells {{at the base of the}} trigger hair open, generating an action potential that propagates to cells in the midrib. These cells respond by pumping out ions, which may either cause water to follow by osmosis (collapsing the cells in the midrib) or cause rapid acid growth. The mechanism is still debated, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case, changes in the shape of cells in the midrib allow the lobes, held under tension, to snap shut, flipping rapidly from convex to concave and interring the prey. This whole process takes less than a second. In the Venus flytrap, closure in response to raindrops and blown-in debris is prevented by the leaves having a simple memory: for the lobes to shut, two stimuli are required, 0.5 to 30 seconds apart.|$|E
25|$|After molting, {{the female}} lays a single batch of eggs either within the {{existing}} gallery, or will find new territory {{to start a}} new colony. Here, the eggs hatch into nymphs that resemble small, wingless adults (images right and below). After a short period of parental care, the nymphs undergo hemimetabolosis (moulting into several instars before emerging as a fully grown adult after the last moult), molting a total of four times before reaching adult form. Adult males never eat, and leave the home colony almost immediately to find a female and mate. Those males that can not fly will often mate with females in nearby colonies, meaning their chosen mates are often siblings or closely related. In some species, the female will eat the male after mating, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> event, the male will not survive for long after mating. A few species are known to be parthenogenetic, meaning they are able to produce viable offspring without fertilisation of eggs. This phemonenon occurs when a female is, for whatever reason, unable to find a male to mate with, thus giving her and her species reproductive security at all times.|$|E
25|$|Maps of {{the period}} {{generally}} depicted a large continent named Terra Australis Incognita of highly variable shape and extent. This land was posited by Ptolemy as a counterbalance to the extensive continental areas in the northern hemisphere; {{due to a lack}} of exploration and various misunderstandings, its existence was not fully abandoned until circumnavigation of the area during the second voyage of James Cook in the 1770s showed that if it existed, it was much smaller than imagined previously. The first confirmed landing on Antarctica was not until 1820, and the coastline of Queen Maud Land did not see significant exploration before Norwegian expeditions began in 1891. In 1513, Cape Horn had not yet been discovered, and indeed Ferdinand Magellan's voyage of circumnavigation was not to set sail for another six years. It is unclear whether the mapmaker saw South America itself as part of the unknown southern lands (as shown in the Atlas Miller), or whether (as Dutch thought) he drew what was then known of the coast with substantial distortion, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> case, serious scholarship holds that there is no reason to believe that the map is the product of genuine knowledge of the Antarctic coast.|$|E
