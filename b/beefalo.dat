25|$|According to the US National Bison Association, American bison (also called American buffalo) are not milked commercially; however, {{various sources}} report cows {{resulting}} from cross-breeding bison and domestic cattle are good milk producers, {{and have been}} used both during the European settlement of North America and during the development of commercial <b>Beefalo</b> in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Complicating {{the matter}} {{is the ability of}} cattle to interbreed with other closely related species. Hybrid {{individuals}} and even breeds exist, not only between taurine cattle and zebu (such as the sanga cattle, Bos taurus africanus), but also between one or both of these and some other members of the genus Bosyaks (the dzo or yattle), banteng, and gaur. Hybrids such as the <b>beefalo</b> breed can even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them part of the genus Bos, as well. The hybrid origin of some types may not be obvious – for example, genetic testing of the Dwarf Lulu breed, the only taurine-type cattle in Nepal, found them to be a mix of taurine cattle, zebu, and yak. However, cattle cannot be successfully hybridized with more distantly related bovines such as water buffalo or African buffalo.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, {{the three}} main <b>Beefalo</b> {{registration}} groups reorganized under the American <b>Beefalo</b> World Registry. Until November 2008, there were two <b>Beefalo</b> associations, the American <b>Beefalo</b> World Registry and American <b>Beefalo</b> International. These organizations jointly formed the American <b>Beefalo</b> Association, Inc., which currently operates as the registering body for <b>Beefalo</b> in the United States.|$|E
50|$|A United States Department of Agriculture {{study found}} <b>Beefalo</b> meat, like bison meat, {{to be lower}} in fat and {{cholesterol}} than standard beef cattle. The American <b>Beefalo</b> Association states that <b>Beefalo</b> {{are better able to}} tolerate cold and need less assistance calving than cattle, while retaining domestic cattle's docile nature and fast growth rate. They damage rangeland less than cattle. They also state that <b>Beefalo</b> meat contains 4 to 6% more protein and is more tender, flavorful, and nutritious than a standard steer. <b>Beefalo</b> has significantly less calories, fat, and cholesterol, than beef cattle, chicken, and cod.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Beefalo</b> are {{primarily}} cattle in genetics and appearance, with the breed association defining a full <b>Beefalo</b> as one with three-eighths (37.5%) bison genetics, while animals with higher percentages of bison genetics are called [...] "bison hybrids".|$|E

5000|$|American bison bulls (American [...] "buffalo") {{have been}} crossed with {{domestic}} cattle to produce <b>beefalo</b> and cattalo. These are variable in type and colour, {{depending on the}} breed of cattle used e.g. Herefords and Charolais (beef cattle), Holsteins (dairy) or Brahman (humped cattle). Generally, they are horned with heavy set forequarters, sloping backs and lighter hindquarters. <b>Beefalo</b> have been back-crossed to bison and to domestic cattle; some of these resemble pied bison with smooth coats and a maned hump. The aim is to produce high protein, low fat and low cholesterol beef on animals which have [...] "less hump and more rump". Although bison bull/domestic cow crossings are more usual, domestic bull/bison cow crossings have a lower infant mortality rate (cow immune systems can reject hybrid calves). Modern <b>beefalo</b> include fertile bulls, making the <b>beefalo</b> a variety of [...] "improved cattle" [...] {{with a dash of}} bison. There were suggestions of crossing the <b>beefalo</b> to Cape buffalo, although this idea essentially ended when the Cape buffalo was found to have 52 chromosomes (instead of 60 as in cattle and bison), meaning that the hybrid's success would be unlikely. Bull and cow cattalos are reported in Wonders of Animal Life edited by J A Hammerton (1930).|$|E
5000|$|They may be <b>beefalo,</b> a bison-cattle crossbreed, {{and thus}} have {{inherited}} the white coloration from their cattle ancestry.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, Jim Burnett of Montana {{produced}} a hybrid bull that was fertile. Soon after, Cory Skowronek of California formed the World <b>Beefalo</b> Association and began marketing the hybrids {{as a new}} breed. The new name, <b>Beefalo,</b> was meant to separate this hybrid from {{the problems associated with}} the old cattalo hybrids. The breed was eventually set at being genetically at least five-eighths Bos taurus and at most three-eighths Bison bison.|$|E
50|$|While all bison {{species are}} {{classified}} {{in their own}} genus, they are sometimes bred with domestic cattle (genus Bos) and produce fertile offspring called <b>beefalo</b> or zubron.|$|E
5000|$|The American <b>Beefalo</b> Association {{states that}} the [...] "crossbreeds are hardier, are more {{economical}} (and less care-intensive) to nurture, and produce meat that's superior {{to that of the}} common cow." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Beefalo,</b> also {{referred}} to as cattalo or the American hybrid, are a fertile hybrid offspring of domestic cattle (Bos taurus), usually a male in managed breeding programs, and the American bison (Bison bison), usually a female in managed breeding programs. The breed was created to combine the characteristics of both animals for beef production.|$|E
5000|$|Żubroń ( [...] ; Żubroń; [...] ) is {{a hybrid}} of {{domestic}} cattle and wisent. The wisent (żubr in Polish) is the European bison; hence, the żubroń {{is analogous to the}} American <b>beefalo.</b> The name żubroń was officially chosen from hundreds of proposals sent to the Polish weekly magazine Przekrój during a contest organised in 1969.|$|E
50|$|According to the US National Bison Association, American bison (also called American buffalo) are not milked commercially; however, {{various sources}} report cows {{resulting}} from cross-breeding bison and domestic cattle are good milk producers, {{and have been}} used both during the European settlement of North America and during the development of commercial <b>Beefalo</b> in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Ribs of pork, beef, lamb, and venison are {{a cut of}} meat. The term ribs usually {{refers to}} the less meaty part of the chops, often cooked as a slab (not cut into {{separate}} ribs).

50|$|In 1844, Thomas Need {{sold his}} {{profitable}} business interests to Mossom Boyd, {{and returned to}} England. Boyd and his sons built up a logging enterprise that was recognized as the third largest logging operation in Upper Canada. In addition to timbering, the Boyds also operated a system of steamboats under the name Trent Valley Navigation Company {{as well as an}} experimental <b>beefalo</b> herd on Boyd Island. Descendants of this herd remain in Alberta.|$|E
50|$|Today the American {{is one of}} only a few pure breeds {{with any}} known Bison genetics, with the more {{well-known}} breed being the <b>Beefalo.</b> Art Jones, the original breeder, began by crossing Hereford, Shorthorn and Charolais, and later added extensive crosses with Brahman cattle and Bison. Today all individuals of this rare breed display the genetic marker for Bison ancestry. American cattle are varying in appearance, though nearly all display the floppy Brahman ears, slight humps, and many have horns.|$|E
50|$|The other-worldly {{aspects of}} the series were also {{reflected}} in the remainder of the regular cast, which included Ivan (Billy Morton), a scientist who developed a Time Closet in the confines of the store; Caldicott C. Catt (voiced by John Wilson), a saxophone-playing cat who lived in a basket on the store's counter; and Benjamin (voiced by Rosco Bell), a talking <b>beefalo</b> head hanging on the wall behind the counter. The characters would also frequently travel to alternate dimensions to battle dinosaurs, zombies, and robots.|$|E
50|$|This {{classification}} {{system does not}} account for several complicating factors: genetically modified organisms, feral populations, and hybridization. Many species that are farmed or ranched are now being genetically modified. This creates a unique category of them because it alters the organisms as a group but in ways unlike traditional domestication. Feral organisms are members of a population that was once raised under human control, but is now living and multiplying outside of human control. Examples include mustangs. Hybrids can be wild, domesticated, or both: a liger is a hybrid of two wild animals, a mule is a hybrid of two domesticated animals, and a <b>beefalo</b> is a cross between a wild and a domestic animal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to raising cattle 1876, the Goodnights preserved {{a herd of}} native plains bison that year, which is said to survive to this day in Caprock Canyons State Park. The herd in Caprock Canyons was actually donated by JA Ranch {{and there is no}} documentation demonstrating that this was the herd preserved by the Goodnights. Bison of this herd were introduced into the Yellowstone National Park in 1902 and into the larger zoos and ranches throughout the nation. He also crossbred the bison with domestic cattle, which he called cattalo. Charles [...] "Buffalo" [...] Jones, a co-founder of Garden City, Kansas, after meeting with Goodnight in Texas, also bred cattalo, or <b>beefalo,</b> on a ranch near Grand Canyon National Park in northern Arizona.|$|E
50|$|Wisent-cattle hybrids also occur, {{similar to}} North America <b>beefalo.</b> Cattle and European bison hybridise fairly readily, but the calves cannot be born {{naturally}} (birth is not triggered correctly by the first-cross hybrid calf, {{so they must}} be delivered by caesarian section). First-generation males are infertile. In 1847, a herd of wisent-cattle hybrids named żubroń was created by Leopold Walicki. The animals were intended to become durable and cheap alternatives to cattle. The experiment was continued by researchers from the Polish Academy of Sciences until the late 1980s. Although the program resulted in a quite successful animal that was both hardy and could be bred in marginal grazing lands, it was eventually discontinued. Currently, the only surviving żubroń herd consists {{of just a few}} animals in Białowieża Forest, Poland and Belarus.|$|E

50|$|The American bison and the European bison (Wisent) are {{the largest}} {{surviving}} terrestrial animals in North America and Europe. Bison are good swimmers and can cross rivers over half a mile (800 meters) wide. They are nomadic grazers and travel in herds. The bulls leave the herds of females at {{two or three years}} of age, and join a male herd, which are generally smaller than female herds. Mature bulls rarely travel alone. Towards the end of the summer, for the reproductive season, the sexes necessarily commingle. American bison are known for living in the Great Plains, but formerly had a much larger range including much of the eastern United States and parts of Mexico. Both species were hunted close to extinction during the 19th and 20th centuries, but have since rebounded; the Wisent owing its survival, in part, to the Chernobyl Disaster, ironically, as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has become a kind of wildlife preserve for Wisent and other rare megafauna such as the Przewalski's Horse, though poaching has become a threat in recent years. The American Plains bison is no longer listed as endangered, but this does not mean the species is secure. Genetically pure B. b. bison currently number only ~20,000, separated into fragmented herds—all of which require active conservation measures. The Wood bison is on the endangered species list in Canada and is listed as threatened in the United States, though there have been numerous attempts by <b>beefalo</b> ranchers to have it entirely removed from the Endangered Species List.|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1886, alarmed about the pending {{extinction}} of the bison, Jones set forth from Kendall in Hamilton County, Kansas, toward the Texas Panhandle to find remaining animals. He lassoed eighteen calves and took them safely back to Kansas. Such western authors as Emerson Hough began to notice Jones's contributions. Jones met the pioneer Texas rancher Charles Goodnight, who was crossbreeding buffalo with cattle to produce <b>beefalo,</b> also called cattalo, an otherwise sturdy breed often born sterile. Jones himself later tried producing cattalo. From 1886-1889, Jones accumulated more than 50 head, including a buffalo herd he had purchased in Winnipeg, Manitoba, which required shipment to Garden City. From this herd, Jones sold animals to zoos, parks, or to other ranchers. He personally delivered ten buffalo to a purchaser in Liverpool, England, a task which earned him $10,000, then {{a large amount of}} money. Jones was a victim of the Panic of 1893. A second ranch he purchased in Nebraska failed, and he sold his remaining herd to ranchers in Montana and California. On September 16, 1893, Jones used two horses to make the run for land into the Cherokee Outlet of Oklahoma. In 1897-1898, he traveled to the Arctic Circle, where his party wintered in a cabin they had constructed near the Great Slave Lake. He captured five baby musk oxen, which were afterwards slaughtered by superstitious Indians. Jones' exploits of how he and his party shot and fended off a hungry wolf pack near Great Slave Lake was verified in 1907 by Ernest Thompson Seton and Edward Alexander Preble, when they discovered the remains of the animals near the long abandoned cabin. In 1899, Jones captured a bighorn sheep for the National Zoo in Washington D.C. That same year, with Colonel Henry Inman (1837 - 1899), he published an autobiography, Buffalo Jones' Forty Years of Adventure.|$|E
5000|$|Bison are {{increasingly}} raised for meat and hides; {{the majority of}} American bison {{in the world are}} raised for human consumption. Bison meat is generally considered to taste very similar to beef, but is lower in fat and cholesterol, yet higher in protein than beef, [...] which has {{led to the development of}} <b>beefalo,</b> a fertile hybrid of bison and domestic cattle. [...] In 2005, about 35,000 bison were processed for meat in the U.S., with the National Bison Association and USDA providing a [...] "Certified American Buffalo" [...] program with birth-to-consumer tracking of bison via RFID ear tags. A market even exists for kosher bison meat; these bison are slaughtered at one of the few kosher mammal slaughterhouses in the U.S., and the meat is then distributed nationwide.Bison are found in publicly and privately held herds. Custer State Park in South Dakota is home to 1,500 bison, one of the largest publicly held herds in the world, but some question the genetic purity of the animals. Wildlife officials believe that free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America can be found only in the Yellowstone Park bison herd, the Henry Mountains bison herd at the Book Cliffs and Henry Mountains in Utah, at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Montana, Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary in the Northwest Territories, Elk Island National Park and Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta, and Prince Albert National Park in Saskatchewan. Another population, the Antelope Island bison herd on Antelope Island in Utah, consisting of 550 to 700 bison, is also one of the largest and oldest public herds in the United States, but the bison in that herd are considered to be only semifree roaming, since they are confined to the Antelope Island. In addition, recent genetic studies indicate that, like most bison herds, the Antelope Island bison herd has a small number of genes from domestic cattle. In 2002, the United States government donated some bison calves from South Dakota and Colorado to the Mexican government. Their descendants live in the Mexican nature reserves El Uno Ranch at Janos and Santa Elena Canyon, Chihuahua, and Boquillas del Carmen, Coahuila, located near the southern banks of the Rio Grande, and around the grassland state line with Texas and New Mexico.|$|E

40|$|Jay Hersch ’ 68 {{was at the}} University of Wisconsin from 1960 to 1964. After {{graduating from}} Wisconsin, he applied to Law School at North Western and {{graduated}} school in Agronomy at the University of Wisconsin, though he really {{did not want to}} go back to school. Instead, he wanted to join the Peace Corps (at the time, heavily promoted by Kennedy and Humphrey), so he went to Colombia (was in Cooperative Development). He finished his time there in June of 1966 and was interested in Economic Development and applied to several graduate schools – Columbia, Princeton, SAIS and Tufts – and he chose to come to Washington (SAIS). There, he focused on Development. He recalls some of his favorite professors and that he met his wife at SAIS. Spanish was his language and he had to learn non-colloquial Spanish and remembers having friends from Mexico and other Latin American countries. When he was looking for jobs in his second year, he interviewed with Exxon in New York and with US AID. He ended up working for the Department of Health Education and Welfare as an intern. He recalls the period of 1968 to 1969 being very exciting times (when Nixon came into power). As an intern, he received a tremendous amount of responsibility because no one was threatened by his status. In Cleveland, he worked with Huff Development Corporation and worked on pairing them up with other major corporations. He also got involved with the Ford Foundation and work they did on building brownstone apartments in poor neighborhoods. In addition, he did work on the rural agrarian reform program in Lee County, Georgia. He then went on to work for the Federal Government for the next 17 years. At the beginning, it was exciting and after a while, he reported that it became frustrating. In 1987 or 1988, he decided to branch off and start his own business. He and his wife, he started looking for property in rural Virginia (Highland County) and began started raising a breed of cattle called <b>Beefalo.</b> This triggered his getting involved in the production of healthier, all-natural, leaner meats (later organic). He got involved in market outreach of this leaner meat through Safeway grocery stores and to date, he still owns the corporation, which has evolved to fresh beef and refrigerated sausage. He says that if there is one lesson he would impart to current SAIS students is to embrace serendipity when it happens and to follow leads when they come up. Also, be sure to follow your dreams. ...|$|E
