Manual scoring of micronuclei can be time consuming and large numbers of <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> have to be analyzed to obtain statistically relevant data. Automation of the micronuclei analysis using image processing analysis software can provide a faster and more reliable analysis of micronucleus assay. Here the used of CellProfiler an open access cell image analysis software for automatic detection of <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> and micronuclei were reported. We aimed to know {{whether there was a}} significant difference in the number of <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> and micronuclei that obtained by manual and CellProfiler counting. Wilcoxon Rank test was used for statistical analysis to test H 0 hypothesis that there was no significant difference in the number of <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> and micronuclei that obtained by manual and CellProfiler counting.

50|$|<b>Binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> can be {{observed}} using microscopy. Cells must first be fixed to arrest them wherever {{they are in the}} cell cycle and to keep their structures from degrading. Their nuclei and tubulin must next be made visible so that binucleation can be identified. DAPI is a dye that binds to DNA and fluoresces blue. For this reason, it is particularly useful at labeling nuclei. Antibody probes can be used to label tubulin fluorescently. The immunofluorescence may then {{be observed}} with microscopy. <b>Binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> are most easily identified by viewing tubulin, which surrounds the two nuclei in the <b>cell.</b> <b>Binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> may be mistaken for two cells in close proximity when viewing only nuclei.|$|R

Different concentrations of BPA (0. 48, 1. 2 and 2. 4 mM) and different fluences of thermal neutrons were studied. Substantial genotoxic potential of alpha and lithium particles generated inside or near the malignant cell by the BNC reaction was observed in a dose-response manner {{as measured by the}} frequency of micronucleated binucleated melanoma cells and by the number of micronuclei (MN) per <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell.</b> The distribution of the number of MN per micronucleated <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> was also studied. The BNC reaction clearly modifies this distribution, increasing the frequency of micronucleated cells with 2 and, especially, {{less than or equal to}} 3 MN and conversely decreasing the frequency of micronucleated cells with 1 MN. A decrease in cell proliferation was also observed which correlated with MN formation. A discrete genotoxic and anti-proliferative contribution from both thermal neutron irradiation and BPA was observed and should be considered secondary. Additionally, V 79 Chinese hamster cells (chromosomal aberrations assay) and human lymphocytes (CBMN assay) incubated with different concentrations of BPA alone did not show any evidence of genotoxicity. The presented results reinforce the usefulness of the CBMN assay as an alternative method for assessment of the deleterious effects induced by high LET radiation produced by the BNC reaction in human melanoma cells...|$|E

Three growth patterns can be distinguished. Mononucleating growth is observed during liver regeneration and after treatment with the tumor promoter 2 -acetylaminofluorene (2 -AAF) and its analogue 4 -AAF. In this growth mode binucleation does not occur, resulting in a decrease in the fraction of binucleated cells. Binucleating growth is observed during normal liver development and after treatment with compounds such as phenobarbital, characterized by progressive polyploidization and maintenance of a <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> fraction. Diploid growth is the growth pattern of neoplastic liver hepatocytes. Most of the cells in neoplastic lesions (foci, nodules, and carcinomas) are diploid, in contrast to the normal liver.

40|$|Abstract. A 2 -year-old Sprague-Dawley rat with hindlimb {{paralysis}} {{was diagnosed}} with a cerebral malig-nant astrocytoma. The distinctive feature of this astrocytoma was the presence of scattered <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> that contained hypereosinophilic, 1 – 2 m in diameter, cytoplasmic granules. The neoplastic astrocytes stained positively for vimentin (VIM), lysozyme, and phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin (PTAH). Within the <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells,</b> granules stained with PTAH and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) before and after diastase digestion. Ultra-structurally, neoplastic astrocytes were characterized by cytoplasmic aggregates of electron-dense intermediate filaments consistent with VIM and desmin. The cytoplasm of <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> contained numerous phagoly-sosomes enlarged by myelin figures and glycoprotein or glycolipid. Intermediate filaments were not present. This is the first description, in the rat, of a neoplasm with features resembling the human granular cell astro-cytoma.

At each dose point, the whole blood was exposed in vitro to 2. 5 Gy of X-ray and then the lymphocytes were cultured with mitogenic stimulation to determine the micronuclei in cytokinesis-blocked <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell.</b> Antioxidant capacity of the extract was determined using free radical-scavenging method.

Achillea millefolium extract exhibited concentration-dependent radical-scavenging activity on 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl hydrazyl free radicals.

40|$|Introduction: Chromosomal damage {{measurement}} is one {{of important}} ways to evaluate the toxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity of drugs, chemicals, and rays. The observation that chromosome damage {{can be caused by}} exposure to ionizing radiation or carcinogenic chemicals was among the first reliable evidence that physical and chemical agents can cause major alterations to the genetic material of eukaryotic cells. The Cytokinesis-Blocked Micronucleus (CBMN) assay also allowed us to score the abnormal nuclear shapes (ANS). The CBMN assay in human lymphocytes {{is one of}} the most commonly used methods for measuring DNA damage. Material and methods: The study population included 20 healthy workers exposed to ionizing radiation (radiologist, technicians and nurses) and 20 individuals healthy people not exposed on radiation. Results: We found an high frequency of micronuclei in healthy workers exposed on ionization in comparison with the control group (healthy people not exposed on ionization). Also we evaluate other nuclear changes like nucleoplasmic bridges and <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> with nuclear buds are biomarkers of chromosomal instability and major alterations in genetic material of the cells. Conclusion: These results suggest that chromosomal instability is in the correlation with micronucleus frequencies and genetic load in healthy workers. The formation of micronucleus and other changes indicates that healthy workers are exposed on clastogenic and aneugenic agents like ionizing radiation and have chromosomal instability and risk of cancer. ...|$|E

Enhanced {{chromosomal}} radiosensitivity is {{a feature}} of many cancer predisposition conditions, indic-ative of {{the important role of}} chromosomal alterations in carcinogenesis. In this study the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleous assay was used to compare the radiosensitivity of blood lymphocytes obtained from Iranian breast or esophageal cancer patients (n = 50, n = 16; respectively) with that of control indi-viduals (n = 40). For each sample, one thousand binucleate lymphocytes were analyzed before and after in vitro exposure to 3 Gy of g rays. The radiation-induced frequency of micronucleus was significantly higher in the breast cancer group (261 / 1, 000 <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells)</b> than in esophageal cancer group (241 / 1, 000 <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells,</b> P < 0. 01) or in the control group (240 / 1, 000 <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells,</b> P < 0. 01). The results indicate that breast cancer patients are more radiosensitive compared to normal healthy individuals or esophageal cancer patients. Increased radiosensitivity could be due to defects in DNA repair genes involved in breast cancer formation.

40|$|Previous {{research}} shows that transplanted stem cells {{have the capacity to}} fuse with the cells of the host, including cells within the central nervous system. In particular, bone marrow derived stem cells (BMDCs) are fusionogenic with Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Complete cell fusion results in a <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> and requires the membranes of the two cells to share their cytoplasmic constituents. To date, fusion in the brain has not been reported after transplantation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

We use a combination of techniques including immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy and electron microscopy to show evidence of an early event of potential cell fusion, which we have termed the ?Snuggle Phenomenon?; our transplanted stem cells migrate away from the transplanted area and can be detected in close proximity to, or within, endogenous cells. The contact enables the membranes to interact, leading to expression of stem cell gene (including potentially therapeutic transgenes) expression in the host neuron.

A total of 273 guinea pigs was injected twice with diluted diphtheric toxin subcutaneously. In the early stage various types of degeneration such as myofibrillar lysis, contraction band and myelin figures appeared in the injured cardiac muscle cells. After the l 3 th experimental day these lesion was begun to localized and the cardiac muscle cells which was alive at {{the periphery of the}} foci was hypertrophied and branched. Binucleated cardiac muscle cells appeared also at the periphery. Number of the binuclei was increased up to the maximum during about the 10 th to 15 th experimental day. The maximum population of the binuclei was approximately 64 % by the serial thin sections. Some hypertrophied cardiac muscle cells have myofobril bundles oriented in different dirctions; one bundle in the proper direction of the muscle fibers and the other in an oblique direction coincided with the direction of the adjacent muscle fiber. Deep longitudinal invagination of the sarcolemma was occasionally observed in the hypertrophied cardiac muscle cells. Synthesis of DNA was demonstrated in the <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> by 3 H-thymidine autoradiography and 2 c- 2 c ploidy was also demonstrated by Feulgen cytofluorometry.

The micronucleus assay is widely used in genotoxicity studies or studies on genomic damage in general. We present methodological aspects of cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay performed in human gliomas irradiated in vitro. Eight human glioblastoma cell lines obtained from DSMZ (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Germany) were gamma-irradiated (60 Co) over a dose range of 0 - 10 Gy. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay was performed to quantitate cytogenetic damage. The cells were fixed directly on dishes, stained with fluorochrome DAPI and evaluated under fluorescent and phase contrast microscope. The micronucleus frequency was expressed as a micronuclei (MN) per <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> (BNC) ratio, calculated after scoring at least 100 BNC per dish. The frequency of spontaneous MN ranged from 0. 17 to 0. 613 (mean: 0. 29 ± 0. 14). After irradiation increase of MN frequency {{in the range of}} 0. 312 - 2. 241 (mean: 0. 98 ± 0. 68) was found at 10 Gy. Gliomas are extremely heterogenous in regard to cytogenetic effects of irradiation, as shown in this study by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. This test is easily performed on irradiated glioma cell lines and can assist in determining their radiosensitivity. However, in order to obtain reliable and reproducible results, precise criteria for MN scoring must be strictly followed.

The present work evaluates the effect of boron at a dose of 12 mg/L of water (equivalent to 0. 0686 g of boric acid) given orally for 8, 42 and 49 days to 3 experimental groups of 10 mice each. Liver sections were stained with PAS-hematoxyline (to evaluate glycogen), Mallory (to identify collagen fibers) and Picrosirius red with polarizing light to classify collagen fibers. Results indicate that boron evokes diverse effects in liver. <b>Binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> were evaluated and counted and results were analyzed with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test. Control group (8 -day-old mice) had 22. 9 <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> per 200 hepatocytes and the boron exposed group (8 -day-old mice) showed 28. 5 (p> 0. 05). Therefore, there are not significant differences among these groups. In the 126 -day-old mice, the control group had 43. 9 <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> per 200 hepatocytes and the boron exposed group showed 76. 0, {{a statistically significant difference}} (p< 0. 01). Regarding PAS staining, intensity was classified as low, moderate or intense and analysis was done with the Chi-Square test. All control and experimental groups differed with slight statistical significance (p= 0. 05). With regard to Mallory staining, intensity was examined in two specific areas: portal triads (PTr) and central veins (CV). There were significant augments in both PTr and CV results after experimental and control groups comparison. Picrosirius red staining examined in polarized microscopy revealed that collagen III was predominant in boron treated mice, denoting collagenolysis of collagen I as toxical effect of boron.

The number of micronuclei did not rank the cell lines {{in the same order}} of radiosensitivity as clonogenic cell survival, which showed a surviving fraction at 2 Gy of 0. 38 ± 0. 02 for JR 8, 0. 34 ± 0. 05 for M 14 and 0. 22 ± 0. 007 for A 2780.

40|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{the repair}} of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is mainly mediated by DNA non-homologous end joining. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a nuclear serine-threonine kinase {{and a member}} of the phosphaditylinositol- 3 kinase-related kinase family that is activated by DSBs, is a key component of this pathway. Wortmannin (WM) is known to be an irreversible and potent inhibitor of DNA-PK and has thus been proposed as an effective sensitizer for ionizing radiation and for radiomimetic compounds. The present study, using the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay, reports on the differ-ential effect of WM on the repair of the DNA damage induced by low LET (60 Co γ-radiation) and high LET radiation by the boron neutron capture reaction (α and Li particles) in V 79 Chinese hamster cells. Significant increases in the number of micronuclei per <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> as well as in the frequency of micronucleated binucleated cells were observed in the presence of different concentra-tions of WM for high LET radiation from the boron neutron capture reaction. The increases observed reached a maximum of ~ 2 -fold in comparison with the respective controls. WM, however, had a more pronounced effect on 60 Co γ-radiation-induced micronuclei, increasing the genotoxic damage from this radiation by ~ 3 - to 4 -fold. These results are in general in agreement with the concept that DSBs induced by high LET radiation are not a more suitable substrate for the end joining processes mediated by DNA-PK, yet they do not preclude a role for DNA-PK in high LET-induced damage repair...|$|E

40|$|Pleural {{malignant}} mesothelioma is an uncommon neoplasm {{usually associated with}} asbestos exposure. The increasing incidence of {{malignant mesothelioma}} cases involving individuals {{with low levels of}} asbestos exposure suggests a complex carcinogenetic process with the involvement of other cofactors. Cytogenetic studies revealed the complexity of the genetic changes involved in this neoplasm reflecting the accumulation of genomic damage. One of the most used methodologies for assessing genomic damage is the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus test applied in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). This approach allows the detection of chromosomal alterations expressed in <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> after nuclear division in vitro. This marker could provide a tool for assessing genetically determined constitutional differences in chromosomal instability. A biomonitoring study was carried out to evaluate the micronuclei frequency in PBLs of patients with pleural malignant mesothelioma with respect to lung cancer, healthy, and risk controls as a marker of cancer susceptibility in correlation with the presence of SV 40. A significant increased micronuclei frequency was observed in patients with malignant mesothelioma in comparison with all the other groups, the mean micronuclei frequency was double in patients with malignant mesothelioma compared with healthy controls, risk controls, and patients with lung adenocarcinoma (median 11. 4 <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> with micronuclei/ 1, 000 <b>binucleated</b> <b>cells</b> versus 6. 2, 6. 1, and 5. 1, respectively).

Key words: DNA repair rates, genotoxicity, styrene exposure, urinar...|$|R
40|$|Loranthus micranthus (LM) {{is one of}} the Nigerian folk {{medicinal}} plants used chronically for the management of immuno-depressive illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, cancer and hypertension. There has not been report on the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of the plant. This study was conducted to investigate the cytotoxic, mitodepressive and genotoxic effects of LM against Allium cepa root cells. The roots of Allium cepa (onion bulb) were exposed to different concentrations (2. 5 - 40 mg/mL) of L. micranthus aqueous leaf extract (LMAE) using NaN 3 (100 ug/mL) and distilled water as positive and negative controls and examined macroscopically and microscopically for toxic effects. Phytochemical screening of the plant was also carried out using conventional methods. LMEA was found to significantly (p 0. 05) at 5 mg/mL compared to the control and did not display significant variation in activity between 20 and 40 mg/mL concentrations respectively (p> 0. 05). Furthermore, LMAE at 10 mg/mL was found to produce the highest number of aberrant cells but failed to elicit c-mitosis found only at 40 mg/mL. LMAE at 5 mg/mL produced the least number of aberrant cells and also failed to induce micronucleus and <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> formation found mostly at 40 mg/mL. Chromosomal aberrations including stickiness, multipolar anaphase and lagging chromosomes, breaks and bridges were induced by all the extract concentrations tested but not dose-dependently. Tannins, alkaloids, saponins and flavonoids were also present in the extract. Our findings indicate that LM is cytotoxic, mitodepressive and genotoxic to Allium cepa especially at doses beyond pharmacological range in vitro and suggest for safety reasons, the continuous use of this plant at lower concentrations for human phytomedicine coupled with a need to conduct further in vivo genotoxic tests...|$|E
40|$|Adverse {{health effects}} of {{airborne}} toxicants, especially small respirable particles and their associated adsorbed chemicals, are of growing concern to health professionals, governmental agencies, and the general public. Areas rich in petrochemical processing facilities (e. g., eastern Texas and southern California) chronically have poor air quality. Atmospheric releases of products of incomplete combustion (e. g., soot) from these facilities {{are not subject to}} rigorous regulatory enforcement. Although soot can include respirable particles and carcinogens, the toxicologic and epidemiologic consequences of exposure to environmentally relevant complex soots have not been well investigated. Here we continue our physico-chemical analysis of butadiene soot and report effects of exposure to this soot on putative targets, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. We examined organic extracts of butadiene soot by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), probe distillation MS, and liquid chromatography (LC) -MS-MS. Hundreds of aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with molecular mass as high as 1, 000 atomic mass units were detected, including known and suspected human carcinogens (e. g., benzo(a) pyrene). Butadiene soot particles also had strong, solid-state free-radical character in electron spin resonance analysis. Spin-trapping studies indicated that fresh butadiene soot in a buffered aqueous solution containing dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) oxidized the DMSO, leading to CH(3) * radical formation. Butadiene soot DMSO extract (BSDE) -exposed NHBE cells displayed extranuclear fluorescence within 4 hr of exposure. BSDE was cytotoxic to > 20 % of the cells at 72 hr. Morphologic alterations, including cell swelling and membrane blebbing, were apparent within 24 hr of exposure. These alterations are characteristic of oncosis, an ischemia-induced form of cell death. BSDE treatment also produced significant genotoxicity, as indicated by <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> formation. The combination of moderate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, as occurred here, can be pro-carcinogenic...|$|E
40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, before {{the onset of}} anaphase, the spindle {{apparatus}} is always positioned with one spindle pole at, or through, the neck between the mother cell and the growing bud. This spindle orientation enables proper chromosome segregation to occur during anaphase, allowing one replicated genome to be segregated into the bud and the other to remain in the mother cell. In this study, we synchronized a population of cells {{before the onset of}} anaphase such that > 90 % of the cells in the population had spindles with the correct orientation, and then disrupted specific cytoskeletal elements using temperature-sensitive mutations. Disruption of either the astral microtubules or actin function resulted in improper spindle orientation in approximately 40 - 50 % of the cells. When cells with disrupted astral microtubules or actin function entered into anaphase, there was a 100 - 200 -fold increase in the frequency of <b>binucleated</b> <b>cell</b> bodies. Thus, the maintenance of proper spindle orientation by these cytoskeletal elements was essential for proper chromosome segregation. These data are consistent with the model that proper spindle orientation is maintained by directly or indirectly tethering the astral microtubules to the actin cytoskeleton. After nuclear migration, but before anaphase, bulk chromosome movement occurs within the nucleus apparently because the chromosomes are attached to a mobile spindle. The frequency and magnitude of bulk chromosome movement is greatly diminished by disruption of the astral microtubules but not by disruption of the nonkinetochore spindle microtubules. These results suggest that astral microtubules are not only important for spindle orientation before anaphase, but they also mediate force on the spindle, generating spindle displacement and in turn chromosome movement. Potential roles for this force in spindle assembly and orientation are discussed...|$|E
