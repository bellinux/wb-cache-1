This will reduce the dependence on imported Bentonite into the country, increase foreign exchange, improve the countrys economy and create employment opportunities. Approach: Three clay samples from different locations within Pindiga Formation were collected using standard sampling procedure and brought to the laboratory for the study. Evaluation of Loss On Ignition (LOI) was carried out using Labocon Furnace (model 2 - 1200), elemental composition of the samples were determined using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) while mineralogical phases of the samples were determined by X-Ray Diffractometry. Results: Results of analysis of crude <b>Bentonitic</b> <b>clays</b> indicates that the clays are Ca-based which require some level of beneficiation before they can attain the properties that will qualify its use in oil well drilling, while other properties such as Aluminum-Silicon ration which ranges between 0. 34 - 0. 39 as against 0. 38 for the standard Wyoming Bentonite, LOI ranges between 14. 8 - 15. 63 as against 15. 73 for the standard and fineness of the samples all attained the required standard even before beneficiation. After beneficiating the samples, their rheological and other physical properties {{was found to have}} improved to a level that is acceptable for use in oil well drilling except for yield points which was still lower.

The lack of detailed hydrogeological studies in this area motivated this study that had the objective of verifying the hypothesis that sand mining pits interfere on the quality and storage of the water in the quaternary sedimentary aquifer. This study focused specifically {{in the eastern part of}} the Tremembé Municipality, São Paulo State, in a mining place called “Mineração Paraíso”. The investigation involved infiltration and flow tests, laboratory analyses of soil physical parameters and estimation, water quality indices and infrastructure construction for equipment installation including piezometers, dynamic penetration tests – (SPT - Standard Penetration Test), wells opening and office analyses. The soil physical parameters analyses revealed high porosity (66 %) in the friable soils. This in addition to the high levels of transmissivity (15. 5 m 2 /h measured in Well 1 and 33 m 2 /h in Well 3), obtained from the flow test, increases the speed of the transportation of solutes including bacteria, to the underground water. Results of the granulometric analyses showed that the sand mining technique is not only predatory, but also inefficient, since the sand at the bottom of the pit is left unexploited, as well as the bentonite clay found in the deeper layers. According to the penetration tests (SPT), the aquifer has an average thickness of 5. 5 m and an upper layer of impermeable organic clays that confine the sand deposits. Furthermore, an aquiclude composed of green <b>bentonitic</b> <b>clays</b> was identified just below the confined layer. However, it is necessary to point out that the confinement condition is lost as soon as the organic soil layer is removed during mining exploitation and the sandy deposits starts to have direct contact with freely circulating air in the atmosphere, therefore the aquifer becomes unconfined. With reference to the results concerning the water quality, the ammoniac nitrogen element was found in a concentration greater than expected, both in the wells and in the active pits. This occurs due to the release of tillage soil, rich in urea (ammonium nitrate), which is removed for the installation of sand mining dredgers. Heterotrophic bacteria were found in the groundwater. Therefore, the negative interference of sand mining pits in the quality and storage of the water in the quaternary sedimentary aquifer was proved...|$|R
