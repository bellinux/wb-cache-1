50|$|Polyacrylonitrile (PAN), {{also known}} as Creslan 61, is a synthetic, {{semicrystalline}} organic polymer resin, with the linear formula (C3H3N)n. Though it is thermoplastic, it does not melt under normal conditions. It degrades before melting. It melts above 300 °C if the heating rates are 50 degrees per minute or above. Almost all polyacrylonitrile resins are copolymers made from mixtures of monomers with acrylonitrile as the main component. It is a versatile polymer used to produce large variety of products including ultra filtration membranes, hollow fibers for reverse osmosis, fibers for textiles, oxidized PAN fibers. PAN fibers are the chemical precursor of high-quality carbon fiber. PAN is first thermally oxidized in air at 230 degrees Celsius to form an oxidized PAN fiber and then carbonized above 1000 degrees Celsius in inert atmosphere to make carbon fibers found {{in a variety of}} both high-tech and common daily applications such as civil and military aircraft primary and secondary structures, missiles, solid propellant rocket motors, pressure vessels, fishing rods, tennis rackets, <b>badminton</b> <b>rackets</b> & high-tech bicycles.

Designing a racket requires a comprehensive understanding of racket performance characteristics.

Determining a coefficient of restitution can help to identify the sweet spot on a racket. By analyzing several head shape designs, it becomes apparent that isometric head shape rackets produce better coefficients of restitution compared to oval and round ones. It is recommended that the racket design consist of low string tension, stiffer racket shafts and bigger head size in order to produce higher shuttlecock speed...|$|E

40|$|Badminton, {{said to be}} {{the worlds}} fastest ball sport, is a fairly unknown sport from a {{scientific}} point of view. There has been great progress made to get from the old wooden rackets of the 19 th century to the light-weight high performance composite ones used today, but the development process is based on a trial and error method rather than on scientific knowledge. The limited amount of existing studies indicate that racket parameters like shaft stiffness, center of gravity and head geometry affect the performance of the racket greatly. These studies have either been physical test with limit number of data points or simplified computer simulations. In this work a parametric study of racket models is performed with the purpose to find key racket design parameters using Finite Element Analysis, FEA. Eleven racket models are simulated using one smash and one clear swing. One is the reference model, based on a modern isometric racket, and the other ten have one parameter modified to see how this alters the response. In addition to the swing tests, the sweet spots of the racket head is analysed and the eigenmodes of the racket are investigated. The results show that the previously mentioned parameters have a noticeable effect on racket performance. A low shaft stiffness may give higher shuttle velocities if used correctly, and an inconsistent shuttle speed and trajectory if used incorrectly. High center of gravity has a less inconsistent effect but instead would require more effort to swing. Noticeable is that the Y-shaped head introduced by Prince, which since has been removed from the market, perform very well in some aspects. These results show that FEA should be seen as a useful tool in <b>badminton</b> <b>racket</b> development and with further work on the field advances can be made that would make badminton the definitive fastest ball sport in the world.

40|$|Due to the {{increase}} in the applications of foils, fibres, and yarns under dynamic loading, characterizing the behaviour of small-scaled material samples at high strain rates has become important. However, owing to the low mechanical impedance and the small size of such samples, the conventional split Hopkinson bar technique encounters serious problems, such as high noise-to-signal ratios, an undistinguishable transmitted signal, a short loading time, and difficulty in achieving large strain. A mini-split Hopkinson tensile bar (mini-SHTB) system has been developed to measure the constitutive relation of micro-scaled material specimens under high strain rates. The system employs polymeric bars of small diameter to achieve a closer impedance match with the specimens. This match ensures a lower noise-to-signal ratio in the transmitted signals and hence allows correct interpretation of the transmitted strain profiles. A series of experiments were carried out on different types and forms of material, such as aluminium foil, cellulose nitrate foil, <b>badminton</b> <b>racket</b> string, and so forth, to verify the applicability of the apparatus. Strain rates in the order of 10 (2) were attained under this mini-SHTB system.

40|$|Due to the {{increase}} in application of foils, fibers and yarns under dynamic loading, characterizing the behavior of materials at high rates of strain becomes important. It is known that adequate experimental techniques, such as the Split Hopkinson Bar technique, have been established for measuring the dynamic behavior of materials at high strain rates. However, due to the low mechanical impedance and small size of the polymer or composite specimens, the conventional Split Hopkinson Bar technique would encounter serious problems, such as unacceptable high noise-to-signal ratios, undistinguishable transmitted signal, short loading time and achieving the maximum strain. In this research project, a mini-Split Hopkinson Tensile Bar (mini-SHTB) system has been developed to measure the constitutive relation of micro-scaled material specimens under high strain rates. The system employs polymeric bars of small diameter to achieve a closer impedance match with the specimens. This match ensures a lower noise-to-signal ratio in the transmitted signals and hence allows correct interpretation of the transmitted strain profiles. The incident wave of the mini-SHTB is generated by the action of a pendulum. The magnitude and duration of the pulse are controlled by the use of a pulse shaper. The specimen under test is gripped by a special fixture to avoid slippage occurring during rapid loading. Since the bar material is visco-elastic in nature, the one dimensional elastic wave theory is no longer applicable. Linear visco-elastic models are used to correct the dispersion and attenuation of waves propagating in visco-elastic bars. To correlate the strain signals at the measurement points to the bar-specimen interface and to reconstruct the stress and particle velocity at the ends of the specimen, the characteristic method is applied. This visco-elastic analysis method is verified with a simple experiment. Good agreement is demonstrated between the analytical prediction and experimental measurement. A series of experiments were carried out on different types and forms of material, such as aluminum foil, cellulose nitrate foil, <b>badminton</b> <b>racket</b> string and so forth, to verify the applicability of the apparatus. Strain rates in the order of 102 were attained under this mini-SHTB.

40|$|AbstractBadminton {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular racket sports for which the grip remains crucial for performance. For {{ergonomic}} purposes, the hand–handle interface of tennis racket has been studied quite extensively. However, the literature shows a very limited knowledge on badminton grip force intensity. Particularly, the relationship between grip force and different badminton strokes is still poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to measure the differences of grip force intensity between four basic badminton strokes, forehand (FH), backhand (BH), smash (SH) and net roll (NR). Ten asymptomatic adult badminton players took part in this study. Grip force was recorded using an embedded capacitive pressure-sensing mat (TekScan 9811) wrapped around a <b>badminton</b> <b>racket</b> handle, from which total grip force could be determined. The sensor was loaded using a force rating of 0 - 1000 N (R 2 = 0, 93) and the sampling rate was 500 Hz. The subjects were instructed to hit 20 shuttlecocks, for each stroke, into a target on the court. Only successful trials were analyzed. A one-way repeated measure ANOVA (stroke) was used to compare the effect of grip force. Tukey post-hoc test was used when significant level (p<. 05) was reached. Average peak force magnitude was 117, 0 N± 45, 7 N, 166, 1 N± 58, 3 N, 209, 0 N± 56, 1 N and 83, 8 N± 59, 2 N for FH, BH, SH and NR conditions respectively. The statistical analysis revealed that grip force applied on the handle was strongly depending upon the stroke, NR grip force was significantly greater than BH (p<. 01) and SH (p<. 01) grip force. Moreover, the grip force applied in the SH condition was higher than BH condition (p<. 01). Data analysis showed that each player had an individual grip force pattern repeatable, but it was observed a strong intersubject variability. The strokes in badminton are a mix of power, precision and manoeuvrability. These characteristics appear to be contradictory: e. g. the literature shows that an increase grip force (power) led to a decrease in wrist motion (manoeuvrability). The main result of the present study is that the subjects took into account these constraints and the type of the strokes by adapting their grip force. Particularly, the precision (NR) and power stroke (SH) were inversely related: a lower grip force led to a greater precision probably allowed by a greater wrist range of motion...|$|R
40|$|The file {{attached}} to this record is the author's final peer reviewed version. The Publisher's final version can be found by following the DOI link. This article questions the current hegemony regarding the drafting of integrity measures such as anti -doping in modern equine based sport. The examples of the Olympic equestrian sports and British Horse Racing Authority (BHA) regulated racing are used to illustrate the current flaws {{and the level of}} crisis facing integrity in horse sport. The regulations concerned differ in form but they contain common ground such as a fondness for strict liability and reverse burdens of proof. It is evident that these concepts, particularly strict liability, are drawn from common law traditions as continental legal systems on the whole have only fault based liability. It is also true to say that these concepts have been applied in regulations based on the WADA Code, such as the FEI’s EADCMRs and others with a similar function such as the Orders and Rules of Racing without much proper thought as to their suitability. The received truth appears to be that it is perfectly reasonable to apply a sanction to a human rider because there has been a doping infraction in the horse. This is because the horse is viewed as a piece of equipment that has been tampered with rather like a ski or a <b>badminton</b> <b>racket.</b> This view of the horse is challenged in this article as the horse has to be re-imagined in the context of post-modern human society. First of all, using evidence from literary, industrial art and military history, arts sport and culture in the modern day this article shows that the elite sport horse is now socially constructed as an ‘athlete-celebrity’. It is therefore unconscionable that strict liability and reverse burdens should be applied in equine cases because the infraction happens in the body of a non-autonomous non-human athlete but the sanction is applied to the mind of an athlete of a different species altogether. A case study is presented of an CAS award just before the 2012 London Games in order to demonstrate the inequities present in horse sport regulation like no other. It is further evident that SGBs can no longer rest easy in the knowledge that they cannot be challenged on procedural grounds as they are not public bodies for the purposes of Judicial Review and human rights actions. There has been a leaching of human rights, natural justice and Judicial Review concepts into private law actions which can be identified in current case law. It is therefore now possible to foresee the decisions of SGBs being judicially reviewed through private law claims. There is however an alternative way of drafting regulations which British Thoroughbred racing has been presented with during a major review. It was suggested that new Orders and Rules of Racing could be drafted according to a number of underpinning principles. The rules themselves should not be too detailed in order to allow them to be applied as flexibly as possible. This represents a real departure from the traditional methods of drafting integrity regulations which have mostly relied on literal interpretation. This article proposes this new method of drafting, coupled with purposive interpretation by tribunals, is the alternative hegemony horse sport desperately needs...|$|R
