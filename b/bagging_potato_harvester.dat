40|$|The {{effect of}} the forward speed of a <b>potato</b> <b>harvester</b> on tubers damage was investigated. The <b>potato</b> <b>harvester</b> type is a two-row potato digger with riddle chain. The {{experiments}} were conducted in a potato field of Haradh Project of the National Agricultural Development Company (NADEC) east of Riyadh, in a sandy loam soil, and for a potato crop planted during the spring season of 2004. The potato type was Hermes (oval graded tubers). The degging depth was set to 22 cm, and the amplitudes of riddle chain of the implement were 17 and 25 mm. Results showed that the average values of tubers lifting percentage were in close agreement for all forward speed values (1. 5, 1. 7, and 2 km/h) of the <b>potato</b> <b>harvester.</b> However, it ranged between 96 % and 99 %. It was found {{that there is no}} significant {{effect of the}} forward speed on both total damaged tubers percentage and damage index. However, {{there was a significant difference}} for the damaged tubers percentage when the amplitude of riddle chain was changed from 17 to 25 mm, where it decreased as the amplitude was increased.

50|$|<b>Potato</b> <b>harvesters</b> are {{machines}} that harvest potatoes. They work by lifting the potatoes {{from the bed}} using a share. Soil and crop are transferred onto a series of webs where the loose soil is sieved out. The potatoes are moved towards {{the back of the}} harvester on to a separation unit and then (on manned machines) to a picking table where people pick out the stones, clods, and haulms by hand. The potatoes then go on to a side elevator and into a trailer or a potato box.|$|R

40|$|For uniform quality, {{potatoes}} must {{be sufficiently}} ventilated during their storage in boxes. Soil {{and other foreign}} material that enters the box together with the harvest can impede ventilation. The proportion and distribution of foreign material in the potato boxes are therefore of interest, as both parameters have a crucial influence on the ventilation of the potatoes. In connection with the testing of a <b>potato</b> <b>harvester</b> that fills the potatoes in storage boxes on the machine, {{the aim was to}} clarify what proportion and what distribution the foreign material assumes in the box. For reference purposes boxes located on a transport vehicle were filled from the <b>potato</b> <b>harvester</b> hopper too. The content of foreign material and its distribution in the storage boxes were determined using a tipping method and a sampling cylinder method. The examinations were concentrated on foreign material with a diameter of less than 2 cm. In addition, {{the extent to which the}} storage boxes were filled was determined by weighing. It turned out that filling the boxes on the harvester leads to uniform distribution of foreign material by contrast with filling boxes located on the transport vehicle. Thanks to gentle filling on the harvester, the clods did not disintegrate into loose soil so that there was only a small proportion of foreign material with a diameter of less than 2 cm...|$|R

40|$|Background: Mechanization rate of dryland crop {{production}} in Korea is about 56 %, {{and especially the}} rate is very low (13. 3 %) for harvesting operation. Recently, precision agriculture technologies including real-time yield monitoring sensors are in demand by female and aged farmers for user comfort. Purpose {{of the study was}} to conduct basic tests of yield monitoring sensors for small-sized Korean <b>potato</b> <b>harvesters.</b> Methods: Candidate sensing modules were selected for mass flow (i. e., load cell) and volume flow (i. e., CCD camera) measurements on the way of potato transportation from the digging part to the collection part. Laboratory test bench was constructed using a commercial <b>potato</b> <b>harvester</b> available in Korea, and the sensing modules were instrumented at the end of the transportation part. Calibration tests were conducted with sample potatoes. Effects of speed of the transportation part, distance between the transportation part and sensing module, vibration and slope of the test body were investigated. Results and discussions: Calibration tests of the mass flow sensor provided fairly good results with R 2 of 0. 95 and RMSE of 11 g. The performance of the mass flow sensor was significantly affected by the number of load cell, and vibration and slope of the test body. The volume-based sensor also showed good results with R 2 of 0. 91 and RMSE of 12 g. The performance was significantly affected by the vibration and slope of the test body. Effects of the speed of the transportation part, and distance between the transportation part and sensing module were not statistically significant within the tested conditions. Conclusion: Both of the mass flow and volume flow approaches showed promising results. Further tests should be conducted to minimize the effects of vibration and slope of the test body, especially considering the harvesting field conditions...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{which helps}} detecting in-line potato tubers without singulation {{when they are}} mixed with clods was developed. It is particularly useful for sorting and grading purposes whether at the packhouses or the <b>potato</b> <b>harvester.</b> The algorithm scans images which include clusters of tubers and clods {{from left to right}} until it encounters a cluster. Once encountered, a scan around the periphery of the cluster starts until returning to the original point where the scanning around the periphery started. At the end of the periphery scanning, the periphery pixels are erased and the new width of the cluster is compared with the previous width. Contouring the periphery continues until a sudden shrink in the width of the cluster occurs which indicates the detection of a contact point. The left-to-right scanning resumes from the contact point until it reaches the right end of the image repeating the periphery scanning every time a cluster is encountered. The algorithm was tested by detecting 380 contact points between tubers and 112 contact points between tubers and clods. Results showed that approximately 99 % of the contact points were detected successfully. It was found that the only reason of error was the lack of cusp between a tuber and a clod when the clod did not have an oval shape. It could be concluded that the algorithm is able to detect any contact point between any oval shaped adjacent objects as long as they form a cusp between them, which is guaranteed between any adjacent tubers. Therefore, the algorithm can be applied at the packhouses to replace the long, bulky and expensive conveyors needed to create spaces between the in-line potato tubers so as to aid machine vision-based size grading. Moreover, the algorithm can be used at the <b>potato</b> <b>harvester</b> to help in discriminating between the touching tubers and clods so as to automate the removal of the clods during harvesting...|$|R

2500|$|At harvest time, gardeners usually dig up {{potatoes}} with a long-handled, three-prong [...] "grape" [...] (or graip), i.e., a spading fork, or a potato hook, {{which is similar}} to the graip but with tines at a 90° angle to the handle. In larger plots, the plow is the fastest implement for unearthing potatoes. Commercial harvesting is typically done with large <b>potato</b> <b>harvesters,</b> which scoop up the plant and surrounding earth. This is transported up an apron chain consisting of steel links several feet wide, which separates some of the dirt. The chain deposits into an area where further separation occurs. Different designs use different systems at this point. The most complex designs use vine choppers and shakers, along with a blower system to separate the potatoes from the plant. The result is then usually run past workers who continue to sort out plant material, stones, and rotten potatoes before the potatoes are continuously delivered to a wagon or truck. Further inspection and separation occurs when the potatoes are unloaded from the field vehicles and put into storage.|$|R
