5|$|Manning's first start, a Tennessee {{homecoming}} {{game against}} Washington State, {{resulted in a}} 109 win. Things got progressively better for the Volunteers after Manning assumed the starting role, as they won six of their final regular-season games. The sole loss was a 1317 defeat {{at the hands of}} then-No. 10 Alabama in Knoxville. The loss was merely a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> the road, however, as Tennessee won all four regular-season games that followed, ending the regular season with a 650 drubbing of in-state rival Vanderbilt. In response to Fulmer's success at turning the team around from a slow start, he was awarded with a one-year contract extension by the university.|$|E
5|$|Stratigeas {{made her}} debut as a villainous {{character}} on the March 19, 2000 episode of Sunday Night Heat, under the ring name Trish Stratus. She appeared on stage to scout Test and Prince Albert. The next night on Raw, Stratus began her first {{role in the}} company, managing Test and Albert in the tag team T & A. It was during her stint managing T & A that Stratus took her first major <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> the ring, by being driven through a table by the Dudley Boyz at Backlash, after she had been taunting Bubba Ray Dudley for several weeks. In June, {{she was on the}} receiving end of a stink face from Rikishi on Raw.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, the CUWBC rowed <b>in</b> the men's <b>bumps</b> races, <b>in</b> the 8th division. CUWBC succeeded <b>in</b> <b>bumping</b> a men's crew only 7 times (in {{both the}} Lent and May <b>Bumps)</b> <b>in</b> the 12 years that they competed, often being bumped very quickly, {{and on one}} {{occasion}} getting triple-overbumped. CUWBC last competed <b>in</b> the <b>bumps</b> <b>in</b> 1973 - the following year, the first dedicated women's bumping races began.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} days of the Lent and May Bumps, Selwyn spent a lot of time in the 2nd division, but rose sharply from the mid-1920s, {{reaching}} 3rd <b>in</b> the May <b>Bumps</b> throughout the early 1930s and 2nd <b>in</b> the Lent <b>Bumps</b> <b>in</b> 1933. By 1958, Selwyn's 1st VIII had found its way back into the 2nd division. Selwyn once again gained 2nd place <b>in</b> the Lent <b>Bumps</b> <b>in</b> 1974 and 4th <b>in</b> the May <b>Bumps</b> <b>in</b> 1979, but has since fallen. The men's 1st VIII currently (...) lies 7th in the 2nd Division of Lent <b>Bumps,</b> and 10th <b>in</b> the 1st Division <b>in</b> the May <b>Bumps.</b>|$|R
5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E

About 30 of the many species in this family, in their larval stage, attach to various animals and feed on skin. This often causes an intensely itchy, red <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> humans.|$|E
25|$|Shoulder pain or {{tenderness}} and, occasionally, a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> {{the middle}} of the top of the shoulder (over the AC joint) are signs that a separation may have occurred.

25|$|Another {{estimate}} {{puts the}} current number of board wargamers in the 15,000 range (this {{is limited to}} people purchasing games, which leaves some room for groups with one person who buys the games, or people who stick to older titles—who do exist, but are cold comfort for publishers). During 2006, several publishers reported that sales were up, but this could remain a short-term <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> sales.|$|E
50|$|A women's crew did {{not appear}} until 1986 and has {{remained}} in the 2nd division {{for most of the}} time since then in both the Lent and May Bumps, although the 1st women's VIII did succeed in breaking into the 1st division <b>in</b> the May <b>Bumps</b> <b>in</b> 2002 for the first time.

They also played a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> his memory that talked about his work for Adult Swim, and then his name, year of birth, and year of death, with a slow fade in and fade out, like bumps for other deaths. This bump was 30 seconds, while most regular bumps are half of that time.|$|E

25|$|Cauliflower ear is a {{blood clot}} that forms under the skin in the ear, causing {{there to be a}} large <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> the ear; the bump tends to be {{extremely}} hard. To develop cauliflower ear one must be hit in the ear many times or hit hard for it to form into {{a blood clot}}. When having cauliflower ear it is important to get the ear drained of liquid that has built up. Otherwise the ear will require surgery to return to normal shape and size. The best way to prevent cauliflower is to wear headgear. This will protect your ears from taking hard hits.|$|E
25|$|Studies suggest gender {{differences}} in the reminiscence bump. Researchers found that men have more positive life events in their thirties and that women have more positive life events in their twenties. This finding suggests that the timing of important positive life events, such as marriage or employment, differ for men and women. Most of the major life events start between the age of 15 and 30 but there is a small gender difference shown here with respect to when the event takes place. Researchers found that women have a slightly earlier bump than men. The earlier age of the <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> women may be attributed to earlier hormonal changes in adolescence.|$|E
25|$|When either {{wheel is}} {{deflected}} upward, the center {{span of the}} spring (the portion between the pivotable mounts) deflects downward. If both wheels deflect upward {{at the same time}} (for example, when hitting a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> the road) the center section bends uniformly between the pivot mounts. In a roll, only one wheel is deflected upwards, which tends to form the center of the spring into an S-shaped curve. The result is that the wheel rate of one side of the suspension depends on the displacement of the other side. The extent to which the spring acts as an anti-roll bar depends on the distance between the pivot mounts and their rigidity.|$|E

25|$|The Spurs christened the SBC Center {{in style}} on November 1, 2002 by {{defeating}} the Toronto Raptors 91–72. The Spurs {{would not get}} off to a flying start as they had just a 19–13 record heading into January. In January the Spurs began to gel and seemed prepped to make a run, when they embarked on their annual Rodeo Road Trip, a nine-game road trip from January 25 to February 16. However, it would be hardly a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> the road for the charging Spurs, who won eight of the nine and began to climb their way to first place. The Spurs went on to erase their seven-game deficit and finished the season in a tie with the Dallas Mavericks for {{the best record in the}} NBA (60–22). Thanks to a tiebreaker, the Spurs won their third straight Division title as Tim Duncan claimed his second straight NBA MVP.|$|E
25|$|After their disappointing {{second round}} collapse, the Spurs looked {{to regain the}} NBA crown. With the {{acquisition}} of guard Brent Barry from Seattle, the Spurs would {{get off to a}} quick start, posting a 12–3 record in November. The Spurs would stay hot through December as they established a 25–6 record entering the New Year. With the later additions of center Nazr Mohammed from New York (acquired in a midseason trade of Malik Rose), and veteran forward Glenn Robinson from free agency, alongside regulars Bruce Bowen, Robert Horry, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Tim Duncan, the Spurs would be near the top in the Western Conference all season, battling the Phoenix Suns for {{the best record in the}} NBA. Just as it appeared the Spurs would cruise toward the playoffs their season suddenly hit a <b>bump</b> <b>in</b> the road when Tim Duncan suffered an ankle injury. The Spurs struggled the rest of the season, finishing just 59–23. However, by the time the playoffs rolled around, Duncan was ready to return.|$|E
