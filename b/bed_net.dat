40|$|Malaria {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} problems in the tropical parts of the world, causing about 1. 5 to 2. 7 million deaths annually. Ninety percent of these deaths occur in Sub-Saharan Africa and 5 % of children die from the disease before reaching 5 years. Malaria is responsible globally for 500 million clinical cases and represents a public health problem for 2. 4 billion people. People living in lowland areas, where malaria is common, acquire some degree of immunity against it due to frequent exposure. In the highland areas, however, people don’t have immunity against the disease. If malaria is introduced to such a highland area, people are at a higher risk of getting serious malaria and epidemics (highland malaria). The spread of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum throughout the African continent has stimulated a search for alternative technologies that may play a role in the malaria control strategy. Insecticide treated nets have been clearly proven to reduce transmission, morbidity and mortality rates of malaria in many high-endemic malaria countries. Studies have shown that use and re-treatment of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> is relatively uncommon in many communities, but there is limited information about the reasons behind this, especially in areas where malaria has recently been introduced. The objective of this study is to describe factors influencing the use and re-impregnation of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> in an area where malaria has recently been introduced. This was a cross-sectional study, conducted in three highland villages in Tanzania from September to November 2001. The study consisted of two methods. First, a quantitative household survey was conducted; thereafter 12 informants took part in a qualitative inquiry using semi-structured interviews. The quantitative survey used a two-stage stratified sampling procedure in which 303 households - 100 without <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> all, 100 with untreated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and 103 with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> - were identified, and the heads of households interviewed. A survey team consisting of 3 persons conducted the interviews. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to interview the subjects at their homes. Finger pricking was used to obtain blood samples, which were examined for malaria parasites. Data analysis was done using SPSS for Windows, version 11. 0. Chi squared (χ²) or Gamma tests were used for analysis of categorical data, T-test was used for numerical data in two groups at a time and odds ratios were used to measure the strength of the association between independent and dependent variables. The level of significance was set to P< 0. 05 at 95 % CI. In the qualitative part, a purposeful sampling approach was used to select informants. Hand-written notes were taken during the interviews. The analysis started during the data gathering. Later, the material was read through in order to identify common themes, code parts of the text, identify similarities and generate concepts. It was found in this study that households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had significantly younger household heads (mean age 32. 71 years) than those with untreated (36. 72 years) and no nets (42. 10 years). Heads of households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had a significantly higher overall level of knowledge about malaria, <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and insecticides - with an average score of 26. 97 out of 29 knowledge questions (93 %) - than households with untreated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (83 %) and without <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (73 %). They were also significantly more literate (98 % vs. 75 % and 55 %, respectively), and had spent more time in school (7. 0 years vs. 4. 5 and 3. 3 years, respectively). Households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had a much higher average income per person per year (Tshs. 69, 499) than households with untreated (Tshs. 29, 773) and no nets (Tshs. 23, 372), and the differences were significant. A higher proportion of the households without <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had heads who felt that insecticides were expensive (67 %) than households with untreated (49 %) and treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (18 %). These findings were statistically significant. Almost all of the households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (99 %) had heads who believed that insecticides have no side effects, as compared to 85 % of household heads with untreated, and 76 % of households without, <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Again, the differences were statistically significant. Almost all households with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> had heads who indicated that insecticides were available in their villages (99 %), as compared to 78 % of households with untreated nets and 63 % of households without <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> These differences were statistically significant. There were also significant differences regarding the perception of insecticides. All household heads with treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> felt that insecticides help “very much” in the prevention of malaria, as compared to 95 % of households with untreated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and 83 % of households without <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> Thirteen percent of households without <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and 4 % with untreated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> said insecticides help to prevent malaria to “a certain extent”. The qualitative part of this study explored lay people’s own understandings of these issues. It seemed clear that many people perceived malaria as a major health threat in their villages, and they thought that the seriousness and complications of the disease were the cause of their low economical status. The majority believed that malaria was caused by mosquito bites and that a lack of use of treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and a lack of destruction of mosquito breeding sites contributed to it. Many people knew how malaria could be transmitted and prevented, but some people did not seek medical treatment early due to social and local traditions and beliefs. Many people perceived the use of insecticide treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> as an effective way of preventing malaria, but some believed that insecticides could cause harmful effects to human beings. Many informants said that people do not treat their <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> because they don’t have enough money, and half said that they fear side effects of insecticides. Some said people do not treat their <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> because they don’t understand very well how insecticides could prevent malaria and because they don’t see mosquitoes in their hamlets, especially during the dry season. Only one informant said the reason was that sometimes insecticides are not available in his village. This study concludes that low levels of knowledge about malaria, <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and insecticides, unaffordability of insecticides, unavailability of insecticides, misconceptions about the effectiveness of insecticides, and myths about side effects of insecticides are associated with low rates of use and re-treatment of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> with insecticides. Younger persons seem to adapt to nets and insecticides significantly better than older persons. It is recommended that the designing and implementation of ITN programs, should consider all the factors associated with the use and re-treatment of <b>bed</b> <b>nets.</b> A joint effort from a combination of different disciplines and sectors is needed to overcome these obstacles. Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) activities should be designed in such a way that they would reach the entire population in the area, but special efforts should also be considered in order to reach the less beneficial groups who are the majority without ITNs. Innovative ways of reaching poor households should be explored. Income-generating projects should be considered in these villages since the purchasing power is so low. The price of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and insecticides should be made affordable through subsidisation especially in areas where malaria has recently been introduced. Different types of colours, sizes and types of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> should be made available to satisfy the preferences of the customers. Several different sales points of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> and insecticides should be considered to maintain the availability. Any big construction project in developing countries should include a health impact assessment and mitigation program like the one that was implemented at the Lower Kihansi 5461 Hydropower project in Tanzania...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{resistance}} of PermaNet® 2. 0 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> against repeated washing and environmental factors by using bioassay tests. After 5, 15 and 21 washings with detergents and by using bioassay tests, the resistance of 40 PermaNet® 2. 0 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> was compared with that of 40 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> conventionally treated with one K-O tablet. To examine the long-term resistance, 31 PermaNet® 2. 0 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were also distributed among villagers, and were re-collected to perform bioassay tests after 1, 2 and 5 years. In the first phase of this study, the insecticidal effect of the conventionally-treated nets significantly decreased due to repeated washings (P < 0. 001); however, it was not significant regarding PermaNet® 2. 0 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> (P = 0. 92 in continuous exposure and P = 0. 12 in mortality tests). In the long-term phase of this study, the time required for knockdown of PermaNet® 2. 0 increased over the first 2 years and then decreased. In addition, the mortality rate decreased over the first 2 years and then increased. In conclusion, it seems that the technique used by the manufacturer for impregnation of PermaNet® 2. 0 <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> has an acceptable efficiency in comparison with conventional techniques...|$|R

Thus, <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> were not effective in reducing malaria morbidity in this group of children.

50|$|ITNs {{protect people}} {{sleeping}} under them and simultaneously kill mosquitoes that contact the nets. Some protection is provided to others by this method, including people {{sleeping in the}} same room but not under the net. However, mathematical modeling has suggested that disease transmission may be exacerbated after bed nets have lost their insecticidal properties under certain circumstances. Although ITN users are still protected by the physical barrier of the netting, non-users could experience an increased bite rate as mosquitoes are deflected away from the non-lethal <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> users. The modeling suggests that this could increase transmission when the human population density is high or at lower human densities when mosquitoes are more adept at locating their blood meals.|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite {{progress}} {{made in the}} last decades, malaria persists as a pressing health issue in sub-Saharan Africa. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to infection and serious health outcomes for themselves and their unborn child. Risk can be mitigated through appropriate use of control measures such as insecticide-treated bed nets. Although social networks can influence uptake of preventive strategies, the role of social influence on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership has not been explored. During an evaluation of a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution programme, the influence of non-health care advisors on ownership and use of bed nets by pregnant women in Kumasi, Ghana was examined. Methods: Data were collected through in-person interviews with 300 pregnant women seeking antenatal care in an urban hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. Participants were asked about their <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership, <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use, and information about three personal contacts that they go to for pregnancy advice. Information about these advisors was combined into an influence score. Logistic regression models were used to determine the association between the score and <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership. Those who owned a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> were further assessed to determine if interpersonal influence was associated with self-reported sleeping under the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> the previous night. Results: Of the 294 women in the analysis, 229 (78 %) reported owning bed nets. Of these <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> owners, 139 (61 %) reported using a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> the previous night. A dose response relationship was observed between the interpersonal influence score and <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> ownership and use. Compared to the lowest influence score, those with the highest influence score (> 1 SD above the mean) were marginally more likely to own a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> [OR = 2. 37, 95 % CI (0. 87, 6. 39) ] and much more likely to use their <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> [5. 38, 95 % CI (1. 89, 15. 25) ] after adjusting for other factors.

40|$|Abstract. In Africa anopheline {{mosquitoes}} transmit malaria and {{lymphatic filariasis}} (LF); insecticide-treated bed nets significantly reduce transmission of both. Insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> provision to children under 5 (U 5) and pregnant women (PW) {{is a major}} goal of malaria control initiatives, but use in Africa remains low because of cost and logistics. We therefore integrated insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> distribution with the 2004 LF/onchocerciasis mass drug administration (MDA) program in Central Nigeria. Community volunteers distributed 38, 600 insecticide-treated bed nets, while simultaneously treating 150, 800 persons with ivermectin/albendazole (compared with 135, 600 in 2003). This was subsequently assessed with a 30 -cluster survey. Among surveyed households containing U 5 /PW, 80 % (95 % CI, 72 – 87 %) owned 1 insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> <b>net,</b> a 9 -fold increase from 2003.

During the third year, the inoculation rate fell to three infected bites per year, i. e., a reduction of 94 % compared with the first year.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Universal {{long-lasting}} insecticidal net (LLIN) coverage (ULC) {{has reduced}} malaria {{morbidity and mortality}} across Africa. Although information is available on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use in specific groups, such as pregnant women and children under 5 years, there is paucity of data on their use among the general population. <b>Bed</b> <b>net</b> source, ownership and determinants of use among individuals from households in an eastern Rwanda community 8 months after a ULC were characterized. METHODS: Using household-based, interviewer-administered questionnaires and interviewer-direct observations, data on <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> source, ownership and key determinants of net use, including demographics, socio-economic status indicators, house structure characteristics, {{as well as of}} <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> quantity, type and integrity, were collected from 1400 randomly selected households. Univariate and mixed effects logistic regression modelling was done to assess for determinants of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use. RESULTS: A total of 1410 households and 6598 individuals were included in the study. Overall, the proportion of households with at least one net was 92 % while <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> usage was reported among 72 % of household members. Of the households surveyed, a total ownership of 2768 nets was reported, of which about 96 % were reportedly LLINs received from the ULC. By interviewer-physical observation, 88 % of the nets owned were of the LLIN type with the remaining 12 % did not carry any mark to enable type recognition. The odds of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use were significantly lower among males and individuals: from households of low socio-economic status, from households with /=two sleeping spaces, and those reporting to have not slept on a bed. CONCLUSION: In this study, despite high a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage, over 25 % of members reported not to have slept under a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> the night before the survey. Males were particularly less likely to use bed nets even where nets were available. Household socio-economic status, number of bed nets and type and number of sleeping spaces were key determinants of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use.

40|$|Background: Many {{studies have}} {{assessed}} {{the level of}} <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage in populations at risk of malaria infection. These revealed large variations in <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use across countries, regions and social strata. Such studies are often aimed at identifying populations with low access to bed nets that should be prioritized in future interventions. However, often spatial differences in malaria endemicity are not taken into account. By ignoring variability in malaria endemicity, these studies prioritize populations with little access to bed nets, even if these happen to live in low endemicity areas. Conversely, populations living in regions with high malaria endemicity will receive a lower priority once a seizable proportion is protected by bed nets. Adequately assigning priorities requires accounting for both {{the current level of}} <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage and the local malaria endemicity. Indeed, as shown here for 23 African countries, there is no correlation between the level of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage and the level of malaria endemicity in a region. Therefore, the need for future interventions can not be assessed based on current <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage alone. This paper proposes the Adjusted <b>Bed</b> <b>net</b> Coverage (ABC) statistic as a measure taking into account both local malaria endemicity and the level of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. The measure allows setting priorities for future interventions taking into account both local malaria endemicity and <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. Methods. A mathematical formulation of the ABC as a weighted difference of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage and malaria endemicity is presented. The formulation is parameterized based on a model of malaria epidemiology (Smith et al. Trends Parasitol 25 : 511 - 516, 2009). By parameterizing the ABC based on this model, the ABC as used in this paper is proxy for the steady-state malaria burden given the current level of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. Data on the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage in under five year olds and malaria endemicity in 23 Sub-Saharan countries is used to show that the ABC prioritizes different populations than the level of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage by itself. Data from the following countries was used: Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Congo Democratic Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The priority order given by the ABC and the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage are compared at the countries' level, the first level administrative divisions and for five different wealth quintiles. Results: Both at national level and {{at the level of the}} administrative divisions the ABC suggests a different priority order for selecting countries and divisions for future interventions. When taking into account malaria endemicity, measures assessing equality in access to bed nets across wealth quintiles, such as slopes of inequality, are prone to change. This suggests that when assessing inequality in access to bed nets one should take into account the local malaria endemicity for populations from different wealth quintiles. Conclusion: Accounting for malaria endemicity highlights different countries, regions and socio-economic strata for future intervention than the <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage by itself. Therefore, care should be taken to factor out any effects of local malaria endemicity in assessing <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage and in prioritizing populations for further scale-up of <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> coverage. The ABC is proposed as a simple means to do this that is derived from an existing model of malaria epidemiology. © 2013 Vanderelst and Speybroeck; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Background Bed nets reduce malaria-related {{illness and}} deaths, by forming a {{protective}} barrier around people sleeping under them. When impregnated with long-lasting insecticide formulations they also repel or kill mosquitoes attempting to feed upon sleeping humans, {{and can even}} suppress entire populations of malaria vectors that feed predominantly upon humans. Nevertheless, an epidemiological study in 2012 demonstrated higher malaria prevalence among <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> users than non-users in urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Methods Focus group discussions were conducted with women from four selected wards of Dar es Salaam city, focusing on four major themes relating to <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use behaviours: (1) reasons for <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use, (2) reasons for not using bed nets, (3) stimuli or reminders for people to use a <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> (4) perceived reasons for catching malaria while using a <b>bed</b> <b>net.</b> An analytical method by framework grouping of relevant themes was used address key issues of relevance to the study objectives. Codes were reviewed and grouped into categories and themes. Results All groups said {{the main reason for}} <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> use was protection against malaria. Houses with well-screened windows, with doors that shut properly, and that use insecticidal sprays against mosquitoes, were said not to use bed nets, while frequent attacks from malaria was the main stimulus for people to use bed nets. Various reasons were mentioned as potential reasons that compromise <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> efficacy, the most common of which were: (1) <b>bed</b> <b>net</b> sharing by two or more people, especially if one occupant tends to come to bed late at night, and does not tuck in the net 71...|$|E

Insecticide treated <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> provide efficient protection against malaria if used correctly and consistently. The Health Belief Model proposes that preventive health behaviour is influenced by individuals’ cognitions and beliefs. Qualitative interviews were conducted with parents (N= 20) in Zanzibar to explore the cognitions influencing their use of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> for children under five. Malaria was perceived as severe and common for young children. Bed nets were considered efficient in preventing malaria. Reasons for not using were beliefs about low risk of infection due to low mosquito density in the hot seasons, and perceptions of <b>bed</b> <b>nets</b> causing heat. Mixed messages from different malaria prevention measures may have undesirable effects. These findings could be used to optimize the design of malaria prevention strategies...|$|R
