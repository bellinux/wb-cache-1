50|$|Synthetic {{materials}} {{also provide}} another method for tissue regeneration {{in which the}} graft's chemical and physical properties can be controlled. Since the properties of a material may be specified for {{the situation in which}} it is being used, synthetic materials are an attractive option for PNS regeneration. The use of synthetic materials come with certain concerns, such as: easy formation of the graft material into the necessary dimensions, biodegradable, sterilizable, tear resistant, easy to operate with, low risk of infection, and low inflammation response due to the material. The material must also maintain the channel during the nerve regeneration. Currently, the materials most commonly researched mainly focus on polyesters, but biodegradable polyurethane, other polymers, and <b>biodegradable</b> <b>glass</b> are also being investigated. Other possibilities for synthetic materials are conducting polymers and polymers biologically modified to promote cell axon growth and maintain the axon channel.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is {{to shed light on}} the role of {{porosity}} and pore architecture in the in vivo bone regeneration capacity of <b>biodegradable</b> <b>glass</b> scaffolds. A calcium phosphate glass in the system P 2 O 5 -CaO-Na 2 O-TiO 2 was foamed using two different porogens, namely albumen and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2); the resulting three-dimensional porous structures were characterized and implanted in New Zealand rabbits to study their in vivo behavior. Scaffolds foamed with albumen displayed a monomodal pore size distribution centered around 150 m and a porosity of 82 %, whereas scaffolds foamed with H 2 O 2 showed lower porosity (37 %), with larger elongated pores, and multimodal size distribution. After 12 weeks of implantation, histology results revealed a good osteointegration for both types of scaffolds. The quantitative morphometric analysis showed the substitution of the biomaterial by new bone in the case of glasses foamed with albumen. In contrast, bone neoformation and material resorption were significantly lower in the defects filled with the scaffolds foamed with H 2 O 2. The results obtained in this study showed that both calcium phosphate glass scaffolds were osteoconductive, biocompatible, and biodegradable materials. However, differences in porosity, pore architecture, and microstructure led to substantially different in vivo response. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

50|$|The first {{bioactive}} {{glass was}} developed by Hench in 1969 through melting mixture of the related oxide precursors at relatively high temperatures. The original bioactive glass was melt-derived (46.1 mol%, SiO2, 24.4 mol%, Na2O, 26.9 mol% CaO, and 2.6 mol% P2O5) and was named Bioglass®.The choice of the glass composition for a specific application {{should be based on}} a firm knowledge on the influence of all major components on the most relevant properties of the glass with regard to both the final use and the manufacture of the product. Despite extensive research during the past 40 years, only a few glass compositions have been accepted for clinical use. The two US Food and Drug Administration FDA approved melt-derived compositions 45S5 and S53P4 consist of four oxides, SiO2, Na2O, CaO and P2O5 ,. In general, a great number of elements can be dissolved in glasses. The effect of Al2O3, B2O3, Fe2O3, MgO, SrO, BaO, ZnO, Li2O, K2O, CaF2 and TiO2 on the in vitro or in vivo properties of certain compositions of bioactive glasses has been reported. However, the influence of the composition on the properties and compatibility of bioactive and <b>biodegradable</b> <b>glasses</b> is not fully understood.|$|R

40|$|The Stӧber {{process is}} {{commonly}} used for synthesising spherical silica particles. This article reports the first comprehensive study of how the process variables {{can be used to}} obtain monodispersed particles of specific size. The modal particle size could be selected within in the range 20 – 500 nm. There is great therapeutic potential for bioactive glass nanoparticles, as they can be internalised within cells and perform sustained delivery of active ions. <b>Biodegradable</b> bioactive <b>glass</b> nanoparticles are also used in nanocomposites. Modification of the Stӧber process so that the particles can contain cations such as calcium, while maintaining monodispersity, is desirable. Here, while calcium incorporation is achieved, with a homogenous distribution, careful characterisation shows that much of the calcium is not incorporated. A maximum of 10 mol% CaO can be achieved and previous reports are likely to have overestimated the amount of calcium incorporated...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} bone healing in rabbit critical-sized calvarial defects using two different synthetic scaffold materials, solid <b>biodegradable</b> bioactive <b>glass</b> and tricalcium phosphate granules alongside solid and particulated autogenous bone grafts. Material and Methods: Bilateral full thickness critical-sized calvarial defects were created in 15 New Zealand white adult male rabbits.

The healing of the biomaterial-filled defects was compared at the 6 week time point to the healing of autologous bone grafted defects filled with a solid cranial bone block in 5 defects and with particulated bone combined with fibrin glue in 10 defects. In 5 animals one defect was left unfilled as a negative control. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) was used to analyze healing of the defects.

40|$|Transdermal drug {{delivery}} {{is limited by}} the barrier properties of the outer skin layer. Microneedles (MNs) effectively circumvent the skin barrier to offer this route as a potential alternative to oral and parenteral delivery of therapeutics. Biodegradable microneedles offer particular advantages however processing commonly requires elevated temperatures that may adversely affect heat-labile molecules and macromolecules. In this study, solid amorphous sugar glasses containing low residual quantities of water were created by dehydration of trehalose and sucrose sugar combination solutions. <b>Biodegradable</b> sugar <b>glass</b> MNs were fabricated following optimisation of a simple and novel low temperature vacuum deposition micromoulding methodology. These had absolute morphological fidelity to silicon master structures and demonstrated sufficient structural rigidity to efficiently penetrate excised human breast skin. Sugar glass MNs incorporating a marker compound dissolved rapidly and completely in situ releasing dye into deeper skin layers. The biological activity of a model macromolecule was partially retained over extended storage following incorporation into sugar glass. This is the first demonstration that MNs created from amorphous sugar glasses can be used for incorporating and delivering molecules, and potentially biologically active macromolecules, via the transdermal route...|$|R

40|$|Degenerative disc disease, an {{irreversible}} process, is {{the leading}} cause of back pain. Nonoperative treatment is symptomatic and does not restore the disc. Current surgical treatment is limited to spinal fusion with varied results. Even if the fusion is successful, it eliminates joint motion and leads to accelerated disc degeneration at adjacent segments. Engineering replacement disc tissue in the long term is likely to supercede fusion therapy. Herein, we describe a novel approach to the treatment of disc disease using tissue-engineering principles. We investigate the use of nucleus pulposus cells as well as <b>biodegradable</b> materials (bioactive <b>glass</b> and polylactide-co-glycolide PLGA) to stimulate nucleus pulposus regeneration. In this thesis, we focus mostly on the biologic aspects of the investigation, since without a source of these cells, tissue engineering of the disc would be impossible. Success in isolating and expanding the nucleus pulposus cell population allows us to then proceed with engineering hybrids that can be used for disc replacement therapy. ^ The first objective was to characterize the nucleus pulposus cells in situ. Then, a method was described for isolating and maintaining the cells in culture. Using a micromass culture system, it was shown that the cells exhibited the morphological and phenotypical characteristics of the nucleus pulposus in situ. Based on these findings, the capability of bioactive <b>glass</b> and the <b>biodegradable</b> polymer PLGA, to serve as substrates for nucleus pulposus cells, was investigated. ^ Our data showed that the nucleus pulposus cells could be isolated and maintained in culture in a manner which preserved their phenotype. The monolayer and micromass culture systems provided techniques which allowed the cells to proliferate and express critical characteristics of the nucleus pulposus in situ prior to implantation. An investigation into the bioactive glass-cell hybrid suggested that nucleus pulposus cell proliferation might be an anchorage dependent event, and that the calcium phosphate-rich layer facilitates cell adhesion, and subsequent proliferation. However, unlike bioactive glass which actively induced cellular activity, PLGA only provided a surface for cell attachment and proliferation. Consequently, cell attachment to the polymer was limited. However, those that did attach, proliferated and maintained their phenotype on the substrate. All of these findings point to the advantages of bioactive glass as well as PLGA as carriers for nucleus pulposus cells. The use of the substrate-cell hybrid construct provides a new approach for treatment of degenerative disc disease. ...|$|R
