5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the live shows, 15,488,019 votes were cast. Votes made via {{landline}} telephones or from the Red Button service cost 35 pence each, with calls made from mobile telephones expected to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive.</b> The votes brought in revenue of more than £5.4million, though it was expected to be a lot higher because of the unknown cost of mobile phone votes. Proceeds were split between production company Syco, co-producer FremantleMedia, broadcaster ITV and phone vote operator Harvest Media. Advertising slots during the final were sold for up to £250,000, which expected to bring in a further £25million in advertising revenues, with the number of commercial breaks increased from five to six.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a deregulated market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|E
5000|$|Cabinet faces. Solid wood {{remains a}} popular choice for cabinet parts, {{including}} bases, frames, doors, and sides. However, traditional-style solid-wood cabinetry <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> and many consumers opt for cabinets that incorporate particle board or plywood to reduce costs. Pricing for solid wood cabinet doors {{depends on the}} wood species used. For example, teak <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than cherry, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than maple, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than oak. Similarly, solid wood <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than plywood which, in turn, <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than particle board or similar sheet goods.|$|R

25|$|Transmission capacity: {{transmission}} capacity may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than for nuclear and coal generating capacity due to lower load factors. Transmission capacity will generally be sized to projected peak output, but average capacity for wind will be significantly lower, raising cost {{per unit of}} energy actually transmitted.

25|$|Smaller {{than their}} desktop and {{enterprise}} counterparts, {{they tend to}} be slower and have lower capacity. Mobile HDDs spin at 4,200rpm, 5,200rpm, 5,400rpm, or 7,200rpm, with 5,400rpm being typical. 7,200rpm drives tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> and have smaller capacities, while 4,200rpm models usually have very high storage capacities. Because of smaller platter(s), mobile HDDs generally have lower capacity than their greater desktop counterparts.|$|E

25|$|Early {{railways}} (c.1840s) {{experimented with}} continuous bearing railtrack, {{in which the}} rail was supported along its length, with examples including Brunel's baulk road on the Great Western Railway, as well as use on the Newcastle and North Shields Railway, on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway to a design by John Hawkshaw, and elsewhere. Continuous-bearing designs were also promoted by other engineers. The system was trialled on the Baltimore and Ohio railway in the 1840s, but was found to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> to maintain than rail with cross sleepers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s a {{time and}} motion study was {{undertaken}} by the owners, Bowaters UK, and the railway was deemed to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than road transport and was closed. However, Bowaters UK offered the main line, some of the locos and rolling stock of the railway to the Locomotive Club of Great Britain for preservation as a tourist railway. Other locomotives and rolling stock were sold to the Great Whipsnade Railway and the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway. The SKLR is now the longest continuous operator of the railway.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} a company that opens a {{subsidiary}} in another country and borrows in the foreign currency to finance its operations, even though the foreign interest rate may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than in its home country: by matching the debt payments to expected revenues in the foreign currency, the parent company has reduced its foreign currency exposure. Similarly, an oil producer may expect to receive its revenues in U.S. dollars, but faces costs in a different currency; it would be applying a natural hedge if it agreed to, for example, pay bonuses to employees in U.S. dollars.|$|E

Panasonic's was a C14 and came with a song recorded on side one, and a blank side two. Except for C74 and C100, such non-standard lengths always {{have been hard to}} find, and tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the more popular lengths. Home taping enthusiasts may have found certain lengths useful for fitting an album neatly on one or both sides of a tape. For instance, the initial maximum playback time of Compact Discs was 74 minutes, explaining the relative popularity of C74 cassettes.|$|E
25|$|MRI is {{in general}} a safe technique, {{although}} injuries may {{occur as a}} result of failed safety procedures or human error. Contraindications to MRI include most cochlear implants and cardiac pacemakers, shrapnel, and metallic foreign bodies in the eyes. The safety of MRI during the first trimester of pregnancy is uncertain, but it may be preferable to other options. Since MRI does not use any ionizing radiation, its use is generally favored in preference to CT when either modality could yield the same information. In certain cases, MRI is not preferred as it may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive,</b> time-consuming, and claustrophobia-exacerbating.|$|E
25|$|Planning {{process is}} under way (as of October 2008) for {{excavating}} a new underground tram depot in the base rock below the existing Vallila depot and adjacent city blocks. The underground depot is planned to have facilities for housing 180 trams plus repair facilities and staff parking spaces. The underground depot would partially or completely replace the Koskela depot, which is inconveniently located far from normally operated tram lines and would require major reconstruction if kept in use. An alternative is rebuilding and expanding the Koskela depot, but this is projected to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than the planned underground depot.|$|E
40|$|Cormorants hunt both benthic (sedentary) and pelagic (motile) prey {{but it is}} {{not known}} if the energy costs of {{foraging}} on these prey differ. We used respirometry to measure the costs of diving in double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) foraging either for sedentary (fish pieces) or motile (juvenile salmon) prey in a deep dive tank. Short dives for sedentary prey <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than dives of similar duration for motile prey (e. g. 20 % higher for a 10  s dive) whereas the reverse was true for long dives (i. e. long dives for motile prey <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than for sedentary prey). Across dives of all durations, the foraging phase of the dive <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> when the birds hunted motile prey, presumably due to pursuit costs. The period of descent in all the dives undertaken appears to have <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> when the birds foraged on sedentary prey, probably due to a higher swimming speed during this period...|$|R

25|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that, {{due to the}} {{different}} rates set by each city's taxi regulators, renting a taxi for a 12-hour shift in Boston can also <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> than in New York City. Using figures from the New York Taxi & Limousine Commission and the Boston Police Department's Hackney Carriage Unit, actual rates for the Chicago newspaper's hypothetical five-mile trip with five minutes wait time in Boston is $18.60. In New York, the same trip can cost either $15, $15.50 or $16, depending on time of day, due to varying surcharges and the fifty-cents NY State Sales tax added to each fare.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the new icebreaker was awarded to Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab and the work began in March 1937. Previously, the Helsinki-based shipyard had completed the unfinished Voima in 1924 and built a port icebreaker {{for the city of}} Helsinki in 1936. On 24 September 1938, the vessel was given the name Sisu, a Finnish word describing will, determination and perseverance, that had been chosen by the Finnish schoolchildren. The sponsor of the vessel was Walborg Jokinen, the wife of the late Captain Ilmari Jokinen. While Sisu was delivered behind the original 20-month schedule and the vessel turned out to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>expensive</b> as predicted, she was generally considered to be a successful design. She was handed over to the Finnish Board of Navigation in March 1939.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} of ordering the new multipurpose icebreaker {{was made in}} late 2004 and the Finnish Environment Institute and the Finnish Maritime Administration were authorized by the Government to make an agreement on the vessel and launch a request for tenders in early 2005.
