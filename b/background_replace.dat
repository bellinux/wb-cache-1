500|$|From July 19 to August 1, 2012, filming {{took place}} on Oak Island, North Carolina, to [...] "film aerial drops over the Atlantic Ocean." [...] They were done for the scene where Iron Man rescues the people falling from the Air Force One over Miami, which were {{originally}} envisioned done with green screen effects, but were changed to using actual skydivers as second unit director Brian Smrz knew the Red Bull skydiving team. Computer graphics were only employed to add clouds, the destroyed plane and matte paintings of the Florida coastline in the <b>background,</b> <b>replace</b> a stand-in with the Iron Man armor, and some digital compositing to combine different takes of the skydivers together. Filming took place in Rose Hill, North Carolina in early August 2012, and the town's name was incorporated into the script as the Tennessee city Stark visits. On August 14, actress Dale Dickey {{said she had been}} cast in the film, and was currently shooting her scenes. The following day, production was halted when Downey suffered an ankle injury. During the break, Black and Pearce made more script revisions before shooting resumed by August 24.|$|E
50|$|The 1994 print {{featured}} the gold WDHV logo (with blue <b>background),</b> <b>replacing</b> the 1986 Sorcerer Mickey WDHV logo, {{which was a}} video editing error, but was bothered not to be corrected.|$|R
5000|$|Guitarist Larry Weed, with {{a country}} and western musical <b>background,</b> <b>replaced</b> Esco soon after. Weed, notably, used to wear his belt buckle on the side when onstage, [...] "so he would not scratch {{the back of his}} Fender guitar." ...|$|R
50|$|For 2001, several minor {{cosmetic}} {{changes were}} made. On the grille and tailgate, the Lincoln emblem {{was given a}} black <b>background</b> (<b>replacing</b> the previous red); on the tailgate, the Lincoln and Navigator badging switched sides. A VHS-based video entertainment system became an option.|$|R
50|$|The {{new style}} combadge (with the {{previous}} gold oval <b>background</b> <b>replaced</b> by a rectangular gold background with a cutout in the center) was also introduced for all uniform types. This combadge was subsequently adopted for DS9 (at {{the beginning of}} its third season) and Star Trek: Voyager.|$|R
50|$|In America and Canada, {{the album}} was titled Emotional Warfare, after the leading (and only American) single. This version also {{featured}} slightly different front artwork, where a black <b>background</b> <b>replaces</b> the white <b>background</b> of the European artwork. The back artwork on the European and North America editions are completely different. The album's vinyl release featured an inner sleeve.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Platforms 4 & 5 (the {{bridge in}} the <b>background</b> was <b>replaced</b> in 2015) ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the story}} opens, Richard leaves the (fictitious) {{small town of}} Plano, California, where he is {{generally}} unhappy, for (the fictitious) Hampden College in Vermont. His disdain for his background establishes a contrast—aestheticism and literary beauty, as opposed to harsh reality—that continues throughout the novel. He misleads others about his <b>background,</b> <b>replacing</b> his mediocre working-class childhood with a fabricated, glamorous one of boarding schools, wealth, failed actors, and parents who own an oil well.|$|R
50|$|The house {{remained}} largely unchanged since Big Brother 5 broadcast the previous summer, the Diary Room chair remained red, {{but with a}} black <b>background,</b> <b>replacing</b> the blue <b>background</b> from before, the jacuzzi was removed and replaced with a sauna. It was the first celebrity series to feature only one bedroom to be shared by both genders, a private bedroom {{was added to the}} bedroom. A secret room located behind the kitchen was inserted and was used twice.|$|R
50|$|In {{certain parts}} of Israel, the poster which {{depicted}} the image of Katniss (Lawrence) aiming her bow and arrow was removed over concerns her image would offend ultra-conservative Jewish audiences. Instead, a fiery mockingjay in the poster's <b>background</b> <b>replaced</b> Lawrence in marketing materials in multiple locations in Israel including Bnei Brak and West Jerusalem. Lionsgate did {{not comment on the}} Israeli marketing campaign. In Jerusalem, public posters with the image of a female are often torn down, while Bnei Brak does not allow posters with female images.|$|R
50|$|The Ashoka Chakra is a {{depiction}} of the dharmachakra; represented with 24 spokes. It is so called because it appears {{on a number of}} edicts of Ashoka, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of Ashoka. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the Flag of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a navy blue colour on a white <b>background,</b> <b>replacing</b> the symbol of charkha (spinning wheel) of the pre-independence versions of the flag.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1930s, the Army Comrades Associations Saint Patricks blue shirts {{earned it}} the {{nickname}} of Blueshirts. It was a quasi-Fascist shirted movement which rejected green as associated with its republican opponents. [...] The saltire {{flag of the}} Blueshirts was a variant of Saint Patricks Flag with the white <b>background</b> <b>replaced</b> with a blue background. W. T. Cosgrave described the colour as [...] "in perfect, traditional, national accord with our history and in close association with the most revered and venerated memory of our patron Saint".|$|R
50|$|Since Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, the {{application}} can recognize a still <b>background,</b> then <b>replace</b> it {{with either a}} pre-set image (built-in or user-supplied) or movie clip.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, the Personal Standard of the Governor of Victoria {{was changed}} to the State Flag of Victoria, with the blue <b>background</b> <b>replaced</b> by gold, and red stars {{depicting}} the Southern Cross. Above the Southern Cross is the Royal Crown. Previously, the standard used by Victorian governors after 1870 had been the Union Jack with the Badge of the State of Victoria emblazoned in the centre. Between 1903 and 1953, the Tudor Crown was used on the State Flag and Governor's Standard, and this {{was changed to}} the present crown in 1954.|$|R
50|$|The main scene {{features}} {{a crowd of}} biblical figures, angels and saints,portrayed in informal positions; {{most of them are}} probably portraits of existing people. As usual, the scene is set in Heaven, but Lippi decided to avoid the outdated gilded <b>background,</b> <b>replacing</b> it with a striped sky which alludes to the seven sectors of the Paradise. In the middle, in a commanding position, are Christ and the kneeling Madonna {{who is going to be}} crowned, within a majestic marble throne in perspective. The latter includes the shell-shaped niche, featured in other paintings by Lippi.|$|R
5000|$|The angel on {{the left}} pulling up his garment is {{inspired}} by Nanni di Banco's group of the [...] "Quattro Coronati", a sculpture in a niche of Orsanmichele. Another element of innovation (introduced {{at the same time}} by Fra Angelico) was the lack of a gilded <b>background,</b> <b>replaced</b> by an architectural space with a window opening to hilly landscape, inspired to Flemish contemporary works. The shell-shaped niche in the background, a typical element of 15th century Florentine painting, and of Lippi in particular, is inspired by a niche in the Tribunale of the Mercanzie in Orsanmichele, designed by Donatello.|$|R
2500|$|In 1964, the RLAF {{adopted a}} new blue-grey service peaked cap with crown of [...] "Germanic" [...] shape – {{very similar to}} that worn by Khmer Air Force (KAF) or Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) {{officers}} –, with gold embroidered flame decoration on the black cap band for general officers. [...] It was initially worn with the standard gilt metal FAR wreathed trident cap device set on a black <b>background,</b> <b>replaced</b> after 1967 by a distinctive RLAF silver cap badge. A blue-grey overseas flight cap (with silver cord piping in the flap for officers), styled after the French M1957 sidecap, was also adopted.|$|R
5000|$|After Elmo Stoll's {{early death}} in 1998 disunion started among the [...] "Christian Communities". Bryce Geiser, {{who has a}} German Baptist <b>background,</b> <b>replaced</b> Elmo Stoll {{as the leader of}} the [...] "Christian Communities", but he could not hold {{together}} all the different people from different backgrounds. In 2001 the five congregations of the [...] "Christian Communities" [...] announced that they would disband the Cookeville community and the movement as a whole. That lead in the end to the disbanding of two of the five [...] "Christian Communities", while two others joined the Noah Hoover Mennonites and one affiliated with an Amish group from Michigan.|$|R
5000|$|The fairly {{extensive}} {{special effects}} animations {{required for the}} [...] "space" [...] sequences were completed by Steven Turnwall using World War II-era craft as inspiration for {{the look of the}} models. <b>Backgrounds</b> were <b>replaced</b> via greenscreen, and then turned to black and white.|$|R
2500|$|More {{text and}} {{background}} colors, including both transparent and translucent <b>backgrounds</b> to optionally <b>replace</b> {{the big black}} block ...|$|R
30|$|The {{overlay region}} {{determined}} in process 2 in the <b>background</b> image was <b>replaced</b> by the overlay image extracted in process 4.|$|R
50|$|Both Giocondae portraits feature carved cats on {{the right}} which {{resemble}} lions, a punning allusion to Leonardo. The woman in the <b>background</b> is <b>replaced</b> by {{a man in the}} portrait of Isabella of Naples; they may allude respectively to the sitter and the artist in the Mona Lisa.|$|R
40|$|The {{constancy}} of a 16 -step achromatic Munsell {{scale was}} tested {{with regards to}} background variations in two experiments. In experiment 1 three groups of observers were asked to find lightness matches for targets in simultaneous lightness displays by using a 16 -step achromatic Munsell scale placed on a white, black, or white-black checkered background. In experiment 2, a yellow-blue checkered background and a green-red checkered <b>background</b> <b>replaced</b> Munsell scales on the black and on the white backgrounds. Significant effects of scale background on matches were found only in experiment 1, suggesting that background luminance is a crucial factor in the overall appearance of the scale. The lack of significant differences in experiment 2, however, may stand for an overall robustness of the scale with respect to background luminance changes occurring within certain luminance ranges...|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of a}} {{collaboration}} with the Japanese J. League Division 1 football team Albirex Niigata, a special poster unveiled on the official Battle of Gods website on February 20, 2013, was displayed across Niigata Prefecture in promotion of their match with the defending league Division 1 champions Sanfrecce Hiroshima on March 3, 2013. The poster {{is based on the}} Battle of Gods poster, with the movie characters replaced by the football team's players: the figure in the <b>background</b> <b>replacing</b> Whis is the team's manager Masaaki Yanagishita, Beerus has been replaced by the Sanfrecce Hiroshima goalkeeper Shūsaku Nishikawa, and Goku is replaced by the team's forward Bruno Lopes. All supporters at the match wore orange, Goku made an [...] "appearance" [...] at the stadium, and the Dragon Ball Z theme song was used.|$|R
5000|$|The portraits on {{the wing}} panels are based on {{photographs}} of Dyer taken by John Deakin in mid 1960s. They are faithful to the photographs, except that the black <b>background</b> <b>replaces</b> the studio wall. They panels show Dyer in his underwear posing on {{a chair in the}} artist's studio. He is depicted as muscular and strong, but restless, ill at ease, and the two panels are filled with senses of movement and tension. Dyer is presented as literally a man falling apart. His body is mutilated; the black border dissolves into his body in both, leaving a void in place of large parts of his torso. In contrast he seems to be melting, leaving blobs of flesh on the ground beneath him. Bacon described this effect as portraying [...] "the life flowing out of him".|$|R
40|$|Using a {{component}} formulation, we construct the supersymmetric action for a superparticle in a three-dimensional Newton-Cartan supergravity background and clarify its symmetries. Our construction proceeds by first constructing the superparticle {{in a flat}} background. Next, by boosting up the <b>background</b> symmetries, we <b>replace</b> in a first step the flat background by a Galilean supergravity background. In a second step the Galilean supergravity <b>background</b> is <b>replaced</b> by a Newton-Cartan supergravity background. We extend our results by adding a supersymmetric cosmological constant and compare the non-relativistic superparticle with the relativistic kappa-symmetric three-dimensional superparticle.

50|$|The club's {{original}} crest {{was built}} around the shield of the Volkspolizei, to whom they were affiliated. In 1953 they adopted the D logo of SV Dynamo, which was retained until reunification, when its wine red <b>background</b> was <b>replaced</b> with Saxon green. They reverted to the red background in the early 2000s.|$|R
50|$|The {{emblem of}} Stubenberg shows {{ideas of the}} emblem of the noble family of Stubenberg, which was named after the castle located within the area of Stubenberg. The toppled anchor resembles the silvery Wolfsangel of the emblem of the nobles; the <b>background</b> was <b>replaced</b> though, showing the green-white colors of Styria now.|$|R
5000|$|The bright, {{white lights}} in the {{background}} flash almost blinding the scene with just the girls present and they dim down as Lena sings. Against the light, the guitar player can be seen and against the other light (opposite side of the screen) there are two backing singers. The scenes then alternate between the stage, red rooms and yellow background. The lights behind the girls on the stage continue to flash then dim again. As the chorus starts a scene is introduced where the girls stand together in a sky blue background. The scenes alternate again {{but this time the}} blue <b>background</b> <b>replaces</b> the yellow one. As the chorus ends only the blue and yellow backgrounds are used as Lena sings [...] "So come on check it" [...] and in the yellow scene Marina and Olya sing [...] "Out".|$|R
50|$|For series 8, which premiered on 1 March 2014, {{the show}} {{received}} a revamp, {{including a new}} studio set (the wave lines in the <b>background</b> were <b>replaced</b> by a circular replica of the letter C), new opening credits, a redesign of graphics and several new games. The seven game format and prize money structure remained the same.|$|R
5000|$|... "Twin Bee -Generation X-" [...] {{is a song}} by FinalOffset. The song is a {{crossover}} from beatmaniaIII. It is a remix of many {{songs from}} one of the earliest Konami game TwinBee, done by Hideaki Sugaya. As a tribute to the series, the banner, background, and <b>background</b> video (<b>replaced</b> with a different video in later games) feature the TwinBee games in action.|$|R
25|$|For {{a period}} of time, however, Inter was forced to abandon their black and blue uniforms. In 1928, Inter's name and {{philosophy}} made the ruling Fascist Party uneasy. As a result, during the same year the 20-year-old club was merged with Unione Sportiva Milanese. The new club was named Società Sportiva Ambrosiana after {{the patron saint of}} Milan. The flag of Milan (the red cross on white <b>background)</b> <b>replaced</b> the traditional black and blue. After World War II, when the Fascists had fallen from power, the club reverted to their original name and colours. In 2008, Inter celebrated their centenary with a red cross on their away shirt. The cross is reminiscent of the flag of their city, and they continue to use the pattern on their third kit. In 2014, the club adopted a predominantly black home kit with thin blue pinstripes before returning to a more traditional design the following season.|$|R
5000|$|In 1964, the RLAF {{adopted a}} new blue-grey service peaked cap with crown of [...] "Germanic" [...] shape - {{very similar to}} that worn by Khmer Air Force (KAF) or South Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) {{officers}} -, with gold embroidered flame decoration on the black cap band for general officers. It was initially worn with the standard gilt metal FAR wreathed trident cap device set on a black <b>background,</b> <b>replaced</b> after 1967 by a distinctive RLAF silver cap badge. A blue-grey overseas flight cap (with silver cord piping in the flap for officers), styled after the French M1957 sidecap, was also adopted. Besides regulation headgear, unofficial Olive Green and camouflage cloth berets, baseball caps and US [...] "Boonie hats" [...] found their way into the RLAF from the United States, Thailand and South Vietnam, to which were soon added Laotian-made copies; a red embroidered baseball cap was given to graduate pilots of the T-28 fighter-bomber course held at the RLAF Flying School in Seno Airbase, near Savannakhet.|$|R
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released. This version is {{almost exactly the same}} as the original, with the only difference being that some early shots were Spears dances in front of the multicolored <b>background</b> are <b>replaced</b> by shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple dress and in front of a black background with flashing lights.|$|R
5000|$|The current Countdown {{branding}} {{was introduced}} on 21 September 2009. The word [...] "Countdown" [...] reused the original logo's red colour, {{but with a}} newly adapted font-type. The previous light green <b>background</b> was <b>replaced</b> with a white one and a logo with the [...] "Shop Smarter" [...] slogan was added. The logo - representing fresh produce - is also used by Australian Woolworths outlets.|$|R
5000|$|The UK term [...] "Cub Scouts" [...] as {{proposed}} in the APR was however not adopted in 1969 although the entire progress badge scheme and proficiency badge scheme were embraced with minor amendments to the names. Progress badges were called the [...] "Standards" [...] instead of [...] "Arrows", i.e. the Bronze Standard, Silver Standard and Gold Standard. The [...] "link badge" [...] {{was known as the}} [...] "District Commissioner's Award", serving as the highest award for the Cadet Scout category. After 2000, the term [...] "Standards" [...] were again revised to [...] "Arrows" [...] and [...] "Cub Scout" [...] name has replaced that of [...] "Cadet Scout". In 2005, the Singapore Scout Association has updated the Cub Scout Training Scheme, revising the syllabus and giving a new look to the designs of the progress badges. While the [...] "Arrows" [...] are retained, the top progress award is now known as the Akela Award (a wolf's head on a green <b>background),</b> <b>replacing</b> the [...] "link badge" [...] design of the UK.|$|R
