500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would get to choose roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E
500|$|When Swift {{was first}} signed to Big Machine Records, {{it was a}} new and {{extremely}} small record label, the smallest in Nashville, Tennessee, that consisted of approximately twelve employees and her as the only signed artist. At some point, Swift realized that it would be more difficult for her to achieve success through a small label, than in a larger label, constricting their contacts and making it nearly impossible to embark on concert tours and have presenter or performer slots on award shows. In addition, as the only signed artist, she could not ask for favors and only had herself to encourage the hope that scenarios would eventually change. Swift described the scenario as an [...] "uphill climb" [...] and said, [...] "There was this moment where I sat there and was like, ‘When {{are we going to get}} a fighting chance? We’re the smallest record label in Nashville, but we want this really bad.’" [...] After reassuring to herself that it would be different in the future, she wrote the beginning of [...] "Change". She let the track sit for a while, waiting for a remarkable event to trigger its completion. She then completed the track the day after she won the Horizon Award at the 2007 Country Music Association Awards and saw Scott Borchetta, the president of Big Machine Records, crying. [...] "That’s when I finished , <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> couldn’t finish it until something like that happened. It was absolutely the most amazing night of my life, getting to see the emotion of all the people who worked so hard for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Christian, the Millennium Falcon set was {{the most}} {{difficult}} to build. Christian wanted the interior of the Falcon to look like that of a submarine. He found scrap airplane metal [...] "that no one wanted in those days and bought them". He began his creation process by breaking down jet engines into scrap pieces, giving him the chance to [...] "stick it in the sets in specific ways". It took him several weeks to finish the chess set (which he described as [...] "the most encrusted set") in the hold of the Falcon. The garbage compactor set [...] "was also pretty hard, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had actors in there and the walls had to come in, and they had to be in dirty water and I had to get stuff that would be light enough so it wouldn't hurt them but also not bobbing around". A total of 30 sets consisting of planets, starships, caves, control rooms, cantinas, and the Death Star corridors were created; all of the nine sound stages at Elstree were used to accommodate them. The massive rebel hangar set was housed at a second sound stage at Shepperton Studios; the stage was the largest in Europe at the time.|$|E

60|$|Summoning Mary, I {{soon had}} {{the room in}} more cheerful order: I {{prepared}} him, likewise, a comfortable repast. My spirits were excited, and with pleasure and ease I talked to him during supper, {{and for a long}} time after. There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and vivacity with him; for with him I was at perfect ease, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> suited him; all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him. Delightful consciousness! It brought to life and light my whole nature: in his presence I thoroughly lived; and he lived in mine. Blind as he was, smiles played over his face, joy dawned on his forehead: his lineaments softened and warmed.|$|E

6000|$|A mock shudder {{passed through}} his tall, {{athletic}} frame, and taking his friend's arm in his, he whispered confidentially, [...] "Think of it, my lord! A woman whom duty compels one to love--Brrr!--Her own father plighted our troth; I am left comparatively free, yet if I do not wed Lady Ursula, she {{is doomed to}} end her days in a convent. [...] . . . A matter of honour--what? [...] . . . Yet I--I, who could love any woman," [...] he added emphatically, [...] "be she queen or peasant--that is--h'm!--if I were really put to it--find {{the very thought of}} my promised bride abhorrent. She is the one woman in all the world whom I could never love--never! [...] . . . I know it! So I ran away from Court, not because I feared one woman loved me too much, but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> should love one woman too little." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may say there's no {{particular}} reason why you should do me a favour. Indeed I only know of one: {{the fact that if}} you'd let me I'd gladly do you one." [...] Her soft, exact tone, in which there was no attempt at effect, had an extreme sincerity; and her companion, though he presented rather a hard surface, couldn't help being touched by it. When he was touched he rarely showed it, however, by the usual signs; he neither blushed, nor looked away, nor looked conscious. He only fixed his attention more directly; he seemed to consider with added firmness. Henrietta continued therefore disinterestedly, without the sense of an advantage. [...] "I may say now, indeed--it seems a good time--that if I've ever annoyed you (and I think sometimes I have) it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was willing to suffer annoyance for you. I've troubled you--doubtless. But I'd TAKE trouble for you." ...|$|E

[...] (Your Lordships will recollect that Bidjegur {{is one of those}} very forts which he declares could not be held but for suspicious and rebellious purposes.) [...] "I do not recollect his mentioning it again, when I set out for Benares; neither did I ever intimate the subject, either to Cheyt Sing or his ministers, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could not support the claim; and to have made it and dropped it would have been in every sense dishonorable. Not that I passed by it with indifference or inattention. I took pains to investigate the foundation of this title, and recommended it to the particular inquiry of Mr. Vansittart, who was the Chief of Patna, at the time in which I received the first intimation. The following letter and voucher, which I received from him, contain a complete statement of this pretended usurpation." ...|$|E

5000|$|Pace {{began his}} career in the Ring of Combat {{promotion}} at Ring of Combat 22. He defeated Sean Santella via unanimous decision. Pace then joined the Bellator Fighting Championships and gained notice in the media with a flying knee KO of Collin Tebo.

60|$|After a while I {{escaped from}} the company-floaters <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could not {{understand}} them, and ran up a hill. Hong-Kong is all hill except when the fog shuts out everything except the sea. Tree ferns sprouted {{on the ground and}} azaleas mixed with the ferns, and there were bamboos over all. Consequently it was only natural that I should find a tramway that stood on its head and waved its feet in the mist. They called it the Victoria Gap Tramway and hauled it up with a rope. It ran up a hill into space at an angle of 65°, and to those who have seen the Rigi, Mount Washington, a switchback railway, and the like would not have been impressive. But neither you nor I have ever been hauled from Annandale to the Chaura Maidàn in a bee-line with a five-hundred-foot drop on the off-side, and we are at liberty to marvel. It is not proper to run up inclined ways at the tail of a string, more especially when you cannot see two yards {{in front of you and}} all earth below is a swirling cauldron of mist. Nor, unless you are warned of the opticalness of the delusion, is it nice to see from your seat, houses and trees at magic-lantern angles. Such things, before tiffin, are worse than the long roll of the China seas.|$|E
60|$|I {{had asked}} Jone and Mr. Poplington to go ahead, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> {{could do a}} great deal better if I worked along by myself for a while, without being told what I ought {{to do and what}} I oughtn't to do. There is nothing that bothers me so much as to have people try to teach me things when I am puzzling them out for myself. But now I found that {{although}} they could not be far ahead, I couldn't see them, on account of the twists in the road and the high hedges, and so I put on steam and went along at a fine rate, sniffing the breeze like a charger of the battlefield. Before very long I came to a place where the road forked, but the road to the left seemed like a lane leading to somebody's house, so I kept on in what was plainly the main road, which made a little turn where it forked. Looking out ahead of me, to see if I could catch sight of the two men, I could not see a sign of them, but I did see that I was {{on the top of a}} long hill that seemed to lead on and down and on and down, with no end to it.|$|E
60|$|I do not, however, advise visiting {{it above}} {{any other place}} in Rome. What I always say is, take your chances with any or every time or place; you cannot fail of some {{impression}} which you will always like recurring to as characteristically delightful. For instance, I once walked home from the Piazza di Spagna with some carnival masks frolicking about me through the sun-shotten golden dust of the delicious evening air, and I had a pleasure from the experience which I shall never forget. It was as rich as that I got from the rosy twilight in which I wandered homeward another time from the Piazza di Venezia and found myself passing the Fountain of Trevi, and lingered long there and would not throw my penny into its waters <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could not help coming back to Rome anyhow. Yet another time I was driving through a certain piazza where the peasants stand night long waiting to be hired by the proprietors who come to find them there, and suddenly the piety of the Middle Ages stood before me in {{the figure of the}} Brotherhood of the Misericordia, draped to the foot and hooded in their gray, unbleached linen. The brothers were ranged in a file at the doors of the church ready to visit the house of sickness or of mourning, barefooted, with their eyes showing spectrally through their masks and their hands coming soft and white out of their sleeves and betraying the lily class that neither toils nor spins and yet is bound, as in the past, to the poorest and humblest through the only Church that knows how to unite them in the offering and acceptance of reciprocal religious duties.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Smart's direct artistic {{stimulation}} came from, literally, {{a passing}} glance {{as he was}} driving: [...] "My paintings have their origins in a passing glance".

6000|$|Drama--tableau! My dear Tony, you are {{literally}} my saviour. The above row of stars represents midnight emotions and palpitations of no mean order. As I finished the line {{just before the}} stars I became aware that a smell of smoke, a sense of burning that had worried me for the previous hour, had suddenly very much increased and that the room was full of it. De fil en aiguille, and in much anxiety, I presently discovered that the said smoke was coming up through the floor between the painted dark-green planks (dark green!) of the margin--outside of matting and rugs, and under a table near the fireplace. To assure myself {{that there was no}} source of flame in the room below, and then to go up and call my servant, do you see? (he long since snoring in bed--for it's now 2.15 a.m.) was the work of a moment. With such tools as we could command we hacked and pried and sawed and tore up a couple of planks--from which volumes of smoke issued!! Do you see the midnight little flurry? Bref, we got at it--a charred, smouldering--long-smouldering, I suppose--beam under, or almost under, the hearthstone and in process of time kindled--that is heated to smoking-point by its temperature (that of the hearth,) which was very high. We put him out, we made him stop, with soaked sponges--and then the relief: even while gazing at the hacked and smashed and disfigured floors. Now my man is gone to bed, and I, rather enlivened for immediate sleep, sit and watch by the scene of the small scare and finish my letter to you: really, you know, to grasp your hand, to hang upon your neck, in gratitude, you being {{at the bottom of the}} whole thing. I sat up late in the first instance to write to you, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't have time to-morrow: and it was because I did so that I was saved a much worse later alarm. Two or three hours hence the smoke would have penetrated to the rest of the house and we should have started up to [...] "fly round" [...] to a much livelier tune.|$|E
6000|$|DEAR HOWELLS,--Get your lecture by heart--it {{will pay}} you. I learned a trick in Vienna--by accident--which I wish I had learned years ago. I meant {{to read from}} a Tauchnitz, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> hadn't well memorized the pieces; and I came on with the book and read a few sentences, then remembered that the sketch needed {{a few words of}} {{explanatory}} introduction; and so, lowering the book and now and then unconsciously using it to gesture with, I talked the introduction, and it happened to carry me into the sketch itself, and then I went on, pretending that I was merely talking extraneous matter and would come to the sketch presently. It was a beautiful success. I knew the substance of the sketch and the telling phrases of it; and so, the throwing of the rest of it into informal talk as I went along limbered it up and gave it the snap and go and freshness of an impromptu. I was to read several pieces, and I played the same game with all of them, and always the audience thought I was being reminded of outside things and throwing them in, and was going to hold up the book and begin on the sketch presently--and so I always got through the sketch before they were entirely sure that it had begun. I did the same thing in Budapest and had the same good time over again. It's a new dodge, and the best one that was ever invented. Try it. You'll never lose your audience--not even for a moment. Their attention is fixed, and never wavers. And {{that is not the case}} where one reads from book or MS., or where he stands up without a note and frankly exposes the fact, by his confident manner and smooth phrasing, that he is not improvising, but reciting from memory. And in the heat of telling a thing that is memorised in substance only, one flashes out the happiest suddenly-begotten phrases every now and then! Try it. Such a phrase has a life and sparkle about it that twice as good a one could not exhibit if prepared beforehand, and it [...] "fetches" [...] an audience in such an enthusing and inspiring and uplifting way that that lucky phrase breeds another one, sure.|$|E
