5|$|The 1900 season {{revealed}} grave {{problems with}} Rostislavs <b>boilers.</b> Black smoke from burning oil was more conspicuous than coal smoke. Uneven distribution of heat inside the <b>boilers</b> caused severe local overheating, buckling of fireboxes and sudden backdrafts. For {{three and a}} half months the <b>boilers</b> failed one by one, starting with small auxiliary power units and ending with the main <b>boilers.</b> Oil delivered by the Rothschild-controlled Russian Standard Oil was not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the Baltic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The Admiral Hipper-class {{ships were}} powered by {{three sets of}} geared steam {{turbines}}. Admiral Hippers and Blüchers engines were built by Blohm & Voss, while Prinz Eugens turbines were built by Germaniawerft. The turbines installed on Seydlitzs and Lützows engines were manufactured by Deschimag. Steam was provided {{in the first three}} ships by twelve ultra-high-pressure <b>boilers.</b> Seydlitz and Lützow were equipped with nine double-ended high-pressure <b>boilers.</b> Admiral Hippers and Prinz Eugens <b>boilers</b> were manufactured by Wagner, while the <b>boilers</b> for the other three ships were built by La Mont.|$|E
5|$|The Canopus-class {{ships were}} {{powered by a}} pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam {{provided}} by twenty Belleville <b>boilers.</b> They were the first British battleships with water-tube <b>boilers,</b> which generated more power at less expense in weight compared with the fire-tube <b>boilers</b> used in previous ships. The new <b>boilers</b> led to the adoption of fore-and-aft funnels, rather than the side-by-side funnel arrangement used in many previous British battleships. The Canopus-class ships proved to be good steamers, with a high speed for battleships of their time— from —a full two knots faster than the Majestics.|$|E

50|$|The {{cylindrical}} furnace or firebox fits entirely {{within the}} <b>boiler's</b> outer shell. Unlike the locomotive <b>boiler,</b> {{there is no}} firebox grate emerging beneath the main <b>boiler.</b> The <b>boiler</b> has similarities with both the locomotive <b>boiler</b> (the multiple small fire-tubes), and the Scotch marine <b>boiler</b> (the short cylindrical furnace). As a fire-tube <b>boiler</b> it has generous heating area and so is an effective steamer. Firebox construction is also simpler, thus cheaper, than for the locomotive firebox.|$|R
50|$|The <b>boiler</b> did {{see some}} {{popularity}} in mainland Europe, as a <b>boiler</b> for small portable engines. A similar <b>boiler,</b> but arranged with return fire-tubes, {{was built in}} America as the Huber <b>boiler.</b>|$|R
5|$|The main {{improvement}} in engine performance during the pre-dreadnought period {{came from the}} adoption of increasingly higher pressure steam from the boiler. Scotch marine <b>boilers</b> were superseded by more compact water-tube <b>boilers,</b> allowing higher-pressure steam to be produced with less fuel consumption. Water-tube <b>boilers</b> were also safer, with less risk of explosion, and more flexible than fire-tube types. The Belleville-type water-tube boiler had been introduced in the French fleet as early as 1879, but it took until 1894 for the Royal Navy to adopt it for armoured cruisers and pre-dreadnoughts; other water-tube <b>boilers</b> followed in navies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether the new ships should be powered entirely by oil-fired <b>boilers</b> was less controversial. The design staff was generally in agreement with the standard practice of using coal-fired <b>boilers</b> for two-thirds of the power plant, with the remainder being oil-fired <b>boilers.</b> Coal-fired <b>boilers</b> were preferred because the coal, stored in the sides of the ship, provided additional protection, particularly for the battlecruisers, which carried less armor than their battleship counterparts. The finalized design was approved on 23 May 1914.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} work stopped, Normandies hull was 65percent complete, her engines were 70percent complete, and her <b>boilers</b> were {{delivered}} but were instead installed in new destroyers. The turrets were 40percent assembled. Languedoc had 49percent of her hull and 73percent of her engines constructed; her <b>boilers</b> were 96percent complete and only 26percent of her turrets were built. The hulls of Flandre and Gascogne were 65 and 60percent complete, respectively, and their engines were 60 and 44percent assembled. Both of their sets of <b>boilers</b> {{were used for}} destroyers. The two ships' turrets were 51 and 75percent complete. Work on Béarn had not significantly progressed by the time war broke out: her hull was only 8–10percent complete and her engines were only 25percent finished. Her <b>boilers</b> were 17percent assembled, and her turrets were at 20percent.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Boiler</b> water {{treatment}} {{is a type}} of industrial {{water treatment}} focused on removal or chemical modification of substances potentially damaging to the <b>boiler.</b> Varying types of treatment are used at different locations to avoid scale, corrosion, or foaming. [...] External treatment of raw water supplies intended for use within a <b>boiler</b> is focused on removal of impurities before they reach the <b>boiler.</b> Internal treatment within the <b>boiler</b> is focused on limiting the tendency of water to dissolve the <b>boiler,</b> and maintaining impurities in forms least likely to cause trouble before they can be removed from the <b>boiler</b> in <b>boiler</b> blowdown.|$|R
5|$|In 1925, NESCo set up {{separate}} {{plant at}} the power station for the low temperature carbonisation treatment of coal, before being burned in <b>boilers</b> and the steam used for electricity generation. The treatment plant was manufactured by Babcock & Wilcox, and {{set up in a}} self-contained boiler house which contained four <b>boilers,</b> four retorts and pulverising mills. The building was also fitted with gas-stripping and by-product plants. The carbonising plant could handle up to 100 tonnes of coal per day, while its <b>boilers</b> produced 78,000lb of steam per hour. This plant was extended in 1931.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, Vikrant was docked at the Naval Dockyard, Bombay, due to many {{internal}} fatigue {{cracks and}} fissures {{in the water}} drums of her <b>boilers</b> {{that could not be}} repaired by welding. As replacement drums were not available locally, four new ones were ordered from Britain, and Naval Headquarters issued orders not to use the <b>boilers</b> until further notice. On 26 February 1971 the ship was moved from Ballard Pier Extension to the anchorage, without replacement drums. The main objective behind this move was to light up the <b>boilers</b> at reduced pressure, and work up the main and flight deck machinery that had been idle for almost seven months. On 1 March, the <b>boilers</b> were ignited, and basin trials up to 40 revolutions per minute (RPM) were conducted. Catapult trials were conducted on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into <b>boilers</b> automatically, rather than needing a complement of stokers {{to do it}} by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This meant that the <b>boilers</b> themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E
50|$|A {{steam drum}} is used without {{or in the}} company of a mud-drum/feed water drum which is located at a lower level. A <b>boiler</b> with both steam drum and mud/water drum is called a bi-drum <b>boiler</b> and a <b>boiler</b> with only a steam drum is called a mono-drum <b>boiler.</b> The bi-drum <b>boiler</b> {{construction}} is normally intended for low pressure-rating <b>boiler</b> while the mono-drum is mostly designed for higher pressure-rating.|$|R

5|$|The {{general idea}} for the {{restoration}} {{was to make the}} locomotives appear as if they were built in the 1880s. The original, dilapidated <b>boilers</b> of the four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works were replaced with new, smaller <b>boilers</b> built by Dixon Boiler Works. Their worn-out wood and steel cabs were replaced with new ones made of fiberglass, and they were given new tenders, which used the trucks from the originals. Many of the smaller original parts on the locomotives such as the domes and brass bells on top of the <b>boilers,</b> the wheels, and the side rods were successfully refurbished and retained. The locomotives' fireboxes were also reconfigured to burn diesel oil. Replicas of their builder plates were also made to replace the originals.|$|E

5|$|Another refit {{followed}} on 12 December 1925– 11 July 1927. The {{elevation of}} the main battery guns was again increased, the bow section of the belt armor was removed, and half of her <b>boilers</b> were converted to oil-firing models. A third and final modernization began on 20 September 1931 and lasted until 20 August 1934. The rest of the coal-fired <b>boilers</b> were replaced with six Indret oil-fired <b>boilers,</b> new turbines and main battery guns were installed, along with eight new 75mm anti-aircraft guns. After emerging from the refit, Provence and Bretagne {{were assigned to the}} 2nd Squadron in the Atlantic. There, they joined fleet exercises off the Azores, Madeira, and Morocco. The two ships took part in a cruise to Africa in 1936. In August, they were involved in non-intervention patrols after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War; these patrols lasted until April 1937.|$|E
5|$|Captain Imai Kanemasa assumed {{command of}} the ship on 14 June, as Tōgō was reorganizing the fleet for future operations. As the IJN was {{preparing}} to invade Sakhalin Island in early July, Kamimura's 2nd Division, now reduced to Iwate, Izumo, and Tokiwa, was tasked to defend the Korea Strait before it escorted troops that made an amphibious landing in northeastern Korea. In mid-August, the division covered the landing at Chongjin, closer to the Russian border. In 1910, Tokiwas <b>boilers</b> were replaced by Miyabara water-tube <b>boilers</b> and her six-inch guns were replaced by Japanese-built models. In December 1911, Iwate and Tokiwa were deployed to Port Arthur to keep order there during the Chinese Revolution.|$|E
5|$|From the hoppers, {{the waste}} falls onto the furnace-charging chute {{and from there}} onto the incinerating grate. Here it is burned at a {{temperature}} in excess of 1,200°C. This heat is then converted into super heated steam through the plant's <b>boilers.</b> This in turn powers steam turbines, much {{in the same way}} as a conventional thermal power station. Electricity is generated at 11 kilovolts. After exiting the turbines, the steam is condensed back to water. For the original two incinerating lines use river water from the Tees as a cooling medium, whereas in the third line, water is condensed through air cooled condenser. The cooled water is treated and reused in the <b>boilers.</b>|$|E
