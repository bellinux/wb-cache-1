40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} performance of <b>insulators</b> with spiral <b>shaped</b> sheds under laboratory and field conditions. The study carried out in different countries and author’ own measurements are presented. It was shown that the pollution flashover voltage of spiral <b>shaped</b> <b>insulators</b> is lower than that of insulators with standard sheds. The poorer performance of spiral <b>shaped</b> <b>insulators</b> is caused by the formation of non-uniform surface layer along the leakage path...|$|R
40|$|A non-eukaryotic, metakaryotic {{cell with}} large, open mouthed, <b>bell</b> <b>shaped</b> nuclei {{represents}} an important stem cell lineage in fetal/juvenile organogenesis in humans and rodents. each human <b>bell</b> <b>shaped</b> nucleus contains the diploid human DNA genome as tested by quantitative Feulgen DNA cytometry and fluorescent {{in situ hybridization}} with human pan-telomeric, pan-centromeric and chromosome specific probes. From weeks ∼ 5 – 12 of human gestation the <b>bell</b> <b>shaped</b> nuclei are found in organ anlagen enclosed in sarcomeric tubular syncytia. Within syncytia <b>bell</b> <b>shaped</b> nuclear number increases binomially up to 16 or 32 nuclei; clusters of syncytia are regularly dispersed in organ anlagen. Syncytial <b>bell</b> <b>shaped</b> nuclei demonstrate two forms of symmetrical amitoses, facing or “kissing” bells and “stacking” bells resembling separation of two paper cups. Remarkably, DNA increase and nuclear fission occur coordinately. Importantly, syncytial <b>bell</b> <b>shaped</b> nuclei undergo asymmetrical amitoses creating organ specific ensembles of up to eight distinct closed nuclear forms, a characteristic required of a stem cell lineage. Closed nuclei emerging from <b>bell</b> <b>shaped</b> nuclei are eukaryotic as demonstrated by their subsequent increases by extra-syncytial mitoses populating the parenchyma of growing anlagen. From 9 – 14 weeks syncytia fragment forming single cells with <b>bell</b> <b>shaped</b> nuclei that continue to display both symmetrical and asymmetrical amitoses. These forms persist in the juvenile period and are specifically observed in bases of colonic crypts. Metakaryotic forms are found in organogenesis of humans, rats, mice and the plant Arabidopsis indicating an evolutionary origin prior to the divergence of plants and animals...|$|R

40|$|Bell form {{strongly}} {{affects the}} hydrodynamic performance of swimming hydromedusae. Although {{the relationship between}} <b>bell</b> <b>shape</b> and hydrodynamic parameters has been documented for static models of different <b>bell</b> <b>shapes,</b> the dynamic differences in contraction characteristics of different <b>bell</b> <b>shapes</b> have not been described. This {{is an important issue}} in medusan motion because the way in which medusan bells contract may influence the effect of <b>bell</b> <b>shape</b> on swimming performance. We measured differences in bell morphologies and wake velocities during swimming by two prolate (streamlined) and two oblate (disc shaped) forms of hydromedusae. Our results indicate that propulsion by prolate medusae is fundamentally different than that of oblate forms. Prolate species were characterized by contraction over {{the entire length of the}} bell and produced a narrower, higher velocity jet. Oblate medusae contracted primarily near the bell margin, and produced a broader, lower velocity jet. Prolate medusae achieved higher velocities but lower Froude propulsion efficiencies than oblate medusae. The adaptive value of these patterns are interpreted in terms of foraging and life history patterns...|$|R
