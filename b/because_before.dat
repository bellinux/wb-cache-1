5|$|The episode {{includes}} four deleted scenes, which feature more on Adam's past. In the scenes Harry tells Ros {{that he was}} looking for Adam's mother, but could not find her <b>because</b> <b>before</b> his death, Adam altered her records on where she lived. Harry visits a wealthy estate where she worked and is told she is currently in Blackpool. In the last scene, Harry and Ros toast to Adam. Those scenes have been included on BBC iPlayer on the Spooks website.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, the Poles resented their {{change of}} {{fortunes}} <b>because,</b> <b>before</b> the war, Poles had a privileged position. Then, {{in the space}} of a few days, Jews and other minorities from within Poland occupied positions in the Soviet occupation government—such as teachers, civil servants and engineers—that they allegedly had trouble achieving under the Polish government. What to the majority of Poles was occupation and betrayal was, to some Jews—especially Polish communists of Jewish descent who emerged from the underground—an opportunity for revolution and retribution. There were even some extreme cases of Jewish participation in massacres of ethnic Poles such as Massacre of Brzostowica Mała. Such behavior affronted non-Jewish Poles.|$|E
5|$|According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), in 2007, the United Kingdom had 274,000 hives, Italy had 1,091,630, and France 1,283,810. In 2008, the British Beekeepers Association {{reported}} the bee {{population in the}} United Kingdom dropped by around 30% between 2007 and 2008, and an EFSA study revealed that in Italy the mortality rate was 40–50%. However, EFSA officials point out the figures are not very reliable <b>because</b> <b>before</b> the bees started dying, no harmonisation {{was used in the}} way different countries collected statistics on their bee populations. At that time (2008), the reports blamed the high death rate on the varroa mite, two seasons of unusually wet European summers, and some pesticides.|$|E

5|$|After a {{conversion}} {{by his mother}} Mary and older sister Susannah in 1798, all of Hinde's family, including his father, converted to Christianity as Methodists. Thomas delayed a while. Shortly afterward the younger Hinde became close friends with Francis Asbury, who became a prominent bishop in the church. Hinde later described the conversion of his youngest sister, Martha Harrison Hinde, in an 1827 article published in the Methodist Review under his pen name, Theophilus Arminius. Hinde recounted Bishop Asbury visiting his father's home in 1803 and telling Martha that she had better find God, <b>because</b> <b>before</b> he could meet her again she would be dead. The bishop's prophecy came true when Martha died in 1811 without having seen Asbury again. Hinde said she had converted before her death and tried to convert the nonbelievers in the room while on her deathbed. He shared a letter in which his sister had tried to convert her close friends. Hinde named his first daughter after his late sister Martha. Hinde did not immediately convert but attended Methodist camp meetings of the period. During his life, he frequently wrote {{about the importance of}} the camp meeting in bringing Christianity and democracy to the west.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his scenes, Rupert Graves was tanned <b>because</b> <b>before</b> {{filming the}} episode, the actor was in Guadeloupe, an island on the Caribbean, {{appearing}} in Death in Paradise. As a result, Gatiss added mention that Lestrade went on holiday in the script. In the original episode, John was to hallucinate the hound at a meat storage locker. However, after visiting such a locker in Bristol, the producers came to realise {{that it would}} be too expensive, and cold for Freeman, forcing them to change the setting to the Baskerville labs. In one scene, Sherlock is driving a Land Rover with John as a passenger after their arrival at Dartmoor; John was originally {{going to be the one}} driving the car, however Freeman cannot drive. In the client scenes, Tovey had to smoke a herbal cigarette as it was illegal to smoke real cigarettes on set. Throughout the episode, the production crew used split dioptres in certain scenes, a camera technique where two separate camera angles are at the same focus on screen. The episode also includes shots of the hound, which was produced by visual effects. Although the series used computer-generated imagery (CGI) in the past, it was the first time a visual effect was made on a large scale. However, there was no guide for the cast to interact with.|$|E

Wells. He began a term of his own the following March 1805, was reelected six years later, in 1810, and served until his resignation on March 3, 1813.|$|E

25|$|The switch cost Guardian Newspapers £80million and {{involved}} setting up new printing presses in east London and Manchester. This was necessary <b>because,</b> <b>before</b> The Guardian move, no printing presses in Britain could produce {{newspapers in the}} Berliner format. There were additional complications, {{as one of the}} paper's presses was part-owned by Telegraph Newspapers and Express Newspapers, contracted to use the plant until 2009. Another press was shared with the Guardian Media Group's north-western tabloid local papers, which did not wish to switch to the Berliner format.|$|E

However much of the radio audience may have remained unaware that the Maxwell was ever gone, <b>because</b> <b>before</b> long Jack was heard traveling around in a decrepit old car again, {{and by the end}} of the 1940s his car would once more be specifically identified as a Maxwell.|$|E

But even after the Civil Services Examination was made common, the state of affairs did not change, and IAS and IFS retained their edge.

25|$|Nobility's marriages became restricted: generally, only a noblewoman was {{eligible}} for valid marriage of a nobleman {{in order to}} transmit the noble status to children. <b>Because</b> <b>before</b> 17th-century mass ennoblements, the number of nobles was actually only in hundreds, daughters of lower nobility became more often brides for wealthy Swedish noble families and even for magnate families. This was one of reasons why many Swedish family of high nobility got also one or more Finnish foremothers (a phenomenon very rare in medieval centuries when already geography {{was a sort of}} obstacle). Finnish nobles very often moved {{to other parts of the}} realm, to have an office in military or in government.|$|E
25|$|At 6 o'clock, {{the high}} {{commander}} of the Hungarian army, General Artúr Görgei arrived on the battlefield, and ordered to his troops to continue the advancement. The right wing was commanded by himself advanced in the forest from Ács, the left flank led by General György Klapka between Mocsa and Ószőny. After the troops of Klapka advanced to Ószőny, pushing back the Liebler brigade, the latter, enforced by the cavalry of Lieutenant General Franz Schlik, started a counterattack, making the Hungarians to retreat, but when it arrived {{within the range of}} the Hungarian cannons from the fortress of Komárom, the cannonade of these caused heavy losses to the Imperial brigade, forcing it to move back to its initial position. The center commanded by General János Damjanich had to advance {{in the area of the}} waste lands of Herkály and Csém, but could start the rapid attack only at 9 o'clock, <b>because</b> <b>before</b> doing that, it had to cross the area dug and filled by the imperials with ditches, in order to make their advancement harder.|$|E
25|$|With the {{philosophy}} of the Temple Society, to reconstruct the Holy Land in order to gather the people of God, fading in view of the resurrection of the Holy Land by Jewish settlement, the Templers' faith lost binding power for many of its members and especially many younger discovered Nazism as a non-denominational replacement of the vacuum. Thus most Nazis in the Holy Land were from Templer background. This led to a complete turnaround in the Evangelical-Templers' relationship, <b>because</b> <b>before</b> 1933 the Evangelical Protestants had strong mental and financial support by German Protestant church bodies, while Templers were somewhat orphaned. After 1933 Templers increasingly usurped positions with influential connections to Nazi party and Nazi government bodies in Germany, while the German Protestant church bodies as partners of the Evangelical congregations in the Holy Land lost government support by the struggle of the churches and by Hitler's and Alfred Rosenberg's general abandonment of Christianity, considered indissolubly Judaised with the Ten Commandments and the Old Testament. Cornelius Schwarz, a Templer from Jaffa, led the Palestinian faction (Landesgruppe) of the Nazi party, with him many young men gained influence over long established institutions as the Evangelical provostry and its congregations as well as the Temple Society itself. The German Foreign Office imposed on Gentile Germans of different denominational affiliations a stronger co-operation under influence of Palestinian Nazi officials of Temple background.|$|E

25|$|This theory postulates that {{multicellularity}} arose as a {{means for}} prey to escape predation. Larger prey {{are less likely to be}} preyed upon, and larger predators are more likely to catch prey. Therefore it is likely that multicellularity arose when the first predators evolved. By assembling as a larger, multicelled organism, prey could escape the attempts of a predator. Therefore multicellularity was selectively favoured over unicellularity. This can be seen in a simple experiment conducted by Boraas et al. (1998). When a predatory protist, Ochromonas valencia, was introduced to a prey population of Chlorella vulgaris, it was seen that within less than 100 generations of the prey species a multicellular growth form of the alga became dominant. This is interesting <b>because</b> <b>before</b> the predator was introduced, the population of Chlorella vulgaris retained its unicellular growth form for thousands of generations. It is likely that it would have remained unicellular indefinitely if the selective pressure that was induced by the predators had not been introduced. After multiple generations with the predator, the algal species retained a growth form of 8-10 cells, which was large enough to avoid the predator, but small enough that each cell still had access to nutrients. This predator-prey relationship provides a likely reason for why it was beneficial for organisms to be multicellular.|$|E
