50|$|It has {{now been}} shown that Lithium, which {{has been used as}} a {{treatment}} for bipolar disorder, acts as a mood stabilizer by selectively inhibiting GSK-3. The mechanism through which GSK-3 inhibition stabilizes mood is not known, though it is suspected that the inhibition of GSK-3's ability to promote inflammation contributes to the therapeutic effect. Inhibition of GSK-3 also destabilises Rev-ErbA alpha transcriptional repressor, which has a significant role in the circadian clock.

40|$|Although the Kraepelinian {{classification}} paradigm is widely used, observations of overlapping boundaries between the symptoms associated with bipolar disor- der and schizophrenia {{are beginning to}} challenge this dichotomy.

40|$|<b>Bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder</b> {{has been}} {{traditionally}} researched, explored, and explained from a modernistic, psychiatric perspective. The {{purpose of this}} study is to explicate an alternative description for <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder,</b> from a postmodern perspective. The widely accepted psychiatric knowledge focuses on the signs and symptoms of the disorder, pharmacological treatments, and manualised psychotherapies. This thesis shifts the focus from an intrapsychic, deficit perspective towards one which is inclusive of surrounding discourses and patterned relationships. The social constructionist research approach is followed, utilising vignette and thematic analyses for textual deconstruction and reconstruction. In addition to these data analyses, discourses were analysed using the actual text of the co-researchers. This allowed for a thorough explication of the ways in which discourses shape the construct <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder.</b> From these analyses, emergent themes were then distilled and compared to the existing body of literature in the bipolar mood spectrum field of study. Process models were generated to depict the various pertinent aspects of the social construction of <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder.</b> This research has value for the treating professional, allowing for a broader, more inclusive discourse perspective to add to the already established medical model view. Further, this research gives credence to the voice of the person who has been diagnosed with the illness. This research may also contribute to the epistemological debates within modernist and postmodernist paradigms.

Methods: Sixty patients with <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder</b> and acutemania episodes who referred to Ibn-e-Sina Psychiatric Hospitalin Mashhad were recruited. Half of them were randomly assignedto the psycho-education group. Their available adultfamily members received a psycho-educational training sessionbefore the patients' discharge from the hospital. All patients receivedconcurrent appropriate pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. All the patients were evaluated by a blind home-visit teamevery 3 months for a period of one year. The evaluation includedthe number of psychiatric visits, patients' adherence, relapsestatus, number of re-hospitalizations, and time to relapse. Results: Fifty-seven patients completed the trial. In the experimentalgroup, there were four patients with relapse(13. 79 %) and in the control group nine patients (31. 58 %) hadrelapse of the disorder (P= 0. 006).

Conclusion: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have metabolic side effects which require regular monitoring and prompt treatment. Background Retinal vein occlusions (RVOs) frequently occur in the elderly in association with atherosclerosis. Hypertension is the commonest cause of RVOs in such population. In young adults, RVOs are associated with vasculitis and coagulopathies. Extensive work-up is required as both vasculitis and coagulopathies can lead to severe systemic morbidity and mortality.

V diplomskem delu smo predstavili bipolarno motnjo razpoloženja, dejavnike, ki negativno vplivajo na kakovost življenja oseb z bipolarno motnjo, in vlogo zdravstvene nege pri obravnavi pacienta z bipolarno motnjo. Metodologija raziskovanja: Diplomsko delo temelji na teoretičnih vsebinah. Uporabili smo deskriptivno metodo dela s študijem domače in tuje strokovne {{literature}}. Rezultati: Ugotovili smo, da bipolarna motnja razpoloženja zmanjšuje kakovost življenja oseb s to motnjo in tudi njihovih svojcev. Oseba se zaradi omenjene motnje izogiba socialnim stikom, pogosto naleti na nerazumevanje okolice in se zaradi tega zateka v osamo. Spremenijo se tudi družinski odnosi, velikokrat na slabše. Pomembno je, da je družina obolelemu članu v oporo in pomoč. Prav tako je izredno pomembna vloga medicinske sestre, saj osebi z bipolarno motnjo nudi vso potrebno podporo in pomoč. Diskusija: Iz analize strokovne literature je razvidno, da bipolarna motnja razpoloženja negativno vpliva na socialne in materialne potrebe tako posameznika kot njegove družine in s tem pomembno zmanjšuje njihovo kakovost življenja. Zaradi narave motnje oseba velikokrat ne zmore opravljati vsakodnevnih aktivnosti. Vpliv medicinske sestre je pri tem zelo pomemben. Medicinska sestra glede na pacientove potrebe nudi pomoč in podporo tako njemu kot tudi njegovi družini, ga spodbuja k izvajanju osnovnih življenjskih aktivnosti in ga poučuje o tem, kako čim bolj kakovostno živeti z bipolarno motnjo razpoloženja. Theoretical background: <b>Bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder</b> {{is one of}} {{the affective}} mood disorders. It is characterized by severe mood swings from intense, manic ‘highs’, to depressive ‘lows’. The thesis discusses <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder,</b> and factors which have a great impact on {{the quality of life of}} a person with <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder,</b> and health care of a patient with depressive and manic episode. Research methodology: Thesis is based on theoretical contents. The descriptive method of work was used through the study of Slovenian and foreign literature. Results: We found that <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder</b> reduces the quality of life of people with this disorder and the lives of their families. As a result of disease the person avoids social contacts and often encounters lack of understanding of society and therefore retreats into seclusion. Family relationships change as well, often they tend to worsen. It is important that family provides support and assistance to the family member with disease. Extremely important is a role of a nurse who provides a patient with all the necessary help and support. Discussion: The analysis of the literature shows that <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorder</b> significantly reduces the quality of life of a person and his family and has an adverse effect to the social life of a person. Due to the nature of disorder a person is unable to perform its daily activities. The role of nurses is very important.

40|$|Implication {{for health}} policy/practice/research/medical education: This {{article focuses on}} {{quantitative}} changes of volumetric parameters of cerebellum in rat after Lithium administration. Lithium is a mood-stabilizer drug that is used for treatment of manic depressive and mixed episodes of <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorders.</b> Cerebellar toxicity has also been recognized as an uncommon but potentially irreversible on sequence of Lithium therapy. Considering this, {{it is necessary to}} find out the effects of this drug on cerebellum. This study is recommended to basic medical sciences researchers, neurologists, Psy-chologists, and also for enlightening general population. Background: Lithium is a drug for treatment of bipolar disorder by correcting mania and reducing depressive mood swings. Objectives: In this study, effects of Lithium on volumetric parameters of cerebellum were investigated using stereological methods. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 20 sexually mature wistar male rats were selected and divided in two groups randomly (n = 10). Administration and con-trol groups received continuously 0. 1 percent Lithium carbonate solution and distilled water respectively with drinking water during a period of 12 weeks. Rat’s cerebellum excised and fixed in modified Lillie’s solution. Then tissues were dehydrated, cleared...|$|R
40|$|Clinical and {{epidemiological}} studies have consistently revealed {{an association between}} alcohol use disorders and both <b>bipolar</b> and nonbipolar <b>mood</b> <b>disorders.</b> However, the evidence regarding {{the nature of these}} associations is unclear. The familial patterns of alcohol and affective disorders were examined using data from a controlled family study of probands with alcohol and anxiety disorders who were sampled from treatment settings and the community. The substantial degree of comorbidity between <b>mood</b> and anxiety <b>disorders</b> among probands allowed for the examination of comorbidity and familial aggregation of alcohol and <b>mood</b> <b>disorders.</b> The major findings are that (1) alcoholism was associated with <b>bipolar</b> and nonbipolar <b>mood</b> <b>disorders</b> in the relatives; (2) there was a strong degree of familial aggregation of alcohol dependence and both types of <b>mood</b> <b>disorders</b> were observed; and (3) {{there was no evidence of}} cross-aggregation (i. e., increase in <b>mood</b> <b>disorders</b> among probands with alcohol dependence, and vice versa) between alcoholism and <b>mood</b> <b>disorders.</b> The independent familial aggregation of bipolar disorder and alcoholism and the finding that the onset of bipolar disorder tended to precede that of alcoholism are compatible with a self-medication hypothesis as the explanation for the frequent co-occurrence of these disorders. In contrast, the independent familial aggregation and the tendency of an earlier onset of alcoholism than that of nonbipolar depression suggest that unipolar <b>mood</b> <b>disorders</b> are frequently secondary to alcoholis...|$|R
40|$|The {{biological}} mechanisms {{proposed to}} underlie primary <b>mood</b> <b>disorder</b> do not usually include a neuropathological component. However, a significant MRI literature attests to structural abnormalities in regions and has encouraged neuropathological investigations from which candidate histological correlates {{have begun to}} emerge. In particular, there are several reports of cytoarchitectural alterations in anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices, characterized by {{a decrease in the}} number or density of glia. Reductions in the size and density of some neuronal populations have also been described, accompanied by alterations in indices of synaptic terminals and dendrites. This form of pathology putatively reflects aberrant neurodevelopment or impaired cellular plasticity. A separate pathological process is suggested by the excess of subcortical focal lesions seen on MRI, especially in elderly patients; these probably reflect white matter damage of vascular origin. Both types of pathology have been observed, {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, in unipolar as well as <b>bipolar</b> <b>mood</b> <b>disorders.</b> None of the findings appear attributable to treatment with antidepressants, mood stabilizers or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, all findings remain preliminary due to a lack of unequivocal replication and the failure to control fully for other potential confounders and co-morbid conditions. There are also basic questions to be answered concerning the clinical correlates, magnitude, progression and heterogeneity of the pathology. Nevertheless, it must now be considered likely that changes in brain structure, both macroscopic and microscopic, are a feature of primary <b>mood</b> <b>disorder,</b> a fact to be taken into account when interpreting functional imaging, neuropsychological and neurochemical data. The neuropathology is postulated to contribute to the pathophysiology and dysfunction of the neural circuits which regulate mood and its associated cognitions, behaviours and somatic symptoms...|$|R
