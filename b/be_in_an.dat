5|$|Montagu {{outlined}} three {{criteria for}} the document that contained {{the details of the}} falsified plans to land in the Balkans.

5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star suggested that this was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E

It is known that they were buried in a mass-grave, but the grave's exact location has been a mystery for 240 years.

5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} {{the origins and}} the nature of the bad blood between the two. According to Jackson, the rivalry exists because he was one of the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to eat or <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> elevator with Silva, but he was not one of them. He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E
5|$|Two rule {{changes were}} made for the 79th Academy Awards {{in regard to the}} Best Foreign Language Film process. The first was instituting a two-step process in {{choosing}} the nominees for the award in order to allow New York-based members of the Academy to participate. An initial committee would select nine films to form a shortlist in January that would then be reviewed by a committee composed of ten members of the initial committee, ten Los Angeles-based members, and ten New York-based members that would select the final five nominees. The second change was the removal of a rule requiring that the films <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> official language of the submitting country. This was done in response to the rejection of Italy's and Austria's submissions for the 78th Academy Awards, Private and Caché respectively, because they were not filmed in the official language of their respective countries. This allowed for the acceptance of submissions such as Canada's Water, which contained solely Hindi dialogue. Following the revealing of the shortlist, the Academy released a list of the five nominees on January 23, 2007. The winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film was Germany's The Lives of Others, which was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.|$|E

40|$|Social {{networking}} sites (SNS) play {{an increasingly}} important role in maintaining geographically close romantic relationships (GCRR). However, knowledge about SNS use in long-distance romantic relationships (LDRR) is still lacking. The present study examined {{the relative importance of}} SNS in maintaining LDRR compared to GCRR, particularly with regard to the use of SNS to express involvement (via relational maintenance behaviors) and to gauge a partner's involvement (via partner surveillance and jealousy) in the relationship. An online survey was conducted among predominantly young adult Facebook users who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> romantic relationship (N= 272). Results showed that participants who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> LDRR reported higher levels of relational maintenance behaviors through SNS than participants who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GCRR. Also, as compared to participants who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> GCRR, participants who <b>were</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> LDRR used SNS more for partner surveillance and experienced higher levels of SNS jealousy...|$|R
