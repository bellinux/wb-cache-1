40|$|In this research, {{the high}} carbon-containing (coke,> 20 wt%) Pt {{catalyst}} wasted from a full-scale petrochemical plant are regenerated in quartz and <b>borax</b> <b>glass</b> reactors by applying 250 W microwave irradiation for 18 hours. When irradiated with microwave substances of various dielectric characteristics will consume the microwave energy; {{the quantity of}} energy consumed is proportional to dielectric constant. Because <b>borax</b> <b>glass</b> has higher dielectric constant than quartz glass (e. g. 4. 6 vs. 3. 6 F/M), it causes higher energy loss than quartz glass. Laboratory results reveal that the removal of coke is smaller for the sample placed in the <b>borax</b> <b>glass</b> reactor than in the quartz glass container (17. 7 vs. 25. 9 %). On the other hand, higher MW output power leads to stronger electrical field to influence the mutual reactions between microwave and dielectric materials (e. g. the absorption of microwave energy), and the overall energy efficiency. The laboratory results also show that when the microwave energy is increased from 250 to 450 W, the carbon removal rate is raised from 25. 9 to 38. 1 % with the sample placed in quartz glass reactor. Using the microwave energy to regenerate high carbon-containing (coke...|$|E
40|$|In this work, a multi {{dimensional}} RF MEMS {{variable capacitor}} that utilizes electrostatic actuation is designed and fabricated on a 425 um thick silicon substrate. Electrostatic actuation is preferred over other actuation mechanisms due to low power consumption. The RF MEMS variable capacitor is designed in a CPW topology, with multiple beams supported (1 - 7 beams) {{on a single}} pedestal. The varactors are fabricated using surface micromachining techniques. A 1 um thick silicon monoxide (Er - 6) {{is used as a}} dielectric layer for the varactor. The movable membrane is suspended on a 2. 5 um thick electroplated gold pedestal. The capacitance between the membrane and the bottom electrode increases as the bias voltage between the membrane and the bottom electrode is increased, eventually causing the membrane to snap down at the actuation voltage. For the varactors designed herein, the actuation voltage is approximately 30 - 90 V. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations are performed from 1 - 25 GHz to accurately predict the frequency response of the varactors. The EM simulations and the measurement results compare favorably. A series RLC equivalent circuit is used to model the varactor and used to extract the parasitics associated with the capacitor by optimizing the model with the measurement results. The measured capacitance ratio is approximately 12 : 1 with a tuning range from 0. 5 - 6 pF. Furthermore, the measured S-parameter data is used to extract the unloaded Q of the varactor (at 1 GHz) and is found to be 234 in the up state and 27 in the down state. An improved anodic bonding technique to bond high resistivity Si substrate and low alkali <b>borax</b> <b>glass</b> substrate that finds potential application towards packaging of MEMS varactors is investigated. To facilitate the packaging of the varactors the temperature is maintained at 400 Â°C. The bonding time is approximately 7 min at an applied voltage of 1 KV...|$|E
6000|$|Incombustible Stuffs.--I {{extract the}} {{following}} paragraph from a newspaper. Persons who make much use of musquito curtains, {{will be glad}} to read it. [...] "'The Répertoire de Chimie Pure et Appliquee' publishes the following remarks by the celebrated chemists, MM. D¦bereiner and Oesner, on the various methods for rendering stuffs incombustible, or at least less inflammable than they naturally are. The substances employed for this purpose are <b>borax,</b> alum, soluble <b>glass,</b> and phosphate of ammonia. For wood and common stuffs, any one of these salts will do; but fine and light tissues, which are just those most liable to catching fire, cannot be treated in the same way. Borax renders fine textile fabrics stiff; it causes dust, and will swell out under the smoothing-iron; so does alum, beside weakening the fibres of the stuff, so as to make it tear easily. Soluble glass both stiffens and weakens the stuff, depriving it both of elasticity and tenacity. Phosphate of ammonia alone has none of these inconveniences. It may be mixed with a certain quantity of sal-ammoniac, and then introduced into the starch prepared for stiffening the linen; or else it may be dissolved in 20 parts of water, in weight, to one of phosphate, and the stuff steeped into the solution, then allowed to dry, and ironed as usual.|$|R
40|$|The major {{objective}} in glass tank melters is {{to optimize the}} entire process by reducing the maximum temperature of melting, improving refractory performance and/or improving melter fuel efficiency. The required characteristics of refractories used in melters are: thermal shock resistance, corrosion resistance, controlled expansion behavior, low thermal conductivity, and adequate creep resistance. The corrosion of the refractories in the melter {{may be due to}} batch carryover (lime, soda, fluorides, lead oxide, <b>borax,</b> silica, other <b>glass</b> constituents), volatile fluxes (i. e., volatile alkali oxides penetrating pores, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist), and melt attack, mainly at the metal line. Erosion often follows the initial corrosion, washing away refractory grains after the original bond has dissolved. Corrosion test designs are usually based on operation and reaction temperatures, reaction rates, and the formation of coatings on the refractory surface. Refractories for glass furnaces normally are limited to compositions based on A 12 O 3, ZrO 2, and SiO 2, with or without Cr 2 O 3. Alumina-zirconia-silicate (AZS) refractories in contact with molten glass form a viscous silicate layer adjacent to the refractory thus restricting contact, and therefore, increasing corrosion resistance. When AZS blocks are used in superstructures, they are exposed to high temperature combustion products. At temperatures above 1475 0 C, the bond strength between the embedded ZrO 2 crystals and the alumina is reduced, attributed to the variation in the thermal expansion characteristics of A 12 O 3 and ZrO 2. Superstructure and crown refractories are subjected to corrosive reactions with the vapor species of the batch components and batch carryover. In the melting of soda-lime glasses, the vapor species are primarily soda and sodium sulfates; for borosilicat...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} {{the performance of}} roof ridge vents {{in regard to the}} possible entry of snow into the attic space under strong wind conditions. A total of 11 vent configurations made available by Air Vent Inc. were tested for snow infiltration. Additionally, attic pressures and flow rates were measured for 13 ridge vent arrangements, including the 11 tested for snow infiltration. For reasons of expense, time, and ease of execution, wind tunnel models of snow blowing and drifting have been used for many years in design and in specific problem solutions. A fairly large number of modelling materials have been employed, e. g. sawdust, mica, gypsum, peat, sand, <b>borax,</b> magnesium carbonate, <b>glass</b> beads, activated clay, expanded polysterene, wheat bran, and semolina. (A recent study of snow loads on the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis was carried out for example using glass beads with a diameter of 0. 1 mm, at a scale of 1 : 384.) In the present study, however, to simulate field conditions as closely as possible, actual natural dry snow was used. The tests were conducted during winter months using the open circuit mode of operation of the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory. The results of the study offer a comparison of the effectiveness of various ridge vent designs, valid of course under the conditions under which the tests were carried out, as described in detail in this report. The tests have been carried out to date at a wind approach angle of 0 degrees (wind direction perpendicular to the roof ridge). The model has been constructed in three pieces (a central piece and two angle pieces) so that, by omitting the two angle pieces, it can be fitted in the tunnel in a rotated 45 degree position for additional testing with 45 degree approach winds. This testing, originally planned for the winter of 1995, had to be postponed until next winter due to the surprisingly mild 1995 winter weather conditions in Minneapolis. Air Vent, Inc...|$|R
