He has also defended the Supreme Court's use of foreign law and international law as persuasive (but not <b>binding)</b> <b>authority</b> in its decisions. However, Breyer is also recognized to be deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in the Supreme Court's First Amendment rulings. Breyer has also demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Supreme Court justice since 1994.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} negligence against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the <b>binding</b> <b>authority</b> of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E

50|$|In {{civil law}} systems, where the preeminent {{source of law}} is legal codes and statutes, a lacuna (a gap) arises when a {{specific}} issue is not explicitly dealt with in written law. Judges will try to identify a provision whose purpose applies to the case at hand. That process can reach {{a high degree of}} sophistication, as judges sometimes not only look at a specific provision to fill lacunae (gaps), but at several provisions (from which an underlying purpose can be inferred) or at general principles of the law to identify the legislator's value judgement from which the analogy is drawn. Besides the not very frequent filling of lacunae, analogy is very commonly used between different provisions in order to achieve substantial coherence. Analogy from previous judicial decisions is also common, although these decisions are not <b>binding</b> <b>authorities.</b>|$|R

500|$|Circuit courts do not {{collaborate}} or {{work with}} other circuits to resolve legal issues, and different circuit courts may reach conflicting conclusions about the same legal issue. Furthermore, cases decided in one circuit are not <b>binding</b> <b>authority</b> on other circuits. If the Supreme Court of the United States has not ruled on a legal issue, federal courts of appeals resolve these issues [...] "as they see fit, subject only to a norm of intracircuit stare decisis." [...] When a circuit split occurs, there is rarely an even numeric division among courts of appeals with regard to how the dispute should be resolved. In fact, {{one study found that}} courts of appeals split evenly in less than one third of all circuit splits. Occasionally, separate courts of appeals will reach three or more different conclusions with regard to the same legal issue.|$|E

25|$|In {{the legal}} field, source {{classification}} {{is important because}} the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of <b>binding</b> legal <b>authority,</b> while secondary legal sources may include books, the headnotes of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias. Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and precedential, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.|$|R

500|$|However, whilst {{the forces}} were {{developing}} locally, {{the goals of}} a comprehensive Imperial defence policy remained constant. A proposal was made to a conference of Dominion leaders in 1907, which recommended that all Imperial forces be organised along a standard model, similar to the recent divisional reorganisation of the British Army and the Army in India (the combined British Army units in India and the Indian Army units). The conference approved this concept, but carried the idea further, and recommended {{the creation of a}} general staff drawn from the forces of the entire Empire. This Imperial General Staff would serve as a common link between the national forces, and could oversee the development of a single uniform defence scheme. It would also be able to help ensure greater consistency between the forces, though it was carefully laid down that the Imperial General Staff could only offer [...] "guidance" [...] to the local government and General Staff, and would not have any <b>binding</b> <b>authority</b> over the national forces.|$|E

25|$|A quashing order {{may also}} be used to protect a {{substantive}} legitimate expectation. It sets aside the decision that frustrates the promise made by a public authority to an applicant, thus <b>binding</b> the <b>authority</b> to fulfil its representation. In Ex parte Coughlan, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the applicant had a substantive legitimate expectation for the facility at which she was living to be kept open {{for the rest of her}} life, which the health authority was not allowed to frustrate. It therefore upheld the High Court's decision to issue a quashing order to prevent the authority from closing the facility, effectively ensuring that the facility was kept running for the benefit of its residents.|$|R
40|$|The {{observance}} of Sharia principles in Islamic arbitration tribunals {{operating in the}} United Kingdom has been heralded {{for its ability to}} provide Muslim communities with internal, community-based fora for dispute resolution. Although the judgments issued by these faith-based arbitration tribunals lack <b>binding</b> legal <b>authority,</b> British lawmakers ex-press concerns centered on threats to the existing national legal system and to England’s deeply rooted social policy of equality and non-discrimination. Introduced to address these concerns in 2011, the Equality Bill proposes a legislative solution to further maintain the principle of equality within alternative dispute resolution channels. This Note argues that, despite the Equality Bill’s laudable effort to curb discrimination and violations of England’s policy of equality, legislative reform alone will be unlikely to affect the Bill’s desired goals...|$|R

40|$|Here {{we propose}} {{the idea that}} the success of an {{argument}} in favor of an issue position should depend on whether the argument resonates with the audiences values. Now consider two groups, one of which has a broader set of values than the other. We develop a mathematical model to investigate how this difference in broadness of values may drive a change on the population level towards positions in line with the more narrow set of values. The model is motivated by the empirical finding that conservative morality rests equally on moral foundations that are individualizing (harm and fairness) and <b>binding</b> (purity, <b>authority,</b> and ingroup), whereas liberal morality relies mainly on the individualizing moral foundations. The model then predicts that, under certain conditions, the whole population will tend to move towards positions on moral issues (e. g., same-sex marriage) that are supported by individualizing moral foundations.

40|$|Abstract: Sport fandom has {{received}} considerable attention from social scientists, yet few have considered {{it from an}} evolutionary perspective. To redress this gap, we develop the hypothesis that team sports exhibit characteristics that activate mechanisms which evolved to facilitate the development of coalitions {{in the context of}} small-scale warfare. Based on this by-product hypothesis, we predicted a correlation between fandom and binding (i. e. group-relevant) concerns, especially loyalty. To test this prediction, we administered the Sport Spectator Identification Scale (SSI) and the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ) to 495 undergraduates. The MFQ measures three binding concerns, including loyalty, and two individualizing ones, harm and fairness. As predicted, fandom correlated significantly with loyalty (r =. 27) and, within men, the two other <b>binding</b> concerns, <b>authority</b> (r =. 22) and purity (r =. 24). By contrast, fandom did not significantly correlate with harm or fairness. In addition, we predicted and found that men reported significantly higher levels of fandom (Cohen’s d =. 45) and loyalty (d =. 27) than did women. In conclusion, this study presents data supporting the coalitional by-product hypothesis of fandom and should spur further research using fandom as a window into our evolved psychology...|$|R
