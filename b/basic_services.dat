5|$|Macdonald was a {{classical}} liberal in the 19th-century tradition of John Stuart Mill.

5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to hand in a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and <b>Basic</b> <b>Services</b> Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E

Introducing firm risk aversion has two impacts. Profits for the <b>basic</b> <b>service</b> can be backloaded to induce cheaper information revelation for this service: an Income Effect which reduces output distortions. The firm must also bear some risk to induce information revelation for the add-on. This Risk Effect reduces {{the level of the}} add-on but hardens information revelation for the <b>basic</b> <b>service.</b> The interaction between these effects has important implications for the dynamics of distortions, contract renegotiation, and the value of incomplete contracts...|$|R

5|$|Constantinople {{began to}} decline {{continuously}} {{after the end of}} the reign of Basil II in 1025. The final blow was given by the conquest of Villardouin and Enrico Dandolo in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, where the City was sacked and pillaged. The city subsequently became the center of the Latin Empire, created by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. Hagia Sophia was converted to a Catholic church in 1204. The Byzantine Empire was restored, albeit weakened, in 1261. Constantinople's churches, defenses, and <b>basic</b> <b>services</b> were in disrepair, and its population had dwindled to a hundred thousand from half a million during the 8th century. After the reconquest of 1261, however some of the city's monuments were restored, and some, like the two Deisis mosaics in Hagia Sofia and Kariye, were created.|$|E
