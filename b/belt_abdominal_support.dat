Abdominal computed tomography revealed a massive hematoma in the abdominal cavity associated with deep hepatic lacerations in the right lobe. The presence of a solid tissue possibly containing pneumobilia was observed above the greater omentum. These findings were consistent with a tentative diagnosis of hepatic laceration due to blunt trauma; therefore, this prompted us to perform emergency laparotomy. The operative findings revealed a massive hematoma and pulsatile bleeding from the lacerated liver and a retroperitoneal hepatoma, which was most likely due to subcapsular injury of the right kidney. In accordance with the preoperative imaging studies, a pale liver fragment on the greater omentum was observed, which was morphologically consistent with the defect in the posterior segment of the liver. Since the damaged area of the liver broadly followed the course of the middle hepatic vein, we carefully inspected and isolated the inflow vessels and eventually performed a right hepatic lobectomy.

As {{part of this}} trend, a new algorithm may emerge for pediatric trauma in which laparoscopic techniques are used in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected hollow viscus perforation. Case Report: We present {{a case in which}} laparoscopy was successfully used in a pediatric trauma patient as a diagnostic and therapeutic modality. A 4 -year-old boy was a back-seat passenger in a head-on collision motor vehicle accident. He was restrained by a lap seat belt. He sustained a concussion, a large forehead laceration and a seat <b>belt</b> <b>abdominal</b> injury. On admission, he complained of abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a soft, nondistended abdomen with moderate diffuse tenderness. He was hemodynamically stable. Computerized tomography of the abdomen revealed free fluid in the pelvis. No abnormalities were detected in the liver or spleen. Because of clinical deterioration and suspected intestinal perforation, diagnostic laparoscopy was utilized instead of proceeding directly to celiotomy. At laparoscopy a jejunal perforation was found and successfully repaired laparoscopically. Large hematomas were seen in the mesentery, as well as an unsuspected splenic laceration. No active bleeding was found. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 5 days following the surgical procedure. Conclusion: This case illustrates the efficacy of using early laparoscopy in children with abdominal trauma when diagnosis is difficult and hollow viscus injury is suspected...|$|R

50|$|Physical {{therapists}} {{can assist}} immobilized patients with effective cough techniques, secretion clearance, stretching of the thoracic wall, and suggest <b>abdominal</b> <b>support</b> <b>belts</b> when necessary. The {{amount of time}} a patient is immobilized may depend {{on the level of}} the spinal cord injury. Physical therapists work with the patient to prevent any complications that may arise due to this immobilization. Other complications that arise from immobilization include muscle atrophy and osteoporosis, especially to the lower limbs, increasing the risk of fractures to the femur and tibia. While passive weight bearing of paralyzed lower extremities appears to be ineffective, stressing the bones through muscular contractions initiated by functional electrical stimulation (FES) has yielded positive results in some cases. The intensity, frequency, and duration of stress to the bones appear to be important determinants of improved bone parameters. Generally, the frequency is effective with three or more weekly exercise sessions. Studies of duration suggest that several months to one or more years of FES are necessary.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to measure the {{effectiveness}} of two treatment techniques-vocalization with <b>abdominal</b> breath <b>support</b> and manual circumlaryngeal therapy (MCT) -in patients with muscle tension dysphonia (MTD). The vocal quality before and after the two treatment techniques was measured by means of the dysphonia severity index (DSI), which is designed to establish an objective and quantitative correlate of the perceived vocal quality. The DSI is based on the weighted combination of the following set of voice measurements: maximum phonation time (MPT), highest frequency, lowest intensity, and jitter. The repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant difference between the objective overall vocal quality before and after MCT. No significant differences were measured between the objective overall vocal quality before and after vocalization with <b>abdominal</b> breath <b>support.</b> This study showed evidence that MCT is an effective treatment technique for patients with elevated laryngeal position, increased laryngeal muscle tension, and MTD.

40|$|The {{adequacy}} of peritoneal dialysis is generally dependant on {{the choice of}} peritoneal fluid, the intraperitoneal fill volume and the contact time.

We designed a mechanism to increase the membrane surface contact area by using an <b>abdominal</b> <b>belt</b> in order to exert enough pressure on the fill volume, to effectively recruit more area in contact for exchange. We studied 12 patients on regular continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at our center from January to October 2008. The age of patients ranged from 44 to 75 years, with a median of 55 years. All the patients were maintained on the same prescription four months before and during the study. Dialysis solutions were 1. 36 % Deaneal®, two liters, three exchanges and the last fill volume was two liters 7. 5 % Extraneal®. The belt was applied to all the patients most of the day and all night. We then observed its effect on dialysis adequacy, reflected by various parameters over a period of eight months. The average Kt/V before wearing the belt was 1. 89 and improved after applying the belt to 2. 3 (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the crash {{exposure}} patterns of pregnant occupants and to evaluate the effectiveness of restraint systems, including four-point seatbelts, in far side crashes. The NASS CDS database revealed that 53. 0 % of pregnant occupants are exposed to frontal crashes while 13. 5 % are exposed to far side impacts. Given that far side crashes were the second leading crash mode after frontal impacts, a previously validated MADYMO computer model of a 30 week pregnant occupant was utilized to investigate pregnant occupant biomechanics in far side crashes. Three impact speeds (5, 15, and 25 mph) were simulated with four restraint conditions: unbelted, lap-belt only, three-point belt, and a four-point <b>belt.</b> Direct <b>abdominal</b> contact from the shoulder strap of the three-point or four-point belt caused uterine-placental strain in contrast to the inertial loading induced strain in the lap-belt and unbelted cases.

Ten healthy male subjects without any history of low back pain participated and a semi-rigid LSO was utilized. Antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of spine images during neutral, flexion, and extension postures, with and without LSO, were captured. Lateral radiographic images were observed by five observers to determine the lumbar lordosis angles by implementation of Cobb, Centroid, and Posterior Tangent methods. Hand drawn line technique was applied on each image using a ruler while lordotic angles were measured using a protractor. Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Lumbar lordoses ranged from 6. 16 ° to 14. 88 ° without orthosis and 15. 24 ° to 17. 92 ° with orthosis for trunk flexion and as for trunk extension with and without orthosis, lumbar lordoses ranged from 39. 92 ° to 57. 96 ° and 36. 24 ° to 56. 88 °, respectively. Correlation between the methods was significant. In addition, there was a significant difference between lumbar lordosis of trunk flexion measured by Cobb and Centroid techniques. However, there were only small changes in trunk extension with and without orthosis measured by Cobb, Centroid, and Posterior Tangent methods. Reliability among observers was also high.

In addition, pressure activity was decreased during sleep com-pared to pre-sleep and post-sleep. We suspect that this may con-tribute to delayed colon transit time after SCI.
