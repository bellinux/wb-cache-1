5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of {{three to four weeks}} and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. Also, they draw {{moisture}} from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness to experiment with their perceived image in the media.|$|E

5|$|On 12 September 1920, Haruna was {{involved}} in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a breech explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No.1 turret, killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of the turret. A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse ignited the gunpowder <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> the breech, detonating the shell while still in the barrel. The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where the elevation of her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Conrad was {{to star in}} an MTV {{series that}} would have focused on her career endeavors, though the network chose not {{to pick up the}} program after Conrad {{preferred}} not to film her private life. In April 2011, Conrad launched The Beauty Department with her hairstylist, Kristin Ess, and her makeup artist, Amy Nadine; she later announced plans to expand the brand to include a line of cosmetics. Looking to target a more upscale audience, Conrad released her third fashion line Paper Crown that August; Conrad released her fourth novel The Fame Game as a spin-off to the L.A. Candy series in April 2012. she has since established an account with Nordstrom for the line. In July, she collaborated with BlueAvocado to launch XO(eco), an environmentally-friendly collection of <b>bags.</b> <b>In</b> October 2012, Conrad released The Fame Game continuation novel Starstruck and the style guide Lauren Conrad Beauty. The final novel of the trilogy, Infamous, was released in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Females usually {{engage with}} several males over a {{breeding}} season. The eggs are fertilised internally in the oviduct. The female deposits them individually on leaves of aquatic plants, {{such as water}} cress or floating sweetgrass, usually close to the surface, and, using her hindlegs, folds the leaf around the eggs as protection from predators and radiation. In the absence of suitable plants, the eggs may also be deposited on leaf litter, stones, or even plastic <b>bags.</b> <b>In</b> the northern crested newt, a female takes around five minutes for the deposition of one egg. Crested newt females usually lay around 200 eggs per season, while the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) can lay up to 400. Triturus embryos are usually light-coloured, 1.8–2mm in diameter with a 6mm jelly capsule, which distinguishes them from eggs of other co-existing newt species that are smaller and darker-coloured. A genetic particularity in the genus causes 50% of the embryos to die: their development is arrested {{when they do not}} possess two different variants of chromosome 1 (i.e., when they are homozygous for that chromosome).|$|E

5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> the wings and fin. The fin tank is used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E
5|$|The doctor tells Scully that Emily {{is getting}} worse. A {{woman from the}} {{adoption}} agency arrives and wants to stop Scully from making decisions for Emily. Mulder connects {{the names of the}} women in the nursing home to recent births and finds that Dr. Calderon was treating them. Emily reacts badly to being placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Mulder finds medical records with Scully's name on them at the nursing home, along with a live fetus in a refrigerated chamber. Mulder finds Calderon entering soon after, and Detective Kresge arrives as well. Mulder and Kresge confront Calderon, who attacks Kresge. Despite Mulder's warning Kresge shoots Calderon, whose wounds cause him to spew green blood which incapacitates Kresge. Mulder quickly leaves the building to avoid being affected by the blood. Calderon morphs into Kresge, and deceives Mulder and escapes. Mulder returns to the hospital, where Emily has gone into a coma. Days later Emily has died. Mulder visits Scully at the funeral chapel, telling her that Kresge is recovering and all evidence at the nursing home and Prangen is gone. The only evidence left is Emily's body, but the agents instead find sand <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> her coffin along with Scully's cross necklace, which she had previously given to Emily.|$|E
5|$|With {{access to}} wood from the Quantock Hills, {{records show that}} paper making was {{established}} by 1652. In the 15th century, a flour mill was established by the Fulford and Hadley families {{near the mouth of}} the Washford River. By 1587 the Wyndham estate had established a fulling and grist mill to the south west. By 1652, the mill had started to produce paper. In 1846 business partners James Date, William Peach and John Wansbrough bought the business and introduced mechanised-production using a water wheel-powered pulley system. In the 1860s, the factory was converted to steam power and the local harbour was used to import raw materials and export finished goods. Most of the mill was destroyed by fire in 1889 but it was rebuilt and less than ten years later five paper making machines were operating. The mill became the largest manufacturer of paper <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> the UK. In 1896, the business became the Wansbrough Paper Company, a limited liability company and is now known as the Wansbrough Paper Mill. With an annual capacity of 180,000 tonnes of product and employing 100 people, it is the UK's largest manufacturer of coreboard, and also produces containerboard, recycled envelope, bag and kraft papers. In December 2015 the paper mill ceased production and closed.|$|E

25|$|Basil is most {{commonly}} used fresh in recipes. In general, it is added at the last moment, as cooking quickly destroys the flavor. The fresh herb can be kept {{for a short time}} in plastic <b>bags</b> <b>in</b> the refrigerator, or for a longer period in the freezer, after being blanched quickly in boiling water. The dried herb also loses most of its flavor, and what little flavor remains tastes very different, with a weak coumarin flavor, like hay.|$|E
