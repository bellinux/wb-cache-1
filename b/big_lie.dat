You say it enough, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie, you repeat the lie and eventually, people believe it. Like blood libel. That's {{the same kind}} of thing. The Germans said enough about the Jews and the people believed it and you had the Holocaust. You tell a lie over and over again. And we've heard on this floor, government takeover of health care.|$|E
25|$|This {{denial and}} {{suppression}} {{of information about}} the famine was made in official Soviet propaganda from the very beginning until the 1980s. It was supported by some Western journalists and intellectuals. It was echoed {{at the time of the}} famine by some prominent Western journalists, including Walter Duranty and Louis Fischer. The denial of the man-made famine was a highly successful and well orchestrated disinformation campaign by the Soviet government. According to Robert Conquest, it was the first major instance of Soviet authorities adopting the <b>Big</b> <b>Lie</b> propaganda technique to sway world opinion, to be followed by similar campaigns over the Moscow Trials and denial of the Gulag labor camp system.|$|E

25|$|As {{the year}} moves on, Den decides {{that he wants}} to leave Angie so he can marry Jan. He finally gets round to telling Angie his {{intentions}} in October, after which Angie becomes distraught. Desperate to hold on to her husband, she announces that she is terminally ill and only has six months to live. Upon hearing this, Den becomes wracked with guilt, and so decides to revise his plans and stay with Angie. He sets about organising a second honeymoon for them in Venice. However, their holiday is ruined when Jan arrives, and upon seeing her and Den together, Angie starts drinking again having not long given up. On the way home from Venice on the Orient Express, a drunk Angie tells the barman all about her <b>big</b> <b>lie.</b> Unfortunately for Angie, Den overhears every word, and from that moment on he reverts to his original plan to leave her, although he decides to wait a while before letting Angie know that he knows about her lie. On Christmas Day that year, Den decides to get his revenge. Thinking that her marriage is safe, Angie is happier than ever - until Den informs her that he'd overheard her conversation with the barman, and he then serves her divorce papers as a Christmas present. This episode had the highest number of viewers the show has ever seen - with more than 30 million viewers (more than half of the British population) tuning in to see it. In response, Angie and Sharon pack their bags and walk out of the pub, choosing to take the route through the public area to cause Den the most embarrassment possible.|$|E
500|$|Another unorthodox {{method used}} in the film was the way low-angle shots were used to display {{a point of view}} facing upwards, thus {{allowing}} ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes. Breaking with studio convention, every set was built with a ceiling—many constructed of fabric that ingeniously concealed microphones. Welles felt that the camera should show what the eyes see, and that it was a bad theatrical convention to pretend there was no ceiling—"a <b>big</b> <b>lie</b> in order to get all those terrible lights up there," [...] he said. He became fascinated with the look of low angles, which made even dull interiors look interesting. One extremely low angle is used to photograph the encounter between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. A hole was dug for the camera, which required drilling into the concrete floor.|$|E
500|$|Harry Connick Sr., the New Orleans {{district}} attorney who defeated Garrison in 1973, criticized Stone's {{view of the}} assassination: [...] "Stone was either unaware of the details and particulars of the Clay Shaw investigation and trial or, if he was aware, that didn't get in his way of what he {{perceived to be the}} way the case should have been." [...] In his book , a history of the assassination published 16 years after the film's release, Vincent Bugliosi devoted an entire chapter to Garrison's prosecution of Shaw and Stone's subsequent film. Bugliosi lists thirty-two separate [...] "lies and fabrications" [...] in Stone's film and describes the film as [...] "one continuous lie in which Stone couldn't find any level of deception and invention beyond which he was unwilling to go." [...] David Wrone stated that [...] "80 percent of the film is in factual error" [...] and rejected the premise of a conspiracy involving the CIA and the so-called military-industrial complex as [...] "irrational." [...] Warren Commission investigator David Belin called the film [...] "a <b>big</b> <b>lie</b> that would make Adolf Hitler proud".|$|E

2500|$|In September 2013, {{during an}} {{interview}} with The Guardian, Hersh commented that the 2011 raid {{that resulted in the}} death of Osama bin Laden was [...] "one <b>big</b> <b>lie,</b> not one word of it is true". He said that the Obama administration lies systematically, and that American media outlets are reluctant to challenge the administration, saying [...] "It's pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [...] ". Hersh later clarified that he didn't dispute Bin Laden's death in Pakistan, and rather meant that the lying began in the aftermath of bin Laden's death.|$|E
2500|$|Eleuterio then {{comments}} {{the news}} items, along with Arévalo (and sometimes Belgodere or Cora). The commentary is usually punctuated by soundbites from previous visits by politicians to the program. These soundbites {{are guaranteed to}} be humorous or unflattering, as to elicit a comic effect. Two memorable ones are one by former governoress of Puerto Rico, Sila Calderón: [...] "Mentira... ¡Mentira! Eso es una mentira, grande, así, como de éste tamaño..." [...] ("Lie... A lie!

(McVeigh himself argued that [...] "imminent" [...] did not necessarily mean [...] "immediate.") They would have argued that his bombing of the Murrah building was a justifiable response to what McVeigh believed were the crimes of the U.S. government at Waco, Texas, where the 51-day siege of the Branch Davidian complex resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians. [...] As part of the defense, McVeigh's lawyers showed the jury the controversial video Waco, the <b>Big</b> <b>Lie.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Den and Angie's {{traumatic}} two-hander {{episode in}} October 1986 was a risky experiment. A thirty-minute episode {{with only two}} people in {{it had never been}} attempted in a soap before. Holland and Smith feared that the episode would not hold up, however press and audience alike were in agreement that it did. Once it was done, it set a precedent and the programme has featured two-handers ever since. The episode was structured like a [...] "tennis match" [...] between Angie and Den, with a non-speaking window-cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. It began with Den trying to tell Angie that he wanted a divorce. Angie was shocked and for a moment defeated, but she then dropped her bombshell and told Den that she only had six months to live. At first Den didn't believe her, but eventually Angie's hysterical performance convinced him. He crumbled and promised to stay with her and only after he left did Angie smile in triumph, letting the audience in on her secret that it was all a <b>big</b> <b>lie.</b> Written by Jane Hollowood and directed by Antonia Bird, this episode is considered {{to be one of the}} finest episodes in EastEnders catalogue.|$|E
