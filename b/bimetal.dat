30|$|As to the {{different}} samples, firstly, the Ag NWs show a low catalytic activity in reduction of Nip, it probably because these Ag NWs with smooth surface lack activity site for reaction. For these Ag/Au/AgCl NWs samples, the Ag/Au <b>bimetals</b> {{are responsible for the}} reduction of Nip, and the AgCl acts as support material. With the increase of Au and AgCl, the alloying of Au/Ag is improved, and the surface of Ag/Au/AgCl NWs is rougher. As described above, the catalytic activities could be improved gradually. However, in the catalytic results, S 2 sample shows the best catalytic performance among all samples. The increased AgCl could influence the catalytic activities of Ag/Au <b>bimetals.</b> The excess AgCl is coated on the surface of Ag/Au <b>bimetals</b> in S 3 sample, and it prevents the contract of Au/Ag with Nip.

30|$|In summary, 1 D Ag/Au/AgCl hollow heterostructures are {{successfully}} synthesized by GRR method from Ag NWs.

Composite heterostructures composed of noble metals and semiconductors exhibited the excellent in catalytic application. Here, 1 D Ag/Au/AgCl hollow heterostructures are synthesized by galvanic replacement reaction (GRR) from Ag nanowires (NWs). The catalytic properties of these as-obtained Ag/Au/AgCl hollow heterostructures with different ratios are investigated by reducing 4 -nitrophenol (Nip) into 4 -aminophenol (Amp) {{in the presence of}} NaBH 4, and the influence of AgCl semiconductor to the catalytic performances of Ag/Au <b>bimetals</b> is also investigated. These hollow heterostructures show the higher catalytic properties than pure Ag NWs, and the AgCl not only act as supporting materials, but the excess AgCl is also the obstacle for contact of Ag/Au <b>bimetals</b> with reactive species. Moreover, the photocatalytic performances of these hollow heterostructures are carried out by degradation of acid orange 7 (AO 7) under UV and visible light. These Ag/Au/AgCl hollow heterostructures present the higher photocatalytic activities than pure Ag NWs and commercial TiO 2 (P 25), and the Ag/Au <b>bimetals</b> enhance the photocatalytic activity of AgCl semiconductor via the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) mechanisms.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the novel, Dorothy is swept from her farm to Oz by a cyclone, which was frequently compared to the Free Silver movement in Baum's time. The yellow brick road represents the gold standard, and the Silver Shoes, which enable Dorothy to travel more comfortably, symbolizes the Populist Party's desire to construct a bimetallic standard of both gold and silver in place of the gold standard. [...] "Oz" [...] is the abbreviated form of ounce, a standard measure of gold. When Dorothy and the Scarecrow walk through the forest, the road begins to be rough and patchy, causing the Scarecrow to trip and fall numerous times. The Scarecrow's falls on the yellow brick road resemble the damage farmers faced owing to deflation caused by the scarcity of gold. Dorothy, however, simply [...] "walks around" [...] the holes in the road, showing that the bimetallic standard works. Even when gold was scarce, the other metal in the <b>bimetal</b> system would be relatively cheap, therefore one bypasses deflation. Throughout the book, most of the characters do not know the magic behind the silver shoes. It is not until Dorothy meets Glinda, the good Witch of the South, that she finds out that the silver shoes have had the power to transfer her back to Kansas all along. Baum is possibly alluding {{to the fact that the}} bimetallic standard has been a working solution to the economic crisis all along, though no one knows how to do it. Once Dorothy clicks her heels three times, she returns to Kansas, where she realizes that [...] "The Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert." [...] The silver shoes were lost, much like the fight for the bimetallic standard, which began to fade away in 1900.|$|E

In order to achieve sound replication of small specimens with dimensions less than 1 mm, very fine powders with mean particle sizes {{in the range of}} 3 - 7 micrometer were used. A wax-polymer binder system specially designed for micro-moulding was used to make up the feedstock. The isothermal and non-isothermal sintering behaviour of the moulded components was evaluated under hydrogen atmosphere. The effect of powder-binder-ratio of the feedstock, master alloy addition, and sintering conditions on the co-sintering compatibility between the components was investigated. In this study, 316 L and 17 - 4 PH showed the best co-sintering compatibility and sound joining of the materials was achieved. When combining 316 L and iron, using a 316 L master alloy (MA) mixed from NiCrMo and iron powder reduced the mismatch incompatibility with plain iron from 12. 7 % to 1. 6 %. So the 316 L/ 17 - 4 PH and 316 L MA/Fe were found to be suitable for micro-co-injection moulding.

The shape memory effect and superelasticity, especially in smart materials [1] and microelectromechanical systems [MEMS], have been extensively investigated in the past decades due to their potential use in several applications. TiNi shape memory alloys [SMAs] are most suitable for MEMS and Bio-MEMS microactuators (e.g., micropump [2, 3], microwrapper [4], and blood vessels [5]) because of their large working distance compared to <b>bimetals</b> and piezo materials.

On the other hand, TiNi thin films has only a small amount of thermal mass to heat or cool, thereby substantially minimizing the response time and enhancing the speed of operation.|$|R

5000|$|The word [...] "eigenstrain" [...] was {{introduced}} by T. Mura {{on the basis of}} the German words [...] "Eigenspannungen" [...] and [...] "Eigenspannungsquellen". In the field of continuum mechanics, an eigenstrain is a kind of strain (deformation) produced without external forces (stress-free). Thermal expansion [...] and phase changes are eigenstrains. An eigenstrain can produce a self-equilibrated stress field called [...] "eigenstress". As an example, if a piece of metal is not uniformly heated, the inhomogeneity of the thermal expansion (the incompatibility of the eigenstrain) induces stresses in the metal, without external forces: the eigenstress. A <b>bimetal</b> is used to estimate the temperature thanks to the deformation of the <b>bimetal</b> due to eigenstresses (here the temperature is uniform in the <b>bimetal</b> but not the eigenstrain, because of the difference of thermal expansion coefficients between the metals used in the <b>bimetal).</b> When a hot piece of glass is put under cold water, it can break because of this eigenstress.|$|E
