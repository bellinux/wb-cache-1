5000|$|The {{drive system}} {{designed}} by Matsushita is direct-drive {{rather than the}} more commonly found belt-drive type, a less-expensive design. The direct-drive design was developed to reduce wow and flutter and produces a very quiet turntable which, for a direct-drive turntable, has minimal motor and bearing noise, (although the <b>bearing</b> <b>rumble</b> does tend to become characteristic in well-used turntables). This was partially achieved through {{the fact that the}} SL1210/1200 was the first (and only) turntable to actually make the platter a part of the motor mechanism as opposed to attaching it via screws or magnets {{as is the case with}} most direct-drive turntables.|$|E
50|$|A rumble is a {{continuous}} deep, resonant sound, {{such as the}} sound made by heavy vehicles or thunder. In the context of audio reproduction rumble refers to a low frequency sound from the bearings inside a turntable. This is most noticeable in low quality turntables with ball bearings. Higher quality turntables use slide <b>bearings,</b> minimizing <b>rumble.</b>|$|R
