2500|$|AC power {{plugs and sockets}} are {{devices that}} allow {{electrically}} operated equipment {{to be connected to}} the primary alternating current (AC) power supply in a <b>building.</b> <b>Electrical</b> plugs and sockets differ in voltage and current rating, shape, size and type of connectors. The types used in each country are set by national standards, some of which are listed in the IEC technical report TR 60083, Plugs and socket-outlets for domestic and similar general use standardized in member countries of IEC. The scope of IEC TR 60083 states: [...] "The report only contains systems for which standard sheets have been published in a National Standard, which may be a National Standard of the country itself or any other IEC member country".|$|E
2500|$|In 1881, {{at the age}} of 21, Insull {{emigrated to}} the US, {{complete}} with side whiskers to make him appear older than his years. [...] In the decade that followed, Insull took on increasing responsibilities in Edison's business endeavors, <b>building</b> <b>electrical</b> power stations throughout the US. [...] With several other Edison Pioneers, he founded Edison General Electric, which later became the publicly held company now known as General Electric. Insull rose to become vice-president of General Electric in 1889, but was unhappy at not being named its president. [...] When the presidency went to someone else, Insull moved to Chicago as head of the Chicago Edison Company. Another consideration is that he was caught between opposing factions when J. P. Morgan combined the Thomson-Houston Electric Company and Edison General Electric to form the new company in April 1892. Those loyal to Edison accused Insull of selling out, and in fact he did welcome the infusion of capital from Vanderbilt, J. P. Morgan and others as necessary for the company's future development. Edison quickly forgave him, but others did not, and it seemed a good idea to get out of town.|$|E

40|$|In this project, the <b>building’s</b> <b>electrical</b> {{equipment}} {{by using}} fuzzy logic rules are modeled {{and the appropriate}} fuzzy logic controller {{in order to reduce}} consumption of <b>building’s</b> <b>electrical</b> energy is defined. Buildings are the largest consumers of energy worldwide including new residential and industrial buildings. The purpose of using fuzzy logic rules for <b>building’s</b> <b>electrical</b> equipment (air conditioning system, lighting and blinds) is to save energy in the whole building while keeping occupants comfort based on the comfort zone. Most of the intelligence controller use the multiple controller consist of lighting controller, HVAC and blind controller in order to control the building power consumption or create the math model for just one part of building, but in this way, by applying fuzzy rules to the plant, {{there is no need to}} have any exact mathematical model of building and finally designed the fuzzy controller to save power consumption...|$|R

2500|$|Between 1940 and 1948, {{domestic}} {{steam locomotive}} sales declined from 30 {{percent of the}} market to 2 percent. By 1949, there was no demand for steam locomotives. Baldwin's attempts to adapt to the changed market for road locomotives had been unsuccessful; the reliability of their offerings was unsatisfactory, epitomized by notorious failures such as their [...] "Centipede" [...] Diesel locomotives and their steam turbine-electric locomotives, which proved to be money pits unsuited for their intended service. [...] In July 1948 Westinghouse Electric, which had teamed with Baldwin to build diesel and electric locomotives and wanted to keep their main customer in the rail industry afloat, purchased 500,000 shares, or 21 percent, of Baldwin stock, which made Westinghouse Baldwin's largest shareholder. Baldwin used the money to cover various debts. Westinghouse vice president Marvin W. Smith became Baldwin's president in May 1949. In a move to diversify into the construction equipment market, Baldwin merged with Lima-Hamilton on December 4, 1950, to become Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton. However, Lima-Hamilton's locomotive technology was unused after the merger and market share continued to dwindle. By January, 1952 Baldwin closed its factory in Rochelle, Il. and consolidated Whitcomb production at Eddystone. In 1953 Westinghouse discontinued <b>building</b> <b>electrical</b> traction equipment, so Baldwin was forced to reconfigure their drive systems based on General Electric equipment. [...] In 1954, during which time they were being virtually shut out of the Diesel market, Baldwin delivered one steam turbine-electric locomotive to the Norfolk and Western railroad, which proved unsatisfactory in service.|$|E

Some electric {{pencil sharpeners}} are powered by batteries rather than being plugged into a <b>building's</b> <b>electrical</b> system, making them more portable.|$|R
5000|$|Industrial and {{commercial}} sites are supplied with 3-phase electricity. Imbalance between the phases causes {{problems such as}} heating in motors and existing wiring, leading to wasteful energy consumption. [...] Some voltage optimisation devices are able to improve balance on the <b>building's</b> <b>electrical</b> supply, reducing losses and improving the longevity of three phase induction motors.|$|R
30|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{provided}} by installing dedicated power supplies {{in two of the}} <b>building's</b> <b>electrical</b> rooms and running conduit to the camera cluster locations where power outlets were installed. Since we had full control of the power by using our own power supplies, the cumbersome power adapters for the cameras were removed and the required power is supplied directly.|$|R
50|$|Usually, a {{construction}} engineer will analyze architectural drawings, mechanical and electrical plans, and other blueprints to segregate the structural and general <b>building</b> <b>electrical</b> and mechanical components from those linked to personal property.

5000|$|The Empire State Building cost $40,948,900 {{to build}} (equivalent to $ in [...] ). Long-term {{forecasting}} {{of the life}} cycle of the structure was implemented at the design phase to ensure that the building's future intended uses were not restricted by the requirements of previous generations. This is particularly evident in the over-design of the <b>building's</b> <b>electrical</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Historically, AC motors {{were used}} for single or double speed {{elevator}} machines {{on the grounds of}} cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely variable speed control over the traction machine becomes an issue. Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC motor generator were the preferred solution. The MG set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a <b>building's</b> <b>electrical</b> system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the <b>building's</b> <b>electrical</b> supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.|$|R
50|$|Renovations {{included}} {{replacement of}} the <b>building’s</b> <b>electrical,</b> mechanical and plumbing systems {{and the addition of}} air conditioning.

50|$|HomePlug {{devices are}} not {{compatible}} with certain power strips, surge protectors, and uninterruptible power supplies incorporating filters, which block the high-frequency signal.
