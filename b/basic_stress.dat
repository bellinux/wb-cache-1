40|$|The {{theoretical}} solutions cf {{the stresses}} in an infinite plate with the hole under uniform loading have been solved {{in a lot}} of cases by the numerous researchers, and the stress concentration factor along tbe hole has been well known. But there are many cases, in which the plate is loaded by the bolts, the rivets or the weldings in the vicinity of the hole. Then the stress distribution and the stress concentration factors along the hole are different to the uniform loading. In the previous papers, the stresses in an infinite plate with a circular or an intersected circular hole under two concentrated forces have been reported. This paper contains an exact two dimensional solution in the integral form for the stresses in an infinite plate with two contacted circular holes of equal size under two concentrated forces along the plane on the common tangential line of the holes. The <b>basic</b> <b>stress</b> function representing in the complex variables was transformed in the Fourier integrals using the formulas of the definite integral. A complete stress function in the plate with the hole was constructed in the form, in which a <b>basic</b> <b>stress</b> function was added to the auxiliary one.
