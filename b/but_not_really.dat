25|$|These {{people then}} shifted to Torres Strait — {{maintaining}} established ties with Papua {{as well as}} with Austronesian speakers further east (this latter being suggested by various characteristics of the Austronesian content in Kalau Lagaw Ya) — and overlaid an Australian population {{in such a way that}} the majority of women spoke an Australian language, with a significant number, mainly men, who spoke a South-East Papuan Austronesian language, accompanied by their Papuan wives and their perhaps bilingual children. Over time, the core structure of the local mothers' language dominated, with retention of the newcomers' Papuo-Austronesian content in the appropriate cultural subsystems. In essence this would have been a 'replay' of the original settlement by Austronesian traders at Parema, with the women understanding the language of the men, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> needing to speak it while retaining parts of their language for significant areas. The children then created a new language shift to an Australian language with a Papuan-Austronesian admixture.|$|E

500|$|Cartwright adapted My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy into a one-woman play in 2004. Cartwright has {{performed}} it {{at a variety}} of venues, including the August 2004 Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Scotland. The play received modest reviews, including criticism for a lack of inside stories about The Simpsons, and its [...] "overweeningly upbeat" [...] tone. David Chatterton of The British Theatre Guide described the show as [...] "interesting and entertaining, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> a 'must see' even for Simpsons fans".|$|E
500|$|Anders Jakobson, their drummer, {{reported}} that [...] "It was {{all these different}} types of people who enjoyed what we were doing.

[...] Other Swedish groups, such as General Surgery and Regurgitate, practiced goregrind. Inhume, from the Netherlands, Rotten Sound, from Finland, and Leng Tch'e, from Belgium, were subsequent European groups who practiced grindcore with death metal inflections. In 2000s, the Belgium-based Aborted [...] "had grown into the role of key contributors to the death-grind genres".|$|E
500|$|... "Drive" [...] {{was written}} by Mike Will Made It, Cyrus, Pierre Ramon Slaughter, and Samuel Jean; it was {{produced}} by Mike Will Made It, with co-production by P-Nasty, and engineered by Chris [...] "Tek" [...] O'Ryan. Stephen Hybicki recorded the song, which was later mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Ryan Kaul. Cyrus commented that the song was written on Valentine's Day in 2013, which was [...] "emotionally [...] such a hard time"; she elaborated that the track was [...] "about needing to leave someone <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> wanting to completely cut yourself off from the relationship. It’s {{a time when you}} want to leave but you can’t. It’s also about moving on." [...] It has been widely speculated to have been inspired by Cyrus' former fiancé Liam Hemsworth.|$|E

Votta called the number [...] "pretty" [...] but said {{the placement of the}} boys in the balconies was [...] "cute <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> compelling as a staged performance".

500|$|The {{play has}} {{received}} modest reviews. Julian Hall of The Independent criticized {{it for a}} lack of inside stories about The Simpsons, writing that [...] "Cartwright never allows you to become bored but that means some issues are skirted over faster than American closing credits on television. You never really get a feel what it is like recording the show." [...] Brian Logan of The Guardian described Cartwright as [...] "a lively host [...] eager to please", but found the play to be [...] "an overweeningly upbeat collection of Simpsons chitchat." [...] David Chatterton of British Theatre Guide described it as [...] "interesting and entertaining, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> a 'must see' even for Simpsons fans." [...] Clive Davis of The Times wrote that [...] "In contrast to The Simpsons itself, where not a line, not a syllable, goes to waste, Cartwright has a habit of losing herself in anecdotes that stumble into dead-ends. [...] The half-hearted trivia quiz involving volunteers from the audience soon dies a death too. The performance really cries out for a hard-headed director. The video clips of Cartwright at large are fun, however." ...|$|E

500|$|The seventh track [...] "Love Money Party" [...] {{features}} Big Sean, and {{incorporates a}} [...] "grimy, haunted-house beat". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that Cyrus appeared {{more comfortable with}} rapping in the recording, compared to an earlier performance on the Mike Will Made It single [...] "23". [...] "#GetItRight" [...] is a [...] "stylish breeze" [...] that sees the inclusion of [...] "whistling [...] and a chopped guitar lick". It was described as being reminiscent of [...] "Twisted" [...] by Usher and [...] "Kickin' In" [...] by Adam Lambert, all three of which were produced by Pharrell Williams. Cyrus stated that [...] "Drive" [...] was inspired by [...] "needing to leave someone <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> wanting to completely cut yourself off from the relationship." [...] Her comments were assumed to reference her engagement to Hemsworth by the media. The tenth track [...] "FU" [...] features French Montana, and according to Catucci, blends [...] "starry Adele-style sass and a French Montana verse into expertly inlaid dubstep wub-wubs". He went on to describe [...] "Do My Thang" [...] as a [...] "ripping dance track", while Lipshutz recognized influences from [...] "gooey synthesizers and snapping percussion". [...] "Maybe You're Right" [...] incorporates drum instrumentation with [...] "hints of gospel influence", and was also questioned to be addressing Hemsworth.

2500|$|Caillebotte's style {{belongs to}} the School of Realism, but was {{strongly}} influenced by his Impressionist associates. In common with his precursors Jean-François Millet and Gustave Courbet, as well his contemporary Degas, Caillebotte aimed to paint reality as it existed and as he saw it, hoping to reduce the inherent theatricality of painting. Perhaps because of his close relationship with {{so many of his}} peers, his style and technique vary considerably among his works, as if [...] "borrowing" [...] and experimenting, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> sticking to any one style. At times, he seems very much in the Degas camp of rich-colored realism (especially his interior scenes); at other times, he shares the Impressionist commitment to [...] "optical truth" [...] and employs an impressionistic pastel-softness and loose brush strokes most similar to Renoir and Pissarro, although with a less vibrant palette.|$|E
2500|$|The DDP communicated {{and worked}} {{together}} on StankDawg's personal site, which was open to anyone who wanted to join in on the fun.

2500|$|In modern Hebrew idiom, the sarcastic expression, [...] "a {{completely}} blue tallit" [...] (טלית שכולה תכלת) {{is widely}} {{used to refer to}} something that is ostensibly, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>really,</b> absolutely pure, immaculate and virtuous. (An English parallel might be calling someone [...] "Mr. Perfect.") The expression stems from rabbinic lore about the biblical figure Korah who led a revolt against the leadership of Moses and Aaron. Koraḥ was said to have asked Moses a number of vexatious, mocking questions, one of which was, [...] "Does a tallit made entirely of blue yarn require tzitzit?" [...] To Moses' affirmative answer, Koraḥ objected that an ordinary (undyed) tallit is rendered 'kosher' (meaning, in this context, ritually fit to be worn) by attaching to its corners the tzitzit tassels, whose key feature was the single thread of blue (פתיל תכלת) contained in each tassel. If so, what addition of holiness could the tzitzit contribute to a tallit which was made entirely of the same sky-blue yarn? ...|$|E

2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot.

[...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E
2500|$|Mad Max: Fury Road {{became a}} {{moderate}} {{box office success}} theatrically.

[...] The Hollywood Reporter calculated that the loss incurred by the film was around $20–40 million. According to Forbes, {{one of the reasons}} the film emerged less successful than hoped was its cancelled release in China; success there could have aided the film in at least passing $400 million. It grossed $153.6 million in North America and $224.8 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $378.4 million. It had a worldwide opening weekend total of $109 million, and went on to become the second highest-grossing Warner Bros. film of 2015 (behind San Andreas), and the nineteenth highest-grossing film of 2015 worldwide overall.|$|E
