5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vinča culture, evolved within the <b>Belgrade</b> area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region, and after 279 BC Celts conquered the city, naming it Singidūn. It was conquered by the Romans during the reign of Augustus, and awarded city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, Frankish Empire, Bulgarian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary before it became the capital of Serbian king Stephen Dragutin (1282–1316). In 1521, <b>Belgrade</b> was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars. <b>Belgrade</b> was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern <b>Belgrade</b> remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when the city was reunited.
