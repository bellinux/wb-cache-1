40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to in vitro evaluate the cuticular surface damage of Ascaridia galli adult worms treated with ethanolic extract of <b>betel</b> <b>nuts</b> Veitchia merrillii. Materials and Methods: Phytochemical screening was done using FeCl 3, Wagner and Dragendorff reagents, NaOH, MgHCl, and Liebermann-Burchard reaction test. Amount of 16 worms were segregated into four groups with three replicates. Four worms of each group submerged into phosphate buffered saline, 25 mg/ml, and 75 mg/ml crude ethanolic extract of V. merrillii, and 15 mg/ml albendazole. The effect of these extract was observed 40 h after incubation as soon as worms death. The worms were sectioned transversally and were explored for any cuticular histopathological changes in their body surface under microscope. Results: We found that the ethanolic extract of V. merrillii <b>betel</b> <b>nuts</b> contains tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, triterpenoids, and saponins. The ethanolic extract of <b>betel</b> <b>nuts</b> V. merrillii induces surface alterations caused cuticular damage of A. galli adult worms.

25|$|The {{two main}} sub-types {{of the disease}} are esophageal squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} (often abbreviated to ESCC), which {{is more common in}} the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world.

Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing <b>betel</b> <b>nut.</b> The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux.|$|E

25|$|Lagun Ein {{was not yet}} off the hook. The king {{assigned}} him to lead {{another attempt}} on Minkhaung. Lagun Ein led a team of 12 commandos to infiltrate the Ava camp. The team made it inside the camp from the lightly guarded north side. He and five men managed to get inside the Ava king's quarters.

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the dissemination of information about the health risks of tobacco, alcohol, and <b>betel</b> <b>nuts</b> and their consumption in Taiwan. To estimate cross-elasticities, the paper uses the Central Bureau of Statistics demand system model. Empirical results indicate that an increase in the dissemination of information on the health risks of tobacco, alcohol, and <b>betel</b> <b>nuts</b> substantially reduces real consumption. Empirical evidence from the cross-elasticity of price also confirms that a complementary relationship exists in Taiwan among these three addictive products.

25|$|Some historians even {{proposed}} {{that they also}} had regular contacts {{with the people of}} Western Micronesia {{because it was the only}} area in the Oceania that had rice crops, tuba (fermented coconut sap), and tradition of <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> chewing when the first Europeans arrived there.

Magellan's chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, mentioned that merchants and ambassadors from all surrounding areas came to pay tribute to the rajah of Sugbu (Cebu) for the purpose of trade. While Magellan's crew were with the rajah, a representative from Siam was paying tribute to the rajah. Miguel López de Legazpi also wrote how merchants from Luzon and Mindoro had come to Cebu for trade, and he also mentioned how the Chinese merchants regularly came to Luzon for the same purpose. The Visayan Islands had earlier encounters with Greek traders in 21 AD. Its people enjoyed extensive trade contacts with other cultures.

25|$|The corpse is {{washed and}} placed on tiger or deer skin or a bed of kusha grass. The hair and feet of the corpse may be tied. The corpse is {{believed}} to be a vessel of power while the rite is performed and tying the hair ensures that the energy does not escape. Another interpretation states that the bondage reflects the practitioner's desire to control the spirit of the corpse. Then, the sadhaka will sit on the corpse for meditation. In Shakta narratives, <b>betel</b> <b>nut</b> is put into the corpse's mouth and it is turned on its back and smeared with sandalwood paste. Shakta sandhakas draw a yantra {{on the back of the}} corpse and sit on it. The 64 yoginis and the guardians of the directions are worshipped with vegetarian offerings. The corpse-seat is again worshipped and the practitioner mounts the corpse like one sits on a horse. Another tradition says that the practitioner is expected to sit in Virasana ("the heroic pose"). The Tantrasara narrates that the practitioner should get off the corpse to draw a triangle or protective circle around him and the corpse or again to scatter mustard or sesame seeds in all directions.|$|E
25|$|Assamese cuisine is {{a mixture}} of {{different}} indigenous styles, with considerable regional variation and some external influences. Although it is known for its limited use of spices, Assamese cuisine has strong flavours from its use of endemic herbs, fruits, and vegetables served fresh, dried, or fermented. Rice is the staple food item and a huge variety of endemic rice varieties, including several varieties of sticky rice {{are a part of the}} cuisine in Assam. Fish, generally freshwater varieties, are widely eaten. Other nonvegetarian items include chicken, duck, squab, snails, silkworms, insects, goat, pork, venison, turtle, monitor lizard, etc. The region's cuisine involves simple cooking processes, mostly barbecuing, steaming, or boiling. Bhuna, the gentle frying of spices before the addition of the main ingredients, generally common in Indian cooking, is absent in the cuisine of Assam. A traditional meal in Assam begins with a khar, a class of dishes named after the main ingredient and ends with a tenga, a sour dish. Homebrewed rice beer or rice wine is served before a meal. The food is usually served in bell metal utensils. Paan, the practice of chewing <b>betel</b> <b>nut,</b> generally concludes a meal.|$|E
