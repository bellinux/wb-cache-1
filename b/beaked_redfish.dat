50|$|The {{deepwater}} redfish (Sebastes mentella), {{also known as}} the <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish,</b> ocean perch, Atlantic redfish, Norway haddock, red perch, golden redfish, or hemdurgan, may reach a size of 55 - 70 cm, but is usually less than 45 cm. It lives in comparatively high concentrations in the North Atlantic, for example in the Irminger Sea where considerable numbers are fished. It occupies depths between 300 and 1000 m and is often pelagic, i.e. far off the bottom. The deep-sea redfish feeds on a variety of food organisms, for example small fishes. In contrast to most fishes that spawn unfertilised eggs, the {{deepwater redfish}} has internal fertilisation and spawns free-living larvae.|$|E

Based on the ecogeographical analysis of the parasite fauna, the occurrence of ectolesions and sexual maturity of Sebastes mentella from ten areas of the Norwegian Sea and adjacent waters, the conclusion on the recruitment of the fish concentrations by maturing individuals from the east and north in the bathyal waters (the Kopytov area) has been confirmed. The relationship of the <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> concentrations in the pelagic zone and bathyal waters of the northern Norwegian Sea under the predominance of fish migration to the pelagic zone has been revealed. The composition of the parasite fauna shows greatly weakened relationship of the pelagic <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> with near-bottom biocenoses. This indicates the fish occurrence in the Norwegian Sea pelagic waters during the most of the annual life cycle. The mass return of the fish from the pelagic waters to the bathyal zone in the Norwegian Sea as opposed to the North Atlantic population assumed by some explorers has been substantiated. It has been concluded that S. mentella aggregations in the Norwegian Sea pelagic waters represent a pelagic ecological group formed by early maturing fish. The near-bottom ecological group in the bathyal waters is composed by late maturing <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish.</b> Peculiarities of the parasite fauna and patterns of two phenes indicate the independent Norwegian-Barents Sea S. mentella population.

40|$|In this work, I {{investigated}} genetic {{complexity in}} four commercially exploited species from the North Atlantic: saithe (Pollachius virens L.), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and beaked and golden redfish (Sebastes mentella and S. norvegicus). The results were used 1) {{to assess the}} consistency between current management units and units identified by results based on genetic data for each species, and 2) to assess the efficiency of SNP data compared to conventional markers in studying population genomics. Panels of nuclear genomic markers, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites, derived from modern genomic approaches, and data on species life history traits, were analyzed to explore genetic complexity within these highly migratory and continuously distributed species. The investigation reveals biologically distinct populations within each of these species. Four genetic clusters of saithe and two clusters of Greenland halibut {{were found in the}} North Atlantic. For <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish,</b> results using both the genome-wide SNP and microsatellite data supported one group (‘shallow’) throughout the North Atlantic and a second group (‘deep’) in the central North Atlantic and Canadian waters. A localized group (‘slope’) of <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> was identified in Greenland and Icelandic waters. Microsatellite DNA supported three unrecognized cryptic species of golden redfish in Greenland and nearby waters. Genetic isolation in golden and <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> was greater than in saithe and Greenland halibut, which is possibly associated with unique life history features of redfishes. The results indicate a correlation between genetic differentiation and life history differences in the studied species. These findings imply that distinct genetic heterogeneity can exist in different marine species and may be influenced by different biotic and abiotic factors. The results highlight that in most cases the current management units of these species are comprised of multiple biological populations. The new definition of gene pools may serve to define biologically meaningful management units to ensure their sustainable exploitation and preserve evolutionary legacies. This study provides the first SNP-based population genomic investigation in saithe, Greenland halibut and <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish.</b> Comparative analyses of SNP and conventional marker systems demonstrate a higher resolution for SNP markers. Results from genome-wide SNP data identified the three genetic groups of <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> from a much smaller sample set, and the estimated genetic differentiation was much greater than that found by other marker. Both in <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> and Greenland halibut a sub-set of outlier SNPs were identified, implying possible signals of selection in these loci or nearby genomic sites. These outliers may provide increased power in population assignment of the species.

In June 2003 a new Spanish research vessel, the RV Vizconde de Eza (VE) replaced the RV Cornide de Saavedra (CS) that had carried out so far the EU survey series. In order to preserve the full use of the 1988 - 2002 survey indices available for <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish,</b> the original time series were converted to the new RV units. An Extended Survivor Analysis (Shepherd, 1999) was performed using the previous XSA framework and the revised EU survey abundance’s at age as the tuning input file. Very high fishing mortalities until 1996 forced a rapid and steep decline of abundance, biomass and female spawning biomass of the 3 M <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> stock. With low fishing mortalities since then the stock decline was halted and the survival and growth of the existing cohorts allowed a discrete but continuous growth of 4 + biomass and female SSB from 1998 onwards. Meanwhile the income of a sequence of weak year classes (1991 - 1997) kept the 4 + abundance stable at a low level till 2001. However on the most recent years (2003 - 2006) a sequence of above average year classes from 1998 to 2002, each one greater than the previous, recruit each year to the 4 + stock, pumping abundance and biomass at the beginning of 2006 to a maximum and a second high of the 1989 - 2006 interval, respectively.

40|$|Vertical {{divergence}} {{in marine}} organisms is being increasingly documented, yet {{much remains to}} be done to understand the role of depth in the context of phylogeographic reconstruction and the identification of management units. An ideal study system to address this issue is the <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish,</b> Sebastes mentella – one of four species of “redfish” occurring in the North Atlantic – which is known for a widely-distributed “shallow-pelagic” oceanic type inhabiting waters between 250 and 550 m, and a more localised “deep-pelagic” population dwelling between 550 and 800 m, in the oceanic habitat of the Irminger Sea. Here, we investigate the extent of population structure in relation to both, depth and geographic spread of oceanic <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> throughout most of its distribution range. By sequencing the mitochondrial control region of 261 redfish collected over a decadal interval, and combining 160 rhodopsin coding nuclear sequences and previously genotyped microsatellite data, we map the existence of two strongly divergent evolutionary lineages with significantly different distribution patterns and historical demography, and whose genetic variance is mostly explained by depth. Combined genetic data, analysed via independent approaches, are consistent with a late Pleistocene lineage split, where segregation by depth likely resulted from the interplay of climatic and oceanographic processes with life-history and behavioural traits. The on-going process of diversification in North Atlantic S. mentella may serve as an “hourglass” to understand speciation and adaptive radiation in Sebastes and in other marine taxa distributed across a depth gradient...|$|E
40|$|The use of parasites as {{biological}} tags for discrimination of {{fish stocks}} {{has become a}} commonly used approach in fisheries management. Metazoan parasite community analysis and anisakid nematode population genetics based on a mitochondrial cytochrome marker were applied {{in order to assess}} the usefulness of the two parasitological methods for stock discrimination of <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> Sebastes mentella of three fishing grounds in the North East Atlantic. Multivariate, model-based approaches demonstrated that the metazoan parasite fauna of <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> from East Greenland differed from Tampen, northern North Sea, and Bear Island, Barents Sea. A joint model (latent variable model) was used to estimate the effects of covariates on parasite species and identified four parasite species as main source of differences among fishing grounds; namely Chondracanthus nodosus, Anisakis simplex s. s., Hysterothylacium aduncum, and Bothriocephalus scorpii. Due to its high abundance and differences between fishing grounds, Anisakis simplex s. s. was considered as a major biological tag for host stock differentiation. Whilst the sole examination of Anisakis simplex s. s. on a population genetic level is only of limited use, anisakid nematodes (in particular, A. simplex s. s.) can serve as biological tags on a parasite community level. This study confirmed the use of multivariate analyses as a tool to evaluate parasite infra-communities and to identify parasite species that might serve as biological tags. The present study suggests that S. mentella in the northern North Sea and Barents Sea is not sub-structured...|$|E
40|$|Data were {{obtained}} from 682 demersal trawls made between 126 and 738 m depths on Flemish Cap in summer during the European Union research surveys in the years 1989 – 94. Despite {{the fact that the}} depth range for all species was not completely covered, analysis of different deep distributions of the 25 most representative species showed that the fauna are zoned with depth. Three faunal assemblages with characteristic catch rates, diversity and dominant species were found on the shelf (126 – 300 m), upper continental slope (300 – 600 m) and middle continental slope (> 600 m). Catch rates were greatest on the shelf and upper continental slope, while diversity was greatest on the middle continental slope. Domi-nance of the commercial species Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides) on the shelf, <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella) and Labrador redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) on upper continental slope, and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) on the middle continental slope. This showed an important aspect of the community structure. Diversity patterns may be under-stood in terms of the relationships with predation, competition, environmental heterogeneity and trophic level. Also the influence of the fisheries in the area can modify this structure. On the size-depth correlations, only longnose eel (Synaphobranchus kaupy), longfin hake (Urophycis chestery), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella), golden redfish (Sebastes marinus) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) showed a significant 'bigger-deeper ' relationship (i. e. larger fish in deeper strata), while spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor) and witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus) showed a negative 'smaller-deeper ' relationship...|$|E
40|$|The 3 M redfish {{assessment}} {{is focused on}} the <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish,</b> regarded as a management unit composed of two populations from two very similar species: the Flemish Cap S. mentella and S. fasciatus. The reason for this approach is the historical dominance of this group in the 3 M redfish commercial catch until 2005. However a new golden redfish fishery (S. marinus) started on September 2005 on shallower depths of the Flemish Cap bank above 300 m, and the Flemish Cap cod fishery reopened in 2010. These new realities implied a revision of catch estimates, in order to split recent redfish commercial catch and by-catch from the major fleets on Div. 3 M into golden (S. marinus) and beaked (S. mentella and S. fasciatus) redfish catches. An Extended Survivor Analysis (Shepherd, 1999) was used with the same framework of previous assessments and with the tuning of the 1989 - 2012 EU survey. Survey results suggest that the <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> stock {{has not been able to}} hold its growth and sustain an above average level, suffering instead a severe decline on the second half of the 2000 ’s. The most likely hypothesis to justify this unexpected downward trend on stock size is an increase in natural mortality by cod predation. From the sensitive analysis, natural mortality at 0. 4 was applied on ages 4 - 6 through 2006 - 2010, and extended to ages 7 plus on 2009 and 2010. It has been kept constant through all ages on 2011 and 2012, but with an overall decline to 0. 125. This is the highest possible level of natural mortality giving assessment results in line with the recent survey trends and at the same time with key diagnostics very close to the best ones, obtained with the return on 2011 - 2012 to the “standard” redfish natural mortality of 0. 1. A 2013 - 2009 retrospective XSA was also carried out, being this assessment very much in line with their immediate predecessors (2012 - 2011). Above average year classes coupled with low fishing mortalities allowed a rapid growth of biomass and abundance since 2003 that pushed the stock to a 2008 - 2009 high. Between 2009 and 2011 biomass and abundance of exploitable and 7 plus female stock went down for causes other than fishing. These declines were halted at well above average levels on the terminal year and, at least for biomass, there was some improvement on 2012. The recruitment at age 4 increased from 2002 till 2006 and was kept at a high level until 2009, with 2005 year class as the most abundant year class of the assessment interval. Recruitment to exploitable stock declined since then and is approaching the level of the weak year classes from the 1990 ’s. Short and medium term stochastic projections were obtained for female spawning stock biomass (SSB) under Fstatusquo, together with SSB and yield medium term probability profiles. As it was documented on the 2011 assessment F 0. 1 is an unacceptable management option at the current <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> stock status. Keeping on 2014 and 2015 fishing mortality at its present low level will sustain on the short term a high level of female spawning biomass. But on the long term it will be natural mortality to determine the future of <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> as a fishery resource...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{provides}} the first quantitative {{estimate of the}} historical fluctuations in the year-class strength of <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> in the Barents Sea.

It is defined as the effective number of 0 -group fish that will eventually enter the fishery. Uncertainties in the year-class strength indices are estimated using a statistical modelling approach, which accounts for observation errors. The reconstructed series indicate clear periods of high recruitment (late 1980 s–early 1990 s) and 8 years of near complete recruitment failure (1996 – 2003). The apparent recovery in recent years is highly uncertain and needs to be confirmed by future observations.

40|$|At present, {{the severe}} {{decline of the}} fishery off Greenland is being {{discussed}} controversially. In contrast to overfishing, climate changes and emigration are itemized causal. Available German data on commercial catches and research cruises are presented for clarification. A few years after the beginning of heavy exploitation during the early sixties, the stocks of cod, golden and <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> reflected a significant rejuvenescence based on catch analysis. Regular scientific surveys• for stock assessment purposes commenced in 1982 when the productivity of the stocks was already adversely affected due to low spawning stocks and extremely irregular recruitment. From this point of view, {{the results of the}} latest survey in 1995 showing stagnant fish biomass at record low level since 1991 are not surprising.

40|$|Despite the {{striking}} physical and environmental gradients associated with depth {{variation in the}} oceans, relatively {{little is known about}} their impact on population diversification, adaptation and speciation. Changes in light associated with increasing depth are likely to alter the visual environment of organisms, and adaptive changes in visual systems may be expected. The pelagic <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish,</b> Sebastes mentella, exhibits depth-associated patterns of substructure in the central North Atlantic, with a widely distributed shallow-pelagic population inhabiting waters between 250 and 550 m depth and a deep-pelagic population dwelling between 550 and 800 m. Here we performed a molecular genetic investigation of samples from fish collected from ‘shallow’ and ‘deep’ populations, using the mitochondrial control region and the gene coding for the visual-pigment rhodopsin. We identify patterns suggestive of potential adaptation to different depths, by detecting a specific amino acid replacement at the rhodopsin gene. Mitochondrial DNA results reflect a scenario of long-term demographic independence between the two S. mentella groups, and raise the possibility that these ‘stocks’ may in fact be two incipient species...|$|E
40|$|In the early- 1960 s a {{deepwater}} form of redfish (Sebastes mentella Travin) {{was found}} at depths more than 500 m on the continental slopes of Labrador and North Newfoundland.

The results of comparisons carried out supported the hypothesis of a lack of close relation between adult redfish in the two areas. The results also allows to assume the existence of 2 populations Sebastes mentella in the Irminger Sea, one in the area of Iceland and East Greenland shelf slopes (coastal stock) and another in pelagic zone over significantly deeper areas (ocean stock). Concerning the early stages, the redfish larvae, drifting towards Western Greenland, seems to originate from a spawning area located at the shelf edge southwest off Iceland, while the larvae hatched in the central sea area were found to be developing within the closed eddy generated by surface currents. No data revealed a possible mass entrance of larvae into the flow of Irminger Current.

Standard length was used as a covariate to adjust the morphometric data because S. marinus were on the average largerthan beaked redfishes. Discriminant analyses of (a) 17 morphomet-ric characters resulted in an 11 -variable discriminant function where 65 % of the variability was explained by the groups, (b) the two traditional discriminatiors (length of symphyseal tubercle and width of orbit) resulted in a function where 56 % of the variability was explained by the groups, and (c) the remaining 15 morphometric characters resulted in a 9 -variable function where 58 % of the variability was explained by the groups. The results demonstrated good (87 - 90 %) separation of golden redfish (S. marinus) and beaked redfishes (S. mentella and S. fasciatus).

40|$|Deepwater {{fish are}} {{characterized}} by long lifespans, late maturity and low productivity. This implies slow recovery from low biomass levels and it is, therefore, important to manage these stocks correctly to avoid overfishing. However, these stocks are generally data poor, which it makes difficult to apply quantitative assessment models {{on which to base}} their management. The management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach consists in evaluating the performance of management strategies by simulation before their implementation. In the evaluation, the main sources of uncertainty in a fishery system and its management process should be taken into account in order to find robust management strategies. Thus, the MSE approach is relevant to the management of data-poor stocks. We used the FLBEIA software, an FLR library coded in the R statistical language, to conduct a bio-economic impact assessment of fisheries management strategies. We evaluated the performance of several management strategies in three different deepwater case studies using the MSE approach: <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella) in the Norwegian Sea, blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) in the Strait of Gibraltar, and French mixed deepwater fisheries in the North East Atlantic. In conclusion, we found that the S. mentella stock is very sensitive to the stock recruitment relationship chosen. For P. bogaraveo, simulations showed that the present constant catch management is as good as more sophisticated strategies. Finally, in mixed fisheries, case study fleet dynamics were key for the success of management strategie...|$|E

Fishing gears were bottom trawls with the mesh size of not less than 130 mm. According to the preliminary dat a, in 2005, on the Flemish Cap, the catch of redfish species by Russian vessels was equal to 1 016 tons. Golden redfish (S. marinus) prevailed (more than 50 %) in catch. The results of bathymetric distribution researches showed that, at 200 - 299 m depths, S. marinus made {{up the bulk of}} catches.

These new realities implied a revision of catch estimates, in order to split recent redfish commercial catch and by-catch from the major fleets on Div. 3 M into golden (S. marinus) and beaked (S. mentella and S. faThe Extended Survivor Analysis assessment used as tuning file the 1989 - 2016 EU survey abundance at age matrix included in a revised input framework. Continuing pressure over Flemish Cap redfish stocks by cod predation, at levels higher, or much higher, than the levels prior to 2006 lead to higher natural mortalities since then. In order to include an independent approach to natural mortality in the sensitivity M framework, for the more recent years (2011 - 2016) natural mortality has been estimated from a number of different biological models, some size/age-independent and others size/age-dependent. These different estimates were arranged in two sets and tuned to survey at age data. A natural mortality of 0. 1 on 2015 - 2016 and the natural mortalities adjusted on previous assessments were found to be the most suitable option to M input. A 2017 - 2013 retrospective XSA was performed, confirming the consistency of the present with preceding results as regards stock biomass, female spawning biomass and fishing mortality. sciatus) redfish catches. Above average year classes and high survival rates allowed a rapid growth of biomass and abundance 2003 onwards, pulling the stock to a 2008 - 2010 high. Since 2009 abundance went down for causes other than fishing, being still above the 1990 ’s low in 2016. By the turn of the decade stock biomass and female spawning biomass (SSB) shown marginal declines as well, but reversed on 2011 - 2012. Individual growth of survivors and low fishing mortalities sustained stock biomass and SSB at high levels till 2015 - 2016. Recruitment at age 4 increased from 2002 till 2006 and was maintained at a maximum level till 2009. Recruitment declined since then and is kept on 2015 - 2016 at the low of the weak year classes from the 1990 ’s, while SSB is still well above the size that originated the high 2002 - 2006 recruitments. Despite the significant decline so far natural mortality has not flattened yet. If natural mortality and fishing mortality stay at their most recent levels, the actual high of female spawning biomass can hold on 2018 - 2019. But on the long term it will be natural mortality, namely over pre recruited ages, to determine the future of <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> as a fishery resource. On 2015 STACFIS remind that projections are based in the assumption that natural mortality stay at its most recent level on the present year and at least on the two next coming years. And that, taking into account the uncertainty on the present and future level of natural mortality, its impact on female spawning stock biomass at the end of any projection is unknown. On 2017 these constraints are still in place, and therefore short and medium term projections are not presented. Versión del edito...|$|E
40|$|There are {{two species}} of redfish, the deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) and the Acadian redfish (Sebastes fasciatus) that have been commercially fished and {{reported}} collectively in fishery statistics in Div. 3 LN. After peaking at an historical high of 79 000 tons in 1987 catches declined to a minimum about 500 tons in 1996, being kept at a low level since then. Catch on {{the last years of}} open fishery (1990 - 1997) and by-catch on the moratorium years (1998 - 2004) are analyzed against recent trends of survey indices. The 1991 - 2004 Canadian spring and autumn surveys are the main source of information used in this work to assess the relative abundance and dynamics of the <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> population on Div. 3 LN. The surveys demonstrate considerable inter-annual variability, the changes frequently being the result of single large catches being taken in different years. Sex ratio and maturity ogives at length were applied to survey abundance at length, for each division and survey series, in order to estimate survey female spawning stock biomass. Instead of looking to the survey indices on a year-to-year basis, trends of the respective mean values were analysed on a broader time scale. The assemblage of Div. 3 L and 3 N survey indices suggests that stock has been increasing from the early 1990 s to the mid- 2000 s in terms of abundance, biomass, and female spawning biomass. However the magnitude of this increase remains difficult to quantify. Estimates of exploitation rate suggest that fishing mortality should be at a very low level when compared to {{the first half of the}} 1990 s...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{striking}} physical and environmental gradients associated with depth {{variation in the}} oceans, relatively {{little is known about}} their impact on population diversification, adaptation and speciation. The pelagic <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish,</b> Sebastes mentella, exhibits depthassociated patterns of population genetic substructure in the central North Atlantic, with a widely distributed population inhabiting waters between 200 and 550 m depth and localised putative populations dwelling at greater depths, between 550 and 900 m. This PhD project implements a multidisciplinary approach to explore and understand aspects of this biological complexity, in the context of depth. To investigate depth as a factor driving population divergence and adaptation, sampling was carried out to target S. mentella at different depth layers and across most of its distribution range. Through the use of mitochondrial and nuclear markers on samples spanning a period between 2006 and 2013, the existence of two strongly divergent evolutionary lineages is revealed, with significantly different geographic distribution patterns and dwelling at different depths. The first empirical evidence to explicitly test genotype and phenotype of Sebastes vision associated with shifts in habitat depth is presented, by conducting spectral analysis of rod visual pigments. Additionally, de novo RNA-seq analysis of redfish retina transcriptome is presented for a subset of “shallow” and “deep” individuals, in order to characterise differential expression of candidate genes involved in visual perception in organisms adapted to different depths. Furthermore, a market accuracy survey of redfish sampled across Europe from various retailers was crossreferenced against data currently held in public databases. Results revealed the existence of inaccurate reference sequences in data bases, likely stemming from species misidentification from previous studies, which currently hinders the efficacy of DNA methods for the identification of Sebastes products. Overall, we cast new light on the role of depth in maintaining biodiversity in the oceans, and consider the practical implications of such findings...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{evidence of the}} influence of hydrography and large scale ocean circulation on the geographical distribution of <b>beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> (Sebastes mentella) in the Irminger Sea on the interannual time scale, from 1992 to 2011. The results reveal the average relationship of adult pelagic redfish to their physical habitat from 100 to 800 m depth: the most preferred latitude, longitude, depth, temperature and salinity for redfish are approximately 58 °N, 41 °W, 557 m, 4. 5 °C and 34. 87, respectively. The redfish habitat corresponds in a temperature–salinity (TS) diagram to a mixing triangle between East Greenland Current Water (EGCW), Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and Irminger Current Water (ICW). The geographical centre of mass of the redfish distribution (as revealed by acoustic fish density) indicates displacements from year to year. Changes in hydrographic conditions were investigated in detail for possible reasons for these displacements. Empirical Orthogonal Analysis reveals that maximum variations of water mass volume on an interannual time-scale in the study region correspond to ICW and LSW changes, while EGCW remains comparatively stable. Indices of redfish geographical centroid, LSW volume, ICW temperature and Subpolar Gyre (SPG) intensity suggest that the geographical redfish displacements are closely related to interannual changes of ICW modulated by the SPG intensity with a lag of 1 or 2 years. In comparison, LSW seems to have no impact on the redfish distribution at the studied depth range. The time lag between ICW and redfish displacements indicates an indirect influence of temperature on redfish. Hence, changes of chlorophyll-a (from satellite imagery), as a proxy for primary production, were used in a first approach to study the role of food availability. The analysis is based on acoustic and trawl data from nine expeditions coordinated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), around 71, 000 hydrographic stations from the Integrated Climate Data Center, World Ocean Database 2009 and Coriolis (among others), 60 years of circulation data from the Max-Planck Institute Ocean Model and 14 years of satellite chlorophyll-a from SeaWiFS, MODIS-Aqua and MERIS...|$|E
40|$|The remote Franz Josef Land (FJL) Archipelago is {{the most}} northerly land in Eurasia and its fish fauna, {{particularly}} in nearshore habitats, has been poorly studied. An interdisciplinary expedition to FJL in summer 2013 used scuba, seines, and plankton nets to comprehensively study the nearshore fish fauna of the archipelago. We present {{some of the first}} underwater images for many of these species in their natural habitats. In addition, deep water drop cameras were deployed between 32 and 392 m to document the fish fauna and their associated habitats at deeper depths. Due to its high latitude (79 °– 82 °N), extensive ice cover, and low water temperatures (< 0 °C much of the year), the fish diversity at FJL is low compared to other areas of the Barents Sea. Sixteen species of fishes from seven families were documented on the expedition, including two species previously unknown to the region. One Greenland shark, Somniosus microcephalus (Somniosidae), ca. 2 m in length, was recorded by drop camera near Hayes Island at 211 m, and Esipov’s pout, Gymnelus esipovi (Zoarcidae), was collected at Wilton Island at 15 m in a kelp forest. Including the tape-body pout, Gymnelus taeniatus, described earlier from the sub-littoral zone of Kuhn Island, 17 fish species are now known from FJL’s nearshore waters. Species endemic to the Arctic accounted for 75 % of the nearshore species observed, followed by species with wider ranges. A total of 43 species from 15 families are known from FJL with the majority of the records from offshore trawl surveys between 110 and 620 m. Resident species have mainly high Arctic distributions, while transient species visit the archipelago to feed (e. g., Greenland shark), and others are brought by currents as larvae and later migrate to spawn grounds in the south (e. g., Atlantic cod Gadus morhua, Capelin Mallotus villosus, <b>Beaked</b> <b>redfish</b> Sebastes mentella). Another species group includes warmer-water fishes that are rare waifs (e. g., Glacier lanternfish Benthosema glaciale, White barracudina Arctozenus rissoi). The rapid warming of the Arctic will likely result in significant changes to the entire ecosystem and this study therefore serves as an important baseline for the nearshore fish assemblages in this unique and fragile region...|$|E
