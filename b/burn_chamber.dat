40|$|Conceptual {{design studies}} of fusion reactor {{configurations}} reveal many interesting and sometimes extremely difficult heat transfer problems. Some components of fusion thermonuclear reactors, such as divertors, plasma limiters, or first-wall armor, {{are believed to}} be subjected to operating conditions characterized by extremely high thermal loads. In a Deuterium-Tritium fusion reactor, nearly 20 % of the thermal power has to be transferred from the hot plasma through the wall components of the <b>burn</b> <b>chamber.</b> Design requirements of commercial fusion power plant in-vessel components are potentially even more stringent than those of experimental devices. For experimental devices with pulsed operation, heat loads on the plasma facing components in case of off-normal events such as a disruption may be the main issue. Fusion nuclear reactor studies are currently devoted mostly to the Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel cycle, since it is the easiest way to reach ignition or a high energy gain. The recent stress on safety by the world's community has however stimulated the research on other fuel cycles than the DT one, based on ‘advanced' reactions, such as Deuterium-Deuterium (DD) and Deuterium-Helium- 3 (DHe 3). The plasma confinement requirements for a DHe 3 reactor are much more challenging than those for a DT reactor. Thus, the demands on the divertor and the first wall are more severe, particularly during a disruption.

40|$|The American {{chestnut}} (Castanea dentata) {{has been}} functionally extirpated as a canopy species since the mid- 20 th century, {{due to the}} importation of multiple pathogens in the 19 th and early 20 th centuries. Modern breeding programs are seeking to produce disease-resistant genotypes, but the ecological and silvicultural knowledge necessary for successful restoration is lacking. In Chapter 2, we compare the growth response of hybrid chestnut seedlings to those of frequent competitors, northern red oak (Quercus rubra), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and red maple (A. rubrum), planted in the understory of mixed-oak forests. These plantings were designed to evaluate the effects of various sources of competition on seedling growth and survival. Height and diameter growth, as well as seedlings mortality was tracked for 4 years after planting. We found that chestnut had out-competed the other species in the most open environments. Chestnut responded positively to the removal of competition, regardless of the source, and displayed a notable ability to capture newly opened growing space. We concluded that American chestnut restoration would be most successful where early stand management is used to provide chestnut a period of reduced competition. We suggest that midstory removal immediately preceding underplanting would increase growth of chestnut seedlings without drastically increasing competition, and may help minimize mortality. An establishment strategy which minimizes competition could benefit chestnut seedlings planted at high quality sites; if combined with multi-stage shelterwood removals and some amount of competition control, midstory removal may be a beneficial tool during chestnut restoration in eastern oak-hickory forests. ^ American chestnut {{is closely related to}} northern red oak and the two were common overstory associates in the eastern hardwood forests of North America throughout the last several thousand years. In Chapter 3, we sought to elucidate those relationships by collecting a variety of crown architecture and leaf morphology measurements from 28 chestnut and 46 red oak saplings. This study was intended to evaluate the potential differences in the seedling establishment strategies of the two species, and how those strategies might be adaptive in relation to local disturbance regimes. We also investigated species 2 ̆ 7 nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) reserve strategies and compared whole-tree biomass partitioning patterns. Overall, chestnut invested less than oak in structural roots, but relatively more in branches and foliage. Chestnut also had higher NSC concentrations than oak indicating some adaptation to withstand aboveground disturbance (e. g., fire or animal browsing). Oak had smaller crown projection area and lower specific leaf area than chestnut, both maladaptive traits in shaded understories and small gaps. We concluded that chestnut 2 ̆ 7 s morphology may have historically helped it to function as an opportunistic and plastic species, and that well-established saplings may have benefitted from a variety of gap sizes to facilitate release. ^ In Chapter 4, we provide an initial evaluation of chestnut seedling 2 ̆ 7 s response to fire-induced topkill. We topkilled 94 American chestnut and 143 red oak seedlings across a range of ground-line diameters. Seedlings were topkilled using a <b>burn</b> <b>chamber</b> and growth and survival of resulting seedling sprouts were monitored for a full year. We observed that chestnut sprouts tended to emerge sooner after topkill than oak sprouts, and noted strong differences between species in point of attachment, with oak storing dormant buds further belowground than chestnut. Oak sprouts outpaced chestnut sprouts, and by one year post-treatment, had greater total volume and taller individual stems than chestnut. We also saw some evidence that oak sprouts expended more resources on re-filling NSC reserves compared to chestnut, highlighting their adaptation to repeated surface fires. We found that sprout growth of both species was more closely linked to initial seedling size than to canopy openness, though canopy openness did {{have a significant effect on}} both height and volume of sprouts. Our results indicate that chestnut seedlings can be expected to respond positively to a single surface fire, but are likely more vulnerable than red oak when exposed to more frequent prescribed burning or when they are below 3 cm ground line diameter. These fires will damage seedlings, and may lead to blight infection. However, due to the prevalence of chestnut blight within its historic range, we suggest that a single, low-intensity fire may still be beneficial as a release treatment in restoration plantings, while not unduly endangering planting stock. Fire will be most effectively applied once seedlings are greater than 3 cm ground line diameter, and have sufficient NSC reserves to fund resprouting. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{frequency}} of electrically initiated, 20 mm munition hangfires (delayed ignitions), a joint Army/NASA investigation was conducted to recommend quality evaluation improvements for acceptance of both primers and gun propellant. This effort focused only on evaluating ignition and combustion performance as potential causes of hangfires: poor electrical initiation of the primer, low output performance of the primer, low ignition sensitivity of the gun propellant, {{and the effects of}} cold temperature. The goal was to determine the "best" of the Army and NASA test methods to assess the functional performance of primers and gun propellants. The approach was to evaluate the performance of both high-quality and deliberately defective primers to challenge the sensitivity of test methods. In addition, the ignition sensitivity of different manufacturing batches of gun propellants was evaluated. The results of the investigation revealed that improvements can be made in functional evaluations that can assist in identifying and reducing ignition and performance variations. The "best" functional evaluation of primers and propellant is achieved through a combination of both Army and NASA test methods. Incorporating the recommendations offered in this report may provide for considerable savings in reducing the number of cartridge firings, while significantly lowering the rejection rate of primer, propellant and cartridge lots. The most probable causes for ignition and combustion-related hangfires were the lack of calcium silicide in the primer mix, a low output performance of primers, and finally, poor ignition sensitivity of gun propellant.

Results showed the combustion rate of Alane and Aluminum decreases with increasing volumetric flow rate of oxidizer. And the combustion rate of Alane is {{higher than that of}} Aluminum. Alane needs more ignition energy than Aluminum to burn, which was measured using a high voltage probe and multimeter.

EDAX analysis was completed to obtain the quantitative analysis of the element and find the O 2 content before the experiment, which is the indication of purity in the sample. EDAX analysis was also completed after the experiment to obtain the percentage of O 2, which indicates the efficiency of the combustion reactions because O 2 {{is one of the main}} products after combustion.

The product has been designed for developing areas in Nicaragua where power is inaccessible and a multi-purpose cookstove/phone charger could be of use. The cookstove features a cylindrical combustion chamber {{that can be used}} for gasification. Gasification is a burning process where smoke from the fire is also burned, creating higher temperatures and a cleaner <b>burn.</b> The combustion <b>chamber</b> is insulated using refractory cement, which will drop the temperature from about 700 Celsius inside the chamber to 200 Celsius outside the chamber. The cookstove outputs heat at a rate of 4. 6 - 6. 6 kW. The cookstove has thermoelectric modules attached to the outside, which, by utilizing the Seebeck effect, convert excess heat into electrical energy. Ideally, the energy would be transferred into the phone at 5 volts and 0. 5 - 0. 6 amps and some of the electrical energy would be used to power a cooling fan to help the stove function properly. The final temperatures that were recorded ranged from around 400 ºC to 700 ºC in the combustion chamber and around 500 ºC for the cooking surface. Gasification was successfully occurring during this stage, and the smoke was being visibly burned off. The electrical output was less successful, resulting with only around 0. 08 V coming out of the thermoelectric generators due to the lack of air flow within the electrical housing and poor electrical connection.
