5|$|One of the {{earliest}} proponents of the strategy of splitting eights is Ed Thorp, who developed the strategy on an IBM 704 {{as part of an}} overall <b>blackjack</b> strategic theory published in Beat the Dealer: A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One in 1962.

5|$|A pair of aces {{gives the}} <b>blackjack</b> player a {{starting}} hand value of either a 2 or a soft 12 {{which is a}} problematic starting hand in either case. Splitting aces gives a player two chances to hit 21. Splitting aces is so favorable to the player that most gambling establishments have rules limiting the player's rights to do so. In most casinos the player is only allowed to draw one card on each split ace. As a general rule, a ten on a split ace (or vice versa) is not considered a natural <b>blackjack</b> and does not get any bonus. Prohibiting resplitting and redoubling is also common. Regardless of the payout for <b>blackjack,</b> the rules for resplitting, the rules for doubling, the rules for multiple card draws and the dealer's cards, one should always split aces.|$|E

Percy has similar dreams about Annabeth saving Luke from being {{crushed by the}} ceiling of some cave and holding it up for him. Both are unable to act, however, until the Oracle (a shriveled mummy) somehow leaves the attic where it was kept and delivers the Huntress a prophecy.

5|$|The {{object of}} <b>blackjack</b> {{is for a}} player to defeat the dealer by obtaining a total as close to 21 as {{possible}} without accumulating a total that exceeds this number. In <b>blackjack,</b> the standard rule {{is that if the}} player is dealt a pair of identically ranked initial cards, known as a pair, the player is allowed to split them into separate hands and ask for a new second card for each while placing a full initial bet identical to the original wager with each. After placing the wager for the split hands the dealer gives the player an additional card for each split card. The two hands created by splitting are considered independently in competition against the dealer. Splitting allows the gambler to turn a bad hand into one or two hands with a good possibility of winning. It also allows the player to double the bet when the dealer busts. Some rules even allow for resplitting until the player has as many as four hands or allow doubling the bet after a split so that each hand has a bet double the original. The standard rules are that when a bet is doubled on a hand, the player is only allowed to draw one more card for that hand.|$|E

The only available method of augmenting Larry's funds is to gamble in the casino, playing <b>blackjack</b> and slots.|$|E
