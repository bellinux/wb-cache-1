6000|$|... 'I <b>bet</b> <b>there's</b> a {{story in}} there of a man named Harold who was too proud to marry a girl, though he loved her, because she was rich and he wasn't. You wouldn't be so silly as that, Bill, would you?' ...|$|R

[...] "I would have <b>bet</b> <b>there</b> wasn't a Reub in the state that wasn't wise to the Ferris breach of promise case, and here you blow in after the show's over and {{want to know who}} Nelly Nealy is.

"Not that I know of; {{but there}} was a good deal of curiosity about her among the yachts, she being an out-of-the-way sort of craft; and I fancy <b>there</b> were some <b>bets</b> about her. <b>There</b> was an idea that she was seen going west two days later, and the {{governor}} asked me to take the boat and find out whether she had been noticed here or at Ryde.

The first we should know of it would be the yell of the varmint at the foot of this barrier, and afore we could get to the top the two on guard would be tomahawked, and they would be down on us like a pack of wolves.

40|$|In Pelota matches, {{games with}} two {{mutually}} exclusive and exhaustive outcomes, bets on the winner are made between viewers through a middleman who receives 16 % of the finally paid amount. In this paper after {{the description of}} the way bets are made in the market we analyze what we call the general odds rule. Analyzing the way odds are fixed in the market we find that assuming equal return on <b>bets</b> <b>there</b> are biases in the market. Moreover, we find profitable betting strategies even taking commissions into account. ...|$|R

A shot rang out, and another and another, but I was getting now above the light of their torches. A hundred feet higher I came to a stand-still, for the rock rose right up in front of me, and the water had here come down from above in a fall. This made it a tight place, you <b>bet.</b> <b>There</b> war no ledge as I could see that I could get along, and I should have to go down a good bit afore I got to one.

40|$|Supported by Discourse Analysis studies made by Michel Pêcheux, we {{aimed at}} {{listening}} and analyzing senses materialized {{in the writing}} of teachers (subjects of the investigation) about the process of inclusion of children and teenagers with the so-called “mental disabilities” in regular Elementary Schools.
