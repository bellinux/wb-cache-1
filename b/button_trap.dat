50|$|Working solvent {{from the}} washing chamber passes through several {{filtration}} steps {{before it is}} returned to the washing chamber. The first step is a <b>button</b> <b>trap,</b> which prevents small objects such as lint, fasteners, buttons, and coins from entering the solvent pump.|$|E
5|$|Character {{movement}} is fully functional within the three-dimensional field map. Characters {{are able to}} perform special maneuvers using the environment by pressing the Triangle <b>button.</b> <b>Traps</b> {{with a variety of}} ill effects can be found throughout the arena. Characters' equipment can be customized, and they can gain EXP and gil from battles.|$|R
5000|$|After a time, {{the trojan}} will display an Exit <b>button,</b> but will <b>trap</b> the mouse cursor within the window when the button is {{attempted}} to be clicked, displaying the message [...] "OH! No I'm in the Cage". The Trojan will then {{require that the}} computer be logged off, at a minimum, before it will return control of the mouse.|$|R
50|$|SMiLE-seq uses a {{microfluidic}} device into which transcription factors, {{which have been}} transcribed and translated in vitro, are loaded. Transcription factor samples (~0.3 ng) are modified {{by the addition of}} an enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) tag and combined with both target double-stranded DNA molecules (~8 pmol) tagged with Cyanine Dye5 (Cy5) and a double-stranded competitive DNA model, poly-dIdC, which operates as a negative control to limit spurious binding interactions. When multiple transcription factors are simultaneously analyzed (e.g., when characterization of potential heterodimeric binding interactions is performed), each transcription factor is tagged with a correspondingly unique fluorescent tag. Samples are pumped through the {{microfluidic device}} in a passive, twenty-minute process that utilizes capillary action in a series of parallel channels. eGFP-tagged transcription factors are immunocaptured using anchored biotinylated anti-eGFP antibodies. Mechanical depression of a <b>button</b> <b>traps</b> bound transcription factor-DNA complexes, and fluorescent analysis is performed. Fluorescent readouts that identify the presence of multiple fluorescent tags associated with a single antibody indicate heterodimeric binding interactions. The presence of DNA is confirmed by Cy5 signal detection. A polydimethylsiloxane membrane on the button surface captures successfully bound transcription factor-DNA complexes, while unbound transcription factors and targets are washed away. Following the removal of unbound components, bound DNA molecules are collected, pooled, and amplified. Sequencing is subsequently performed using NextSeq 500 or HiSeq2000 sequencing lanes. Sequence data is used to develop a seed sequence, which is then probed for functional motifs using a uniquely developed hidden Markov model-based software pipeline.|$|R
5000|$|MouseHunt 2.0 was {{the second}} version of the game. It boasted many more User Interface changes, along with major {{gameplay}} elements, like Crafting. It was released on 6 October 2008. This version consists of a handy toolbar with a heading {{at the top of}} the page. On the Camp page, the layout has the banner, many <b>buttons,</b> and the <b>traps,</b> journal, and a short summary by [...] "Larry", who is a fictional knight that starts players off and gives hunting tips based on locations.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{measures}} have been suggested to mitigate the problem of <b>button</b> BPM <b>trapped</b> mode heating. A test fixture, {{using a combination of}} commercial-off-the-shelf and custom machined components, was assembled to validate the simulations. We present details of the fixture design, measurement results, and a comparison of the results with the simulations. A brief history of the <b>trapped</b> mode <b>button</b> heating problem and a set of design rules for BPM button optimization are presented elsewhere in these proceedings. Here we present measurements on a test fixture that was assembled to confirm, if possible, a subset of those rules: (1) Minimize the trapped mode impedance and the resulting power deposited in this mode by the beam. (2) Maximize the power re-radiated back into the beampipe. (3) Maximize electrical conductivity of the outer circumference of the button and minimize conductivity of the inner circumference of the shell, to shift power deposition from the button to the shell. The problem is then how to extract useful and relevant information from S-parameter measurements of the test fixture...|$|R
50|$|Levels are {{presented}} from a side-scrolling view, with Dr. Simius controlling {{a group of}} monkeys who must perform tasks like pulling levers and pressing <b>buttons</b> while evading <b>traps</b> and enemies in order to progress to the next level. The game's enemies and obstacles present an action component for the game, as a player may have to navigate a monkey though a crushing machine or past flying mines. Only one monkey can be controlled at a time. All hazards in the game are non-lethal, though they will reduce the player's health bar; the game is over is the health bar is depleted. Health can be replenished by collecting fruit.|$|R
