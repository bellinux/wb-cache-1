In free-market mechanism, this extreme difference will trigger price-volatility and shortage of staple-food. This situation causes opportunity-losses for the stakeholders (producer, consumer, agent and government) in the staple-food distribution system. The government has got incurred losses because the government cannot achieve food-security for the households. The government has several price stabilization policies; {{one of them is}} market intervention policy by using <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> schemes to stabilize price and to reduce losses for the stakeholders. The objective of this research is to determine the <b>buffer</b> <b>stock</b> schemes required for market-intervention program.

40|$|Recent {{models with}} {{liquidity}} constraints and impatience emphasize that consumers use savings to buffer income fluctuations.

We derive from the model an appropriate theoretical restriction and test it using data on working-age individuals drawn from the 2002 Italian Survey of Household Income and Wealth.

After a period of decline, tin prices rebounded in the late 1980s. Government policies since the early 1970s had sought to expand the percentage of metallic or refined tin exports that offered greater returns. As a result, smelting increased during the 1970s, but in the 1980s the excessive costs of the nation's highly underutilized smelting operations contributed to the decision to restructure Comibol.|$|E
5000|$|There was {{a greater}} {{depth of water}} at the {{entrance}} to the canal than {{at the entrance to}} Maryport harbour, but the problems of navigation in the upper Solway meant that sailing ships were more dependent on favourable winds to reach Port Carlisle. The annual shareholders' meeting in 1826 was told that [...] "it often happened that the navigation was stopped for six, seven, or nine weeks together by the prevalence of adverse winds"; this problem had held back the use of the canal for valuable goods (where the cost of adequate <b>buffer</b> <b>stocks</b> would be prohibitive) but was now obviated by a weekly steam packet service to and from Liverpool. This was not a complete solution: the canal had not been designed to take steamships, there was not enough depth of water at low tide at the harbour mouth to keep large steamships afloat, and the heavy machinery in steamships made them much less tolerant of grounding when the tide went out. The company therefore sought an Act of Parliament authorising the construction of a 'floating dock' (i.e. not a dock that floated, but a wet dock with lock gates to retain sufficient depth of water that ships in the dock remained afloat) at the canal mouth. The prospect of this (and the fact that some Canal Company directors were also directors of the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway [...] ) helped the N&CR to decide against active involvement in the promotion of a railway from Carlisle to Maryport. [...] Although the Act was obtained (Royal Assent 7 June 1836) the 'floating dock' at Port Carlisle was never built.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that simple price {{limiters}} may have unexpected consequences in irregular commodity price fluctuations between bull and bear markets and complicated impacts {{on the size of}} <b>buffer</b> <b>stocks.</b> In particular, imposing a lower price boundary may lead to a huge buffer stock, e. g. to a ?butter mountain? or a ?milk lake? and this is a real problem for regulators since storage costs may become impossible to finance over time. The relation between price limiters and the size of <b>buffer</b> <b>stocks</b> is nontrivial and there may exist some optimal price limiters which require only weak market interventions and thus provide a rather inexpensive option to regulate commodity markets. In this paper, we use a simple commodity market model to explore the relation between price limiters and the average growth rate of the <b>buffer</b> <b>stocks.</b> It is found that these optimal price limiter levels are simply the minimum values of unstable periodic orbits of the underlying deterministic system. commodity markets; price stabilization; limiter control; butter mountains and milk lakes...|$|E
