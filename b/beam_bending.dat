30|$|The classic {{assumption}} of Bernoulli (plane cross-sections {{perpendicular to the}} axis of the <b>beam</b> before <b>bending</b> remain plane and perpendicular to the bent axis of the <b>beam</b> after <b>bending)</b> {{has been used to}} calculate the strains distribution inside the beam cross-section.|$|R
50|$|As {{there is}} no {{lengthwise}} stress force on the neutral plane, {{there is no}} strain or extension either: when the <b>beam</b> <b>bends,</b> {{the length of the}} neutral plane remains constant.

50|$|In mechanics, {{the neutral}} plane or neutral surface is a {{conceptual}} plane within a beam or cantilever. When loaded by a <b>bending</b> force, the <b>beam</b> <b>bends</b> {{so that the}} inner surface is in compression and the outer surface is in tension. The neutral plane is the surface within the beam between these zones, where the material of the beam is not under stress, either compression or tension.|$|R

50|$|Two {{types of}} failure occurred: <b>beam</b> <b>bending</b> with {{buckling}} {{of the lower}} beam flange, and buckling of the beam-column assembly. The first {{was determined to be}} the most probable prime failure and the second the less probably prime cause.|$|E

As {{the index of}} refraction of air decreases faster than normal the radar <b>beam</b> <b>bends</b> toward the ground instead of continuing upward. Eventually, it will hit the ground and be reflected back toward the radar.

The beams have been bent by both the short term and long term transverse loads. By a detailed analysis of experimentally determined stress-strain quantities and by their comparison with the results of computation according to BAB- 87, a good agreement of the results could be established.

50|$|A {{chemical}} sensor {{can be obtained}} by coating a recognition receptor layer over the upper side of a microcantilever beam. A typical application is the immunosensor based on an antibody layer that interacts selectively with a particular immunogen and reports about its content in a specimen. In the static mode of operation, the sensor response is represented by the <b>beam</b> <b>bending</b> with respect to a reference microcantilever. Alternatively, microcantilever sensors can be operated in the dynamic mode. In this case, the beam vibrates at its resonance frequency and a variation in this parameter indicates the concentration of the analyte.|$|E
5000|$|We need an {{expression}} for the strain {{in terms of}} the deflection of the neutral surface to relate the stresses in an Euler-Bernoulli beam to the deflection. To obtain that expression we use the assumption that normals to the neutral surface remain normal during the deformation and that deflections are small. These assumptions imply that the <b>beam</b> <b>bends</b> into an arc of a circle of radius [...] (see Figure 1) and that the neutral surface does not change in length during the deformation.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{solution for}} predicting delamination buckling {{and growth of}} a thin fiber reinforced-plastic (FRP) layer in laminated wood <b>beams</b> under <b>bending</b> is presented. Based on a strength-of-materials approach, displacement functions for a delaminated <b>beam</b> under four-point <b>bending</b> are derived. Using force and displacement compatibility conditions, an explicit form relating the applied transverse load with the delamination buckling load is established. An explicit form of the strain-energy release rate is presented to study the delamination growth in <b>beams</b> under <b>bending.</b> The analytical solution is evaluated using experimental data for gluedlaminated timber (glulam) beams reinforced with a thin fiber-reinforced plastic composite on the compression face. The delamination growth in bending is shown to behave differently {{to that of the}} in-plane loading case...|$|R

The validity of the theoretical model is confirmed by a comparison of the theoretical and experimental results, while the efficiency of the fiber reinforcement is corroborated by the increased strength and stiffness of the reinforced timber beams...|$|R
50|$|Fibrils are {{composed}} of linear biopolymers, and are characterized by rod-like structures with high length to diameter ratios. Oftentimes, they spontaneously arrange into helical structures. In biomechanics problems, fibrils {{can be characterized as}} classical beams with a roughly circular cross-sectional area on the nanometer scale. As such, simple <b>beam</b> <b>bending</b> equations can be applied to calculate flexural strength of fibrils under ultra-low loading conditions. Like most biopolymers, stress-strain relationships of fibrils tend to show a characteristic toe-heel region before a linear, elastic region. Unlike biopolymers, Fibrils do not behave like homogeneous materials, as yield strength has been shown to vary with volume, indicating structural dependencies.|$|E
50|$|In {{the finite}} element method, the {{behavior}} (stresses, strains and displacements resulting from load conditions) of large-scale structures is approximated by a FE model consisting of structural elements (members) connected at structural node points. Calculations on traditional computers are performed at each node point and results communicated to adjacent node points until {{the behavior of}} the entire structure is computed. On the Finite Element Machine, microprocessors located at each node point perform these nodal computations in parallel. If there are more node points (N) than microprocessors (P), then each microprocessor performs N/P computations. The Finite Element Machine contained 32 processor boards each with a Texas Instruments TMS9900 processor, 32 Input/Output (IO) boards and a TMS99/4 controller. The FEM was conceived, designed and fabricated at NASA Langley Research Center. The TI 9900 processor chip was selected by the NASA team as it was the first 16-bit processor available on the market which until then was limited to less powerful 8-bit processors. The FEM concept was first successfully tested to solve <b>beam</b> <b>bending</b> equations on a Langley FEM prototype (4 IMSAI 8080s). This led to full-scale FEM fabrication & testing by the FEM hardware-software-applications team led by Dr. Olaf Storaasli formerly of NASA Langley Research Center and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (currently at USEC).The first significant Finite Element Machine results are documented in: The Finite Element Machine: An experiment in parallel processing (NASA TM 84514).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new machine {{that has been}} developed for directly measuring the deflection of airfield pavements under a rolling load wheel. This rolling weight deflectometer (RWD) optically measures the maximum amplitude of the depression basin using {{a new type of}} laser sensor that operates on the principle of triangulation. Four sensors that are mounted on a beam make pavement measurements. The key to producing accurate results is the requirement that the sensors remain in a straight line. Previous attempts using the method were plagued with deflection errors caused by thermal and vibrational <b>beam</b> <b>bending.</b> The patented RWD uses a laser to monitor bending of the physical beam in realtime. The information is used with pavement sensor data to produce accurate deflection measurements in the presence of significant <b>beam</b> <b>bending.</b> The bending-compensated RWD produces a deflection measurement with an accuracy of 40 μm (0. 0015 inch). The RWD consists of a horizontally transported beam, strategically placed pavement sensors, a subsystem that monitors <b>beam</b> <b>bending,</b> an odometer, and a data acquisition computer...|$|E

40|$|Vibration {{measurements}} {{can be used}} {{to detect}} fatigue cracks in structures. In fact, a damage alters the dynamic characteristics of the structure. In this report, a parameter called Local Modal Crack Sensitivity (LMCS) is used for crack localisation. Its analytical expression is explicitly written for a flexural vibrating beam. For more complex structures, FEM analysis can be used. LMCS is the coefficient of proportionality between the relative frequency shift, dwr/wr, of r-th eigenmode and the actual bending stiffness variation dK of damaged beam. It is a measure of how much local damage affects each eigenfrequency of the undamaged beam, as a function of crack location. This concept can obviously be generalised for other structures besides a <b>beam</b> in <b>bending.</b> From the well known expression of the modal stiffness kr for a <b>beam</b> in pure <b>bending,</b> the following expression of LMCS for a <b>beam</b> in <b>bending</b> can be deduced:...|$|R
