50|$|In LEFMPA, during cracking, no {{specific}} region is mentioned {{in between the}} area which is cracked and that which is not. But {{it is evident that}} in concrete, there is some intermediate space between cracked and uncracked portion. This region is defined as the Fracture Process Zone (FPZ). FPZ consists of micro cracks which are minute individual cracks situated nearer to crack tip. As the crack propagates these micro cracks merge and becomes a single structure to give continuity to the already existing crack. So indeed, FPZ acts as a <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> between cracked region and uncracked region. Analysis of this zone deserves special notice because it is very helpful to predict the propagation of crack and ultimate failure in concrete.In steel (ductile) FPZ is very small and therefore strain hardening dominates over strain softening. Also due to small FPZ, crack tip can easily be distinguished from uncracked metal. And in ductile materials FPZ is a yielding zone.|$|E

From the experimental measurement, {{we are able to}} determine quantitatively the stress-bridging law (or decohesion law), which characterizes the relationship between the bridging stress and the opening displacement cross the <b>bridging</b> <b>zone.</b> The plastic bonded HMX (PBX) high explosives are composed of the energetic crystal (HMX) and a polymeric binder. Previous experimental observations showed that the fracture process in the sugar mock, a simulant of the PBX 9501 high explosive, is very different from that in brittle solids, even though the high explosive material PBX 9501 is quite brittle under tension. A close examination of the fracture surface revealed that before crack initiation and propagation, a very large damage region is developed ahead of the crack tip. Since such a damage region is very narrow, it can be modeled as a stress <b>bridging</b> <b>zone.</b> Due to the presence of the sizable <b>bridging</b> <b>zone,</b> conventional fracture mechanics is no longer applicable. Stress bridging has to be considered explicitly in order to understand of fracture processes in the PBX 9501 high explosive and the sugar mock. The model, which explicitly incorporates stress-bridging mechanism, is shown in Fig. 1. In describing the model, one would need the following quantities, <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> length R, bridging stress {sigma}(x{sub 1 }), bridging-zone opening displacement {sigma}(x{sub 1 }), and the critical stress, {sigma}{sub C}, at which <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> starts to develop.

The healing of delamination cracks in laminates containing particles or fibres of the mendable thermoplastic poly[ethylene-co-(methacrylic acid) ] (EMAA) was investigated. The {{results showed that the}} formation of largescale <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> of EMAA ligaments along the crack upon healing yielded a large increase (similar to 300 %) in the static mode I interlaminar fracture toughness, exceeding the requirement of full restoration. The mendable laminates retained high healing efficiency with multiple repair cycles because of the capability of EMAA to reform the <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> under static delamination crack growth conditions. Under fatigue loading, healing by the EMAA was found to restore the mode I fatigue crack growth resistance, with the rates of growth being slightly less than that pertinent to the unmodified laminate. The EMAA <b>bridging</b> <b>zone,</b> which generated high toughness under static loading conditions, does not develop under fatigue loading because of rapid fatigue failure of the crack bridging ligaments. Similar to the multiple healing capability of EMAA under static loading, multiple healing of delamination fatigue cracks is confirmed, with the fatigue crack growth rates remaining approximately unchanged.

40|$|R-curve {{behaviour}} {{is often}} used for evaluating crack growth resistance in quasibrittle materials but few {{studies have focused on}} polycrystalline graphite. In this study, R-curve behaviour in three commercial grade nuclear graphites, of varying structure and properties, is compared using an optical method, a theoretical compliance method, and, a potential drop (PD) technique to measure crack length. Two graphites are coarse-grained and the third a fine grained graphite. Both 3 -point bend and compact tension specimens are used. The fine-grain graphite shows lowest resistance, with the coarse-grained materials displaying similar R-curves. The compliance method is simplest but assumes the material is linear elastic, producing similar R-curves to the optical method. The PID method seriously underestimates the crack length due to crack face bridging, causing the R-curves to show a falling behaviour. The shortfall in the PID measurements presents a novel way of physically measuring the <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> length. The graphites display similar variation in the apparent <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> length despite the difference in grain size. Higher resistance in the coarser material results from increased crack path deflection, coupled with stronger grain bridging traction within the <b>bridging</b> <b>zone.</b> The <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> length is longer in compact tension specimens than in 3 -point bend specimens, explaining partly why higher fracture energy is recorded in compact tension. In oxidised graphite, the crack growth resistance reduces but the coarser materials still show useful resistance. The fine-grain graphite shows a tendency toward flat R-curve behaviour with increasing oxidation. The mechanisms responsible for toughening in non-oxidised graphite prevail in oxidised material but diminish with increasing porosity and loss of binder phase. A preliminary study of the nano-indentation behaviour of the nuclear graphites reveals a similar response in all the materials. Anelastic hysteresis in the loadunload response is found with little residual deformation. There is also evidence of a creep effect during the dwell period at the maximum load. Comparison of the average indentation modulus with the bulk flexural and sonic modulus indicates that the nano-indentation technique is unable to sense bulk modulus changes such as occur with oxidation or the forming process. Instead, the method is susceptible to localised structural inhomogeneities. ...|$|E

40|$|Summary A multi-scale bridged crack {{model for}} the {{evaluation}} of fracture and strength parameters of interfaces with cracks is proposed. We suppose that distributed nonlinear bonds link the crack surfaces in some zones starting from the crack tips. The sizes of these zones are not assumed to be small as compared to the crack length on every bridging level. The system of singular integral-differential equations is derived for normal and shear bond stresses evaluation. Two fracture criterions of quasistatic crack growth are considered. The first condition in the both criterions is the same: it is the condition of the bond limit stretching or the limit strain at the trailing edge of the <b>bridged</b> <b>zone.</b> Two types of the second condition of fracture is considered: a) the force condition which is the condition for the critical stress intensity factor and b) the proposed energetic condition based on the equality of the values of the strain energy release rate and the energy dissipation by the bonds at the crack limit equilibrium state. The regimes of the <b>bridged</b> <b>zone</b> and the crack tip equilibrium and growth are analyzed for the both types of these criterions...|$|R

40|$|The {{resistance}} of polycrystalline materials to intergranular cracking can {{be influenced by}} the microstructure. In sensitized stainless steels, for example, the grain boundaries prone to sensitization form paths of low resistance for intergranular stress corrosion cracking. The nonsensitized grain boundaries, such as twin boundaries, have been observed to encourage the formation of crack bridging ligaments. Computational models of intergranular cracking have been developed to investigate the consequences of crack bridging, through its effects on crack propagation in microstructures with different fractions of nonsensitized boundaries. This paper introduces the recently developed, two-dimensional model for intergranular cracking with crack bridging, and reports its application to investigate the effect of grain size. It is shown that the size of the crack <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> depends on the grain size, and the shielding contribution depends on the relative size of the <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> compared to the crack length. It is concluded that both grain refinement and increase in the fraction of resistant boundaries can improve microstructure resistance to intergranular cracking. These observations are consistent with the effects of grain boundary engineering on stress corrosion cracking resistance in sensitized stainless steels. Copyright © 2008 by ASME...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{more than}} two decades of {{research}} on the topic, there are currently few practical tools for incorporating crack size (i. e., small or short crack) effects into fatigue life predictions in real engineering applications. This paper examines how fatigue resistance curves (fatigue R-curves or fatigue threshold R-curves) may be used to understand and predict such crack size effects. Recently published and new experimental fatigue R-curve results are presented for human bone and polycrystalline Al 2 O 3. When fatigue crack growth resistance is plotted as a function of crack size on R-curves, clear trends of increasing with crack extension are seen for both materials. Also, when those crack size effects arise from extrinsic toughening mechanisms, like crack bridging in Al 2 O 3, it is demonstrated that the fatigue behavior at all crack sizes can be predicted by carefully characterizing the <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> and quantifying the effects of bridging using only long crack experiments. Experimentally measured short crack fatigue threshold data agrees well with the predictions based on quantitative <b>bridging</b> <b>zone</b> characterization.

The interfacial friction shear strength tau(sub f) measured in the crack wake using pushout testing revealed lower values than the as-received interface. Interfacial wear also reduced the strength of the bridging fibers. The reduction in fiber strength is thought to be a function of the magnitude of relative fiber/matrix displacements ind the degree of interfacial damage.

In this project, the fracture characteristics of a specially made fiber reinforced composite with different fiber spacing are investigated.

This crack tip closure phenomenon is one manifestation of bridging-induced spatial oscillations that sometimes appears in the crack displacement function, which can be understood qualitatively through the similarity of the fracture problem to the classical problem of a beam on a Winkler foundation.
