A record of eight parties won seats, {{the first time since the}} beginning of democratic elections in 1990 that more than seven parties entered parliament. After being tasked by President Rosen Plevneliev to form a government, Borisov's GERB formed a coalition and members of the parties in the Reformist Bloc (Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB), Union of Democratic Forces (SDS), Bulgaria for Citizens Movement (DBG), Alternative for Bulgarian Revival and Bulgarian Agrarian National Union (BZNS)) were chosen for Minister positions. However, Boyko <b>Borisov</b> made a vow in 2016 – should GERB President nominee Tsetska Tsacheva does not win the Bulgarian presidential election, 2016, he would resign as a Prime Minister. GERB lost at this election from the independent candidate Rumen Radev who was, nevertheless, supported by the Bulgarian Socialist Party. Subsequently, Boyko <b>Borisov</b> resigned for the second time.|$|E

25|$|Periodically ensuing {{corruption}} {{scandals and}} controversies {{has led to}} reports of high levels of corruption in <b>Borisov's</b> government. According to the Corruption Perceptions Index, compiled by Transparency International, <b>Borisov's</b> government was as corrupt as previous governments, {{with two of his}} closest ministers – Tzvetan Tzvetanov and Miroslav Naydenov—investigated by the Prosecutor General and the Tax Authority for taking bribes while in office. This goes against <b>Borisov's</b> declared mission to fight corruption and organized crime while pressing criminal charges against former corrupt politicians. Despite <b>Borisov's</b> initial promise, no representative of previous cabinets has so far been convicted.|$|R

5|$|The {{subsequent}} snap {{elections in}} May 2013 {{resulted in a}} narrow win for GERB. However, with no support from the other three political parties that entered the parliament, on 24 May, GERB leader Boyko <b>Borisov</b> returned the president's mandate to form a government. The Bulgarian Socialist Party nominated the ex-Finance Minister Plamen Oresharski for the post of Prime Minister in May 2013. Only two weeks after its initial formation the Oresharski government came under opposition criticism and {{had to deal with}} another wave of large-scale protests some with more than 11 000 participants.

At about the same time, the 31st Army became part of the 3rd Belorussian Front. In the initial stages of Operation Bagration, the front's immediate objective was the city of Orsha. The 331st had the direct support of the 959th SU Regiment (SU-76s) for its initial assault; this regiment had been assigned to support of the corps since the beginning of June. In recognition of the 331st's role in the liberation of Orsha, on June 27, it was awarded the Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class. The division went on to assist in the liberation of <b>Borisov.</b> While two divisions of the 8th Guards Rifle Corps of the 11th Guards Army attacked from the west and north, the 331st drove into the south of the city and it was cleared of German forces by 3:00 am on July 1.

Despite a promising start, Giovinco did not play regularly and made sporadic appearances throughout the season, both in the starting eleven and off the bench, {{as he struggled to}} fit into Claudio Ranieri's preferred 4–4–2 formation, and was often used out of position on the left wing. However, he did earn praise in the media for the Man of the match performance that he produced when he was started in Juventus's home fixture in Serie A against Bologna on 14 March 2009, in which he first set-up a goal from a corner and later scored another from a half-volley to help Juventus come from behind to win the match 4–1.
