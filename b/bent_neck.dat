60|$|Our modern artists, whom we style Pre-Raphaelites, have {{delighted to}} go back, {{not only to}} the finish and {{peculiar}} manner, but also to the subjects of the early painters. It is impossible to give them too much praise for the elaborate perseverance with which they have equalled the minute perfections of the masters from whom they take their inspiration: nothing probably can exceed the painting of some of these latter-day pictures. It is, however, singular into what faults they fall as regards their subjects: they are not quite content to take the old stock groups,--a Sebastian with his arrows, a Lucia with her eyes in a dish, a Lorenzo with a gridiron, or the Virgin with two children. But they are anything but happy in their change. As a rule, no figure should be drawn in a position which it is impossible to suppose any figure should maintain. The patient endurance of St Sebastian, the wild ecstasy of St John in the Wilderness, the maternal love of the Virgin, are feelings naturally portrayed by a fixed posture; but the lady with the stiff back and <b>bent</b> <b>neck,</b> who looks at her flower, and is still looking from hour to hour, gives us an idea of pain without grace, and abstraction without a cause.|$|E

60|$|It now {{struck him}} that the truth of his {{conclusions}} might be demonstrated without all the apparatus he had employed. To do this, he took some decaying animal or vegetable substance, such as urine, which is an extremely decomposable substance, or the juice of yeast, or perhaps some other artificial preparation, and filled a vessel having a long tubular neck with it. He then boiled the liquid and bent that long neck into an S shape or zig-zag, leaving it open at the end. The infusion then gave no trace of any appearance of spontaneous generation, however long it might be left, as all the germs in the air were deposited {{in the beginning of}} the <b>bent</b> <b>neck.</b> He then cut the tube close to the vessel, and allowed the ordinary air to have free and direct access; and the result of that was the appearance of organisms in it, as soon as the infusion had been allowed to stand long enough to allow of the growth of those it received from the air, which was about forty-eight hours. The result of M. Pasteur's experiments proved, therefore, in the most conclusive manner, that all the appearances of spontaneous generation arose from nothing more than the deposition of the germs of organisms which were constantly floating in the air.|$|E

If you, O reader, or I were bound to stand up in that court, dressed in wig and gown, and to tell a story that would take six hours in the telling, the one or the other of us knowing it to be his special duty so to tell it that judge, and counsellors, and jury, should all catch clearly every point that was to be made,--how ill would that story be told, how would those points escape the memory of the teller, and never come near the intellect of the hearers! And how would the knowledge that it would be so, confuse your tongue or mine,--and make exquisitely miserable that moment of rising before the audience! But our Solicitor-General rose to his legs a happy man, with all that grace of motion, that easy slowness, that unassumed confidence which belongs to the ordinary doings of our familiar life.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to choose a new resin for the BP Castro(bottle-making process. Four resins were tested using the standard 10 -week stack test: ExxonMobil HY A 30 I (the control), Chevron Marlex 9512 H, Dow DMDA 6200, and BP Solvay HPS 0 - 25 - 155. The study focused on five possible defects: <b>bent</b> <b>neck,</b> pushed up base, creased side wall, pushed in bumper, and creased label panel. The goal was to find a resin that performed as well as or better than the control resin. The test required bottles to be made and quality-checked for conformance to specification. The bottles were then put into an Environmental Stress Crack Resistance test and subsequently set up in a warehouse for a live load double stack test. Four pallets of each resin were loaded with ballast weight and left untouched. At the conclusion of IO weeks, the ballast weight was removed and the bottles were inspected for defects. None of the resins clearly outperformed the control resin on all elements of the evaluation. Due to the lack of supply of the control resin, a new resin had to be picked from this set; therefore, the comparison was narrowed down to a single defect type: <b>bent</b> <b>neck.</b> As a result, the Dow resin was chosen as the replacement. Future development in test methods can be drawn from this test set of data to produce a lab-based test that is done in a controlled environment at an accelerated pace...|$|E

40|$|The loss of {{commercial}} quality during storage and transportation of roses {{is one of}} the factors that reflect on production costs, leading producers to preventively apply harmful chemicals, mainly to hamper Botrytis cinerea development and reduce further losses. An alternative to increase flower longevity without contaminating the environment with harmful chemicals is the use of natural products, such as essential oils, which have fungistatic and insecticide properties, as well as low toxicity. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of essential oils on the vase life of Rosa cv. Avalanche: 12 treatments were tested, resulting from the combination of 5 types of essential oils plus the control in two cold storage periods (2 to 6 days) at 1 °C, 90 - 95 % RH. The essential oils tested were eucalyptus, cinnamon, lemongrass and peppermint (1 %), clove (0. 1 %), plus a control with distilled water. Application was made by spraying the flower buds. After storage at low temperatures, the flower stems were kept in a room (16 °C, 70 % RH) during 10 days for evaluation. Flower stems stored for 2 days in a cold chamber showed better means for darkening, turgor and <b>bent</b> <b>neck,</b> as well as a lower weight loss by the stems. The application of lemongrass essential oil at 1 % caused burns on the petals, compromising quality and pot life.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{prevalence}} of neck pain in patients and their effects on daily performance. Design: Hospital based observational study. Setting: OPD of Mayo Hospital and private chamber of the consultant. Main outcome measures: Neck pain {{as a cause of}} morbidity in both genders with loss of work hours leading to economic and household pressures. Results: A total of 100 patients were studied. Out of these 54 % were males and 46 % were females. Age range was 15 - 70 years with the mean of 37 + 15. 12 years. Duration of pain was from range 1 - 10 years with the mean of 4 + 3. 80 years. Sixty nine percent were married and 31 % were unmarried, 74 % had urban and 26 % had rural background. Out of these 69 % were working in sitting posture and 31 % in standing posture with bent necks on their jobs. Pain was radiating to arms in 53 %, dull localized in 34 %, stabbing in 9 % and of burning character in 4 % of patients. No neurological deficit was noted except that movements of neck were painful with associated muscle spasm. These patients were put on muscle relaxants, analgesics, advised extension exercises and told to improve their working conditions by keeping high desks or soft cervical collar. 78 % patients showed improvement in the pain and radiation whereas 22 % did not get any relief who were referred to physiotherapy department. Conclusions: Neck pain and associated neck muscle pain is a common symptom. The muscle spasm can be overcome by good posture, proper position of neck during work, avoiding very long hours of <b>bent</b> <b>neck.</b> NSAIDs, muscle relaxants and light extension along with exercises of neck can overcome such problems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPostharvest {{diseases}} cause considerable {{losses to}} harvested crops. Among them, gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) {{is a major}} problem of exporting to cut rose flowers into Korea. Irradiation treatment is an alternative to phytosanitary purposes and a useful nonchemical approach to the control of postharvest diseases. Gamma irradiation was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antifungal activity against B. cinerea on cut rose varieties, ‘Shooting Star’ and ‘Babe’. The irradiating dose required to reduce the population by 90 %, D 10, was 0. 99 kGy. Gamma irradiation showed complete inhibition of spore germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea, especially 4. 0 kGy in vitro. Antifungal activity of gamma irradiation on rose B. cinerea is a dose-dependent manner. A significant phytotoxicity such as <b>bent</b> <b>neck</b> in cut rose quality was shown from gamma irradiation at over 0. 4 kGy (p< 0. 05) in both varieties. Although there is no significant difference in both varieties for fresh weight, in the case of flower rate, ‘Babe’ shows more sensitivity than ‘Shooting Star’. In vivo assays demonstrated that established doses in in vitro, over 4 kGy, could completely inactive fungal pathogens, but such high doses can cause severe flowers damage. Thus, to eliminate negative impact on their quality, gamma irradiation was evaluated at lower doses in combination with an eco-friendly chemical, sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) to examine the inhibition of B. cinerea. Intriguingly, only the combined treatment with 0. 2 kGy of gamma irradiation and 70 ppm of NaDCC exhibited significant synergistic antifungal activity against blue mold decay in both varieties. Together, these results suggest that a synergistic effect of the combined treatment with gamma irradiation and NaDCC can be efficiently used to control the postharvest diseases in cut rose flowers, and will provide a promising technology for horticulture products for exportation...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 10 - 15 % of couples are infertile and male factors account for about half of these cases. With the advent of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), many infertile men {{have been able to}} father offspring. However, teratozoospermia still remains a big challenge to tackle. Septins belong to a family of cytoskeletal proteins with GTPase activity and are involved in various biological processes e. g. morphogenesis, compartmentalization, apoptosis and cytokinesis. SEPTIN 12, identified by c-DNA microarray analysis of infertile men, is exclusively expressed in the post meiotic male germ cells. Septin 12 (+/+) /Septin 12 (+/-) chimeric mice have multiple reproductive defects including the presence of immature sperm in the semen, and sperm with <b>bent</b> <b>neck</b> (defect of the annulus) and nuclear DNA damage. These facts make SEPTIN 12 a potential sterile gene in humans. In this study, we sequenced the entire coding region of SEPTIN 12 in infertile men (n =  160) and fertile controls (n =  200) and identified ten variants. Among them is the c. 474 G>A variant within exon 5 that encodes part of the GTP binding domain. The variant creates a novel splice donor site that causes skipping of a portion of exon 5, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal half of SEPTIN 12. Most individuals homozygous for the c. 474 A allele had teratozoospermia (abnormal sperm < 14 %) and their sperm showed bent tail and de-condensed nucleus with significant DNA damage. Ex vivo experiment showed truncated SEPT 12 inhibits filament formation in a dose-dependent manner. This study provides the first causal link between SEPTIN 12 genetic variant and male infertility with distinctive sperm pathology. Our finding also suggests vital roles of SEPT 12 in sperm nuclear integrity and tail development...|$|E
