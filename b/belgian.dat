5|$|After {{the defeat}} in 1940, {{significant}} numbers of <b>Belgian</b> soldiers and civilians escaped to Britain who, along with <b>Belgian</b> pre-war émigrés in Britain and Canada, formed the <b>Belgian</b> forces in exile. The <b>Belgian</b> government, including ministers from Catholic, Socialist and Liberal parties under Hubert Pierlot, evacuated to London alongside other governments from occupied countries (including the Netherlands and Luxembourg) where it remained until the liberation of Belgium in 1944.|$|E
5|$|<b>Belgian</b> {{soldiers}} fought rearguard actions {{while other}} <b>Belgian</b> units {{already on the}} Dyle line worked tirelessly to organise better defensive positions in the Leuven–Antwerp gap. The 2nd Regiment of Guides and the 2nd Carabineers Cyclists of the 2nd <b>Belgian</b> Cavalry Division covered the retreat of the 4th and 7th <b>Belgian</b> divisions and were particularly distinguished at the Battle of Tirlemont and the Battle of Halen.|$|E
5|$|During the 18 Days' Campaign, the <b>Belgian</b> {{air force}} had lost {{practically}} all its equipment and 28 pilots had been killed. After the French surrender, many <b>Belgian</b> pilots escaped to England. 15 <b>Belgian</b> pilots served in fighter squadrons of the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the Battle of Britain in June 1940 while a further 14 others served in auxiliary roles, such as navigators or gunners. All served in predominantly British squadrons rather than national units. By 1943, {{there were more}} <b>Belgian</b> pilots in the Royal Air Force than there {{had been in the}} <b>Belgian</b> air force in 1940.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, the <b>Belgian</b> government-in-exile {{decided to}} raise a {{military}} unit from pre-war <b>Belgian</b> émigrés and soldiers rescued from Dunkirk. The original forces were known as the 1st Fusilier Battalion A 2nd Fusilier Battalion was formed in Canada from <b>Belgian</b> émigrés in the Americas.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>Belgian</b> {{military}} had officially surrendered in May 1940 and the <b>Belgian</b> Constitution specifically forbade Belgians from joining foreign militaries, the Free <b>Belgian</b> forces were officially committing treason; {{the charge was}} only annulled in 1948 and nobody was prosecuted. Despite the formation of all-Belgian ground units from late 1940, many <b>Belgian</b> volunteers – {{especially those in the}} Royal Air Force – served in majority British units, particularly in the early years after the formation of the Free <b>Belgian</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{revenue from}} the <b>Belgian</b> Congo enabled the <b>Belgian</b> {{government}} in exile and Free <b>Belgian</b> Forces to fund themselves, unlike most other states in exile, which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments. It also meant that the <b>Belgian</b> gold reserves, which had been moved to London in 1940, were not needed to fund the war effort, and therefore were still available {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that a third {{generation}} is already coming of age, Turkish <b>Belgians</b> continue to be seen as outsiders by {{a large part of the}} native population and are often the object of prejudice and discriminatory behavior. This article explores processes of ‘othering’ and ‘exclusion’ from the point of view of Turkish <b>Belgians</b> themselves: it focuses on how and to what extent Turkish <b>Belgians</b> feel othered, accepted or excluded and on how this shapes their identification processes. Based on a qualitative case study among second and third generation Turkish <b>Belgians</b> (N= 60), I demonstrate how cases of racism, prejudice and ethnic framing in everyday interaction incite a sense of exclusion among many of the respondents. The analysis points to an interdependence between this sense of exclusion and how people identify vis-à-vis <b>Belgians,</b> Turks, Turkish <b>Belgians.</b> Based on notions of similarity and difference, sense of exclusion, and meanings given to different identities, we construct five different identification profiles. The analysis of these profile shows the power of exclusion while at the same time highlighting how Turkish <b>Belgians</b> are active agents in constructing a positive, inclusive identity...|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} was {{also involved in}} the provision of social, educational and cultural institutions to <b>Belgian</b> refugees. In 1942, the government sponsored the creation of the <b>Belgian</b> Institute in London to entertain the <b>Belgian</b> refugee community in London. By 1943, there were also four <b>Belgian</b> schools in Britain with 330 pupils between them, in Penrith, Braemar, Kingston and Buxton.|$|E
5|$|After liberation, the <b>Belgian</b> {{government}} decided {{to increase the}} size of the RNSB to 1,200 men which would later form the backbone of the fledgling <b>Belgian</b> Navy.|$|E
5|$|Alan Brooke, {{commander}} of the British II Corps sought to put the matter of cooperation right with King Leopold. The King discussed the matter with Brooke, who felt a compromise could be reached. Van Overstraeten, the King's military aide, stepped in {{and said that the}} 10th <b>Belgian</b> Infantry Division could not be moved. Instead, the British should move further south and remain completely clear of Brussels. Brooke told the King that the 10th <b>Belgian</b> Division was {{on the wrong side of}} the Gamelin line and was exposed. Leopold deferred to his advisor and chief of staff. Brooke found Overstaeten to be ignorant of the situation and the dispositions of the BEF. Given that the left flank of the BEF rested on its <b>Belgian</b> ally, the British were now unsure about <b>Belgian</b> military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Two corvettes and a {{group of}} minesweepers were also {{operated}} by the <b>Belgians</b> during the Battle of the Atlantic. By 1943, 350 <b>Belgians</b> were serving as sailors on these vessels.|$|R

5|$|Around 1,400 {{men of the}} <b>Belgian</b> {{fishing fleet}} had left for Britain after the <b>Belgian</b> surrender. Three <b>Belgian</b> {{trawlers}} even {{took part in the}} evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk, rescuing 4,300 British soldiers between them. Their ships and crews were put at the disposal of the Royal Navy, for coastal patrols and launching barrage balloons. From October 1940, many joined the RNSB.|$|E
5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} {{strategic}} reserve. It was felt it would save more <b>Belgian</b> territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also had the advantage of absorbing Dutch and <b>Belgian</b> Army formations (including some 20 <b>Belgian</b> divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{distinctive}} course, the Brabant Revolution had been extensively used in historical comparisons with the French Revolution. Some historians, following Henri Pirenne, {{have seen it}} as a key moment {{in the formation of}} a <b>Belgian</b> nation-state, and an influence on the <b>Belgian</b> Revolution of 1830.|$|E
5000|$|On 11 April 1865, General Regules {{attacked}} the <b>Belgians</b> with between 3,000 and 3,500 Republican soldiers. [...] Surrounded from all sides, the <b>Belgians</b> {{held out for}} five hours, hoping for reinforcements which arrived four days too late. They were finally forced to surrender. While the number of casualties is disputed, {{it is believed that}} between fifty and one hundred <b>Belgians</b> were killed and around 200 were taken prisoner.|$|R
50|$|On {{orders from}} 3rd Infantry Division, the <b>Belgians</b> withdrew from {{positions}} {{back to the}} UN lines, taking up positions on Hill 362. Withdrawing from Haktang-ni, the <b>Belgians</b> watched a heavy artillery barrage falling on their vacated positions.|$|R
50|$|In Brussels on 4 February/4 May 1875, Philipp married Louise, {{princess of}} Belgium, his second cousin, {{daughter}} of Leopold II, {{king of the}} <b>Belgians</b> and granddaughter of Leopold I, king of the <b>Belgians,</b> brother of Philipp's grandfather Ferdinand.|$|R
5|$|Before the war, the <b>Belgian</b> {{government}} had planned an emergency system of rationing, which was implemented {{on the day}} of the German invasion. The German occupying authority used Belgium's reliance on food imports as a bargaining tool. The amount of food permitted to <b>Belgian</b> citizens was roughly two-thirds of that allowed to comparable German citizens and was amongst the lowest in occupied Europe. On average, scarcity of food led to a loss of five to seven kilograms of weight per <b>Belgian</b> in 1940 alone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Belgian</b> forces {{took control}} of Rwanda and Burundi during World War I, and the country came under <b>Belgian</b> control in a 1919 League of Nations mandate, named Ruanda-Urundi. Although Belgium {{initially}} continued the German method of government through the monarchy, in 1926, it began a policy of direct colonial rule {{in line with the}} norm in the Congo. Reforms included simplifying the complex three-chieftain system, so one chief (usually Tutsi) instead of three (typically split between Tutsi and Hutu) ruled a local area. <b>Belgian</b> reforms also extended uburetwa (forced labour by Hutus for Tutsi chiefs) to individuals, not just communities, and to regions not previously covered by the system. Tutsi chiefs began a process of land reform with <b>Belgian</b> support; grazing areas traditionally controlled by Hutu collectives were seized by Tutsi and privatised with minimal compensation.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. <b>Belgian</b> {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} <b>Belgian</b> parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The <b>Belgian</b> URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the <b>Belgian</b> Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the <b>Belgian</b> agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E

5|$|By 1944, the Free <b>Belgian</b> {{forces in}} the United Kingdom {{numbered}} some 4,500 men. <b>Belgian</b> soldiers formed the 1st <b>Belgian</b> Infantry Brigade (which also included an artillery battery of soldiers from Luxembourg) more often known as the Brigade Piron after its commanding officer, Jean-Baptiste Piron. The Brigade Piron {{was involved in the}} Normandy Invasion and the battles in France and the Netherlands until liberation.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's and the British {{response}} was officially restrained. This {{was due to}} the strong-willed defence of the <b>Belgian</b> defensive campaign presented to the cabinet by Sir Roger Keyes at 11:30am 28 May. The French and <b>Belgian</b> ministers had referred to Leopold's actions as treacherous, but they were unaware of the true events: Leopold had not signed an agreement with Hitler in order to form a collaborative government, but an unconditional surrender as Commander-in-Chief of the <b>Belgian</b> Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of their advance through Belgium, the Germans {{committed}} a number of war crimes against the <b>Belgian</b> civilian population along their route of advance. These massacres were often responses to towns whose populations were accused of fighting as Francs-Tireurs or guerillas against the German army. Civilians were summarily executed and several towns deliberately destroyed in a series of punitive actions collectively known as The Rape of Belgium. As many as 6,500 people were killed by the German army between August and November 1914. In Leuven, the historic library of the town's university was deliberately burned. News of the atrocities, also widely exaggerated by the Allied press, raised considerable sympathy for the <b>Belgian</b> civilian population in occupied Belgium. The sympathy for the plight of <b>Belgian</b> civilians and <b>Belgian</b> refugees continued in Allied newspapers and propaganda {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
