5|$|Wise asked Harold Michelson {{to be the}} film's {{production}} designer, and Michelson was put to work on {{finishing the}} incomplete Phase II sets. The designer began with the bridge, which had nearly been completed. Michelson first removed Chekov's new weapons station, a semicircular plastic bubble grafted onto {{one side of the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>wall.</b> The idea for Phase II was that Chekov would have looked out toward space while crosshairs in the bubble tracked targets. Wise instead wanted Chekov's station to face the Enterprises main viewer, a difficult request as the set was primarily circular. Production illustrator Michael Minor created a new look for the station using a flat edge {{in the corner of the}} set.|$|E
25|$|About 5:38am EST, while {{operating}} the motorcoach southbound in a left-hand HOV lane of I-75 in the Atlanta metropolitan area, the driver accidentally entered a left exit ramp, which ended abruptly at an elevated T-junction {{marked by a}} stop sign. When it {{reached the top of}} the ramp and the stop sign, the bus was traveling at highway speed. The driver lost control of the bus, which slid sideways into a concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>wall</b> and chain-link security fence, then fell 19 feet, landing on its left side across the interstate highway below. Twenty-nine passengers survived the crash, while seven occupants were killed.|$|E
25|$|The bridge has {{not always}} been the source of tragedy, the evening of the 18th of May 1969 is fondly remembered by many of the {{community}} when a truck laden with Bushmills and Cream of Barley Whiskey was traveling from Antrim to Dublin when its brakes failed coming down the hill and it rolled over the <b>bridge</b> <b>wall</b> into the river some 3 meters or so below, the driver survived and was brought to Hospital but the entire loot of liquor was strewn across the river bottom. Most of the town of Slane were quick on the scene, vans and truck were seen spiriting away from the wreck of the truck in the dead of night. Several prosecutions followed, the actual quantity of whiskey taken away is still known only to the management of Bushmills and perhaps to the Insurance Company that followed up the claim. The following day five Irish Divers, Brian Cusack, Sean Sheridan, Joe Murray, Fergus McKenna and Sean Donohoe arrived and while the local people of Slane were still dredging for bottles they collected 408 bottles in total, the local butcher in Slane at the time was apparently still drinking Bushmills Whiskey four years later.|$|E

50|$|It {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. In 2001, the bridge was closed {{when one of the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>walls</b> began to {{separate}} from an arch. After a decade of disuse, it was demolished and replaced with a concrete span in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Very little now {{remains to}} show that this was once a busy country junction.

60|$|We dipped {{over the}} bridge into the village. A boy on a bicycle, loaded with four paper bonnet-boxes, pedalled towards us, out of an alley on our right. He bowed his head the better to {{overcome}} the ascent, and naturally took his left. Mr. Lingnam swerved frantically to the right. Penfentenyou shouted. The boy looked up, saw the car was like to squeeze him against the <b>bridge</b> <b>wall,</b> flung himself off his machine and across the narrow pavement into the nearest house. He slammed {{the door at the}} precise moment when the car, all brakes set, bunted the abandoned bicycle, shattering three of the bonnet-boxes and jerking the fourth over the unscreened dashboard into Mr. Lingnam's arms.|$|E

5000|$|The bridge {{provides}} {{access to}} the main village from the Sligo side of the area. It was built in 1847 after the old bridge was washed away in a storm in 1844. It contains the Bullance stone, which {{is built into the}} <b>bridge</b> <b>wall</b> and is a symbolic drinking trough, which qualified the village to hold a [...] "Fair Day". The water is reputedly a cure for skin infections. Hangings took place at the bridge in the 19th century. A similar type bridge is located south of the village in the local woods. This is known as [...] "Fortland Bridge".|$|E

5000|$|The film {{begins with}} a headmaster's voice telling {{a large group of}} {{children}} he knows some of them have been playing on the railway with a young boy sitting on a railway <b>bridge</b> <b>wall.</b> As he ponders on his thoughts, he considers the idea of holding a school Sports Day-style event on the railway line. The rest of the film shows his imagined idea of what would happen, with children being split into four competitive teams to take part in different activities often carried out by young people trespassing on the railway. Three [...] "games" [...] are held, in which the children are challenged to break through the fence surrounding the railway line, play [...] "chicken" [...] with the trains and throw things at passing trains. Each time we see the tragic consequences of these activities, such as one scene where a driver and passenger are left badly injured by broken glass after a child throws a brick through the train window. The final task is for the children to run through a tunnel, but after they enter, we see a train approaching. Only four children cross the end of the tunnel, each of them injured terribly. One boy who crosses the finish line collapses as the overhead speaker announces the final results. The film finishes as a group of adults appear and go into the tunnel to carry out the bodies of the dead and injured children, which are then laid out in a long line along the railway track. The camera pans out to show all the dead and bloodied children along the track before returning to the boy sitting on the railway <b>bridge</b> <b>wall,</b> who seems to be reconsidering the idea.|$|E
