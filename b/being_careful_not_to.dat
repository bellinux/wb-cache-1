25|$|Beginning in the Middle Ages, manuals of {{confession}} {{emerged as}} a literary genre. These manuals were guidebooks on how to obtain the maximum benefits from the sacrament. There were two kinds of manuals: those addressed to the faithful, {{so that they could}} prepare a good confession, and those addressed to the priests, who had to make sure that no sins were left unmentioned and the confession was as thorough as possible. The priest had to ask questions, while <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> suggest sins that perhaps the faithful had not thought of and give them ideas. Manuals were written in Latin and in the vernacular.|$|E

Sticks one foot length are held in each hand and beaten to make a sharp, rasping sound as the dance {{proceeds}} with unique steps, twisting and turning. It is danced by both men and women, during festivals, auspicious days and weddings. The special qualities of the dance are quickness, alertness, while <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hurt the other dancers by the swinging 'kol'. Earlier, the 'kols' were brightly painted and decorated with brass rings, bells etc. The dancers used to wear ankle-bells. However, no special dress or make up was used for this dance.|$|E

After initially <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> offend sensitivities of Islamic scholars who feared Pancasila might develop into a quasi-religious cult, Suharto secured a parliamentary resolution in 1983 which obliged all organisations in Indonesia to adhere to Pancasila as basic principle. He also instituted mandatory Pancasila training programs for all Indonesians, from primary school students to office workers. In practice, however, the vagueness of Pancasila was exploited by Suharto's government to justify their actions and to condemn their opponents as [...] "anti-Pancasila".|$|E

5000|$|Many {{cruise lines}} {{allocate}} cabins for dance host programs. Dance hosts {{are expected to}} socialize with passengers and dance with the female passengers, who happen to greatly outnumber male passengers on most cruises. Dance hosts must be present nightly at dance floor locations and [...] "work the room", offering a dance to each unescorted female passenger, while <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> show favoritism.They are also responsible for attending all ship-sponsored parties and are often asked to host tables at dinner time. They serve as general companions, making conversation and joining in for shipboard activities and games. All the while, romance is not involved, so these gentlemen must have their wits and tact about them. Crossing another passenger's cabin threshold can result in disembarkation.

2500|$|Another {{reason for}} his {{criticism}} of the Origin, some historians claim, was that Owen felt upstaged by Darwin and supporters such as Huxley, and his judgment was clouded by jealousy. Owen in Darwin's opinion was [...] "Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about". [...] "It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me". Owen also resorted to the same subterfuge he used against Mantell, writing another anonymous article in the Edinburgh Review in April 1860. In the article, Owen was critical of Darwin for not offering many new observations, and heaped praise (in the third person) upon himself, while <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> associate any particular comment with his own name.

While the other bears flee {{to the safety of}} their cave, Humphrey is left outside and is forced to hide in a nearby cabin instead. Once inside the cabin, Humphrey is horrified to learn that it is a hunting lodge, made evident by the many guns and hunting trophies hanging on the walls. As he starts to leave, he sees Donald Duck coming toward the cabin {{carrying}} a rifle. Humphrey desperately looks for a hiding place inside the cabin, and finally notices a large bear skin rug in front of the fireplace. He quickly rolls up the rug, stows it in an empty trunk, and lays out flat {{on the floor in the}} rug's place. Just then, Donald enters unaware that his rug has been replaced, or that it is alive.

40|$|One of the paradoxes facing {{all mankind}} is its {{inability}} to supply the world population with enough healthful, nutritious food, although it has the technological, human, and financial ability to do so. Today, the world has more resources and know-how and is better armed than ever to attack the problems posed by infectious diseases, low productivity, and lack of energy sources and nonpolluting means of transportation, {{as well as the}} absence of basic services, such as potable water, sanitary facilities, schools, and health care infrastructures. The basic question is how best to use these resources and skills to further reduce the number of individuals living in extreme poverty, more than 1. 2 billion people. This paradox is the basis for this study on the challenge of hunger in West Africa and the regional strategies that must be used in the end to achieve food security in this region. Food and nutritional security remain one of the basic challenges in West Africa that we must face. The whole question is how to meet this challenge. Our study tries to provide part of the answer to this question. To do so, we reviewed the many aspects and the true causes of the phenomenon of hunger. But before that, we tried to be clear about the terms used in our study, <b>being</b> particularly <b>careful</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> confuse famine and malnutrition, on one hand, and famine and food insecurity, on the other.

50|$|For {{removal of}} a small tumor, it is {{accessed}} through one nostril. However, for larger tumors, access through both nostrils is required and the posterior nasal septum must be removed. Then the surgeon slides the endoscope into the nasal choana until the sphenoid ostium is found. Then the mucosa around the ostium is cauterized for microadenomas and removed completely for macroadenomas. Then the endoscope enters the ostium and meets the sphenoid rostrum where the mucosa is retracted from this structure and {{is removed from the}} sphenoid sinus to open the surgical pathway. At this point, imaging and Doppler devices are used to define the important structures. Then the floor of the sella turcica is opened with a high speed drill <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> pierce the dura mater. Once the dura is visible, it is cut with microscissors for precision. If the tumor is small, the tumor can be removed by an en bloc procedure, which consists of cutting the tumor into many sections for removal. If the tumor is larger, the center of the tumor is removed first, then the back, then the sides, then top of the tumor {{to make sure that the}} arachnoid membrane does not expand into the surgical view. This will happen if the top part of the tumor is taken out too early. After tumor removal, CSF leaks are tested for with fluorescent dye, and if there are no leaks, the patient is closed.|$|R
40|$|The idea that, {{within a}} family, one child prefers to act {{differently}} is {{a recurring theme}} in children’s books. This story features Mama Cat and her three kittens, Fluffy, Skinny, and Boris. Mama Cat does {{the things that you}} would expect a cat do, wash her paws, walk on stone walls, sharpen her claws, chase leaves, dig in sand, and take the proverbial “cat-nap. ” Fluffy and Skinny stay close to Mama Cat and copy what she does. Boris, on the other hand, seems to take little interest in Mama Cat’s activities – preferring to snooze. Eventually, Mama Cat, Fluffy, and Skinny tire – and now its Boris’s turn! The book ends with a playful plot twist that is sure to be a hit with the toddlers for whom the book is intended. The book’s simple phrases break down the action, using repetition to lead children to anticipate the next event. When being read out loud, the reader can easily engage children to participate by asking them what they think will happen next. This approach will add drama and heighten the enjoyment of the surprise ending. Beautifully illustrated (covered more in detail later in this paper), each picture not only features the cats, but contains trios of other creatures including: caterpillars, ladybugs, snails, and bumblebees.

In his early appearances, McArdle drops {{by the close}} unannounced to get Barry and Terry {{to do a job}} for him requesting, for instance, they valet his car to rid the back seat of what McArdle described as 'pig's blood'. In a stronger storyline, (and one of Brooksides first sensational ones) under instructions from Tommy McArdle the two provide an alibi for the perpetrators of an armed robbery. Local fireman and neighbour George Jackson is convicted for this crime instead, the key evidence being that he (foolishly) drew a map of the warehouse for McArdle, who used him for his knowledge of the place. In another scam, Barry and Terry enter in a counterfeit video deal with McArdle, (which also sees Barry briefly involved with Lucy Collins - daughter of residents Paul and Annabelle). This particular job goes wrong for Barry; despite <b>being</b> <b>careful</b> <b>to</b> <b>not</b> cross McArdle it ends in the beating of Barry and Terry within an inch of their lives in the tool hire shop that they run. Barry typically makes a quick recovery, but Terry is seriously hurt and spends a long time in hospital and for a while afterwards walks with a limp. The McArdle beating one is too much for Barry to try to get revenge on and so sensing he has no friends or future in Liverpool, Barry takes a job as a shop fitter, a job that takes him all around the country.|$|R

This essay describes a workshop designed to introduce these ideas to interested individuals of vary-ing degrees of mathematical and theological sophistication. Created by a retired minister and former math professor, the workshop details five sets of interactive exercises culled from game theory, theoretical complexity, fuzzy logic, basic al-gebra, and simple arithmetic. Exercises are user-friendly, interactive, and easily related by analogy to various social issues. I am a retired Unitarian Universalist minister who loves mathematics; I even used to teach it. When I gave up my position {{as the head of the}} math program at an undergraduate women’s college to attend seminary, I took my interest in math with me. Subsequently I wrote about the relation-ship between math and religion for my doctoral thesis, work which was later published as What Number Is God?, a volume in SUNY’s series in Western Esoteric Traditions [22].
