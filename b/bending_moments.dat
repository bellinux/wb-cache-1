5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by <b>bending</b> <b>moments,</b> representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping.|$|E
25|$|After {{determining}} the minimum {{cross section of}} the members, the last step in the design of a truss would be detailing of the bolted joints, e.g., involving shear stress of the bolt connections used in the joints. Based on the needs of the project, truss internal connections (joints) can be designed as rigid, semi rigid, or hinged. Rigid connections can allow transfer of <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> leading to development of secondary <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> in the members.|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} conditions have a considerable {{effect on the}} critical load of slender columns. The {{boundary conditions}} determine the mode of bending of the column and the distance between inflection points on the displacement curve of the deflected column. The inflection points in the deflection shape of the column are the points at which the curvature of the column changes sign and are also the points at which the column's internal <b>bending</b> <b>moments</b> of the column are zero. The closer the inflection points are, the greater the resulting axial load capacity (bucking load) of the column.|$|E

As the soil stiffness increases from 0.8 to 8  MPa (i.e., the modular ratio decreases from 50 to 5), {{the value of the}} <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> {{at the center of the}} strip footing decreases by 60.8 %.

25|$|The Vierendeel truss is a {{structure}} where the members are not triangulated but form rectangular openings, {{and is a}} frame with fixed joints {{that are capable of}} transferring and resisting <b>bending</b> <b>moments.</b> As such, it does not fit the strict definition of a truss (since it contains non-two-force members); regular trusses comprise members that are commonly assumed to have pinned joints, with the implication that no moments exist at the jointed ends. This style of structure was named after the Belgian engineer Arthur Vierendeel, who developed the design in 1896. Its use for bridges is rare due to higher costs compared to a triangulated truss.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental {{study on the}} identification of moving vehicle axle loads on a continuous supported bridge {{based on the measured}} <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> responses. A bridge-vehicle system model was fabricated in the laboratory. The bridge was modeled as a three span continuous supported beam and the vehicle was modeled as a vehicle model with two-axle loads. A number of strain gauges were adhered to the bottom surface of the beam to measure the <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> responses. Using measured <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> responses as an input, the inverse problem was solved to identify moving loads. The moving forces were identified when considering <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> responses from all spans of the beam and only one span respectively. The rebuilt responses were reconstructed from the identified loads as a forward problem. To study the accuracy of the method the relative percentage errors were calculated with respect to the measured and the rebuilt <b>bending</b> <b>moment</b> responses.
