500|$|MacFarlane has a {{baritone}} voice. He is {{a pianist}} and singer who, {{in his early}} years, trained with Lee and Sally Sweetland, the vocal coaches of Barbra Streisand and Frank Sinatra. In an interview with NPR, MacFarlane commented on their vocal training, to which he said [...] "They really drill you," [...] he said. [...] "They teach you the old-style way of singing, back when you had no electronic help. ... show your teeth. If you look at old photos of Sinatra while he's singing, there's {{a lot of very}} exposed teeth. That was something that Lee Sweetland hit on day in and day out, and correctly so, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> brightens the whole performance." [...] His comedy influences include people like Woody Allen, Jackie Gleason, Mel Brooks, and the creators of Monty Python. While his musical influences include people like Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Vic Damone, Johnny Mercer, Bing Crosby, Bobby Darin, Gordon MacRae, and the Rat Pack.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her ace in the hole, the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no one out there who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, he understands that this move is going to mean that she's probably not going to fare that well in this trial. So it's a pretty devastating moment for Cersei, and you see that in her reaction, and partly <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> bodes so ill for this coming trial, and partly because it's her own son who's really betrayed her." ...|$|E
500|$|The band made {{extensive}} use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)" [...] feature natural reverberation achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and [...] "Let Down" [...] was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band {{to work at a}} different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that [...] "the biggest pressure was actually completing [...] We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." [...] Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without audio separation, meaning that instruments were not overdubbed separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: [...] "I hate doing overdubs, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> doesn't feel natural.... Something special happens when you're playing live; {{a lot of it is}} just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen." [...] Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would [...] "start to think about it and it would sound really lame." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on to me about it or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E
500|$|Gard was keen to animate the {{character}} realistically, an aspect {{he felt the}} industry at the time had disregarded. He sacrificed quick animations in favour of more fluid movement, believing that players would empathise with {{the character}} more easily. Lara's dual-wielding of pistols {{was inspired by the}} film Hard Boiled and an Æon Flux short. In the first Tomb Raider, Croft's three-dimensional (3D) character model is made of around 230polygons. The character's braid was removed from the model, but added back for subsequent iterations. Gavin Rummery, programmer on the first two Tomb Raider games, explained, [...] "It had been dropped from the original <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> didn't work properly with all the acrobatic moves – it was more like she had an electric eel attached to her head that had a life of its own. But on TRII I came {{up with a way to}} get it working and was really pleased how natural it looked." [...] There is a misconception that, while adjusting the character model, Gard accidentally increased the breasts' dimensions by 150 percent and the rest of the creative team argued to keep the change. Gard, however, has stated thasich notion [...] "came out of a silly remark made in an interview". Core Design hired Shelley Blond to voice Croft after the game entered the beta phase of development. Gard left Core Design after completing Tomb Raider, citing a lack of creative freedom and control over marketing decisions related to the ideas he developed (especially Lara Croft).|$|E
500|$|The Open Door took 18 {{months to}} write. The new songs {{were written by}} Lee and Balsamo, who share credits for nine songs. Lee was the sole writer of [...] "Like You", [...] "Lithium" [...] and [...] "Good Enough", and co-wrote [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] with guitarist John LeCompt. The singer confessed that after Moody's {{departure}} she had nobody to hold her back {{in the writing process}} and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been able to just sit and write music with somebody and not be afraid of what they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities". She said it was only about [...] "writing great music".|$|E

It was {{recorded}} during a live show at Today FM and released in the 2004 covers compilation, Even Better than the Real Thing Vol. 2. It was also covered in Mandarin by Taiwanese girl group S.H.E and released on their studio album Encore (2004). Their version was retitled [...] "Bié Shuō Duìbùqǐ" [...] ( [...] "Don't Say Sorry"). American pop rock singer Sally Maer also covered [...] "Everytime" [...] to release it on her studio album Bed of Roses (2008). [...] "Everytime" [...] was used during the 2009 Irish production of the 1896 play The Seagull. Jackie Evancho covered the song for her debut album Prelude to a Dream (2009). On August 19, 2010, her version debuted at number three on Billboards Classical Digital Songs chart. British singer Cher Lloyd covered the song live on The X Factor in the United Kingdom in 2010. This caused the song to re entry the top 50 singles chart in the UK.| On July 27, 2012, Kelly Clarkson covered the song during the Las Vegas stop of her summer tour, as an audience request. Clarkson had a harpist accompany her during the performance, and told the audience, [...] "This song {{is one of my}} favourite songs. [...] I actually prefer [...] version better, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> sounds really sad, but I'm going to try and do it." [...] Spears approved of Clarkson's cover via her Twitter account, calling it [...] "beautiful". [...] "Everytime" [...] was also covered on the American series Glee episode [...] "Britney 2.0" [...] by the character Marley Rose (played by Melissa Benoist); her rendition was rated a B by TVLine's Michael Slezak. In July 2016, the song {{was covered by}} YouTube personality Trisha Paytas.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{reconstruction}} was generally considered an architectural triumph, Erith was disappointed. He complained openly {{during and after}} the project that the government had altered his design to save money. Erith described the numbers on the front, intended to be based on historical models, as 'a mess' and 'completely wrong' to a fellow historian. [...] "I am heart broken", he said, [...] "by the result... the whole project has been a frightful waste of money <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> has not been done properly. The Ministry of Works has insisted on economy after economy. I am bitterly disappointed with what has happened".|$|E

2500|$|In a 2002 {{interview}} with Anthony DeCurtis, Tweedy noted that, {{of all of}} the songs that Uncle Tupelo recorded throughout their career, [...] "Sandusky" [...] holds a special place for him:"Sandusky" [...] is probably the track that I'm most proud of. [...] It's an instrumental, it was a real collaboration and it just kind of came out of us in the studio, real improvised natural music, very simple. I think it's beautiful. [...] I also don't feel I was that much a part of it, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> happened, and maybe that makes it easier to listen to it. That's the one that sticks out in my mind the most.|$|E
2500|$|Animal vocal {{signals are}} for the most part {{intrinsically}} reliable. When a cat purrs, the signal constitutes direct evidence of the animal's contented state. One can [...] "trust" [...] the signal not because the cat is inclined to be honest, but <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> can't fake that sound. Primate vocal calls may be slightly more manipulable, but they remain reliable for the same reason— because they are hard to fake. Primate social intelligence is Machiavellian— self-serving and unconstrained by moral scruples. Monkeys and apes often attempt to deceive one another, {{while at the same time}} constantly on guard against falling victim to deception themselves. Paradoxically, it is precisely primates' resistance to deception that blocks the evolution of their vocal communication systems along language-like lines. Language is ruled out because the best way to guard against being deceived is to ignore all signals except those that are instantly verifiable. Words automatically fail this test.|$|E
2500|$|G-Unit member Tony Yayo has {{alleged that}} Ghostface had a ghostwriter for his {{critically}} acclaimed album Supreme Clientele. In {{an interview with}} Spin magazine, Yayo claimed that Far Rockaway native Lord Superb, who guested on the album, wrote a majority, if not all, of the lyrics. In an interview with hiphopdx.com Raekwon, who also appears on the album, responded saying: [...] "He [...] know damn well he [...] ain’t write that fuckin’ album. I don’t even wanna get into shit like that, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> makes me upset that muthafuckas be running they mouth all kinda ways.

[...] However, in a November 2007 interview with Rhapsody Music, Ghost responded with [...] "...'Perb [...] is Rae’s [...] man. He been in the studio a few times while we’re doing shit. He ain’t write shit. All ‘Perb contributed was a couple of lines that you could put in the air. When we write, we all do that.

6000|$|She {{had still}} met it in naming so promptly, for their early convenience, {{one of the}} great museums; and indeed with such happy art that his fully seeing where she had placed him hadn't been till after he left her. His absence from her for so many weeks had had such an effect upon him that his demands, his desires had grown; and only the night before, as his ship steamed, beneath summer stars, in sight of the Irish coast, he had felt all the force of his {{particular}} necessity. He hadn't in other words at any point doubted {{he was on his way}} to say to her that really their mistake must end. Their mistake was to have believed that they could hold out--hold out, that is, not against Aunt Maud, but against an impatience that, prolonged and exasperated, made a man ill. He had known more than ever, on their separating in the court of the station, how ill a man, and even a woman, could feel from such a cause; but he struck himself as also knowing that he had already suffered Kate to begin finely to apply antidotes and remedies and subtle sedatives. It had a vulgar sound--as throughout, in love, the names of things, the verbal terms of intercourse, were, compared with love itself, horribly vulgar; but it was as if, after all, he might have come back to find himself [...] "put off," [...] though it would take him of course a day or two to see. His letters from the States had pleased whom it concerned, though not so much as he had meant they should; and he should be paid according to agreement and would now take up his money. It wasn't in truth very much to take up, so that he hadn't in the least come back flourishing a cheque-book; that new motive for bringing his mistress to terms he couldn't therefore pretend to produce. The ideal certainty would have been to be able to present a change of prospect as a warrant for the change of philosophy, and without it he should have to make shift but with the pretext of the lapse of time. The lapse of time--not so many weeks after all, she might always of course say--couldn't at any rate have failed to do something for him; and that consideration it was that had just now tided him over, all the more that he had his vision of what it had done personally for Kate. This had come out for him with a splendour that almost scared him even in their small corner of the room at Euston--almost scared him <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> seemed to blaze at him that waiting was the game of dupes. Not yet had she been so the creature he had originally seen; not yet had he felt so soundly safely sure. It was all there for him, playing on his pride of possession as a hidden master in a great dim church might play on the grandest organ. His final sense was that a woman couldn't be like that and then ask of one the impossible.|$|E
