At Blumenthal's urging, MySpace installed a link to free <b>blocking</b> <b>software</b> ("K9 Web Protection"); however, in May 2006, Blumenthal announced that the site had failed to make the program easy to find and that it was not clearly labeled. Blumenthal also urged MySpace to take further steps to safeguard children, including purging deep links to pornography and inappropriate material, tougher age verification, and banning users under 16.|$|E
