500|$|Chris Carabott of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 7.7, praising the {{performances}} by {{the actors and}} how well characters were contrasted. The TV Critic gave the episode a rating of 63/100, saying that its [...] "good intrigue from the writers <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know more about Kate and what she did", while also stating that the [...] "lack of action may affect some who are hooked on 24's style of relentless developments and tension." [...] Josh Wolk rated [...] "Tabula Rasa" [...] a B+, saying that [...] "Kate's story is intriguing, though she's still not quite believable as a fugitive badass." ...|$|E

Squad members included Cecilia Bangura, Jarriatu Kamara, Hannah Conteh, Haja Kamara, Magret Sesay, Sarah Bangura, Fatmata Turay, Fatmata Mansaray, Kaju Max-Macauley, Aminata Lebbe, Zainab Sesay, Alice Bundor, Adama Sesay, Rashidatu Kamara, Isata Kamara, Wuyiah Muwaid, Nasu Bundor, and Assanatu Jalloh. The cost of travel {{for the team}} was paid for by LEOCEM, the country's only cement company. The company's managing director rationalised the decision to pay saying, [...] "We received the request from the SLFA at a very short notice but we decided to help <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see female football grow from the grass-roots level and also to meet our corporate social responsibility. We are happy about helping out the female team and we hope they'll eliminate their Gambian counterpart." [...] Members of the under-17 team are drawn from the Airtel Rising Stars tournament.|$|E
500|$|After this album, {{the group}} planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career to {{facilitate}} their solo careers. Beyoncé {{has noted that}} their destinies were already fulfilled; however, Destiny's Child claimed that naming the album Destiny Fulfilled was not a coincidence. Beyoncé has said that [...] "the group felt it still had something to offer musically" [...] with the album before adding: [...] "We did this record for ourselves, not to sell a million the first week out... That doesn't mean as much to us as {{just the fact that}} three friends got back together to do another record. That was our destiny.". Rowland commented: [...] "We were like, 'You know what, we're getting older and we want to end on a high note.' We want to give our fans a great final record". Beyoncé, also commented regarding the finality of their career: [...] "Who knows what will happen in three, five or 10years? The main thing is that we maintain our friendship and that we do it <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> – not because it's a good business move." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{romance novels}} {{featuring}} African-Americans and Hispanic protagonists {{are becoming more}} popular, those featuring Asian or Asian-American characters are rare. Author Tess Gerritsen believes {{this is due to}} the fact that there are fewer Asian-American women who read romances: [...] "We read romances <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> feel good about love...in order to do that, the reader must identify with the heroine." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{statement}} {{ended with}} these words: [...] "We {{are not doing}} this <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> fight. We are not doing this because we think that is funny {{to see what the}} inside of a jail cell looks like, nor because we like the sound of riot police in the streets or the taste of teargas. We are doing this because any other alternative would mean bowing down to the pigs who hide behind their desks and try to control ours and other peoples lives!" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{hypothesis}} that caste amounts to race has {{been rejected by}} some scholars. Ambedkar, for example, wrote that [...] "The Brahmin of Punjab is racially of the same stock as the Chamar of Punjab. The Caste system does not demarcate racial division. The Caste system is a social division of people of the same race." [...] Various sociologists, anthropologists and historians have rejected the racial origins and racial emphasis of caste and consider the idea to be one that has purely political and economic undertones. Beteille writes that [...] "the Scheduled Castes of India taken together are no more a race than are the Brahmins taken together. Every social group cannot {{be regarded as a}} race simply <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> protect it against prejudice and discrimination", and that the 2001 Durban conference on racism hosted by the U.N. is [...] "turning its back on established scientific opinion".|$|E
5000|$|In January 2015, Hit the Lights {{announced}} {{the title and}} release date for the album. A few days later they premiered the first track off the album, [...] "Fucked Up Kids," [...] along with the track listing. Leading up to its release, the band premiered more songs including [...] "The Real" [...] and [...] "No Filter" [...] to build anticipation. The band announced on Twitter that they [...] "wrote Invicta <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> push ourselves. <b>We</b> wrote Summer Bones <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> rip shit. <b>We</b> stand by both." ...|$|R

2500|$|In November 2014 {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{in the aftermath}} of Operation Onymous that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: [...] "This is something we want to keep for ourselves. The way we do this, we can’t share with the whole world, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it again and again and again." [...] A BBC source cited a [...] "technical breakthrough" [...] that allowed the tracking of the physical location of servers, and the number of sites that police initially claimed to have infiltrated led to speculation that a weakness in the Tor network had been exploited. This possibility was downplayed by Andrew Lewman, a representative of the not-for-profit Tor project, suggesting that execution of more traditional police work was more likely. However, in November 2015 court documents on the matter generated serious ethical security research as well as Fourth Amendment concerns.|$|E
2500|$|From 1891 to 1900, Everhard {{served as}} {{president}} of the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1894, she led the successful effort to secure school suffrage for Ohio women. She also gained for Ohio women the right to vote in municipal elections. She was among the suffrage activists who spoke at a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington D. C. in 1896, led by Susan B. Anthony. Everhard's remarks gave her reasons for activism:You probably wonder, even if you have not asked, why we are not at home looking after our families instead of coming to Washington to pester you. It is just <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take better care of our homes that we have come. I for one pay enough in taxes every year to buy a farm and yet I have no right to say how they shall be collected or how expended. It is a mistake to say that women do not want the ballot, for in Ohio, where we have been given school suffrage, interest has grown rapidly, and now women who at first did not even want school suffrage have been educated into being full-fledged suffragists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Monty, {{who left}} the series in 1986, {{returned}} in 1991 with the hope she would again raise the ratings of the show. She brought Geary back to General Hospital that same year as Luke's look-alike cousin, Bill Eckert. The actor had refused {{to return to the}} show as Luke without Laura. The unpopularity of the Bill Eckert character led to ABC's firing Monty, killing off Bill, and bringing Luke and Laura back, played by Geary and Francis. Upon their return, the actors took more control of the writing for their characters. Geary, along with a writer friend, Irene Suver, developed the story for Luke and Laura's return. Geary's contract allowed him to rewrite his dialogue at his discretion. Francis and Geary were also known for fighting over story direction with executive producer Wendy Riche and the show's writers. The departure of head writer Richard Culliton days after a tense meeting with Geary caused rumors to circulate that the actor threatened to quit if Culliton were not fired. [...] "The meeting did not go well, but I made no ultimatums and there was certainly no violence," [...] Geary said. [...] "I really don't know if I {{had anything to do with}} his departure, but I wouldn't shed any tears if I did." [...] Francis supported Geary in what they considered to be standing up for the [...] "integrity" [...] of their characters and protecting the [...] "Spencer franchise." [...] "Sometimes people think we're difficult because of that, but we're only difficult <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> live up to the high standards we've set," [...] Francis said. [...] "I actually like it when Tony gets out of line... He can go to horrid places I can't." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Greenwood, {{he began}} playing bass out of necessity, {{teaching}} himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. He said: [...] "We {{were people who}} picked up their respective instruments <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play music together, rather than just <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> play that particular instrument. So {{it was more of}} a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool. I don’t think of myself as a bass player anyway. I’m just in a band with other people." [...] Among his musical influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is their}} only album in English rather than German. Singer Gabi Delgado-López later noted: [...] "So <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> break our own rules and said: OK, {{so now we}} sing in English, now we don’t wear black. (laughing) With purpose. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> break our own rules." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{finally settled}} on a {{take-off}} of the rather negative phrase {{that had been used}} to describe Radcliffe women for ages.

6000|$|... "We don't leave <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to,</b> {{but because}} we HAVE to," [...] replied Mrs. Quack, [...] "and we go back {{just as soon as}} we can. What {{would you do if you}} couldn't find a single thing to eat?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a promotional}} interview, Rob Bourdon stated: [...] "We wanted {{a group of}} songs that would sit well {{together}} <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a record that you could pop into your CD player and, from beginning to end, there would never be a spot where you start daydreaming." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hollander said: [...] "we <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> define {{ourselves}} {{in opposition to}} the cliché of a country vicar, partly <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> depict England as it is now, rather than having a sort of bucolic-y, over the hills and far away, bird-tweeting England - <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> the complications of the multi-cultural, multi-ethnic inner-city, where everything is much harder." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his later}} years Moody devoted {{much of his time}} to his work on the board of {{directors}} of Moody Gardens. He was quoted in the Houston Chronicle as saying, [...] "I originally conceived the project of the gardens <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> use the gardens to give this community another source of income" ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Oceans" [...] was {{performed}} in open D tuning. The song is musically and texturally {{different from the rest}} of the album.

5000|$|Delgado and Görl reunited in 1985 {{to record}} 1st Step to Heaven, their only album in English, which {{achieved}} {{one week in}} the Swedish album chart at no. 46.

6000|$|... "Oh, {{how can one}} {{explain a}} change in sun and moon and everybody's soul?" [...] cried Rosamund, in despair. [...] "Must I confess we had got so morbid as to think him mad merely because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get married; and that we didn't even know it was only <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get married ourselves?

6000|$|... 'There's {{only one}} economy which I don't think is justifiable,' said he, 'and that is, {{to cut down}} your {{subscriptions}} to charities. It is such a very cheap way of doing things. Not that I do much in that line--too little, perhaps. But to say that <b>because</b> <b>WE</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> economise, therefore some poor people are to suffer, is a very poor argument. We must save at our own expense.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You're all right,' he said. 'The {{hot weather}} has given you that tired feeling. What {{you want is}} a change of air. We will pop down {{together}} hand in hand this week-end to some seaside resort. You shall build sand castles, while I lie {{on the beach and}} read the paper. In the evening we will listen to the band, or stroll on the esplanade, not so much <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to,</b> as to give the natives a treat. Possibly, if the weather continues warm, we may even paddle. A vastly exhilarating pastime, I am led to believe, and so strengthening for the ankles. And on Monday morning we will return, bronzed and bursting with health, to our toil once more.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} would, {{and that is}} just what we would do, if we didn't take the long journey south when Jack Frost freezes {{everything}} tight up there where my home is," [...] returned Mrs. Quack. [...] "He comes earlier up there and stays twice as long as he does here, and makes ten times as much ice and snow. We get most of our food in the water or in the mud under the water, as of course you know, and when the water is frozen, there isn't a scrap of anything we can get to eat. We just HAVE to come south.
