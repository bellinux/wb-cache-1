The SOI wafer contains three layers- a 400 μm thick “handle” layer of silicon followed by a 2 μm thick oxide layer topped with a 20 μm thick “device” layer of silicon. The embedded oxide layer acts as an etch-stop during silicon etching, leaving a thin membrane of consistent thickness on the device side. The device dimensions were chosen to provide acceptable membrane deflection predicted by calculations and Finite Element Analysis. A microfabrication process plan was designed to produce thin membranes appropriate for electrostatic actuation. A 700 nm layer of silicon dioxide was grown {{on both sides of}} the SOI wafer to be used as a mask during silicon etching.

Here, a simple technique is reported to produce free-standing TiO 2 nanotubular membranes with through-hole morphology. It consists in a 3 -step anodization procedure carried out at room temperature on a Ti foil. The first anodization (1 h at 80 V) is used to pattern the surface of the metallic foil. Then, the second anodization (24 h at 80 V) produces the array of TiO 2 nanotubes that will constitute the final membrane. A higher voltage anodization (3 - 5 minutes at 180 V) is finally applied to detach the TiO 2 nanotubular layer from the underlying Ti foil. In order to completely remove the barrier layer that obstructs some pores of the membrane, the latter is etched 2 minutes in a <b>buffered</b> oxide <b>etch</b> solution.

To achieve downstream cleanliness, filters must be manufactured in clean environments and cleaned in postmanufacture pmcesses, which also add to cost. This article examines these issues and describes the testing of filtration devices for recirculated <b>buffered</b> oxide <b>etch</b> (BOE) applications. Here, flow rate and freedom from particles are very important and, due to the high surface tension and low gas solubility of many etch bath formulations, fdter wettability is also signifcant. Figure 1. Recirculation etch bath system. Treated polysulfone Recirculating etch baths BOE solutions are used extensively in silicon processing to remove oxide layers while leaving Si unaffected. A traditional BOE bath consists of 7 :l 40 % ammonium fluoride, 49 % HF [l]. More recent fondations use lower concentrations of ammonium fluoride, which results in an unsaturated solution with lower surface tension [21. Buffered oxide etching is often accomplished in recirculating etch baths (REB) (Fig. 1). Fluid in the tank flows over a weir into the suction of a pump (either a singlestage centrifugal pump or a positive displacement diaphragm pump), through a particle-removing filter, back into the tank through eductors {{in the bottom of the}} tank, and then up past the wafers to complete the loop...|$|R
40|$|High {{peak power}} laser systems, such as National Ignition Facility (NIF), Laser Mega Joule (LMJ), and High Power laser Energy Research {{facility}} (HiPER), include {{a large amount}} of optics. Fused silica glass {{is one of the most}} common optical materials which is used in these high peak power laser systems owing to its excellent optical properties, especially for the 355 nm ultraviolet laser. However, it is generally found that fused silica optics damage under irradiation with a high peak power laser beam, and the laser induced damage (LID) becomes the limit to increasing the laser power. Theoretically, the laser induced damage threshold (LIDT) of fused silica substrates is high, while it drops significantly due to the poor surface quality created in the manufacturing process. This project aims to find a series of fused silica optical surface processing techniques which are able to improve the surface quality and increase its LIDT when irradiated using high peak power lasers. This work consists of the following contents： 1. 	According to the mechanisms of LID, the effects of surface structural defects and contaminants on the LID are analysed and some simulation work is done. 2. 	By means of the Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF) method, surface structural defects, i. e. surface and sub-surface damage, are removed because the MRF method is a non-fracture polishing process. 3. 	Parameter optimisation in the MRF process is done by the Taguchi designing method. This optimisation mainly focuses on the surface roughness because it is also another factor that limits the LIDT. 4. 	Two post polishing treatments, Ion Beam Etching (IBE) and a HF-based etching process (<b>buffered</b> oxide <b>etch</b> (BOE)), are used in this work to remove contaminants left by the former polishing steps (conventional polishing and MRF processes). 5. 	A series of LIDT tests are done to verify the validity of the above work. Results show that the MRF process, BOE etching and IBE treatment are all useful in improving the LIDT of fused silica optics. The main contribution to knowledge of this work is that this work provides a series of processing techniques to increase the LIDT of fused silica optics. These techniques involve the MRF procedure, IBE method and BOE etching in sequence after the conventional grinding and lapping processes. These processing techniques are validated by several groups of LIDT tests...|$|R
40|$|Selectively etched {{optical fibers}} {{were used as}} a {{template}} for fabrication of ultramicroelectrodes (UME), which are suitable {{for use as a}} probe in scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Multistep index optical fibers with high-GeO 2 -doped core and two cladding layers were chemically etched to a sharp point (10 nm in diameter) in NH 4 F/HF <b>buffer</b> solutions. The <b>etched</b> fibers had a defined geometry and the etching process was highly reproducible. After etching, a layer of gold was sputtered on the fibers. The Au-coated fibers were then insulated by electrophoretic paint. The size and shape of the electrodes were determined by steady-state cyclic voltammetry and SECM. The SECM tip current-distance (approach) curves over conductive and insulating substrates agreed with the theoretical curves obtained by numerical simulations, which proves a conical electrode geometry. The base radius and height of the conical electrodes determined by SECM were in the range of 0. 255 - 1. 0 and 0. 3 - 1. 2 ƒÝm, respectively. In order to fabricate electrodes within 200 nm in radius using selectively etched optical fiber as the template, we tried several approaches: (1) Using focused ion beam (FIB) milling we could cut the gold-coated tip at desired size with nanometer precision. However, after electrophoretic paint deposition on FIB modified fibers, the apparent size of the electrode increased against our expectation from FIB, which indicated that gold exposed not only at the tip but also on the side-wall. (2) Insulating gold-coated probes by sputtering silicon oxide has been investigated...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years, {{researchers}} have explored {{the use of}} piezoresistive microcantilevers/resonators as gas sensors because of their relative ease in fabrication, low production cost, {{and their ability to}} detect changes in mass or surface stress with fairly good sensitivity. However, existing microcantilever designs rely on irreversible chemical reactions for detection and researchers have been unable to optimize symmetric geometries for increased sensitivity. Previous work by our group showed the capability of T-shaped piezoresistive cantilevers to detect gas composition using a nonreaction-based method – viscous damping. However, this geometry yielded only small changes in resistance. Recently, computational studies performed by our group indicated that optimizing the geometry of the base piezoresistor increases device sensitivity up to 700 times. Thus, the focus of this work is to improve the sensitivity of nonreaction-based piezoresistive microcantilevers by incorporating asymmetric piezoresistive sensing elements in a new array design. A three-mask fabrication process was performed using a 42 ̆ 2 silicon-on-insulator wafer. Gold bond pads and leads were patterned using two optical lithography masks, gold sputtering, and acetone lift-off techniques. The cantilevers were patterned with electron-beam lithography and a dry etch masking layer was then deposited via electronbeam evaporation of iron. Subsequently, the silicon device layer was deep reactive ion etched (DRIE) to create the vertical sidewalls and the sacrificial silicon dioxide layer was removed with a <b>buffered</b> oxide <b>etch,</b> completely releasing the cantilever structures. Finally, the device was cleaned and dried with critical point drying to prevent stiction of the devices to the substrate. For the resonance experiments, the cantilevers were driven electrostatically by applying an AC bias, 10 Vpp, to the gate electrode. A DC bias of 10 V was placed across the piezoresistor in series with a 14 kÙ resistor. The drive frequency (0 – 80 kHz) was swept until the cantilever resonated at its natural frequency, which occurred when the output of the lock-in amplifier reached its maximum. These devices have been actuated to resonance under vacuum and their resonant frequencies and Qfactors measured. The first mode of resonance for the asymmetric cantilevers was found to range between 40 kHz and 63 kHz, depending on the piezoresistor geometry and length of the cantilever beam. The redesigned piezoresistive microcantilevers tested yielded static and dynamic sensitivities ranging from 1 - 6 Ù/Ìm and 2 - 17 Ù/Ìm displacement, respectively, which are 40 – 730 times more sensitive than the best symmetric design previously reported by our group. Furthermore, the Q-factors ranged between 1700 and 4200, typical values for MEMS microcantilevers...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of Ge-Te-Sb (GST) thin films. The films were deposited using a Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) method and mainly characterized with XRD, SEM, AFM and TEM. For amorphous and polycrystalline films, un-etched Si(100) was used. The amorphous films showed a similar crystallization behavior as films deposited with sputtering and evaporation techniques. When depositing GST on un-etched Si(100) substrates at elevated substrate temperatures (130 - 240 °C), polycrystalline but highly textured films were obtained. The preferred growth orientation was either GST(111) or GST(0001) depending on if the films were cubic or hexagonal. Epitaxial films were prepared on crystalline substrates. On KCl(100), a mixed growth of hexagonal GST(0001) and cubic GST(100) was observed. The hexagonal phase dominates at low temperatures whereas the cubic phase dominates at high temperatures. The cubic phase is accompanied with a presumed GST(221) orientation when the film thickness exceeds ~ 70 nm. Epitaxial films were obtained with deposition rates as high as 250 nm/min. On BaF 2 (111), only (0001) oriented epitaxial hexagonal GST films are found, independent of substrate temperature, frequency or deposition background pressure. At high substrate temperatures there is a loss of Ge and Te which shifts the crystalline phase from Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 towards GeSb 2 Te 4. GST films deposited at room temperature on BaF 2 (111) were in an amorphous state, but after exposure to an annealing treatment they crystallize in an epitaxial cubic structure. Film deposition on pre-cleaned and <b>buffered</b> ammonium fluoride <b>etched</b> Si(111) show growth of epitaxial hexagonal GST, {{similar to that of}} the deposition on BaF 2 (111). When the Si-substrates were heated directly to the deposition temperature films of high crystal-line quality were obtained. An additional heat treatment of the Si-substrates prior to deposition deteriorated the crystal quality severely. The gained results show that PLD can be used as a method in order to obtain high quality epitaxial Ge-Sb-Te films from a compound target and using high deposition rates...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of Zn compounds as buffer layers was recently extended to wide gap CuInS 2 CIS based thin film solar cells. Using a new chemical deposition route for the buffer preparation aiming at the deposition {{of a single}} layer, nominal ZnS buffer {{without the need for}} any toxic reactants such as, e. g. hydrazine has helped to achieve a similar efficiency as respective CdS buffered reference devices. After identifying the deposited Zn compound, as ZnS Zn S,O bi layer buffer in former investigations [M. Bär, A. Ennaoui, J. Klaer, T. Kropp, R. S ez Araoz, N. Allsop, I. Lauermann, H. W. Schock, and M. C. Lux Steiner, Formation of a ZnS Zn S,O bilayer buffer on CuInS 2 thin film solar cell absorbers by chemical bath deposition, J. Appl. Phys., accepted. ], this time the focus lies on potential diffusion intermixing processes at the buffer absorber interface possibly, clarifying the effect of the heat treatment, which drastically enhances the device performance of respective final solar cells. The interface formation was investigated by x ray photoelectron and x ray excited Auger electron spectroscopy. In addition, photoelectron spectroscopy PES measurements were also conducted using tuneable monochromatized synchrotron radiation in order to gain depth resolved information. The buffer side of the buffer absorber heterointerface were investigated by means of the characterization of Zn S,O ZnS CIS structures where the ZnS Zn S,O bi layer buffer was deposited successively by different deposition times. In order to make the in terms of PES information depth deeply buried absorber side of the buffer absorber heterointerface accessible for characterization, in these cases the <b>buffer</b> layer was <b>etched</b> away by dilute HClaq. We found that while out leached Cu from the absorber layer forms together with the educts in the chemical bath a Zn 1 Z,Cu 2 Z S like interlayer between buffer and absorber, Zn is incorporated in the uppermost region of the absorber. Both effects are strongly enhanced by postannealing the Zn S,O ZnS CIS samples. However, it was determined that the major fraction of the Cu and Zn can be found quite close to the heterointerface in the buffer and absorber layer, respectively. Due to this limited in the range of one monolayer spatial extent, these diffusion mechanisms were rather interpreted as a CBD induced and heat treatment promoted Cu Zn ion exchange at the buffer absorber interface. Possible impacts of this intermixing on the performance of the final solar cell devices will also be discusse...|$|R
