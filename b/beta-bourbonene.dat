40|$|The {{composition}} of sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids in the solvent extract of extant, Miocene and Eocene dammar (i. e., Class II) resins {{has been determined}} and compared to investigate the vulnerability of these biomarkers to diagenesis. Molecular evidence (e. g., absence of bicadinanes) and low Rock-Eval maturity values (T-max < 400 degrees C) of the fossil resins indicate {{that they have not}} yet reached the catagenetic stage. Significant changes in the sesquiterpenoid {{composition of}} the fossilised compared to the modern dammars were evident, whereas the triterpenoid products reflected only minor differences. The major sesquiterpenoids in the extant resin are the essential oil components, alpha-copaene, <b>beta-bourbonene,</b> beta-elemene, beta-caryophyllene, germacrene D, germacrene B and spathulenol. In contrast, the major sesquiterpenoids in the fossilised resins were C- 15 cadalene-based compounds such as dihydro-or-curcumene, delta-selinene, beta-muurolene, calamenene, 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydrocadalene and cadalene. This difference indicates the susceptibility of the essential oils and the transformation of germacrene D and cadinenes to cadalene-based compounds (e. g. calamenene and 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydrocadalene, cadalene) during diagenesis. The triterpenoid assemblages in both fossil and extant resins were very similar with abundant beta- and alpha-amyrin in all resins. It was evident that beta-amyrin was more prone to diagenesis than alpha-amyrin. The terpenoid compositions of the fossil resins (cf. extant resin) clearly reveal the greater susceptibility of sesquiterpenoids to diagenetic alteration than pentacyclic triterpenoids.
