25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{required}} new safety equipment. A new energy-absorbing steering column {{was accompanied by}} an energy-absorbing steering wheel, padded instrument panel, non-protruding control knobs, and four-way emergency flashers. A shoulder belt option was also featured, and the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> was now a dual reservoir unit with a backup hydraulic circuit.|$|E
25|$|For 1967 all Fords {{featured}} a large, padded hub {{in the center}} of the plastic steering wheel, along with an energy-absorbing steering column (introduced late into the 1967 model year), padded interior surfaces, recessed controls on the instrument panel, and front outboard shoulder belt anchors. Another safety related change was the introduction of the dual <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> used on all subsequent Galaxies (and other Ford models).|$|E
2500|$|The dual-reservoir <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> with {{separate}} {{front and rear}} hydraulic systems, was introduced in 1962, six years ahead of the Federal requirement. [...] The first fully automatic heater-air conditioning system also appeared, as did the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission; it would become the GM standard model for several decades. [...] From the late 1960s, Cadillac offered a fiber-optic warning system to alert the driver to failed light bulbs. The use of extensive bright-work on the exterior and interior also decreased each year after 1959. By the 1966 model year, even the rear bumpers ceased to be all chrome – large portions were painted, including the headlight bezels.|$|E
50|$|Brakes were {{hydraulic}} {{and assisted}} by the Rolls-Royce mechanical servo with 11 in drums and suspension was independent coils {{at the front}} and semi-elliptic springs at the rear. Twin <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> were incorporated from April 1956.|$|R
50|$|Stock {{brake drums}} must be used, no disk <b>brakes.</b> Stock <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> must be used.|$|R
25|$|Drive train, {{front and}} rear suspension, <b>brakes,</b> radiators, <b>master</b> <b>cylinders,</b> trunnions, {{steering}} columns, power steering pumps, engines, transmissions, brake drums and rotors are interchangeable with 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors and Classics. Some parts are even interchangeable back to 1958 and earlier, while other components were used by AMC into the 1970s.|$|R
2500|$|The Skyline GT-R 'N1' model (identified by {{the model}} code suffix [...] "ZN"), was {{introduced}} on 19 July 1991, and designed for home-market N1 racing {{with a total}} of 245 units eventually produced (118 of these are 'N1', 64 are 'V·Spec N1', and 63 are 'V·Spec II N1' - see below explanation of 'V.spec'). The most notable change was in the engine, which was upgraded to the R32-N1 specification. Building on the 'Nismo' car's specification, it was also lightened by the removal of the ABS, and rear wiper, but for 'N1' the air conditioning, sound system, and boot carpet were also deleted, and distinctive light-weight headlights were fitted. 'N1' cars also had reinforcing for the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and additional brake cooling ducts under the car. All 'N1' cars were delivered with a thin layer of colour code 326 [...] "Crystal White" [...] paint.|$|E
2500|$|The Valiant was {{completely}} redesigned for 1967 model {{year and the}} station wagons, hardtops, and convertibles were dropped. Buyers who wanted a Valiant-type hardtop coupe or convertible could choose a similarly-styled Barracuda, which was still based on the Valiant with a slightly sportier style. [...] The new Valiant model range included 2- and 4-door sedans on a newly lengthened [...] wheelbase. The design was straightforward and rectilinear. The body sides were mildly sculptured with a tapering lower feature line that widened toward the wheels. The new fenders had a vertical slab look. The grille was vertically split and subdivided horizontally. Vertical taillights were segmented and had a fanned-out look. Horsepower rating for the [...] Slant-6 engine was raised from [...] to [...] by installation of the slightly bigger camshaft introduced on the 225 in 1965, together with Carter BBS and Holley 1920 carburetors using the larger [...] throttle bore previously reserved for the 225, rather than the smaller [...] carburetors formerly used on the 170 engine. [...] Federally-mandated safety equipment was provided on all 1967s, including a new dual-chamber <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> energy-absorbing steering column, wheel, and instrument panel controls; shoulder belt mountings for outboard front passengers, a new 4-way hazard flasher, and, for 1970, lane-change directional signals were included.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> bore {{increased by}} 0.3 mm.|$|E
25|$|In {{position}} two, {{the valve}} blocks the line, isolating that <b>brake</b> from the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> This prevents {{the pressure from}} rising further should the driver push the brake pedal harder.|$|R
50|$|Like all cars {{sold in the}} U.S. for 1967, the 4-4-2 came {{standard}} with a {{group of}} occupant protection and accident avoidance features as mandated by Federal law. This safety package included an energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, padded dash, recessed controls, four-way hazard flashers and a dual-circuit <b>brake</b> hydraulic <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a {{hydraulic}} brake system, the driver applies force by a mechanical link from the {{pedal to the}} <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In turn the <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> develops hydraulic pressure in the wheels. In contrast, the electro-hydraulic brake SBC provides the brakes with a brake fluid supply from the hydraulic high-pressure reservoir, which is sufficient for several braking events. A piston pump driven by an electric motor supplies a controlled brake fluid pressure between 140 and 160 Bar in the gas diaphragm reservoir.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{was changed}} to a new unit (February 1991) ...|$|E
5000|$|On May 1, 1984 Nissan {{recalled}} 11,909 MY 1984 300ZX {{models for}} an improperly assembled <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
50|$|The E30 M3 {{had special}} {{front and rear}} brake {{calipers}} and rotors. It also has a special <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|If {{bleeding}} <b>brakes</b> {{because of}} <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> replacement the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is usually [...] "bench bled" [...] before installation. Typically by securing {{it on the}} bench, filling it with fluid, connecting fittings and hoses to route fluid from the outlet ports on the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> back to its reservoir, and repeatedly depressing the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> plunger until bubbles are no longer seen coming from the hoses.|$|R
50|$|In a four-wheel car, the FMVSS Standard 105, 1976; {{requires}} that the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> be divided internally into two sections, each of which pressurizes a separate hydraulic circuit. Each section supplies pressure to one circuit. The combination {{is known as a}} dual <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> Passenger vehicles typically have either a front/rear split brake system or a diagonal split <b>brake</b> system (the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> in a motorcycle or scooter may only pressurize a single unit, which will be the front brake).|$|R
50|$|The <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> {{is located}} behind the driver’s side {{dashboard}} {{mounted on the}} vacuum booster. The pressure inside of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is created by a primary and secondary piston. These are pushed by the output rod of the vacuum booster to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated through the brake lines to the brake calipers. When the brake fluid is pushed through the <b>brake</b> lines, the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> chambers are replenished by the reservoir (attached {{to the top of}} the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder).</b>|$|R
50|$|Braking and {{suspension}} were uprated to 284 mm ventilated front discs, {{a larger}} <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and servo, {{as well as}} revised front springs, dampers, and front struts.|$|E
50|$|Other {{engineering}} {{improvements that}} modernized the 1961 Larks included {{the introduction of}} cowl ventilation, suspended brake and clutch pedals (accompanied by a firewall-mounted <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder)</b> and revamped steering systems.|$|E

Note {{the location of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and clutch slave cylinder nestled inside. This part of the car was damaged when Guerrero struck the errant wheel.|$|E
50|$|The {{braking system}} now {{featured}} thicker {{front and rear}} discs, twin-piston aluminium-headed front calipers, bigger non-asbestos <b>brake</b> pads, larger <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and a higher capacity booster. The discs were now ventilated 287x28 mm at the front and solid 287x16 mm at the back. The XR6 VCT and XR8 were also available with an optional Tickford Premium Brake setup that brought 329 mm grooved front brake discs with twin-piston C4 calipers.|$|R
40|$|Brake-by-wire {{represents}} {{the replacement of}} traditional brake components such as pumps, hoses, fluids, <b>brake</b> boosters, and <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> by electronic sensors and actuators. The different design of these brake concepts poses new challenges for the automotive industry with regard to availability and fallback levels in comparison to standard conventional brake systems. This contribution focuses {{on the development of}} appropriate fallback level concepts. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) techniques and field trials will be used to investigate the performance and the usability of such systems...|$|R
2500|$|Don Yenko, who {{had been}} racing Corvettes, could not compete {{successfully}} against the Carroll Shelby Mustangs after they arrived on the scene; he therefore decided to race modified Corvairs, beginning with the 1966 model. As the stock Corvair did not fit {{into any of the}} SCCA categories, Yenko had to modify four-carburetor Corsas into [...] "sports cars" [...] by removing the back seat; in the process he introduced various performance improvements.

All were equipped by the Chevrolet factory with heavy duty suspension, four speed transmission, quicker steering ratio, [...] "positraction" [...] limited-slip differentials (50 with 3.89 gears, and 50 with 3.55 when Chevrolet dropped the 3.89) and dual <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinders</b> (the first application of this by Chevrolet, to become stock equipment the next year). Because most of the engine cooling in air-cooled engines is done by circulating oil, an oil cooler was necessary for competition use, this was mounted externally on the rear body section above the left wheel.|$|R
50|$|The Megane Renault Sport 225 Cup {{includes}} the Cup Chassis option, which adds drilled brake discs, red {{front and rear}} brake calipers and increased <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> diameter, different 18-inch wheels plus revised stiffened steering.

40|$|Abstract—Master {{cylinder}} is {{a component}} of hydraulic braking system {{and it is just}} a simple piston inside a <b>cylinder.</b> <b>Master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is the key element of braking system which initiates and controls the braking action. A reservoir is attached to the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> to store <b>brake</b> fluid. A <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> having a reservoir and a cylinder formed from a single piece of molded material. The objective of the present work is to minimize the weight to increase mileage in case of general road cars and to increase the speed of the vehicle in case of sports cars. Saving grams at different parts in a car helps us in saving some kilograms {{at the end of the}} design. The plastics have good elastic properties and are strong enough to use for <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The use of plastics in the manufacturing of <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> reduces the weight of the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> is modeled in PRO-E and the analysis is carried using ANSYS work bench. The automobile components like <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> can be easily modeled in PRO-E and can be easily analyzed using ANSYS...|$|R
50|$|The system {{employs a}} travel sensor and a {{pressure}} sensor at the pedal {{to measure the}} speed and force of the driver's command. The control unit processes this information and generates the control signals for the wheel pressure modulators. Normally, the <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder</b> is detached from the brake circuit. A pedal travel simulator creates normal pedal feedback. If ESP intervenes, the high-pressure reservoir supplies the required brake pressure quickly and precisely to selected wheels, without any driver involvement.|$|R
50|$|The {{brake light}} {{operated}} {{only by the}} rear brake in the UK market. A switch was available as a spare part to fit onto the front <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> casting which would also operate the brake light. The necessary wiring was already included on the main wiring harness in the headlamp shell. Sales were 14,000+ in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|The {{braking system}} {{comprised}} a cast-iron detachable brake drum on each roadwheel, with the retardation provided by asbestos-lined brake shoes mounted in a leading/trailing arrangement. The shoes were operated by double-acting Lockheed hydraulic cylinders, fed {{by a single}} hydraulic circuit connected to the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> which was mechanically linked to the brake pedal. [...] This design was normal for that time.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2010, certain 2005-2007 model Acura RLs {{were subject}} to a safety recall for {{potential}} leaking of the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> seal. [...] A seal in the <b>brake</b> <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> may be susceptible to damage following the use of brake fluid other than the recommended Acura or (Honda) Genuine DOT3 brake fluid. If the seal is damaged, it {{can result in a}} brake fluid leak under certain conditions. If a leak should occur, the driver might see a low brake fluid indicator light or a BRAKE FLUID LOW or CHECK BRAKE SYSTEM message. If the driver continues to drive the vehicle after receiving this message without refilling the brake fluid reservoir, it could result in a brake pedal that feels soft or spongy, and may eventually affect braking performance, increasing the risk of a crash. Affected vehicles were to be inspected and repaired, as applicable, at no charge. Reportedly, this recall applied to both 2005-2007 Acura RL and 2005-2007 Honda Odyssey models.|$|E
50|$|Bellcranks {{are also}} seen in {{automotive}} applications, {{as part of}} the linkage connecting the throttle pedal to the carburetor, and connecting the brake pedal to the <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder.</b> In vehicle suspensions, bellcranks are used in pushrod-style suspensions in automobiles or in the Christie suspension in tanks. Vertically-mounted suspensions may not be feasible in some vehicle designs due to space, aerodynamic, or other design constraints; bellcranks translate the vertical motion of the wheel in to horizontal motion, allowing the suspension to be mounted transversely or longitudinally within the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|These models {{included}} 247 mm vented {{front brake}} discs, with the VTR and VTS also having rear brake discs (solid 247 mm discs). Also, {{a different style}} of control arms and struts {{was used for the}} suspension. The VTS had a 22 mm <b>master</b> <b>brake</b> <b>cylinder,</b> and the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a 19 mm. The VTS had a 19 mm front anti-roll bar and 22 mm rear anti-roll bar, while the VTR and Westcoast/Furio had a 19 mm front and 21 mm or sometimes 19 mm rear anti-roll bar.|$|R
40|$|NoBraking system characteristics, {{brake system}} {{performance}} and {{brake system component}} design parameters that influence brake pedal `feel¿ in a passenger car have been studied using the simulation modelling package AMESim, in particular to model the linear and nonlinear characteristics of internal components. A passenger car hydraulic brake system simulation model incorporating the <b>brake</b> pedal, booster, <b>master</b> <b>cylinder,</b> <b>brake</b> lines and calipers has been developed to predict brake system response {{to assist in the}} design of braking systems with the desired brake pedal force / travel characteristic characteristics to create good brake pedal `feel¿. This has highlighted the importance of system components, in particular the <b>master</b> <b>cylinder</b> and caliper seal deformation, and the operating characteristics of the booster in determining the brake pedal force / travel characteristic. The potential contribution of these 3 components to brake pedal `feel¿ improvement has been investigated, and the results of the AMESim model have been verified using experimental measurement data. The model can be used in the future to provide an accurate prediction of brake system response at the design stage thereby saving time and cost...|$|R
