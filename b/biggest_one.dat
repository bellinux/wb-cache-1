5|$|Peronism still {{controlled}} the labor unions, {{the most powerful}} ones in all of Latin America. The <b>biggest</b> <b>one</b> was the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). Alfonsín sought to reduce the Peronist influence over the unions, fearing that they may become a destabilizing force for the fledgling democracy. He rejected their custom of holding single-candidate internal elections, and deemed them totalitarian and not genuine representatives of the workforce. His proposal was to change the laws for those internal elections, remove the union leaders appointed during the dictatorship, and elect new ones under the new laws. The CGT rejected the proposal as interventionist, and prompted Peronist politicians to vote against it. The law {{was approved by the}} Chamber of Deputies but failed to pass in the Senate by one vote. A second bill proposed simply a call to elections, without supervision from the government, which was approved. As a result, the unions remained Peronist.|$|E

5000|$|After {{making peace}} on several planets and helping out in {{different}} ways the various inhabitants of them, <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> is sucked into [...] "The Bottom of Gravity", a literal gravity pit. There they find SDF and Galaxy Railways Trains that have disappeared from their universe over the years. They also find various other craft that have been missing. For some reason, the Platoon {{is not able to}} get <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> to move. During this time, Frell starts spending periods of time in the engine room (inside the boiler, where all the glowing dials and switches are). One time, as she is turning to leave, she feels a presence and asks who is there. Suddenly, all the glowing dials and switches light up and a voice says that it is the Independent Train Control System, type G8001. This is basically the voice of <b>Big</b> <b>One.</b> Frell has a conversation with <b>Big</b> <b>One,</b> and she learns that <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> will not move because the other trains have started to persuade him to stay in the pit and sleep peacefully, or die. <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> also says that he is not moving because he does not have a destination. After Frell convinces the rest of the Platoon that <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> really does talk, they come into the engine room and give <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> some support, such as saying that after they take Frell to her planet, they will all go back to Destiny together. <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> realizes that Sirius Platoon never gives up, even in impossible situations. He also realizes that he too is a member of Sirius Platoon. He asks other engines that have been repaired and coupled up to lend him their power, and they do. <b>Big</b> <b>One</b> with all the other engines make it out of the pit. But just as they reach the top, the couplers break and the other engines fall back into the pit, while they are saying their farewells to <b>Big</b> <b>One.</b>|$|R

500|$|Patrick Sauriol of UGO {{started the}} review stating [...] "After {{the events of}} season two's cliffhanger, there were a hundred {{questions}} {{on the minds of}} the show's fans, but the <b>biggest</b> <b>one</b> gets answered with the Season Three double-header premiere: was the start of Season Three worth the wait or has the show jumped the shark? Answer: You better frakkin' believe that Battlestar Galactica hasn't jumped the shark." [...] Sauriol commented that the time leap of a year was a [...] "gutsy move," [...] but felt it has [...] "always been the case" [...] for the series. However, he also felt that all doubts the audience might have to harbor [...] "that this show won't live up to the first two seasons should be wiped away." [...] Callis' performance was praised, with Sauriol stating [...] "again Callis proves that he owns this role and again he proves tonight why Gaius Baltar is the best character on this show." [...] Sauriol graded [...] "Occupation" [...] and the following [...] "Precipice" [...] A-. Television Without Pity gave the episode a B.|$|E
500|$|After {{the series}} finale, the Los Angeles Times {{characterized}} the series as [...] "an epic poem, with Jack Bauer {{in the role}} of Odysseus or Beowulf. Which means he needed to be fighting monsters, not essentially decent people who have made one very bad decision." [...] The critic {{went on to say that}} villain Charles Logan encapsulated all that [...] "Jack and 24 fought against for so long: political corruption and cowardice, narcissism and megalomania, ruthlessness and stupidity." [...] One reviewer for BuddyTV said that [...] "I'll remember the legacy of 24 as an action drama that redefined what serialized television can do and provided many shocking twists and turns along the way—the <b>biggest</b> <b>one</b> being the very real impact the show had on American foreign policy." [...] The New York Times said [...] "24 will live on, possibly as a feature film, and surely in classrooms and in textbooks. The series enlivened the country's political discourse in a way few others have, partly because it brought to life the ticking time-bomb threat that haunted the Cheney faction of the American government in the years after 9/11." [...] The show was declared the sixth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002–2012).|$|E

500|$|... "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Castellaneta, who voices {{characters}} such as Homer and Krusty on The Simpsons, and his wife Deb Lacusta. American comedian and actress Joan Rivers guest starred in the episode as Annie. She recorded her lines in March 2011. In an interview with E! News at that time, Rivers noted {{that this was not}} her first animated voice-over role, though it was her <b>biggest</b> <b>one</b> yet. She further added that she is a fan of the show because it is [...] "so clever and so funny on so many levels. So when they called and said, 'Do you want to do it?' without even reading a script I said, 'Absolutely.'" [...] Adam Buckman, a former television columnist at the New York Post, noted on his blog that the story of the episode is similar to a period in Rivers' life {{at the end of the}} 1980s. At that time, she was hosting The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers on the Fox network. When Rivers challenged Fox executives who wanted to fire her husband Edgar Rosenberg as the show's executive producer, the network fired them both. Rosenberg committed suicide just three months later. Buckman wrote that the story of [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution" [...] was [...] "no doubt devised with Rivers’ approval and possibly with her input", and that [...] "only a comedian of her stature and experience" [...] would attempt to spoof a personal tragedy such as this one. Other guest stars in the episode include actor Kevin Dillon and stand-up comedian Janeane Garofalo as themselves, and stand-up comedian Jackie Mason in a minor reprisal of his role as Krusty's father, speaking only one line.|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} Minority Report {{is the classic}} {{philosophical}} debate of free will vs. determinism. One of the main questions the film raises is whether the future is set or whether free will can alter the future. As critic C.A. Wolski commented, [...] "At the outset, Minority Report... promises to mine some deep subject matter, to do with: do we possess free will or are we predestined to our fate?" [...] However, {{there is also the}} added question of whether the precogs' visions are correct. As reviewer James Berardinelli asked, [...] "is the Precogs' vision accurate, or has it in some way been tampered with? Perhaps Anderton isn't actually going to kill, but has been set up by a clever and knowledgeable criminal who wants him out of the way." [...] The precog Agatha also states that since Anderton knows his future, he can change it. However, the film also indicates that Anderton's knowledge of the future may actually be the factor that causes Leo Crow's death. Berardinelli describes this as the main paradox regarding free will vs. determinism in the film, [...] "ere's the <b>biggest</b> <b>one</b> of all: Is it possible that the act of accusing someone of a murder could begin a chain of events that leads to the slaying. In Anderton's situation, he runs because he is accused. The only reason he ends up in circumstances where he might be forced to kill is because he is a hunted man. Take away the accusation, {{and there would be no}} question of him committing a criminal act. The prediction drives the act [...] a self-fulfilling prophecy. You can see the vicious circle, and it's delicious (if a little maddening) to ponder." [...] Film scholar Dean A. Kowalski argues that in this scenario free will still exists, as the perpetrators control their actions, and the precogs' visions are but the facts that resulted from their choices.|$|E
