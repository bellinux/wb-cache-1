5|$|Bradford City {{became the}} first league {{football}} team from the county, <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>even</b> had a team or played a game. They and Chelsea, who were elected to the league two years later, share {{the distinction of being}} the only clubs to join the league without having played a competitive fixture. A summer archery contest, which had been organised {{to raise money for the}} rugby league club, was used to finance the new club, and Manningham's colours of claret and amber were adopted as Bradford City's kit, but with Manningham's hoops changed to stripes.|$|E

She explains to him what has happened, and turns {{on the evening news}} to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>even</b> arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} problems <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>even</b> {{reached the}} fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor {{the building had}} lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E

In 1917, Vizzini was sentenced to 20 years in first instance for fraud, corruption and murder, but he was absolved thanks to powerful friends who exonerated him. He made his fortune {{on the black market}} during World War I, and expanded his activities to the sulphur mines. As a representative of a consortium of sulphur mine operators, Vizzini participated in high-level meetings in Rome and London concerning government subsidies and tariffs, next to such men as Guido Donegani of Montecatini chemical industries and , Finance minister during Benito Mussoliniâ€™s fascist regime.|$|E
5|$|When the UCI {{released}} {{its list of}} teams graded according to their hierarchy that decided who would receive a World Tour license, this team's signees put them at the top, making them world number one <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>even</b> existed. This did not guarantee the team a top-level license, it simply qualified them for it, but they were later announced as having received a four-year World Tour license. Whether intentionally or incidentally, this corresponded to the initial financial guarantee Becca put up for the team. Nygaard hailed the license acquisition as the fruition of many months of hard work. This afforded the team automatic invitations to all World Tour events, including the season's three Grand Tours.|$|E

5|$|The year of 1967 started {{badly for}} the Vietnam People's Air Force (VPAF). During {{the early years}} of the war, the rules of {{engagement}} prevented U.S. fighter-bombers from hitting North Vietnamese air bases, and that allowed North Vietnamese fighter pilots to attack American bomber formations as they were approaching their targets, thereby forcing U.S. pilots to jettison their bomb loads <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>even</b> reached their target. Then, instead of dueling with U.S. strike aircraft, North Vietnamese pilots would normally retreat to the safety of their bases. To preempt further attacks on U.S. bomber formations by the North Vietnamese Air Force, the United States Air Force became interested in luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters up against a decoy target, and shoot them down in the air using missile-armed fighter aircraft. By 1967, the North Vietnamese Air Force had become more aggressive towards U.S. strike formations, and it indicated to U.S. commanders that it was the right time to launch a decoy operation.|$|E

Shortlisted candidates are then subjected to more tests to ensure that they fit certain criteria, such as having above average intelligence and excellent eyesight, before they are selected to join the unit.

The difference in weight between a parachutist and a container meant that they often landed some distance apart, rather defeating the purpose, and some were captured by enemy forces or lost <b>before</b> <b>they</b> could <b>even</b> be used. The low power and small wheels also meant that they struggled to cope adequately with the often rough battlefield roads so were often abandoned by troops who found it easier to continue on foot. Another problem for the Welbike was that, {{by the time it was}} in mass production, much larger gliders had been developed that could carry bigger and more powerful motorcycles such as the Royal Enfield WD/RE.|$|R
