25|$|The inchworm, or looper {{caterpillars}} {{from the}} family Geometridae are so named <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> move, appearing to measure the earth (the word geometrid means earth-measurer in Greek); {{the primary reason for}} this unusual locomotion is the elimination of nearly all the prolegs except the clasper on the terminal segment.|$|E

25|$|Typically, predators {{attempt to}} reduce {{communication}} to prey as this will generally reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} hunting. However, some forms of predator to prey communication occur in ways that change the behaviour of the prey and make their capture easier, i.e. deception by the predator. A well-known example is the angler fish, an ambush predator which waits for its prey to come to it. It has a fleshy bioluminescent growth protruding from its forehead which it dangles in front of its jaws. Smaller fish attempt to take the lure, placing themselves in a better position for the angler fish to catch them. Another example of deceptive communication is observed in the genus of jumping spiders (Myrmarachne). These spiders are commonly referred to as “antmimicking spiders” <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> wave their front legs in the air to simulate antennae.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{individuals}} may actually {{find it easier}} to escape situations of abuse in the United States than they would have in their countries of origin. Among some immigrants there is much criticism {{of the way in which}} women in particular have been changed by American culture. Women may be seen as too Americanized <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> dress or their lack of deference to men. The general support for gender equality within American society can undermine traditional power hierarchies within the family in which men had control over the actions of women. One of the ways that such power is undermined is through the presence of laws against domestic violence. In some patriarchal societies, husbands may have complete control over their wives, including control over their bodies. U.S. laws do not support this sort of arrangement and women who are aware of their rights can utilize formal legal institutions to combat such gender imbalances within the family. The ability of government authorities to intervene in the realm of the family can undermine the traditional power balance and leave men feeling dispossessed.|$|E

Not wishing to repeat {{the mistakes of the}} French Jacobins they moved against the popular political clubs that formed their political base, thereby alienating their most enthusiastic supporters. On the other hand, at the behest of Delacroix they also moved against [...] "counter-revolutionaries" [...] by having purging commissions removing these people from the electoral rolls, further undermining the legitimacy of the regime, as moderate Patriots were also disenfranchised. The final blow was that the new regime reneged on its promise to elect an entirely new Representative Assembly.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Ultra Jump Egg, Urobuchi gave insight into his writing philosophy, stating that he believed the overarching plot of a story {{was more important than}} the characters within it. He indicated that he would first determine the actions and the ultimate fate of a character before even assigning it a name, and contrasted this with other writing methods which first focused on developing the characters and then creating a storyline for them to follow. He again defended his decision to have Mami die, claiming that this could actually have the converse effect of making her character even more memorable, saying, [...] "I think there are quite many characters who became immortal exactly because they died, like Caesar Zeppeli in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or Raoh in Fist of the North Star. Precisely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> died, they were able to live forever." ...|$|E

Most people in communist Poland, including opposition activists, did not question the supremacy of socialism or the socialist idea; misconduct by party officials, such as not following the provisions of the constitution, was blamed.

2500|$|Most lenses are spherical lenses: {{their two}} {{surfaces}} {{are parts of}} the surfaces of spheres. Each surface can be [...] (bulging outwards from the lens), [...] (depressed into the lens), or planar (flat). The line joining the centres of the spheres making up the lens surfaces is called the axis of the lens. Typically the lens axis passes through the physical centre of the lens, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> are manufactured.

2500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> {{have been}} adopted into Japanese, a single kanji {{may be used to}} write one or more {{different}} words – or, in some cases, morphemes – and thus the same character may be pronounced in different ways. From {{the point of view of}} the reader, kanji are said to have one or more different [...] "readings". Although more than one reading may become activated in the brain, deciding which reading is appropriate depends on recognizing which word it represents, which can usually be determined from context, intended meaning, whether the character occurs as part of a compound word or an independent word, and sometimes location within the sentence. For example, [...] is usually read kyō, meaning [...] "today", but in formal writing is instead read konnichi, meaning [...] "nowadays"; this is understood from context. Nevertheless, some cases are ambiguous and require a furigana gloss, which are also used simply for difficult readings or to specify a non-standard reading.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the temple's garden, over a hill {{stands the}} Hansōbō, the temple's large tutelary Shinto shrine. The {{enshrined}} spirit is the Hansōbō Daigongen. The gongen was originally the tutelary spirit (...) of Hōkō-ji in Shizuoka and was brought here in 1890 by Aozora Kandō. The statues on the stairs leading to the shrine represent Tengu, entities similar to goblins which accompany the gongen. Some of the creatures have wings and a beak: they are a type of tengu called Karasu-tengu (crow tengu) <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> look. On a clear day, from the shrine one can see Mount Fuji to the west, and Sagami bay and Izu Ōshima to the south. The stones in the garden are full of names: they are those of the faithful who donated to the temple, and which belong to over 100 different religious organizations. This area used to be the temple's Inner Sanctuary, which still stands among the trees {{at the very top of}} the hill and which can be reached going up the steep stairs that begin on the right of the shrine, in front of the Jizō-dō. Next to the sanctuary there's an observation deck from which, on clear days, are visible Kamakura, Yuigahama and Mount Fuji.|$|E
