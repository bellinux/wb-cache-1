5|$|A {{variety of}} Polish flags are defined in current Polish {{national}} law, either through {{an act of}} parliament or a ministerial ordinance. Apart from the national flag, these are mostly military flags, used <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> all branches of the Polish Armed Forces, especially the Polish Navy. Other flags are flown by vessels of non-military uniformed services.|$|E
5|$|Ants are {{distinct}} in their morphology from other insects in having elbowed antennae, metapleural glands, {{and a strong}} constriction of their second abdominal segment into a node-like petiole. The head, mesosoma, and metasoma are the three distinct body segments. The petiole forms a narrow waist between their mesosoma (thorax plus the first abdominal segment, which is fused to it) and gaster (abdomen less the abdominal segments in the petiole). The petiole may be formed <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two nodes (the second alone, or {{the second and third}} abdominal segments).|$|E

5|$|Each {{subsequent}} {{line was}} built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station.

5|$|In 1910, Curie {{succeeded in}} {{isolating}} radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named {{for her and}} Pierre: the curie.

5|$|In {{parliamentary}} elections, 14-member election lists may {{be submitted}} to the State Electoral Commission {{for any number of}} constituencies in Croatia. A 14-member list of candidates may also be submitted for the Croatian diaspora constituency, while a two-member list can be submitted for the ethnic-minority representatives. In each case, 500 endorsements are required for an election list to become valid. The lists may be supported <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more political parties, or by a group of voters as an independent list. No one may be a candidate on two or more lists simultaneously.|$|E

5|$|Planets are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Six of the planets are orbited <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more natural satellites.|$|E
5|$|Recreational {{cross-country}} skiing includes ski touring and groomed-trail skiing, typically at resorts or in parklands.

5|$|September 25, 2004– Hurricane Jeanne {{hits the}} {{southern}} {{portion of the}} state very near where Frances struck three weeks prior, producing moderate winds and rainfall reaching 11.97inches (304mm) at Kenansville.

The passage of Hurricane Jeanne results in three deaths; two due to winds and one from flooding.|$|E
5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of}} the mouth, that distend during the amplification of the call. Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving {{a better understanding}} of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses.

5|$|The genital {{openings}} (gonopores) of {{both sexes}} are located {{on the underside of}} the third body segment (near the second pair of legs) and may be accompanied in the male <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> two penes which deposit the sperm packets onto the gonopods. In the female, the genital pores open into paired small sacs called cyphopods or vulvae, which are covered by small hood-like lids, and are used to store the sperm after copulation. The cyphopod morphology can also be used to identify species. Millipede sperm lack flagella, a unique trait among myriapods.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} usually {{accompanied}} <b>by</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> more friendly non-player characters, who {{will follow the}} player and provide assistance in combat against enemies.
