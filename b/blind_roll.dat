50|$|The open-air {{isolation}} ward {{was constructed in}} 1916. This building was constructed {{for the care of}} those with infectious diseases, on the principles of the miasma theory which suggested that because the germs were thought to be circulating in the air, health service accommodation should be isolated and maintained to allow the maximum flow of the air through the building, dispersing germs. A report in the Darling Downs Gazette, of 1921 describes the {{isolation ward}} as being in a distant corner and under the shade of several large trees. Several similar wards were constructed at hospitals throughout Queensland, but very few survive. The buildings were a Queensland innovation. The building was designed to have a ward which be open to the weather and was protected by canvas <b>blinds</b> <b>rolled</b> down from the eaves. The blinds were replaced by timber-framed walls due to the cold weather. A new open-air ward, closer to the main building, was constructed by the Commonwealth Government in 1921.

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the last}} several decades, shading devices such as <b>blinds,</b> louvers, <b>roll</b> shades, etc., have {{received}} much attention due to their roles as indoor environmental controllers (preventing glare, blocking shortwave radiation, and contributing to thermal comfort). In order to allow the aforementioned systems to act as true optimal controllers, a fast and accurate mathematical model that is able to predict the dynamic behavior {{of the system is}} necessary. This paper describes the development of a lumped simulation model of an indoor blind system adjacent to double glazing (6 mm clear+ 12 mm air + 6 mm low-e). This is typical of office building shading systems in Korea. Rather than attempting to develop the most detailed and accurate model of the system, the approach described in this paper is based on the postulated minimalistic model augmented with a parameter estimation technique. The lumped simulation model was validated with measurements obtained from an in-situ, full-scale experimental facility mounted on the south-facing façade. It was found that the calibration method delivers accurate results for the unknown parameters (convective heat transfer coefficients and air permeability of the shading device), allowing the calibrated lumped model to be used in ensuing optimal control and performance studies.

5000|$|Before the {{development}} of viscous-drive and electric fans, engines were fitted with simple fixed fans that drew air through the radiator at all times. Vehicles whose design required the installation of a large radiator to cope with heavy work at high temperatures, such as commercial vehicles and tractors would often run cool in cold weather under light loads, even {{with the presence of}} a thermostat, as the large radiator and fixed fan caused a rapid and significant drop in coolant temperature as soon as the thermostat opened. This problem can be solved by fitting a [...] radiator blind (or radiator shroud) to the radiator that can be adjusted to partially or fully block the airflow through the radiator. At its simplest the <b>blind</b> is a <b>roll</b> of material such as canvas or rubber that is unfurled {{along the length of the}} radiator to cover the desired portion. Some older vehicles, like the World War I-era S.E.5 and SPAD S.XIII single-engined fighters, have a series of shutters that can be adjusted from the driver's or pilot's seat to provide a degree of control. Some modern cars have a series of shutters that are automatically opened and closed by the engine control unit to provide a balance of cooling and aerodynamics as needed.|$|R

It was reintroduced on 29 November 2008 as permanent fixture. Branded the Stockport Shuttle Bus it was operated by Solutions SK on behalf of Stockport Council, before operations switched to Freshfield Coaches the following month, after {{it was revealed that}} SolutionsSK had been operating the service with a freight licence. The service was re-branded in August 2009 to form part of the Metroshuttle network, and was given a new livery to mark the change. Prior to this, the fleet (consisting of Optare Solos) were unpainted and fairly run down, even lacking <b>roll</b> <b>blinds.</b> The fleet was replaced with new Alexander Dennis Enviro200s, fitted with digital displays. In 2010, the operator of the service changed, with Oldham based Swan's Travel taking over the service [...] on a short-term basis, before being replaced by Bluebird in October 2010. Bluebird ran the service until March 2011, when the service was taken over by Stagecoach Manchester, who run the majority of services in Stockport. Stagecoach ran the service until 1 July 2012, when it was transferred to Arriva North West's Wythenshawe depot.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, issues {{regarding}} building stock are highly {{important in the}} quest to reduce overall UK energy consumption and finding prime targets for cuts in carbon emissions. Of all the main consumers of energy, the fact how occupants use and operate the building plays a crucial role. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have a thorough understanding of the occupant response to environmental controlling systems in buildings because the building should be designed not only to satisfy comfort requirements but also to be used with a low input of energy. This research can be seen as an attempt to explore such issues. It examines various environmental issues such as motivating forces and influential effects related to the occupant control behaviour with special attention to the usage of those simple, easy-to-use and robust means that the occupant is able to see and almost immediately experience the results of the actions. Two naturally ventilated buildings in Sheffield were selected as the study cases. Their architectural features were examined, including environmental situation, occupant identification and architectural speciality. Both buildings' <b>blinds</b> (shading <b>rolls)</b> and windows were recorded by photograph twice a day for 16 months continuously. At the same time, the outside hourly weather parameters and inside physical parameters were collected. A questionnaire survey and a face-to-face interview were also carried out in order to investigate the thermal, visual and acoustic comfort sensation and an indication of the motivating forces for manual control obtained. From a sustainability perspective, the study has provided knowledge that enables designers to anticipate how a design encourages that the sustainable interaction between the occupant operation behaviour, building components and/or systems, and conversely, avoid built conditions where occupant interaction may cause sustainable penalties. This understanding may well lead to the building using less energy to maintain comfort. The study could also provide opportunities for decision makers to understand the current situations of the buildings that were selected as case studies. The result of this research may be used as a work-base for successful improvement and give confidence to embark on the design of naturally ventilated buildings...|$|R
