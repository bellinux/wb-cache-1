For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> not be the best time for European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.|$|E

For example, dairy manufacturing equipment can be cleaned well enough that the rabbis grant pareve status to products manufactured with it. Nevertheless, someone with a strong allergic sensitivity to dairy products might still react to the dairy residue, {{and that is why}} some products that are legitimately pareve carry [...] "milk" [...] warnings.|$|E
2500|$|Sharpton has run unsuccessfully for {{elected office}} on {{multiple}} occasions. Of his unsuccessful runs, {{he said that}} winning office {{may not have been}} his goal, saying in an interview: [...] "Much of the media criticism of me assumes their goals and they impose them on me. Well, those might not be my goals. So they will say, 'Well, Sharpton has not won a political office.' <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> not be my goal! Maybe I ran for political office to change the debate, or to raise the social justice question." [...] Sharpton ran for a United States Senate seat from New York in 1988, 1992, and 1994. In 1997, he ran for Mayor of New York City. During his 1992 bid, he and his wife lived in a home in Englewood, New Jersey, though he said his residence was an apartment in Brooklyn.|$|E

2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "LHX" [...] was a warship {{that was}} {{proposed in the}} late 1990s to replace the s, but with a dry deck for hovercraft rather than a floodable [...] "well deck". After 2000, the LHX, the so-called [...] "Amphibious Assault Ship Future Replacement", was put forward to replace all of the LHDs. [...] The new LHX could be a Flight 2 design of the America class built with a well deck and a smaller island superstructure, which would give it 20 percent more capacity on the flight deck. This would remove the current restriction on MV-22s to land on spots 5 and 6, and also giving room for four MV-22B, three F-35B Lightning IIs, or three CH-53Ks to use the flight deck. In 2008, the procurement of Flight 2 ships was tentatively planned for 2024, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> not be practical or affordable by then.|$|E
2500|$|Carter's {{writings}} [...] {{began to}} receive wider critical and historical attention {{when they were}} published in Eric Gardner's 2007 book Jennie Carter: A Black Journalist of the Early [...] West. A reviewer in American Literary Scholarship wrote that her work [...] "remarkably complicates assumptions about blacks' access {{to the middle class}} in the late-19th-century West even as it adds to and confirms a rich tradition of post-Gold Rush West Coast journalism." [...] Garder notes that [...] his research into [...] Carter helped uncover little-known black communities in the Sierra Nevadas, which had links to larger urban centers like Sacramento and San Francisco. [...] Writing like Carter's that was published in black newspapers, along with similar work by Norris Wright Cuney, Frank Webb and George T Ruby, [...] Gardner said, was {{an important part of the}} literary output of 19th century African-Americans that was often overlooked. [...] He also notes that because she worked primarily in short essays she can be compared to [...] Mark Twain and Bret Harte, both 19th century writers of the American West who also used the short essay form in their work. [...] Gardner speculated that her choice of the pseudonym Semper Fidelis (Always Faithful), suggested that for Carter, [...] "writing is a gesture of faith for the community, in the community, writing about topics that need to be discussed <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> not be discussed", a way to [...] "push people to be involved and think about the issues." ...|$|E
