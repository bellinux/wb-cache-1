[...] Scholars note close parallels between Gandhi's work and Swaminarayan's work related to non-violence, truth-telling, hygiene, temperance, and the uplift of masses. Commenting on Gandhi's social work, N.A. Toothi [...] "most of his thought, activities and even methods of most of the institutions which he has been building up and serving, have the flavor of Swaminarayanism, more than that of any other sect of Hindu Dharma." [...] He however did not feel that Swaminarayan's values aligned perfectly with his interpretation of Vaishnavism. In a letter dated 25 July 1918, to Manganlal Gandhi, he stated, “To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> have felt in all seriousness that Swaminarayan and Vallabhacharaya have robbed us of our manliness. They made the people incapable of self-defense... It was all to the good that people gave up drinking, smoking, etc., this, however, is not an end in itself, it only is a means. The love taught by Swaminarayan and Vallabh is all sentimentalism... Do not mix up the Vaishnava tradition with the teaching of Vallabha and Swaminarayan.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} charge of obscurantism, other {{analytic}} philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger's work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting. However, not all analytic philosophers have been as hostile. Gilbert Ryle wrote a critical yet positive review of Being and Time. Ludwig Wittgenstein made a remark recorded by Friedrich Waismann: [...] "To <b>be</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> can imagine what Heidegger means by being and anxiety" [...] which has been construed by some commentators as sympathetic to Heidegger's philosophical approach. These positive and negative analytic evaluations have been collected in Michael Murray (ed.), Heidegger and Modern Philosophy: Critical Essays (Yale University Press, 1978). Heidegger's reputation within English-language philosophy has slightly improved in philosophical terms in some part {{through the efforts of}} Hubert Dreyfus, Richard Rorty, and a recent generation of analytically oriented phenomenology scholars. Pragmatist Rorty claimed that Heidegger's approach to philosophy {{in the first half of}} his career has much in common with that of the latter-day Ludwig Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, Rorty asserted that what Heidegger had constructed in his writings was a myth of being rather than an account of it.|$|E
