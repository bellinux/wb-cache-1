40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} labour and environmental taxes in a general equilibrium model with unionised labour markets and involuntary unemployment. Environmental externality {{is related to the}} consumption of a polluting output. In particular, we examine whether a "double dividend" in terms of employment and the environment can be reaped with an environmentally motivated, revenue neutral tax reform. With unemployment <b>benefits</b> <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax,</b> we find that uncompensated increases in either labour income or environmental taxes lead to a lower equilibrium level of employment and polluting output. Numerical simulations with plausible parameter values show that employment will improve after the reform. The magnitude of the employment effect is considerable and depends positively on the share of polluting output in total consumption. However, due to the increased level of economic activity, environmental quality tends to deteriorate. This caveat can be avoided if tax cuts are targeted to the payroll tax in the non-polluting sector only. A prerequisite for the double dividend is that the elasticity of substitution between polluting and non-polluting consumption is large enough.

25|$|The {{government}} {{set about}} implementing the wartime plans of Liberal William Beveridge {{for the creation}} of a 'cradle to grave' welfare state. It set in place an entirely new system of social security. Among the most important pieces of legislation was the National Insurance Act 1946, in which people in work were required to pay a flat rate of national insurance. In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for a wide range of benefits, including pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefit. Various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income. In 1949, unemployment, sickness and maternity <b>benefits</b> were <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|R
5|$|Beyond {{the obvious}} honour, the award also carries a cash {{allowance}} for those under {{the rank of}} lieutenant (or the appropriate service equivalent), {{and in some cases}} a cash award. Upon the death of the recipient, the pension is transferred to the widow until her death or remarriage. In the case of a posthumous recipient who is a bachelor, the allowance is paid to his father or mother. In the case of the award being conferred posthumously on a widower, the allowance is to be paid to his son or unmarried daughter. A monthly stipend of 10,000 rupees is given the awardee. The award amount and pension <b>benefits</b> are <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> income <b>tax.</b> In addition, different ministries under the Central Government have various awards for PVC winners.|$|R
40|$|The 1997 {{pension reform}} {{comprised}} {{an increase in}} contributions, reduction in benefits and introduction of incentives to raise the effective retirement age. But the greatest financial gain was achieved by harmonizing the pension regimes. Measures to promote employer-based retirement income provision, the so-called second pillar, have still to be implemented. Currently, the tax reform committee is discussing tax incentives to raise the utilization of firm and private pension schemes. Abroad, {{the development of a}} fully funded pension insurance system is encouraged by a range of tax breaks, which includes deductibility of contributions and lower tax rates on benefits. The most generous system applies in the U. K., where contributions to pension funds as well as <b>benefits</b> are <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> up to a fixed ceiling. The cost of lost tax revenues is estimated at 3 percent of GDP. In New Zealand, contributions to pension funds have been fully taxed since 1988, but pension payments remain exempt. With this, pension funds were given approximately the same tax status as other private forms of savings. As a result, there was a precipitous decline in firm pension schemes. While developing their capital stock, pension funds are usually <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax</b> on interest earned. In Austria, this exemption is extended only to personal life insurance schemes and Pensionskassen. In spite of similar tax breaks, company pensions show highly varying proportions of coverage against total employment across the countries investigated. Just 11 percent of the dependently employed in Austria are entitled to a firm pension, while in Australia their share is over 90 percent. Generally, firm pensions are widely available in countries where the second pillar is mandatory (Australia, France, Switzerland). In Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, firm pensions are similarly prevalent thanks to inter-industrial collective agreements. The incidence of firm pensions depends also on the income replacement rate provided by the public pension system. In countries such as the U. K., Canada or the USA, where public pensions are low, 45 to 59 percent of employees are entitled to a firm pension.

An association of worship may organize only religious activities, defined as liturgical services and practices. A cultural association may engage in profit-making activity. Although a cultural association is not <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes,</b> it may receive government subsidies for its cultural and educational operations, such as schools. Religious groups normally register under both of these categories; the Mormons, for example, runs strictly religious activities through its association of worship and operates a school under its cultural association.|$|R
