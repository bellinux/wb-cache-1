5|$|<b>Babbit</b> {{recruited}} Clea DuVall, who had {{starred in}} her short film Sleeping Beauties, {{to play the}} role of Graham Eaton. <b>Babbit</b> says that she was able to get a lot of the cast through DuVall, including Natasha Lyonne and Melanie Lynskey. Lyonne first saw the script in the back of DuVall's car and subsequently contacted her agent about it. She had seen and enjoyed Babbit's short Sleeping Beauties and was eager to work with the director. She was not the first choice for the role of Megan. An unnamed actress wanted to play the part but eventually turned it down because of religious beliefs; she did not want her family to see her face on the poster. <b>Babbit</b> briefly considered Rosario Dawson as Megan but her executive producer persuaded her that Dawson, who is Hispanic, would not be right for the All-American character.|$|E

40|$|Abstractâ€”In this paper, the <b>babbitting</b> of {{a bearing}} in {{boiler feed pump}} of an {{electromotor}} has been studied. These bearings {{have an important role}} in reducing the shut down times in the pumps, compressors and turbines. The most conventional method in <b>babbitting</b> is casting as a melting method. The comparison between thermal spray and casting methods in <b>babbitting</b> shows that the thermal spraying babbitt layer has better performance and tribological behavior. The metallurgical and tribological analysis such as SEM, EDS and wet chemical analysis has been made in the Babbitt alloys and worn surfaces. Two type of babbitt materials: tinbase and lead-base babbitt was used. The benefits of thermally sprayed babbitt layers are completely clear especially in large bearings...|$|R
5|$|Not feeling {{qualified}} {{to write the}} script herself, <b>Babbit</b> brought in screenwriter and recent graduate of USC School of Cinematic Arts Brian Wayne Peterson. Peterson had experience with reparative therapy while working at a prison clinic for sex offenders. He {{has said that he}} wanted to make a film that would not only entertain people, but also make people get angry and talk about the issues it raised.|$|E

5|$|She {{wanted the}} {{production}} and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of gender construction). According to <b>Babbit,</b> the germaphobic character of Mary Brown represents AIDS paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and PVC outfits. The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink picket fence were filmed in Palmdale, California.|$|E

500|$|Art <b>Babbit,</b> an {{animator}} {{who joined}} the Disney studio in 1932, invited seven of his colleagues (who worked {{in the same room}} as him) to come with him to an art class that he himself had set up at his home in the Hollywood Hills. Though there was no teacher, <b>Babbit</b> had recruited a model to pose for him and his fellow animators as they drew. These [...] "classes" [...] were held weekly; each week, more animators would come. After three weeks, Walt Disney called <b>Babbit</b> to his office and offered to provide the supplies, working space and models required if the sessions were moved to the studio. <b>Babbit</b> ran the sessions for a month until animator Hardie Gramatky suggested that they recruit Don Graham; the art teacher from the Chouinard Institute taught his first class at the studio on November 15, 1932, and was joined by Phil Dike a few weeks later. These classes were principally concerned with human anatomy and movement, though instruction later included action analysis, animal anatomy and acting.|$|E

500|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. She had {{previously}} directed two short films, Frog Crossing (1996) and Sleeping Beauties (1999), {{both of which}} were shown at the Sundance Film Festival. She went on to direct the 2005 thriller The Quiet and the 2007 comedy Itty Bitty Titty Committee. <b>Babbit</b> and Sperling (as producer) secured financing from Michael Burns, then the vice president of Prudential Insurance (now Vice Chairman of Lions Gate Entertainment) after showing him the script at Sundance. According to <b>Babbit,</b> their one-sentence pitch was [...] "Two high-school girls fall in love at a reparative therapy camp." [...] Burns gave them an initial budget of US$500,000 which was increased to US$1 million when the film went into production.|$|E
500|$|When {{originally}} {{submitted to}} the Motion Picture Association of America rating board, But I'm a Cheerleader received an NC-17 rating. In {{order to get a}} commercially viable R rating, <b>Babbit</b> removed a two-second shot of Graham's hand sweeping Megan's clothed body, a camera pan up Megan's body when she is masturbating, and a comment that Megan [...] "ate Graham out" [...] (slang for cunnilingus). <b>Babbit</b> was interviewed by Kirby Dick for his 2006 documentary film This Film Is Not Yet Rated. A critique of the MPAA's rating system, it suggests that films with homosexual content are treated more stringently than those with only heterosexual content, and that scenes of female sexuality draw harsher criticism from the board than those of male sexuality. It compares this movie to American Pie (also released in 1999), which features a teenage boy masturbating and was given an R rating (though American Pie also originally received an NC-17 rating and also required cuts to its masturbation scene to reduce its rating to R). <b>Babbit</b> says that she felt discriminated against for making a gay film. The film was rated as M (for mature audiences) in Australia and in New Zealand, 14A in Canada, 12 in Germany and 15 in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|<b>Babbit,</b> {{whose mother}} runs {{a halfway house}} called New Directions for young people with drug and alcohol problems, had {{wanted to make a}} comedy about {{rehabilitation}} and the 12-step program. After reading an article about a man who had returned from a reparative therapy camp hating himself, she decided to combine the two ideas. With girlfriend Andrea Sperling, she {{came up with the idea}} for a feature film about a cheerleader who attends a reparative therapy camp. They wanted the main character to be a cheerleader because it is [...] "...the pinnacle of the American dream, and the American dream of femininity." [...] <b>Babbit</b> wanted the film to represent the lesbian experience from the femme perspective to contrast with several films of the time that represented the butch perspective (for example, Go Fish and The Watermelon Woman). She also wanted to satirize both the religious right and the gay community.|$|E
50|$|Shimizu {{was one of}} {{the stars}} of Foxfire, {{alongside}} Angelina Jolie. She also had a supporting role in Jamie <b>Babbit's</b> 2007 film Itty Bitty Titty Committee. Shimizu appeared in the third season of the here! original series Dante's Cove.|$|R

It was released by Sony Screen Gems worldwide.|$|R
500|$|Williams {{continued}} {{to perform in}} films as well. Her first mainstream production was in the slasher film [...] (1998). It was a financial success, making $55million against its $17million budget. Williams appeared with Kirsten Dunst in the comedy Dick (1999). The movie is a parody, recounting the Watergate scandal, {{which led to the}} resignation of U.S. President Richard Nixon. She began to do more challenging work, starting with a small part in But I'm a Cheerleader, directed by Jamie <b>Babbit.</b>|$|E
500|$|<b>Babbit</b> made a {{conscious}} effort to cast people of color for minor roles, in an effort to combat what she describes as [...] "racism at every level of making movies." [...] From the beginning she intended the characters of Mike (played by RuPaul), Dolph (Dante Basco) and Andre (Douglas Spain) to be African American, Asian and Hispanic, respectively. She initially considered Arsenio Hall for the character of Mike but says that Hall was uncomfortable about playing a gay-themed role. As Mike, RuPaul makes a rare film appearance out of drag.|$|E
500|$|But I'm a Cheerleader is {{not only}} about sexuality, but also gender and the social {{construction}} of gender roles. One {{of the ways in which}} <b>Babbit</b> highlighted what she called the artificiality of gender construction was by using intense blues and pinks in her production and costume design. Chris Holmlund in Contemporary American Independent Film notes this feature of the film and calls the costumes [...] "gender-tuned." [...] Ted Gideonse in Out magazine wrote that the costumes and colors of the film show how false the goals of True Directions are.|$|E
50|$|After {{graduating from}} Barnard College in 1993, <b>Babbit's</b> first job was as an {{assistant}} to the assistant for Martin Scorsese on The Age of Innocence.

500|$|The film's {{version of}} the Queen was created by Walt Disney and Joe Grant, and {{originally}} animated by Art <b>Babbit</b> and voiced by Lucille La Verne.

500|$|Gender {{roles are}} further {{reinforced}} by the tasks the campers have to perform in [...] "Step 2: Rediscovering Your Gender Identity." [...] Nikki Sullivan in A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory says that this rediscovery is shown to be difficult and unsuccessful rather than the natural discovery of their latent heterosexuality. Sullivan says that the film not only highlights {{the ways in which}} gender and sexuality are constructed but also takes the norms and truths about heteronormative society and renders them strange or [...] "queer." [...] Holmlund says that <b>Babbit</b> makes the straight characters less normal and less likable than the gay ones. Sullivan says that this challenge of heteronormativity makes But I'm a Cheerleader an exemplification of queer theory.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} {{the film to}} those of director John Waters but felt that it fell short of the mark. Stephanie Zacharek called it a [...] "Waters knockoff" [...] while Ebert said that Waters might have been ruder and more polished. <b>Babbit</b> says that although Waters {{is one of her}} influences, she did not want her film to have the [...] "bite" [...] of his. She states that whereas John Waters does not like romantic comedies, she wanted to tell a conventionally romantic story. The production design, which was important to the overall look and feel of the film, drew mixed responses. LaSalle described it as clever and eyecatching and James Berardinelli called it a standout feature. Others found it to be gaudy, dated, cartoonish and ghastly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} The Beauty Prize {{included}} {{a number of}} allusions to popular fads of the day: beauty competitions, mah-jong, and endurance dancing; while [...] "Meet me down on Main Street", with its refrain [...] "Oh, won't you meet me down on Main Street / Where the George F <b>Babbits</b> grow", explicitly referenced Sinclair Lewis's 1922 novel, Babbitt.|$|R
