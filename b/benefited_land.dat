40|$|Washington {{courts are}} free to enforce publicland use servitudes. Of the {{elements}} required for a servitude to run with the land, form, notice, and touch and concern on the burden side do not bar running. Only the touch and concern element applied on the benefit side is a potential bar. Washington conceivably could allow public land use servitudes to run with the land by following the minority position of not requiring touch and concern on the benefit side. A less stringent theory, however, is available to enforce public land use servitudes. Washington has not adopted a rule that public servitudes are always in gross when government does not directly own <b>benefited</b> <b>land.</b> Therefore, the courts {{are free to}} require touch and concern on the benefit side while recognizing that the requirement is met when the promise benefits land, regardless of ownership. Based on their past record, Washington courts probably will enforce public land use servitudes. The courts have recognized and responded {{to the need for}} land use control to manage growth and development in the state, thereby furthering both public zoning and private subdivision regulation. Accordingly, to be consistent, the courts must enforce public land use servitudes...|$|E

40|$|The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was {{probably}} the most popular of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs. Many studies have examined the contribution of the CCC in national and state parks and forests, but less attention has been directed towards soil conservation work performed by enrollees on farms and ranches across the country. This dissertation examines cultural landscapes created by the CCC on farms and ranches in Central Texas that are now part of the Fort Hood Military Reservation. Cultural landscapes created by the CCC in the 1930 s are significant because they represent large-scale federal government intervention into farming practices and planning on private land. Dramatic transformations occurred in both the conservation movement and on the land itself. This can be investigated through archaeological sites associated with activities of the CCC on Fort Hood from its period of operation (i. e., from 1933 to 1942). The significance of identified archaeological sites is evaluated based on the Secretary of the Interior's guidelines for evaluating archaeological sites for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. Through the CCC, America's civilians transformed millions of acres of land across the United States from 1933 to 1942 in an effort to conserve natural resources that had been severely overexploited in preceding decades. Soil conservation and other New Deal agricultural programs primarily <b>benefited</b> <b>land</b> owners, but research on Fort Hood suggests that some tenants and sharecroppers benefited as well. Soil conservation work performed by the CCC on private land changed the way America's farming population operated their farms and included ordinary farmers in the conservation movement. Conservation was no longer the sole concern of academics, but through the efforts of federal, state, and local governments, became a major concern of ordinary farmers. This study also explores how rural planning efforts involved farmers in the decision-making process more than ever before. The reorganization of the rural landscape of Central Texas attests to the degree to which conservation measures were accepted by individual farmers...|$|E

As well as economic and tenure strategies, people have taken up cultivation because of state pressure to grow crops, with countries such as Tanzania holding up farming (and the land conversion that inevitably accompanies it) as a national ideal, continually emphasised through the school system and the media (Bishop 2007).|$|R

It shows that the introduction of diversion programs tends to <b>benefit</b> <b>land</b> owners while harming operators.

Diversion programs tend to raise land prices lass than proportional to the increases in rental rates.

Participation in voluntary government programs tends to be greater in regions with higher costs, less efficient marginal technology and less efficient marginal land. Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study agricultural-urban land {{allocation}} {{in light of}} the rising amenity value of agricultural landscape. A given land area is to be allocated between a number of agricultural activities (crops) and urban use. Each activity (crop) area generates private benefits (profit from agricultural produce) and amenity benefits (open space, aesthetic landscape, hiking trails). Land allocated for housing provides only private <b>benefits.</b> <b>Land</b> markets overlook the social (environmental) role of agricultural land and as a result lead to undersupply of farmland. In an empirical study of an Israeli case, we find the undersupply of farmland and the associated deadweight loss to be substantial. Investigating effects of population and income growth processes, we find that, contrary to market outcomes, the socially optimal allocation may call for more farmland preservation under either process. ...|$|R
