5|$|Cole {{once again}} found {{himself with a}} chance in the Bayern box, but keeper Oliver Kahn hurried out of his goal to punch the ball to safety. At the other end, Basler came close with another free kick before Alexander Zickler sent a shot just wide {{from the edge of}} the box. As half time approached, United winger Ryan Giggs, playing out of {{position}} on the right, sent a weak header towards Kahn from a Cole cross, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> as close as they were to come to a goal in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Corman later said, I’m {{weary of}} {{prepackaged}} formulas, {{and when you}} try out a new idea, you necessarily think about shooting a hackneyed scene {{in a funny way}} without resorting to parody. This wasn’t a parody, it was “Good God, how can I find a different sort of gunslinger?” Right away, I thought of a woman gunslinger, and the idea for the script came to me all of a sudden. It was the sheriff’s wife. He’s killed and she takes over for her husband. It was logical when it wasn’t, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> enough for a six-or seven-day western.|$|E

5|$|Early script drafts had Henry accidentally kill Louise Mortimer, but {{producers}} {{were never}} satisfied with this development, thinking Henry would have failed if she died. Writers also posited that Henry's father's murder involved revenge {{after he had}} an affair, but the producers and Gatiss {{found it easier to}} mention he died because he learned of Franklin's experiments with the hallucinogenic gas. The ending also changed; the final scene had originally involved Moriarty entering the Tower of London <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> held back for the following episode.|$|E

This examined {{what sort of}} system {{would be needed to}} provide protection against an unsophisticated attack with a limited number of warheads. Using Zeus EX, a few bases could provide coverage for the entire US. The system would be unable to deal with large numbers of warheads, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not a concern for a system that would only be tasked with beating off small attacks.|$|E
5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E
5|$|On March 28, 1941, Seaborg, {{physicist}} Emilio Segrè and Kennedy {{were able}} to demonstrate not only the presence of plutonium, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> fissile, an important distinction that was crucial to the decisions made in directing Manhattan Project research. Arthur Wahl then began exploring the chemistry of the newly discovered element.

5|$|Riegels did play, and {{he turned}} in a stellar second half performance, {{including}} blocking a Tech punt. In addition, Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not enough. Tech would ultimately win the game and their second national championship 8–7. Georgia Tech's safety score after the wrong way run made {{the difference in the}} outcome of the game, which increased the significance of Roy's mistake. In spite of the loss, the example of how the distraught Riegels was persuaded to pick himself up, return to the field and play so hard during the second half is sometimes used by motivational speakers to illustrate overcoming setbacks.|$|E
5|$|The America West Arena has {{a maximum}} {{capacity}} of 19,000, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> reduced for SummerSlam 2003. The event grossed over US$715,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 16,113, the maximum allowed. This was later confirmed by Linda McMahon, WWE CEO, {{in a press}} release on August26, 2003. The event resulted in 415,000pay-per-view buys (a 0.88 pay-per-view buyrate). The promotion's pay-per-view revenue was $24.7million.|$|E
5|$|The Dąbrowski Legion {{was first}} used against Austrians and their allies in Italy. In March 1797 it garrisoned Mantua, {{and by the end}} of the month it took part in its first combat during the Ten Days of Brescia. By the end of April the ranks of the Legion had swelled to 5,000. At that time Dąbrowski lobbied for a plan to push through to the Polish territories in Galicia, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} rejected by Napoleon who instead decided to use those troops on the Italian front. In April, the Legion took part in quelling the uprising in Verona, known as Veronese Easters. The Treaty of Leoben signed that month, which promised peace between Austrians and French, was a blow to Polish morale, but Dąbrowski correctly assumed that it would not last.|$|E

5|$|The French {{operations}} in the area were hampered {{by a lack of}} a suitable base close to the mouth of the Adriatic; the British had given the French free access to Malta, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> hundreds of miles away. The Austrians also possessed several submarines, one of which torpedoed the dreadnought Jean Bart in December 1914. This threat from underwater weapons greatly limited French naval activities in the Adriatic. As the war progressed, the French eventually settled on Corfu as their primary naval base in the area. Later in the war, Démocratie was sent to Mudros along with her sister ships to reinforce the blockade of the Dardanelles.|$|E
5|$|The Kemper Arena has {{a maximum}} {{capacity}} of 18,344, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> reduced for New Year' Revolution (2007). The maximum attendance that was allowed was 10,000. The event received 220,000 pay-per-view buys, which {{was less than}} the 294,000 buys the previous year's event received. The promotion's revenue was $107.4million, which was greater than the previous year's revenue of $95.1. Canadian Online Explorer rated the overall event, {{as well as the}} main event, a six out of ten. None of the matches received a rating higher than a 7.5 out of 10. The match between Mickie James and Victoria was rated a three out of 10, the lowest overall.|$|E
5|$|The Presidio La Bahía {{was moved}} from the Guadalupe River to Goliad on the San Antonio River in 1749. Within five years, a new mission for the Karankawa tribes, Nuestra Señora del Rosario de los Cuhanes, was built {{upstream}} of the presidio. This mission survived for many years. Despite the new missions and presidios, Texas {{was one of the}} least populated provinces on the northern frontier of New Spain. By 1760, almost 1,200Hispanic people lived in Texas, with half in San Antonio, 350 at Los Adaes, and 260 at La Bahía.

5|$|The first XFR-1 {{made its}} first flight on 25 June 1944 without its jet engine, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} shortly afterward. The second prototype first flew on 20 September 1944. Test flights confirmed wind tunnel tests that revealed a lack of longitudinal stability because {{the center of gravity}} had been miscalculated. In addition, the circular rear fuselage of the FR-1 gave less stability than the slab-style fuselage of the Grumman F4F Wildcat that was used {{as a model for the}} stability calculations. A new tail with enlarged vertical and horizontal stabilizers was designed and retrofitted to the prototypes. The original Douglas double-slotted flaps proved to be unsatisfactory during flight testing, but all three prototypes and the first 14 production aircraft were built with them before they were replaced with a single-slotted flap.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} intended to include an online multi-player offering, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> later canceled.

The game was released in North America on October 6, 2009, for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with other countries and the Microsoft Windows platforms being released at later times in 2009.
