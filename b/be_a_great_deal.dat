However, following the collapse of the USSR, the newly independent republics became host to most of the formations with modern equipment, whereas Russia was left with lower-category units, usually with older equipment. As financial stringency began to bite harder, the amount of new equipment fell as well, and by 1998, only ten tanks and about 30 BMP infantry fighting vehicles were being purchased each year.|$|E
25|$|The next {{foray into}} the {{building}} did not occur until the daylight hours. Chief Nevins had his District Engineers organize recovery parties. Except for a short segment of the vestibule, the building had mainly collapsed into the cellar and burned until the wood was consumed. What first appeared to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of rubbish in the cellar underneath the vestibule {{turned out to be}} largely human remains, a large mass of people which had fallen into twisted and distorted positions and then burned. These were mainly from the gallery and the stairway, which, in the original structure, had been above the vestibule ceiling against the south wall of the building.|$|E
25|$|Doppler shift {{studies of}} galaxy {{clusters}} by Fritz Zwicky in 1937 {{found that most}} galaxies were moving much faster than seemed to be possible from what was known about {{the mass of the}} cluster. Zwicky hypothesized that there must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of non-luminous matter in the galaxy clusters, which became known as dark matter. Since his discovery, astronomers have determined that a large portion of galaxies (and most of the universe) is made up of dark matter. In 2003, however, four galaxies (NGC 821, NGC 3379, NGC 4494, and NGC 4697) were found to have little to no dark matter influencing the motion of the stars contained within them; the reason behind the lack of dark matter is unknown.|$|E

25|$|Because most if not {{all stars}} form clustered, star {{clusters}} are to be viewed the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The violent gas-expulsion events that shape and destroy many star clusters at birth leave their imprint in the morphological and kinematical structures of galaxies. Most open clusters form with at least 100 stars and a mass of 50 or more solar masses. The largest clusters can have 104 solar masses, with the massive cluster Westerlund 1 being estimated at 5 × 104 solar masses; close to that of a globular cluster. While open clusters and globular clusters form two fairly distinct groups, there may not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of difference in appearance between a very sparse globular cluster and a very rich open cluster. Some astronomers believe the two types of star clusters form via the same basic mechanism, with the difference being that the conditions that allowed the formation of the very rich globular clusters containing hundreds of thousands of stars no longer prevail in the Milky Way.|$|E
500|$|Writer Brannon Braga {{initially}} {{conceived of}} the episode as centered on Captain Picard, rather than Worf. It was only when planning out the story that he realised that there would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of personal differences across realities with Picard. As such, he decided to include Worf as the main character, and chose to place him in a romance with Troi as he felt {{that most people would}} not have expected it. Braga considered writing Tasha Yar into the episode, but he felt that this would have copied [...] "Yesterday's Enterprise", so he replaced her with Wesley Crusher, played by Wil Wheaton. Further changes were made to the script as Braga had intended for Worf to be sung [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] in the Klingon language, but the cost for the rights to the song would have been prohibitive and so the idea was dropped.|$|E
500|$|From the beginning, the battleships of Division Nine faced a hard task in {{adapting}} to the new methods and practices they encountered in the Grand Fleet. Any difficulties, however, that might have arisen from this transition based on national pride or rivalry were dissipated {{in large part by}} the professional example set by Admiral Rodman himself. As he would later note of his squadron's assimilation: [...] "I realized that the British fleet had had three years of actual warfare and knew the game from the ground floor up; that while we might know it theoretically, there would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> to learn practically. There could not be two independent commands in one force if our work was to be harmonious, and the only logical course was to amalgamate our ships and serve under the command of the British commander-in-chief." [...] This cooperative attitude trickled down through the division, and elicited the admiration and appreciation of the British.|$|E

500|$|In February 1926, Churchill's {{political}} colleague Sir Samuel Hoare {{described a}} visit {{in a letter}} to the press baron Lord Beaverbrook; [...] "I have never seen Winston before in the role of landed proprietor,... the engineering works on which he is engaged consist of making a series of ponds in a valley and Winston appeared to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> more interested in them than in anything else in the world". In January 1928, James Lees-Milne stayed as a guest of Churchill's son Randolph. He described an evening after dinner; [...] "We remained at that round table till after midnight. Mr Churchill spent a blissful two hours demonstrating with decanters and wine glasses how the Battle of Jutland was fought. He got worked up like a schoolboy, making barking noises in imitation of gunfire, and blowing cigar smoke across the battle scene in imitation of gun smoke". On 26 September 1927 Churchill composed the first of his Chartwell Bulletins, which were lengthy letters to Clementine, written to her while she was abroad. In the bulletins, Churchill described in great detail the ongoing works on the house and the gardens, and aspects of his life there. The 26 September letter opens with a report of Churchill's deepening interest in painting; [...] "Sickert arrived on Friday night and we worked very hard at various paintings... I am really thrilled... I see my way to paint far better pictures than I ever thought possible before".|$|E

2500|$|Once the {{butterfly}} completes its metamorphosis, {{it has a}} number of defensive mechanisms in place to avoid predation. [...] One of the most easily identifiable traits is the bright eyespots found on the wings. These eyespots are essentially concentric circle {{of a wide variety of}} colours. [...] Apart from the wide range of colours, eyespots are very limited in their plasticity. There are three main hypothesis to why these spots may have developed; they resemble the eyes of an enemy of the predator in order to intimidate them, they draw the attention of the predator to less vital components of {{the butterfly}}'s body, or the spots are there simply to surprise the predator. [...] The only disadvantage to these spots is that they cause the butterfly to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> more conspicuous.|$|E

A {{friendly}} visit to Wolverhampton Wanderers on a slippery surface was ended with 15 minutes still to go, because of rain and poor visibility, with Wanderers 2–0 ahead. Although a Small Heath team weakened by injury beat Lincoln City 4–0, the Birmingham Daily Post suggested that [...] "if the forwards would learn to understand each other's movements and play a collective game, {{instead of trying to}} shine individually, the result would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> more beneficial" [...] to the club.

2500|$|Pekka Pyykkö divides these superactinides {{into three}} series: a 5g series (elements 121 to 138), an 8p1/2 series (elements 139 to 140), and a 6f series (elements 141 to 155), {{although}} noting {{that there would}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> of overlapping between energy levels and that the 6f, 7d, or 8p1/2 orbitals could well also be occupied in the early superactinide atoms or ions. He also expects that they would behave more like [...] "superlanthanides", {{in the sense that}} the 5g electrons would mostly be chemically inactive, similarly to how only one or two 4f electrons in each lanthanide are ever ionized in chemical compounds. He also predicted that the possible oxidation states of the superactinides might rise very high in the 6f series, to values such as +12 in element 148.|$|E

Keith Flett said: [...] "It {{is likely to be}} correct that despite William Hague's professed policy of transparency towards the release of government files from the colonial era that far from everything will be released and it will depend on the skills of historians to spot gaps in the record." [...] Elkins, who, like Anderson, is an expert witness for the Mau Mau legal action, highlighted the need for caution, and wrote of her involvement with trying to get files out of the foreign office for analysis back at Harvard: [...] "This process has been anything but straightforward. Despite the legal context, the FCO has culled files, requiring multiple requests for full disclosure, and still files have not been forthcoming." [...] Of the April 2012 release, she noted that it [...] "excludes territories such as Palestine and Rhodesia. The Cyprus files exclude the period of the emergency. The Malaya files cover very little of the contested emergency years. The Kenya documents are a meagre subset of the files released (though culled) {{in the context of the}} Mau Mau case. For all 12 colonies covered in today's release, there appears to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> pertaining to finance, tourism, administration and the like. ...
