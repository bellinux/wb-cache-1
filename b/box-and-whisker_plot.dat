50|$|In {{descriptive}} statistics, a {{box plot}} or boxplot {{is a method}} for graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Box plots may also have lines extending vertically from the boxes (whiskers) indicating variability outside {{the upper and lower}} quartiles, hence the terms <b>box-and-whisker</b> <b>plot</b> and box-and-whisker diagram. Outliers may be plotted as individual points.Box plots are non-parametric: they display variation in samples of a statistical population without making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution. The spacings between the different parts of the box indicate the degree of dispersion (spread) and skewness in the data, and show outliers. In addition to the points themselves, they allow one to visually estimate various L-estimators, notably the interquartile range, midhinge, range, mid-range, and trimean. Box plots can be drawn either horizontally or vertically. Box plots received their name from the box in the middle.|$|E

30|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of the data was carried out using MINITAB® 17 (Minitab Inc., State College, PA, USA) software. A <b>box-and-whisker</b> <b>plot</b> was developed to assess and compare the fungal pellet size distribution. The box plot represents the pellet-size distribution graph with the first quartile Q 1 (with 25  % of the data values), the median (with half of the data values) and the third quartile Q 3 (with 75  % of the data values), with pellet diameter obtained at varying culture conditions (agitation) as the major variable. By default the upper and lower whiskers extend to the highest and lowest data value (among the distribution), respectively. A MINITAB® 17 generated histogram, with a Gaussian curve maximum was used to assess the size distribution and the average pellet diameter from the bench-scale reactors. A sample size of 50 or 100 pellets, from the shake flask or bench-scale reactor culture (respectively), was measured to obtain the pellet size distribution.|$|E

This study compared three established methods of extracting DNA from feathers to ascertain if any produced a greater quantity of DNA. Each of the methods were conducted at five different time intervals (n= 45). Each was a modification of the Qiagen DNeasy DNA extraction kit. A two way ANOVA determined if there was any differences among times or methods, and showed a significance difference among methods (F= 45. 67, P < 0. 001) but not times.

Materials and Methods: From 2009 to 2014, we enrolled 55 ovarian cancer patients (total 67 courses) including first-line, persistent, platinum-sensitive, or platinum-resistant disease in MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Weekly pretreatment complete blood counts and calculated ratios [platelet/neutrophil ratio, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil/monocyte ratio, platelet/monocyte ratio, lymphocyte/monocyte ratio] during dose-dense chemotherapy were collected. By grouping these hematologic biomarkers into three different response subgroups (responsive, stable, and nonresponsive) according to CA 125 trend, the data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, and using post hoc-Tukey test for comparing each other. A p value < 0. 05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results: Absolute counts of lymphocytes and platelets, PLR, platelet/neutrophil ratio, platelet/monocyte ratio (all p < 0. 001), and NLR (p= 0. 013) had statistically significant differences. Moreover, using <b>box-and-whisker</b> <b>plot,</b> absolute count of lymphocyte, PLR, and NLR showed most remarkable discrepancy in responsive, stable, and nonresponsive patients. Subgroup analysis for primary, platinum-sensitive, and platinum-resistant patients further revealed that PLR and NLR were significantly correlated to the outcome of dose-dense chemotherapy.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} for learning models to achieve high classification performances with imbalanced data sets, because with imbalanced data sets, {{when one of the}} classes is much larger than the others, most machine learning and data mining classifiers are overly influenced by the larger classes and ignore the smaller ones. As a result, the classification algorithms often have poor learning performances due to slow convergence in the smaller classes. To balance such data sets, this paper presents a strategy that involves reducing the sizes of the majority data and generating synthetic samples for the minority data. In the reducing operation, we use the <b>box-and-whisker</b> <b>plot</b> approach to exclude outliers and the Mega-Trend-Diffusion method to find representative data from the majority data. To generate the synthetic samples, we propose a counterintuitive hypothesis to find the distributed shape of the minority data, and then produce samples according to this distribution. Four real datasets were used to examine the performance of the proposed approach. We used paired t-tests to compare the Accuracy, G-mean, and F-measure scores of the proposed data pre-processing (PPDP) method merging in the D 3 C method (PPDP+D 3 C) with those of the one-sided selection (OSS), the well-known SMOTEBoost (SB) study, and the normal distribution-based oversampling (NDO) approach, and the proposed data pre-processing (PPDP) method.

Among 1533 seasonal H 1 N 1 viruses tested, 1431 (93. 3 %) were outliers for oseltamivir; they all harbored the H 275 Y mutation in the neuraminidase (NA) and were reported as oseltamivir-resistant. Only 15 (0. 7 %) of pandemic 2009 H 1 N 1 viruses tested (n = 2259) were resistant to oseltamivir. All influenza A(H 3 N 2) (n = 834) and B (n = 914) viruses were sensitive to oseltamivir, except for one A(H 3 N 2) and one B virus, with D 151 V and D 197 E (D 198 E in N 2 numbering) mutations in the NA, respectively.

The first level of visualization was at the single station or grouped stations using the <b>box-and-whisker</b> <b>plot</b> as a graphical/statistical tool. This plot {{was used to compare}} intra-annual variability and correlation between total phosphorus (TP) and chlorophyll a (chl a) at a site in Florida Bay. Secondly, time was added as a dimension to produce a 9 -year, monthly time series plot of declining salinity at a site in NE Florida Bay. It was shown how a centred moving average could be used to smooth out the noise and disclose inter-annual oscillations. Time series of anomalies from long term means were discussed as a means of displaying correspondence and coupling among variables. Thirdly, the utility of 2 -D contour maps of variables was demonstrated in showing sources and mixing of fresh water across the hydroscape as well as nutrient loading to the South Florida ecosystem. From this expanded spatial view, it was observed that the water quality of different bays and coastal areas are differentially affected both by external and internal processes and how management of pump operations and canal conductance can overwhelm the natural hydrological cycle and have far reaching impacts in Florida Bay and the SW Florida Shelf. We also showed that contouring was useful for elucidating causal relationships among variables over the spatial domain. Time step animations of monthly salinity contours in Florida Bay showed the importance of mixing with western boundary waters to alleviation of hypersaline conditions.

The societal and economic impact due to such storms made accurate prediction of the weather phenomenon a serious concern for the meteorologists of India. The initiation of such storms requires sufficient moisture in lower troposphere, high surface temperature, conditional instability and a source of lift to initiate the convection. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) {{is a measure of the}} energy realized when conditional instability is released. It plays an important role in meso-scale convective systems. Convective inhibition energy (CINE) on the other hand acts as a possible barrier to the release of convection even in the presence of high value of CAPE. The main idea of the present study is to see whether a consistent quantitative range of CAPE and CINE can be identified for the prevalence of such thunderstorms that may aid in operational forecast. A statistical – fuzzy coupled method is implemented for the purpose. The result reveals that a definite range of CINE within 0 – 150 Jkg- 1 is reasonably pertinent whereas no such range of CAPE depicts any consistency for the occurrence of severe thunderstorms over Kolkata. The measure of CINE mainly depends upon the altitude of the level of free convection (LFC), surface temperature (T) and surface mixing ratio (q). The <b>box-and-whisker</b> <b>plot</b> of LFC, T and q are drawn to select the most dependable parameter for the consistency of CINE in the prevalence of such thunderstorms.

Plots C and D consider all measurements by displaying specimen {{scores in the}} two axes of a Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA). In this MDA, the first axis accounts for 82. 3 % and the second axis for 17. 7 % of the variance. Crosses and vertical lines within gray boxes represent, respectively, means and medians. Gray box widths span the interval between the 25 th and 75 th percentiles, containing the middle 50 % of the data points. Horizontal lines, or " whiskers ", extend this interval to the 10 th and 90 th percentiles, containing 80 % of the data points. At least nine data points are required to compute the 10 th and 90 th percentiles, hence no whiskers are plotted for S. a. caripana. Open circles represent potential outliers.
