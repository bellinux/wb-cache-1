She is ugly, but particularly pleasing, and with no sort of form about her. Her husband, Prince Radziwill, is much the most agreeable man I have ever seen here, and they have a great many <b>beautiful</b> <b>children,</b> particularly a little girl of ten years old, who is the most graceful little creature I have ever saw, and who has taken a great fancy to me. The youngest, a baby of nine months old, is beautiful".|$|E

To make a young child grow up to be strong and healthy, mothers drew them through a split sapling or young tree. Even more wonderful, as medicine for the country itself, the oak had power to heal. The new land sometimes suffered from disease called the val [...] When sick with the val, the ground sunk. Then people, houses, churches, barns and cattle all went down, out of sight, and were lost forever, in a flood of water." ...|$|E

60|$|As we rode on {{we found}} that the news of our coming had spread through the village. People came and stood in their doors, beckoning, bowing, smiling, and waving their handkerchiefs, and the {{carriage}} was several times stopped by persons who came to offer flowers. I remember, in particular, a group of young girls brought to the carriage two of the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>children</b> I ever saw, whose little hands literally deluged us with flowers.|$|E
6000|$|Some years afterwards, {{when two}} <b>beautiful</b> <b>children</b> {{had been born}} to them, Lady Windermere came down {{on a visit to}} Alton Priory, a lovely old place, that had been the Duke's wedding present to his son; and one {{afternoon}} as she was sitting with Lady Arthur under a lime-tree in the garden, watching the little boy and girl as they played up and down the rose-walk, like fitful sunbeams, she suddenly took her hostess's hand in hers, and said, 'Are you happy, Sybil?' ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was a real}} summer day; large, round, glossy, fleecy clouds, {{as white}} and shining as glaciers, studded with their immense and immoveable forms the deep blue sky. There {{was not even a}} summer breeze, though the air was mellow, balmy, and exhilarating. There was a bloom upon the trees, the waters glittered, the {{prismatic}} wild-fowl dived, breathed again, and again disappeared. <b>Beautiful</b> <b>children,</b> fresh and sweet as the new-born rose, glanced about with the gestures and sometimes the voices of Paradise. And in the distance rose the sacred towers of the great Western Minster.|$|E

60|$|There is a {{good deal}} to be said against war. I am not {{prepared}} to maintain that war did not bring with it disadvantages, but {{there can be no doubt}} that, for the noblest work of Nature--the making of men--it was a splendid manufactory. It taught men courage. It trained them in promptness and determination, in strength of brain and strength of hand. From its stern lessons they learned fortitude in suffering, coolness in danger, cheerfulness under reverses. Chivalry, Reverence, and Loyalty are the <b>beautiful</b> <b>children</b> of ugly War. But, above all gifts, the greatest gift it gave to men was stanchness.|$|E
6000|$|Three sturdy little girls, {{with a year}} step {{between each}} of them, stood up to receive Lady Beach-Mandarin's invasion; an {{indeterminate}} baby sprawled regardless of its dignity on a rug. [...] "Aah!" [...] cried Lady Beach-Mandarin, advancing in open order. [...] "Come and be hugged, you dears! Come and be hugged!" [...] Before she knelt down and enveloped their shrinking little persons Mr. Brumley was able to observe that they were pretty little things, but not the <b>beautiful</b> <b>children</b> he could have imagined from Lady Harman. Peeping through their infantile delicacy, hints all too manifest of Sir Isaac's characteristically pointed nose gave Mr. Brumley a peculiar--a eugenic, qualm.|$|E
60|$|By the {{interest}} of his friends he procured a judicial situation of sufficient emolument, but of local duty; and to fulfil this duty he was obliged to reside in North Wales. The locality, indeed, suited him well, for he was sick of the world at nine-and-twenty; and, carrying his beautiful and newly-married wife from the world, which without him she could not love, Mr. Cleveland enjoyed all the luxuries of a cottage orn√©e in the most romantic part of the Principality.

Until recently, no matches had been found and Sharon's identity remained a mystery.|$|R

6000|$|God's Garden is a well-meaning {{attempt to}} use Nature for {{theological}} and educational purposes. It belongs to that antiquated school of thought that, {{in spite of the}} discoveries of modern science, invites the sluggard to look at the ant, and the idle to imitate the bee. It is full of false analogies and dull eighteenth-century didactics. It tells us that the flowering cactus should remind us that a dwarf may possess mental and moral qualities, that the mountain ash should teach us the precious fruits of affliction, and that a fond father should learn from the example of the chestnut that the most <b>beautiful</b> <b>children</b> often turn out badly! We must admit that we have no sympathy with this point of view, and we strongly protest against the idea that ...|$|E
