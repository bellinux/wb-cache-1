50|$|Bruns {{nystagmus}} is {{an unusual}} type of bilateral nystagmus most commonly occurring in patients with cerebellopontine angle tumours. It {{is caused by the}} combination of slow, large amplitude nystagmus (gaze paretic nystagmus) when looking towards the side of the lesion, and rapid, small amplitude nystagmus (vestibular nystagmus) when looking away {{from the side of the}} lesion. It occurs in 11% of patients with vestibular schwannoma, and occurs mainly in patients with larger tumours (67% of patients with tumours over 3.5 cm diameter). Bruns nystagmus is also associated with an increased incidence of <b>balance</b> <b>disturbance</b> in patients with vestibular schwannoma. It may be caused by the compression of both flocculi, the vestibular part of the cerebellum, and improvement in both the nystagmus and balance problems occur commonly after removal of the tumour.|$|E

40|$|Background: Balance {{has been}} found to be {{decreased}} in chronic neck pain (CNP) patients of both idiopathic and traumatic onset. Balance has been recommended to be tested in CNP patients. However, there exists no clinical balance test valid for this population. Purpose: The purpose with this study was to increase knowledge about balance tests that could pick out CNP subjects with <b>balance</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Aim: To explore if the modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction and Balance (mCTSIB) along with adjunct positions can pick out the CNP subjects with <b>balance</b> <b>disturbances.</b> Methods: A pilot, cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 subjects with CNP (&# 8805; 3 - month duration) and with Neck Disability Index (NDI) &# 8805; 10 out of 50, who were recruited from an outpatient clinic in Southwestern Norway. Balance was assessed using the mCTSIB (four test conditions) along with six adjunct test conditions. Each test condition was held for 30 seconds. Results: The mCTSIB demonstrated a ceiling effect. The adjunct positions with the eyes closed in tandem and especially one-leg standing appear to provide an indication of <b>balance</b> <b>disturbances</b> in CNP subjects. No associations were found between results on balance tests and NDI, pain intensity, or dizziness status. When using a 10 -second cut- off score obtained from normative data, there was, in this study, a 20 % failure rate for subjects to reach the cut-off score in tandem standing with the eyes closed and 80 % in one- leg standing with the eyes-closed. Conclusion: As a result of a low sample size, limited conclusions can be drawn.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is the {{methodology}} of optimal choice of firefighters to solve difficult rescue tasks. 27 firefighters were analyzed: aged from 22 – 50 years of age, and with 2 – 27 years of work experience. Body <b>balance</b> <b>disturbance</b> tolerance skills (BBDTS) measured by the ‘Rotational Test’ (RT) and time of transition (back and forth) on a 4 meter beam located 3 meters above the ground, was the criterion for simulation of a rescue task (SRT).

The correlation of the RT and SRT results with 3 criteria for estimating BBDTS and 2 categories ranged from 0. 478 (p< 0. 01) – 0. 884 (p< 0. 01) and the results of SRT 0. 911 (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Otosclerosis is a {{disorder}} that impairs middle ear function, leading to conductive hearing loss. Surgical treatment results in large improvement of hearing at low sound frequencies, but high-frequency hearing often suffers. A likely {{reason for this}} is that inner ear sensory cells are damaged by surgical trauma and loud sounds generated during the operation. Animal studies have shown that antioxidants such as N-Acetylcysteine can protect the inner ear from noise, surgical trauma, and some ototoxic substances, but it is not known if this works in humans. This trial was performed to determine whether antioxidants improve surgical results at high frequencies. We performed a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial at three Swedish university clinics. Using block-stratified randomization, 156 adult patients undergoing stapedotomy were assigned to intravenous N-Acetylcysteine (150 mg/kg body weight) or matching placebo (1 : 1 ratio), starting one hour before surgery. The primary outcome was the hearing threshold at 6 and 8 kHz; secondary outcomes included the severity of tinnitus and vertigo. One year after surgery, high-frequency hearing had improved 2. 7 ± 3. 8 dB in the placebo group (67 patients analysed) and 2. 4 ± 3. 7 dB in the treated group (72 patients; means ± 95 % confidence interval, p = 0. 54; linear mixed model).

40|$|CONTEXT: An {{estimated}} 300   000 sport-related concussion injuries {{occur in}} the United States annually. Approximately 30 % of individuals with concussions experience balance disturbances. Common methods of balance assessment include the Clinical Test of Sensory Organization and Balance (CTSIB), the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and the Romberg test; however, the National Collegiate Athletic Association recommended the Wii Fit as an alternative measure of balance in athletes with a concussion. A central concern regarding {{the implementation of the}} Wii Fit is whether it is reliable and valid for measuring <b>balance</b> <b>disturbance</b> in athletes with concussion. OBJECTIVE: To examine the reliability and validity evidence for the CTSIB, SOT, BESS, Romberg test, and Wii Fit for detecting <b>balance</b> <b>disturbance</b> in athletes with a concussion. DATA SOURCES: Literature considered for review included publications with reliability and validity data for the assessments of balance (CTSIB, SOT, BESS, Romberg test, and Wii Fit) from PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. DATA EXTRACTION: We identified 63 relevant articles for consideration in the review. Of the 63 articles, 28 were considered appropriate for inclusion and 35 were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: No current reliability or validity information supports the use of the CTSIB, SOT, Romberg test, or Wii Fit for balance assessment in athletes with a concussion. The BESS demonstrated moderate to high reliability (interclass correlation coefficient = 0. 87) and low to moderate validity (sensitivity = 34 %, specificity = 87 %). However, the Romberg test and Wii Fit {{have been shown to be}} reliable tools in the assessment of balance in Parkinson patients. CONCLUSIONS: The BESS can evaluate balance problems after a concussion. However, it lacks the ability to detect balance problems after the third day of recovery. Further investigation is needed to establish the use of the CTSIB, SOT, Romberg test, and Wii Fit for assessing balance in athletes with concussion...|$|E
