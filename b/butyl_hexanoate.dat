In addition to codling moth, field trapping studies were conducted with oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck), obliquebanded leafroller Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris), the leafroller Pandemis pyrusana Kearfott, and the eyespotted budmoth, Spilonota ocellana (Denis and Schiffermüller). HPVs included ethyl (E,Z) - 2, 4 -decadienoate (pear ester), (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene, <b>butyl</b> <b>hexanoate,</b> (E) -β-ocimene, (E) -β-farnesene, and farnesol. Three types of GAA co-lures differing in a 10 -fold range in weekly evaporation rates were tested. The evaporation rate of GAA co-lures was an important factor affecting moth catches. The highest rate tested captured fewer codling moth but more leafrollers and eyespotted budmoth. GAA co-lures caught both sexes of each species. The field life of <b>butyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> and (E) -β-ocimene lures were much shorter than pear ester or sex pheromone lures. Adding GAA to pear ester or to (E) -β-ocimene significantly increased the catches of only codling moth or oriental fruit moth, respectively. Combining pear ester or (E) -β-ocimene with GAA did not affect the catch of either species compared with the single more attractive HPV. Adding HPVs to GAA did not increase the catches of either leafroller species or eyespotted budmoth. Traps baited with pear ester, sex pheromone, and GAA for monitoring codling moth were also effective in classifying pest pressure of both leafroller species within orchards...|$|E
40|$|The {{volatile}} compositions from {{organic and}} conventional passion fruit pulps produced in Brazil were investigated. The pulps were also physicochemically characterized. The volatile compounds from the headspace {{of the passion}} fruit pulp were stripped to a Porapak Q trap for 2 hours; they were eluted with 300 µL of dichloromethane, separated by gas chromatography/flame ionisation detection and identified through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Both pulps conformed {{to the requirements of}} the Brazilian legislation, indicating they were suitable to be industrialized and consumed. A total of 77 compounds were detected in the headspace of the passion fruit pulps - 60 of which were identified, comprising 91 % of the total chromatogram area. The major compounds were the following: ethyl butanoate, 52 % and 57 % of the total relative area of the chromatogram for the organic and conventional passion fruit pulps, respectively; ethyl hexanoate, 22 % and 9 %, respectively; and hexyl butanoate, 2 % and 5 %, respectively. The aroma of the organic passion fruit pulp is mainly related to the following volatile compounds: ethyl hexanoate, methyl hexanoate, &# 946;-myrcene and D-limonene. The conventional passion fruit pulp presented methyl butanoate, butyl acetate, hexanal, 1 -butanol, butyl butanoate, trans- 3 -hexenyl acetate, cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, <b>butyl</b> <b>hexanoate,</b> hexyl butanoate, 3 -hexenyl butanoate and 3 -hexenyl hexanoate as the main volatile compounds for aroma...|$|E
40|$|The enzyme system AlkBGT from Pseudomonas putida GPo 1 can {{efficiently}} ω-functionalize {{fatty acid}} methyl esters. Outer membrane protein AlkL boosts this ω-functionalization. In this report, it is shown that whole cells of Escherichia coli expressing the AlkBGT system can also ω-oxidize ethyl nonanoate (NAEE). Coexpression of AlkBGT and AlkL resulted in 1. 7 -fold-higher ω-oxidation activity on NAEE. With this strain, initial activity on NAEE was 70 U/g (dry weight) of cells (g cdw), 67 % {{of the initial}} activity on methyl nonanoate. In time-lapse conversions with 5 mMNAEE the main product was 9 -hydroxy NAEE (3. 6 mM), but also 9 -oxo NAEE (0. 1 mM) and 9 -carboxy NAEE (0. 6 mM) were formed. AlkBGT also ω-oxidized ethyl, propyl, and butyl esters of fatty acids ranging from C 6 to C 10. Increasing {{the length of the}} alkyl chain improved the ω-oxidation activity of AlkBGT on esters of C 6 and C 7 fatty acids. From these esters, application of <b>butyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> resulted in the highest ω-oxidation activity, 82 U/g cdw. Coexpression of AlkL only had a positive effect on ω-functionalization of substrates with a total length of C 11 or longer. These findings indicate that AlkBGT(L) can be applied as a biocatalyst for ω-functionalization of ethyl, propyl, and butyl esters of medium-chain fatty acids. </p...|$|E

Using headspace gas chromatography with electroantennographic and flame ionization detection in parallel, followed by GC-MS analysis, 1 -butanol, methyl butanoate, ethyl 2 -methylpropanoate, ethyl butanoate, butyl ethanoate, ethyl 2 -methylbutanoate, propyl butanoate, <b>butyl</b> propanoate, methyl <b>hexanoate,</b> <b>butyl</b> 2 -methylpropanoate, and butyl butanoate were identified as the constituents of the attractant. It was found that P. femoralis beetles were attracted to a mixture of the synthetic compounds about as strongly as to the fresh fruit. The beetles were also equally attracted to the fruit and to horse dung in areas where ripe fruit was not available. In areas permeated with the smell of the ripe fruit the horse dung retained its attractiveness, whereas no beetles were caught in traps baited with fruit. Publishers' Versio...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Volatile {{compounds}} {{of eight}} pear varieties were isolated and identified by GC/MS. A total of 112 components were identified from headspace of intact fruits, including 47 compounds {{reported for the}} first time in pear. The volatile profiles of these pear varieties were characterized by esters, alcohols, hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones. Qualitative and quantitative differences of compounds in the profiles are discussed in terms of flavor differences between pear varieties. Analysis of volatiles isolated from eating-ripe pears by direct sniffing GC indicated that a group of nine esters including 2 -methylpropyl-, butyl-, pentyl- and hexyl acetates, <b>butyl</b> butanoate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> methyl trans- 2, cis- 4 -, ethyl trans- 2, cis- 4 - and ethyl cis- 2, cis- 4 - decadienoates from 'Bartlett', 'Cornice' and 'Anjou' pear possessed strong, specific pear-like aroma. A second group of esters was also found to possess very positive aroma and can significantly affect overall sensation by serving as 'contributory to flavor compounds'. A newly developed, solid-phase microextraction technique was used to follow changes of volatile production of 'Bartlett', 'Packham's Triumph' and 'Anjou' pears during ripening. The major esters were found to increase at different rates and times during fruit ripening. Highly significant correlations between specific groups of odor-active compounds and pear flavor intensity during ripening indicated the significant contribution of volatiles to overall pear flavor. The effects of harvest maturity on volatiles differed between fruit varieties. 'Bartlett' harvested at all maturities, upon ripening produced similar amounts of flavor constituents. Higher volatile production was observed in early harvested 'Packham's Triumph'. Delayed harvest significantly reduced volatile production in 'Anjou'. Prolonged storage of fruits resulted in severe reduction of volatile esters in 'Packham's Triumph' and 'Anjou'. Alcohol acyltransferase, the ester synthesizing enzyme was isolated from 'Bartlett', partially purified, and its properties characterized. The enzyme was estimated to have a molecular weight of 40 kD and was most active at pH 7. 5 and 3 O°C. The enzyme has Km= 0. 6 mM and Vmax = 0. 3 nmol/min for hexanol and Km= 53 μM and Vmax = 0. 2 nmol/min for acetyl-CoA. Maximum activity of the enzyme was obtained when hexanol and acetyl-CoA were used as substrates...|$|R
40|$|A THESIS PRESENTED TO CAPE PENINSULA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY IN FULFILMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MASTERS OF TECHNOLOGY DEGREE IN HORTICULTURE. IN THE FACULTY OF APPLIED SCIENCES 2014 Codling moth ([Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae]) infest pomes {{resulting}} in high production losses to fruit farmers in South Africa and globally. Many farmers are adopting biocontrol methods {{including the use}} of entomopathogens as alternatives to synthetic insecticides for sustainable management of Arthropod pests. Research activities on screening and application of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) have intensified in recent years. This study was carried out to isolate and identify virulent indigenous entomopathogenic fungal strains from soils of selected locations in the Western Cape region of South Africa that are pathogenic against codling moth (Cydia pomonella (Linn) [Lepidoptera: Totricidae]) and to evaluate the possiblility of combining semiochemicals and fungal inoculums in a simulated attract-and-fungus contamination system for codling moth control. Soil samples were collected from 10 locations in the Western Cape, South Africa for the isolation of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) by baiting the soil samples with 5 th instar larvae of codling moths. Fungal strains were identified and characterized using light microscopy and DNA analysis (internal transcribed spacer region) and elongation factor 1 -α (EF 1 -α) genes of fungal cultures. Thirty-nine (39) isolates belonging to six species were obtained; Purpureocillium lilacinum (8 isolates), Fusarium oxysporum (five isolates), Fusarium polyphialidicum (two isolates), Beauveria pseudo-bassiana (one isolate), Aspergillus flavus (three isolates) and Metarhizium robertii (20 isolates). Generally, M. robertsii was the most frequently encountered species representing 51 % {{of the total number of}} isolates collected from the soil samples. This is the first report of the isolation of M. robertsii in southern Africa. A screening test to identify the most virulent fungal strains against codling moth was carried out on 39 isolates by immersing 5 th instar larvae of C. pomonella into aqueous spore suspension 1 x 108 conidia ml- 1. Mortality data from the immersion bioassay indicated that the 39 fungal isolates were pathogenic against fifth instar larvae of codling moth inducing 47 - 85 % insect mortality at an infective concentration of 1 x 108 spores’ ml- 1, 5 days post-treatment. Two fungal strains MTL 151 and GW 461 induced over 85 % larval mortality and were selected for further evaluations. The effect of MTL 151 and GW 461 on egg hatchability of 0 -day old eggs was evaluated by exposing freshly laid eggs on wax papers that were pre-treated with fungal spores ranging from 103 - 108 spores/ml. Egg hatchability reduced significantly from 93 - 71 % (GW 461) and 95 - 66 % (MTL 151) as spore concentration increases from 1 x 103 to 1 x 108 spores ml- 1, respectively. The highest spore concentration significantly inhibited egg hatchability {{resulting in}} lower egg hatchability compared to that obtained with the cypermethrin containing commercial insecticide (Fruitfly [registered by Kombat (PTY) Ltd]) tested at the recommended dose of 0. 25 ml/ 250 ml of water. The potential of the two M. robertsii strains to protect apples from infestation by codling moth neonates was assessed in an apple fruit bioassay under laboratory and field bioassay. Codling moth neonates were exposed to apples that were sprayed topically with varied conidia concentrations (103 - 108 sporesml- 1). The mean number of participating apple fruits having developing/developed larvae in the core/flesh significantly reduced from 5. 3 to 1 and 7. 6 to 1 for MTL 151 and GW 461, respectively as spore concentrations increased from 1 x 103 to 1 x 108 spores/ml- 1. A concurrent decrease in apple fruit rot as conidia concentration increased was observed. Up to 90 % of apples treated with 1 x 108 spores/ml- 1 had no larva present in their cores and this result compared favourably with the commercial pesticide (Fruitfly) used at a recommended dose of 0. 25 g/ 250 ml of water. No significant difference was found between the EC 50 values of 1. 2 x 103 (CI= 1. 2 x 102 - 1 x 105) (MTL 151) and 1. 1 x 105 (CI = 7 x 103 – 5. 6 x 105) (GW 461) spores ml- 1. However, neither the two M. robertsii strains nor the insecticide deterred the neonates from feeding on the surface of the fruits. The attraction responses of male and female adult codling moths to <b>butyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> and codlemone blend; <b>butyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> (0. 025 mg / ml of hexane) and codlemone (0. 1 mg / ml of hexane) in a ratio of 1 : 1 (0. 5 ml: 0. 5 ml from both solutions) were assessed in a one-choice wind tunnel olfactory bioassay during scoto-phase in the absence of fungal spores. The blend attracted more females (69 %) than males (66. 7 %), however these responses were not significantly different (P > 0. 5). The prospect of integrated use of entomopathogenic fungal conidia and semiochemical blend for control of C. pomonella adults was assessed in a wind tunnel containing the combo lure and M. robertsii (MTL 151) spores formulated as a powder (250 mg) or aqueous spore suspension (3. 1 x 108 spores m- 1 ± 7 x 102 sporesml- 1). Insect attraction, mean number of spores picked per insect and insect mortality was assessed. No significant difference (P > 0. 5) was observed in the number of inoculi picked by unsexed adult moths in the two conidial formulations tested; spore powder (3. 1 x 103 ± 1 x 103 spores ml- 1) and aqueous spore suspension (3. 1 x 103 ± 7 x 102 spores ml- 1). No mortality was recorded among fungus or control-treated moths. Both M. robertsii (MTL 151) spore formulations did not significantly (P > 0. 05) affect the attraction responses of the insects to the combo lure; powder (73. 3 ± 3. 3 %) and aqueous (68. 6 ± 2. 9 %) compared to the control treatment (without the fungal spores) (70 ± 0. 5 %). These results suggest that the fungus did not inhibit the attraction of moths by semiochemicals. Despite the successful autoinoculation of moths with fungal spores, the level of contamination was too low to induce mortality among adult moths. This study opens up opportunities for research in attract-and-fungus contamination delivery systems. This is the first report of the occurrence of M. robertsii in the southern Africa. Further, results from this study indicates that C. pomonella is susceptible to indigenous South African entomopathogenic fungi and 2 indigenous M. anisopliae strains, MTL 151 and GW 461 provided adequate protections against codling moth larval infestations of apple fruits. Future research endeavours to improve adherence of conidia to adult moth cuticle is recommended.

40|$|Factors that {{interfere}} with attraction of apple maggot flies to traps were studied to provide a baseline for optimal trap deployment in apple orchards. ^ I found a four-fold increase in captures of mature flies when <b>butyl</b> <b>hexanoate</b> was added to unbaited red spheres. The addition of ammonium carbonate or food presence did not affect mature fly response to traps. Wild flies immigrating into commercial orchards were primarily mature and not hungry for protein. ^ Flies released outside blocks of apple trees of different sizes were intercepted in larger proportions by traps on small and medium sized trees than on similar traps on large trees. Overall trap performance was not strongly affected by orchard structure. ^ Released flies were recovered in larger proportions by traps on McIntosh trees than by traps on Red Delicious trees bearing larger darker fruit. Visual competition became stronger as Red Delicious apples grew in size and turned in color. Decreased trap apparency on Red Delicious trees was compensated for by increased residence time of wild flies. ^ Wild flies were captured in larger numbers by red spheres and Ladd traps than by yellow panels. Red spheres lost capturing power towards harvest when competing visually with red fruit. Ladd traps were not equally affected, but were more sensitive to trap positioning than red spheres. Red sphere effectiveness was restored after harvest. Optimal trap positioning {{may need to be}} revised. ^ Wild fly accumulation on traps on tees of different apple cultivars during the growing season revealed that fly distribution in orchards is not exclusively governed by fruit ripening but rather by apple maggot preferences for some cultivars. Although ripening stage affected the onset of increases in fly accumulation on traps, some cultivars never accumulated many flies during the growing season. ^ Apple maggot preferred to oviposit in sweet moderately firm fruit, but avoided ovipositing in excessively hard or soft fruit of different apple cultivars. Females also avoided fruit of late cultivars, even when sugar content and firmness were high and moderately high. Ovipositional cultivar preferences did not necessarily translate into greater fly accumulation on traps in our orchard study. ...|$|E
