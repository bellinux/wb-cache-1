40|$|International {{migration}} of highly skilled people is often conceived {{as the international}} mobility of educated personnel within transnational companies. It epitomises the successful international {{migration of}} labour. This article critically reviews this conception and analyses the major viewpoints on the phenomenon. Starting {{with a description of}} brain drain in the 1960 s, researchers' attention shifted to analyses of <b>brain</b> <b>exchange</b> in the late 1980 s. Studies came to the fore that focused on international migration processes from a company-related perspective and emphasised the influence of transnational companies. The importance of individual migrants, however, was neglected, since they appeared to have minor influence on the migration process. Due to recent changes in technology, reorganisation of processes of production and a policy shift, the article reinvestigates their position. Firstly, it draws on a case study on the German "Green Card" scheme which opened up the labour market for highly skilled ICT specialists. In this new process individual migrants have gained importance. Secondly, it revises the major labour flows of highly skilled persons to Germany during 2000 &ndash; 2003. The majority of highly skilled immigrants entered the country not via intra-company transfers or as highly skilled specialists, but as refugees or repatriates. Their labour market success, however, is low, which might question the existing positive image of highly skilled international migration...|$|E

40|$|ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) are {{approximately}} 20 -kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that participate in vesicular transport in the Golgi and other intracellular compartments and stimulate cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. ARFs {{are active in}} the GTP-bound form; hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, possibly {{with the assistance of}} a GTP hydrolysis (GTPase) -activating protein results in inactivation. Exchange of GDP for GTP and reactivation were shown by other workers to be enhanced by Golgi membranes in a brefeldin A-sensitive reaction, leading to the proposal that the guanine nucleotide-exchange protein (GEP) was a target of brefeldin A. In the studies reported here, a soluble GEP was partially purified from bovine <b>brain.</b> <b>Exchange</b> of nucleotide on ARFs 1 and 3, based on increased ARF activity in a toxin assay and stimulation of binding of guanosine 5 '-[gamma-[35 S]thio]triphosphate, was dependent on phospholipids, with phosphatidylserine being more effective than cardiolipin. GEP appeared to increase the rate of nucleotide exchange but did not affect the affinity of ARF for GTP. Whereas the crude GEP had a size of approximately 700 kDa, the partially purified GEP behaved on Ultrogel AcA 54 as a protein of 60 kDa. With purification, the GEP activity became insensitive to brefeldin A, consistent with the conclusion that, in contrast to earlier inferences, the exchange protein is not itself the target of brefeldin A...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} “brain drain ” {{hypothesis}} – {{the idea that}} New Zealand is losing many of its most talented citizens to other countries. We conclude that we are experiencing more of a <b>brain</b> <b>exchange</b> than a brain drain. There have been net outflows of New Zealand citizens for forty years, {{and we have been}} replacing those leaving with non-New Zealand citizens. On the basis of the data available, our immigrants appear to be more skilled than our emigrants (and than our general population). But there may be some cause for concern if immigrants cannot get jobs to make use of their skills. Migration flows to and from Australia are different from those {{with the rest of the}} world. New Zealand consistently loses its citizens to Australia, but they are not just the highest skilled. Instead, they are representative of the general population of New Zealand. That is, there is no brain drain to Australia either, but what might be called a “same drain”. This is likely to be a consequence of the common labour market. Policy responses could focus on both outflows and inflows. Limited policy levers exist for attracting and retaining New Zealand citizens within the country, other than making the country a more attractive place to work, and live. The key policy issue for inflows is the improvement of the selection, settlement, and integration of immigrants. The paper ends by calling for a more sophisticated debate on immigration and emigration, and a more accurate conception of what will be an ongoing trend – that is, the increasingly free flow of people (including New Zealanders), around the globe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to shift the focus from a {{negative}} prejudice about immigration towards a much more positive evaluation. More and more the migration pattern changes from a blue-collar migration of low qualified workers towards a whitecollar mobility of highly skilled professionals. It has to be stressed strongly that - strikingly enough - most migrants are relatively well qualified. Just to mention a new IMF study (Carrington/Detragiache 1999 : 47), the US data show that immigration flows of individuals with no more than a primary education are quite small, and reach only about 500 ? 000 individuals {{out of a total of}} 7 million immigrants! ?For most countries, people with a tertiary education have the highest migration rate [...] . Thus, migrant to the Unites States tend to be better educated than the average person in their home (that is the sending) country, and the proportion of very highly educated people who migrate is particularly high? (Carrington/Detragiache 1999 : 48). So, these data clearly indicate that there is a substantial brain drain. Another question of quite similar importance is, why the US only should get a brain gain. Why not the EU? The immigration of highly skilled is crucial and decisive for growth and wealth of nations in the 21 st century. Once again this is clearly seen and strategically developed in the US. The USA attracts highly skilled people from all over the world because of a number of natural as well as artificial benefits (?sun, sea, and sand?, close relations between industry and universities etc.) and, therefore, experiences a ?Brain Gain? that stimulates growth. In the case of Europe, mobility is mainly intra-European, representing a ?<b>Brain</b> <b>Exchange?.</b> This is being fuelled by the Europeanisation of production and the creation of an internal labour market. However, the EU lacks the magnetic power to attract high skilled foreign scientists and to become leading centres of research intensive (service) production. For Eastern Europe there is a fear of a ?Brain Drain? that will not be directed towards the EU but rather towards the US...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to study human whole-body gas {{exchange}} and cerebral autoregulation using a mathematical model. Previously, a human cardiopulmonary (CP) model [45, 47] was developed, which included heart, closed-loop blood circulation, gas exchange at lungs and baroreflex control of arterial pressure. In the current study, two major extensions to the model are made. First, a description of gas exchange in the peripheral tissues is added and is coupled with the lung gas exchanger via the circulatory loop with variable transport delays. A peripheral chemosensitive loop is also added to mimic the influence of blood gas composition on the heart and vasculature. The CP model is then used to predict the integrated cardiovascular and blood-tissue gas transport responses to pronounced changes in lung gas composition, and thus simulates changes encountered in apnea with and without passive oxygenation. The second extension of the CP model includes a more detailed description of cerebral circulation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics, <b>brain</b> gas <b>exchange</b> and cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation. Two CBF regulatory mechanisms are described: autoregulation and CO 2 reactivity. Central chemoreceptor control of ventilation is also added. This new model is subsequently used to study cerebral hemodynamic and <b>brain</b> gas <b>exchange</b> responses to test protocols commonly used {{in the assessment of}} CBF autoregulation (e. g., carotid artery compression and the thigh cuff test). The model closely mimics the experimental findings and provides biophysically based insights into the dynamics and interactions of the associated physiological systems. In summary, this work represents a bold effort in large-scale modeling of physiological systems. The presented model accurately describes the physiological systems and can explain how the cardiovascular, pulmonary and autonomic nervous systems interact in response to a variety of cardiopulmonary challenges, such as apnea, carotid artery compression and the thigh cuff test. With further refinement, the model may help investigators to better understand the complex biophysics of cardiopulmonary diseases such as sleep-related disorders of breathing (obstructive and central sleep apnea) and complications associated with head-injuries...|$|R
40|$|The {{biggest problem}} when {{analyzing}} {{the brain is}} that its synaptic connections are extremely complex. Generally, the billions of neurons making up the <b>brain</b> <b>exchange</b> information through two types of highly specialized structures: chemical synapses (the vast majority) and so-called gap junctions (a substrate of one class of electrical synapse). Here {{we are interested in}} exploring the three-dimensional spatial distribution of chemical synapses in the cerebral cortex. Recent research has showed that the three-dimensional spatial distribution of synapses in layer III of the neocortex can be modeled by a random sequential adsorption (RSA) point process, i. e., synapses are distributed in space almost randomly, with the only constraint that they cannot overlap. In this study we hypothesize that RSA processes can also explain the distribution of synapses in all cortical layers. We also investigate whether there are differences in both the synaptic density and spatial distribution of synapses between layers. Using combined focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM), we obtained three-dimensional samples from the six layers of the rat somatosensory cortex and identified and reconstructed the synaptic junctions. A total volume of tissue of approximately 4500 μm 3 and around 4000 synapses from three different animals were analyzed. Different samples, layers and/or animals were aggregated and compared using RSA replicated spatial point processes. The results showed no significant differences in the synaptic distribution across the different rats used in the study. We found that RSA processes described the spatial distribution of synapses in all samples of each layer. We also found that the synaptic distribution in layers II to VI conforms to a common underlying RSA process with different densities per layer. Interestingly, the results showed that synapses in layer I had a slightly different spatial distribution from the other layers.

40|$|The new {{geography}} of the R&D activities As a rule, new technologies in today’s world {{are the result of}} a long R&D process. This includes basic theoretical and applied research, as well as repeated testing which ensures that the new techniques coming out of the previous processes are ready to be applied in production and/or to enrich the output-mix with new products. In a broader sense, R&D generates also new ideas and techniques that contribute to the introduction of more efficient methods in the organization of production. In that part in which the non-marketable results are significant, the R&D activity is primarily state funded or financed by international organizations. It manifests a wide spatial distribution, spreading practically to all countries, and includes mainly research aiming to improve public health and security conditions, and to raise agricultural efficiency. It aims also to increase environmental protection and to create positive external economies that promote the public interest. In many big countries a considerable amount of state funded research serves military purposes and the exploration of space, with some of it having spillover effects for peaceful purposes. In the remaining part of the R&D that is conducted in the private sector of the economy, the Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) are the dominant players. In the era of globalization they have emerged as principal economic actors and are even more important in the application of new technologies. They dispose of large material resources and can recruit scientific and engineering talent from all over the world. It matters therefore where they locate their R&D. Given that the developed countries spend on R&D 2 - 3 % of their GDP, amounting to the largest part of the world research expenditure, the traditional view has been that those countries account also for nearly all research activity. According to the UN World Investment Report 2005, however, the view of more complex production activities being undertaken in the North and simpler ones in the South is less and less a true reflection of reality. In some developing countries like China, India, Pakistan and North Korea, the state budget allocations for R&D expenses, including those for military research, has been high. The actual research output per unit of expense may be even higher, in comparison to that of the developed countries, because their wage levels and the cost of the basic infrastructure (building and various kinds of materials) are lower. Many of their researchers, however, are not less efficient and inventive than their homologues in the more developed countries. Further, MNEs now view parts of the developing world not only as key sources of cheap labour, but also of growth, skills and even new technologies. They have accelerated the pace of their direct investment in overseas R&D and the delocation of R&D activities in other countries, acquiring or establishing new laboratories abroad and integrating them into global R&D networks. They have many reasons to implement those policies: Their purpose is to source foreign technology, gain access to the local science base, hire foreign skilled engineers and benefit from local expertise and scientific excellence. They also want first, to utilize their subsidiaries in adapting the local market products to those developed in the research laboratories of the mother multinational company; and second, to adjust their own products to the local market and manufacturing processes. R&D activities of acquired subsidiaries are more concerned with applied research and scanning of local technologies, while new established subsidiaries generally focus on the suitable for the local market development of products based on technologies applied in the mother company. All told, small and less developed countries contribute now substantially to the world research output in three main ways: By running their own public and private research centers; as partners and employees of the subsidiaries of the MNEs established in them; and through their nationals doing research work in foreign universities and research centers. Despite its alleged detrimental effects, globalization, whatever its definition, appears to be reducing at a quick pace the spatial inequalities in research activities. The ways and means of those developments and their actual effects will be analyzed in the proposed paper. Policy implications Exploring the spatial allocation of the R&D activity may lead to useful conclusions for rational policy decisions. The establishment of MNEs in any country has overall positive labour market affects. It may, however, cause unemployment to the less qualified workers, in the usual cases that labour intensive processes are introduced in production lines carried out with traditional techniques. R&D activities established by the MNEs in a host country generate also positive spillovers in it, by strengthening its policies designed to attract FDI in research and innovation, as well as through an increase in the local demand for highly qualified persons. The more pronounced the presence of foreign R&D subsidiaries in a host country, the higher the demand for domestic researchers. It follows that well trained and with appropriate work attitudes graduates of tertiary education in any country can find satisfactory employment, at home or abroad. The national borders are also open for the highly skilled. Far from causing a brain drain, their emigration develops, as a rule, into a brain gain because it creates incentives for more and better training in the sending country. Eventually, it develops also into a <b>brain</b> <b>exchange</b> between sending and receiving countries, for their mutual benefit. In the last fifteen years, for example, the Chinese and Indian researchers in the universities and the technological parks of many developed countries have contributed considerably to the economic development of their respective countries. Up until very recently, in Greece as well about nine out of ten persons with responsible positions in the academia, the research centers and practically in all walks of life had some research experience abroad. The hypothesis which will also be tested in the proposed paper is that, higher degrees of R&D internalization are associated with minimal negative effects of any brain drain Main Bibliography Bein M. and Docquier Fr 2004 â€œSkilled Migrationâ€, Brussels Economic Review, Vol. 47 -No 1, Spring, Special Issue Cornelius W., EspenshadeT.

MethodsWe conducted a meta-analysis of the literature, analyzed the CC in 694 subjects of the Autism <b>Brain</b> Imaging Data <b>Exchange</b> project, and performed computer simulations to study the effect of different analysis strategies. ResultsOur meta-analysis suggested a group difference in CC size; however, the studies were heavily underpowered (20 % power to detect Cohen’s d =. 3). In contrast, {{we did not observe}} significant differences in the Autism <b>Brain</b> Imaging Data <b>Exchange</b> cohort, despite having achieved 99 % power. However, we observed that CC scaled nonlinearly with brain volume (BV) : large brains had a proportionally smaller CC. Our simulations showed that because of this nonlinearity, CC normalization could not control for eventual BV differences, but using BV as a covariate in a linear model would. We also observed a weaker correlation of IQ and BV in cases compared with control subjects. Our simulations showed that matching populations by IQ could then induce artifactual BV differences. ConclusionsThe lack of statistical power in the previous literature prevents us from establishing the reality of the claims of a smaller CC in autism, and our own analyses did not find any. However, the nonlinear relationship between CC and BV and the different correlation between BV and IQ in cases and control subjects may induce artifactual differences.

Recognizing this problem, a number of avian brain researchers began an effort to revise the terminology, which culminated in the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum, held at Duke University from 18 to 20 July 2002. In the new terminology approved at this Forum, the flawed conception that the telencephalon of birds consists nearly entirely of a hypertrophied basal ganglia has been purged, and the actual parts of the basal ganglia and its brainstem afferent cell groups given names reflecting their nowevident mammalian homologues. The pallial telencephalic regions that were erroneously named to reflect presumed homology to mammalian basal ganglia were renamed as parts of pallium, using prefixes in most cases that retained established abbreviations (for continuity with the replaced nomenclature).

Measuring brain activity using fMRI while participants are under the influence of cTBS shows local cTBS effects in BA 1 / 2 varied, with some participants showing decreases and others increases in the BOLD response to viewing actions vs control stimuli.

30|$|The ASD is a neurodevelopment {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} deficits in communication and social interaction, along with repetitive {{patterns of behavior}} and interests. Neuroimaging {{studies have demonstrated that}} dysfunction of triple networks [including central executive network (CEN), salience network (SN), and default modal network (DMN)] were associated with ASD (Vinod et al. 2011). To the best of our knowledge, there were no studies investigating the SC of those networks, especially their dynamic configuration across ages in ASD. The lack of investigation of the SC in ASD is probably due to the limited number of participants recruited in previous studies. Therefore, in the current study, we collected big datasets from the Autism <b>Brain</b> Imaging Data <b>Exchange</b> (ABIDE). Then we employed the SC modal to investigate the SC and topological properties of the triple networks and their development across ages in ASD.|$|R
40|$|Information {{exchange}} in chatroom conversations {{of people with}} and without traumatic brain injury (TBI) This study describes how people with and without traumatic <b>brain</b> injury (TBI) <b>exchange</b> information in small chatroom groups. Each of the ten participants with moderate-severe TBI and twelve control participants conversed with two unknown communication partners in a moderated chatroom on two occasions. Rates of information exchange were measured. Statistically {{significant differences were found}} in the: (1) frequency of information requests made by TBI participants and (2) frequency of information giving and negotiation/repair by communication partners of TBI participants (both reduced in the TBI group). Further research is required to validate results and explore the impact of alternate chatroom compositions.

40|$|Histone {{modifications}} and chromatin remodeling represent universal {{mechanisms by}} which cells adapt their transcriptional response to rapidly changing environmental conditions. Extensive chromatin remodeling takes place during neuronal development, allowing the transition of pluripotent cells into differentiated neurons. Here, we report that the NuRD complex, which couples ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling with histone deacetylase activity, regulates mouse <b>brain</b> development. Subunit <b>exchange</b> of CHDs, the core ATPase subunits of the NuRD complex, is required for distinct aspects of cortical development. Whereas CHD 4 promotes the early proliferation of progenitors, CHD 5 facilitates neuronal migration and CHD 3 ensures proper layer specification. Inhibition of each CHD leads to defects of neuronal differentiation and migration, which cannot be rescued by expressing heterologous CHDs. Finally, we demonstrate that NuRD complexes containing specific CHDs are recruited to regulatory elements and modulate the expression of genes essential for brain development...|$|R
40|$|National Institutes of Health; Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation 	We {{propose a}} novel method for neurodevelopmental brain mapping that {{displays}} how an individual&# 39;s values for {{a quantity of}} interest compare with age-specific norms. By estimating smoothly age-varying distributions at a set of brain regions of interest, we derive age-dependent region-wise quantile ranks for a given individual, which can be presented {{in the form of}} a brain map. Such quantile rank maps could potentially be used for clinical screening. Bootstrap-based confidence intervals are proposed for the quantile rank estimates. We also propose a recalibrated Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for detecting group differences in the age-varying distribution. This test is shown to be more robust to model misspecification than a linear regression-based test. The proposed methods are applied to brain imaging data from the Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample and from the Autism <b>Brain</b> Imaging Data <b>Exchange</b> (ABIDE) sample. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDown Syndrome is {{the most}} common genetic cause for {{intellectual}} disability, yet the pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in Down Syndrome is unknown. We compared fMRI scans of 15 individuals with Down Syndrome to 14 typically developing control subjects while they viewed 50 min of cartoon video clips. There was widespread increased synchrony between brain regions, with only a small subset of strong, distant connections showing underconnectivity in Down Syndrome. Brain regions showing negative correlations were less anticorrelated and were among the most strongly affected connections in the brain. Increased correlation was observed between all of the distributed brain networks studied, with the strongest internetwork correlation in subjects with the lowest performance IQ. A functional parcellation of the brain showed simplified network structure in Down Syndrome organized by local connectivity. Despite increased interregional synchrony, intersubject correlation to the cartoon stimuli was lower in Down Syndrome, indicating that increased synchrony had a temporal pattern that was not in response to environmental stimuli, but idiosyncratic to each Down Syndrome subject. Short-range, increased synchrony was not observed in a comparison sample of 447 autism vs. 517 control subjects from the Autism <b>Brain</b> Imaging <b>Exchange</b> (ABIDE) collection of resting state fMRI data, and increased internetwork synchrony was only observed between the default mode and attentional networks in autism. These findings suggest immature development of connectivity in Down Syndrome with impaired ability to integrate information from distant brain regions into coherent distributed networks...|$|R
40|$|Using an immunoelectron {{microscopic}} procedure, we directly {{observed the}} concurrent addition {{and loss of}} chicken brain tubulin subunits from the opposite ends of microtubules containing erythrocyte tubulin domains. The polarity of growth of the brain tubulin {{on the ends of}} erythrocyte microtubules was determined to be similar to growth off the ends of Chlamydomonas axonemes. The flux rate for brain tubulin subunits in vitro was low, ~ 0. 9 /~m/h. Tubulin subunit flux did not continue through the entire microtubule as expected, but ceased when erythrocyte tubulin domains became exposed, resulting in a metastable configuration that persisted for at least several hours. We attribute this to differences in the critical concentrations of erythrocyte and <b>brain</b> tubulin. The <b>exchange</b> of tubulin subunits into the walls of preformed microtubules other than at their ends was also determined to be insignificant, the exchange rate being less than the sensitivity of the assay, or < 0. 2 %/h...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the needs}} of {{selecting}} important features for massive neuroimaging data, we propose a spatially varying coefficient model (SVCMs) with sparsity and piecewise smoothness imposed on the coefficient functions. A new class of nonparametric priors is developed based on thresholded multiresolution Gaussian processes (TMGP). We show that the TMGP has a large support on a space of sparse and piecewise smooth functions, leading to posterior consistency in coefficient function estimation and feature selection. Also, we develop a method for prior specifications of thresholding parameters in TMGPs and discuss their theoretical properties. Efficient posterior computation algorithms are developed by adopting a kernel convolution approach, where a modified square exponential kernel is chosen taking the advantage that the analytical form of the eigen decomposition is available. Based on simulation studies, we demonstrate that our methods can achieve better performance in estimating the spatially varying coefficient. Also, the proposed model {{has been applied to}} an analysis of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (Rs-fMRI) data from the Autism <b>Brain</b> Imaging Data <b>Exchange</b> (ABIDE) study, it provides biologically meaningful results.
