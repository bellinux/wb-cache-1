25|$|Use of {{distributed}} power (i.e., {{remotely controlled}} locomotive units mid-train and/or {{at the rear}} end) mitigates somewhat the time-lag problem with long trains, because a telemetered radio signal from the engine operator in the front locomotive commands the distant units to initiate <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> reductions that propagate quickly through nearby cars.|$|E
25|$|Modern ABS applies {{individual}} <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> to {{all four}} wheels through a control system of hub-mounted sensors and a dedicated micro-controller. ABS is offered or comes standard on most road vehicles produced today {{and is the}} foundation for electronic stability control systems, which are rapidly increasing in popularity due to the vast reduction in price of vehicle electronics over the years.|$|E
25|$|Another {{solution}} to loss of <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> is the two-pipe system, fitted on most modern passenger stock and many freight wagons. In {{addition to the}} traditional brake pipe, this enhancement adds the main reservoir pipe, which is continuously charged with air directly from the locomotive's main reservoir. The main reservoir is where the locomotive's air compressor output is stored, and is ultimately the source of compressed air for all systems that use it.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic brakeforce {{distribution}} (EBD or EBFD) or electronic brakeforce limitation (EBL) is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies {{the amount of}} force applied to each of a vehicle's wheels, based on road conditions, speed, loading, etc. Always coupled with anti-lock braking systems (ABS), EBD can apply more or less <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to each wheel {{in order to maximize}} stopping power whilst maintaining vehicular control. [...] Typically, the front end carries the most weight and EBD distributes less <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to the rear brakes so the rear brakes do not lock up and cause a skid. In some systems, EBD distributes more <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> at the rear brakes during initial brake application before the effects of weight transfer become apparent.|$|R

25|$|To {{prevent a}} runaway due to loss of <b>brake</b> <b>pressure,</b> dynamic (rheostatic) braking can be {{utilized}} so the locomotive(s) will assist in retarding the train. Often, blended braking, the simultaneous application of dynamic and train brakes, {{will be used}} to maintain a safe speed and keep the slack bunched on descending grades. Care would then be given when releasing the service and dynamic brakes to prevent draw-gear damage caused by a sudden run out of the train's slack.|$|E
25|$|Railroads {{proposed}} the end-of-train device (EOT or ETD) as an alternative. An ETD could {{be attached to}} the rear of the train to detect the train's air <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> and report any problems to the locomotive. The ETD also detects movement of the train upon start-up and radios this information to the engineers so they know all of the slack is out of the couplings and additional power could be applied. The machines also have blinking red lights to warn following trains that a train is ahead. With the introduction of the ETD, the conductor moved up to the front of the train with the engineer.|$|E
25|$|Brake discs and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and urban driving with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period as you would a new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain max speed to a minimum speed. For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal is to get the brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the <b>brake</b> <b>pressure</b> and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E
50|$|Wheel speed {{transducers}} in each {{main wheel}} axle induce an AC frequency on the DC voltage input proportionate to the wheel speed as they are driven by the wheels. This frequency is compared to a normal deceleration curve and if it deviates it activates a small torque motor in the affected wheel control valve which shunts <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to the return line {{by means of a}} spool valve. As the wheel rotation speed accelerates to normal tolerance limits, normal <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> is restored.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that drivers use specific visual information to execute braking behaviors [Faj 05] and that drivers calibrate braking behavior to this visual information over time [Faj 09]. Specifically, Fajen (2005) argued that when successfully braking, participants adjust <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to maintain a visually-specified ideal <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> less than one’s maximum ability to brake. In the current paper, we investigated whether factors, specifically one’s emotional state, would alter the relationship between braking behavior and visually-specified ideal <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> over time. Specifically, we investigated whether the performance of braking changed when anxious. Previous research demonstrated that anxiety influences static perceptual judgments of space [Gra 12] {{and the performance of}} open-loop sports actions [Bei 10]. Open-loop actions are actions where once the movement has been initiated there are no opportunities to alter the outcome (i. e., putting a golf ball). This research shows an influence of anxiety on static perceptual tasks and the performance of open-loop actions suggesting that anxiety may also influence more complex everyday actions like braking. It is important to know whether, and how, the influence of anxiety extends to the performance of closedloop actions like braking given the potential realworld consequences of poor performance...|$|R
50|$|The {{sole purpose}} of the VDC program is to prevent or {{minimise}} the risks of a potential accident. Up to ten computer systems monitor all four wheels {{in addition to the}} driver's steering, throttle and braking input, in real time. Should the VDC system detect a loss of traction, the ESC and TCS components automatically apply <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> and reduce engine speed to prevent oversteer or understeer, ensuring that the driver remains in control. Should the driver apply the brakes in an emergency, the ABS component prevents the wheels from locking up, while EBD assigns appropriate brake force to each wheel and BA increases <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> to bring the car to a safe and complete stop. The HHA component prevents the car from rolling backwards whilst on a hill, should the brake pedal be released.|$|R

40|$|Paper―based {{friction}} materials containing {{four different}} graphite particle sizes were prepared using the wet paper―making process. The effects of graphite particle size on friction performance such as friction torque curves, dynamic friction coefficient, static friction coefficient and wear rate were studied {{by using an}} inertia friction tester. Meanwhile, the sensitivity of friction coefficient to <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> and rotating speed was also investigated. Worn surfaces of samples were analyzed by using scanning electron microscope. The results show that with graphite particle size decreasing, braking time increases and torque curves become more stable, while friction coefficient and wear rate decrease. The dynamic friction coefficient declines as <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> and rotating speed increase. Samples with proper particle size exhibit more stable friction coefficient in the continuous braking process.

40|$|By {{simulating}} {{emergency braking}} conditions of mine hoisters, tribological experiments of a mining nonasbestos brake material sliding on E 355 CC steel friction disc investigated a pad-on-disc friction tester. It is shown that, under combined influence of <b>braking</b> velocity and <b>pressure,</b> the lubricating film and micro-convex-apices on wear surface would have complex physicochemical reactions which make the instant friction coefficient rise gradually while the instant surface temperature rises {{first and then}} falls. With the antifriction effect from lubricating film and the desquamating of composite materials, the mean friction coefficient decreases first, then rises, and decreases again with the increasing of initial braking velocity. And with the existence of micro-convex-apices and variation from increment ratio of load and actual contacting area, it rises first and then falls with the increasing of <b>braking</b> <b>pressure.</b> However, the mean surface temperature rises obviously with the increasing of both initial braking velocity and <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> for growth of transformed kinetic energy. It is considered that the friction coefficient cannot {{be considered as a}} constant when designing brake devices for mine hoisters.

50|$|Emergency brake assist (EBA) or Brake Assist (BA or BAS) is {{a generic}} term for an {{automobile}} braking technology that increases <b>braking</b> <b>pressure</b> in an emergency. The first application was developed jointly by Daimler-Benz and TRW/LucasVarity.
