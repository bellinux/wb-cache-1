5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century {{epizootics}} in livestock caused by viruses continue to have serious consequences. <b>Bluetongue</b> disease, a disease caused by an orbivirus broke out in sheep in France in 2007. Until then the disease had been mainly confined to the Americas, Africa, southern Asia and northern Australia, but it is now an emerging disease around the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide array}} of {{bacterial}} and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine Johne's disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. <b>Bluetongue</b> disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. Ovine rinderpest (or peste des petits ruminants) is a highly contagious and often fatal viral disease affecting sheep and goats.|$|E
5|$|Epizootics are {{outbreaks}} (epidemics) {{of disease}} among non-human animals. During the 20th century significant epizootics of viral diseases in animals, particularly livestock, occurred worldwide. The many diseases caused by viruses included foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest of cattle, avian and swine influenza, swine fever and <b>bluetongue</b> of sheep. Viral diseases of livestock {{can be devastating}} both to farmers and the wider community, as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{important}} pathogens of livestock. Diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease and <b>bluetongue</b> {{are caused by}} viruses. Companion animals such as cats, dogs, and horses, if not vaccinated, are susceptible to serious viral infections. Canine parvovirus {{is caused by a}} small DNA virus and infections are often fatal in pups. Like all invertebrates, the honey bee is susceptible to many viral infections. However, most viruses co-exist harmlessly in their host and cause no signs or symptoms of disease.|$|E
5|$|While the {{painting}} {{has been described}} as showing the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata starting the first bushfire, it portrays elements of nine distinct dreamings, of which Lungkata's tale is the central motif. Lungkata was the <b>Bluetongue</b> Lizard Man, an ancestral figure responsible for creating bushfire. The painting portrays the results of a fire, caused by Lungkata to punish his two sons who did not share with their father the kangaroo they had caught. The sons' skeletons are on the right hand side of the image, shown against a background representing smoke and ashes.|$|E
25|$|The {{first case}} of <b>bluetongue</b> disease in Romanian history is {{reported}} in Buzău County.|$|E
25|$|The Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) {{virus is}} closely related and crossreacts with <b>Bluetongue</b> virus on many blood tests.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bluetongue</b> virus (BTV), {{a member}} of Orbivirus genus within the Reoviridae family causes serious disease in {{livestock}} (sheep, goat, cattle). It is non-enveloped, double-stranded RNA virus. The genome is segmented.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bluetongue</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in Australia, the USA, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe. An outline of the transmission cycle of BTV is illustrated in article Parasitic flies of domestic animals.|$|E
25|$|Norway saw {{its first}} finding in February 2009, when cows at two farms in Vest-Agder {{in the south}} of Norway showed an immune {{response}} to <b>bluetongue.</b> Norway have since been declared free of the disease in 2011.|$|E
25|$|African horse {{sickness}} {{is related}} to <b>Bluetongue</b> and is spread by the same midges (Culicoides species). It can kill the horses it infects and mortality may {{go as high as}} 90% of the infected horses during an epidemic.|$|E
25|$|Some animals also develop foot lesions, {{beginning}} with coronitis, with consequent lameness. In sheep, this {{can lead to}} knee-walking. In cattle, constant changing of position of the feet gives <b>bluetongue</b> the nickname The Dancing Disease. Torsion of the neck (opisthotonos or torticollis) is observed in severely affected animals.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998 NRL {{clubs have}} played both trial matches and premiership season games {{in areas that}} do not have {{representation}} in the NRL in both Australia and New Zealand. Non-traditional venues that have been used include <b>Bluetongue</b> Stadium, Westpac Stadium, Barlow Park, TIO Stadium, nib Stadium, Stadium Mackay and Eden Park in Auckland.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} contribution to the northward spread of <b>Bluetongue</b> disease has been the ability of Culicoides obsoletus and C.pulicaris to acquire and transmit the pathogen, both of which are spread widely throughout Europe. This is in contrast to the original C.imicola vector which is limited to North Africa and the Mediterranean. The relatively recent novel vector has facilitated a far more rapid spread than the simple expansion of habitats North through global warming.|$|E
25|$|Severe biting {{stress to}} cattle, sheep and horses is caused. Horses {{suffer from a}} {{cutaneous}} hypersensitivity reaction called sweet-itch, or Queensland-itch that is caused by antigenic components of saliva of biting midges. Poultry may be severely afflicted with biting stress. Species such as Culicoides imicola and Culicoides variipennis transmit <b>bluetongue</b> virus between sheep and cattle (see diagram and photograph above), and they transmit African horse sickness virus between horses and other equids. Culicoides midges transmit Leucocytozoon protozoa to poultry birds.|$|E
25|$|The Pirbright Institute is a {{research}} establishment that investigates diseases in farm animals. It consists of two sites, one close to Pirbright and one in Compton, Berkshire {{and is one of}} eight UK research institutes supported by the UK's Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). The Pirbright site includes international reference laboratories for the diagnosis of livestock diseases exotic to the UK, including the World Reference Laboratory for foot and mouth disease. The site also conducts research on viruses including foot and mouth disease and <b>bluetongue</b> virus.|$|E
25|$|Transmission to {{vertebrates}} usually occurs via a tick vector. THOV {{persists in}} the tick, {{remaining in the}} organism as it goes through its developmental stages; this is called transstadial transmission. The virus can be transmitted to another host within a day of attachment to the host. THOV can be transmitted between ticks when they feed simultaneously on apparently uninfected guinea pigs, {{in the absence of}} a detectable level of virus in the blood. Such nonviraemic transmission has also been observed with other predominantly tick-transmitted RNA viruses, including <b>bluetongue,</b> Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever, louping ill, tick-borne encephalitis, vesicular stomatitis virus and West Nile virus viruses. Transmission of DHOV by respiratory aerosol has also been observed.|$|E
25|$|The CSIR had {{concluded}} in 1943 that any extension Brahman cross-breeding would require further importations to avoid inbreeding in the cross-bred population. Post-war, Atkinson and others followed this advice with further purchases of pure-bred Brahman from overseas {{to develop the}} breed. Between 1949 and 1951 Atkinson imported two Brahman bulls and two heifers from the USA. In 1950 Waverley Station, also imported Brahman cattle. By 1954, 49 head had been imported to Australia; however, importations were terminated in 1954 because of {{the outbreak of the}} disease <b>bluetongue</b> in the USA. It was not until 1981 when health protocols changed that importation from the USA recommenced and between then and 2002 more than 700 animals were imported.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} had already paid substantial compensation to farmers {{because of the}} foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 followed by the <b>bluetongue</b> outbreak in 2007, {{against the background of}} EC Directives 77/391 and 78/52 on eradication of tuberculosis, brucellosis or enzootic bovine leucosis. In the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, a total of £1.4 billion in compensation was paid. The Cattle Compensation (England) Order 2006 (SI2006/168) was overturned when the High Court decided the Order was unlawful; in the test case, farmers had been receiving compensation payments of around £1,000 on animals valued at over £3,000, but in extreme cases the discrepancy between animal value and compensation paid was over one thousand percent. This case was itself overturned on appeal in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Although <b>bluetongue</b> {{disease was}} already {{recognized}} in South Africa {{in the early}} 19th century, a comprehensive description of the disease was not published until {{the first decade of}} the 20th century.
