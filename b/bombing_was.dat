5|$|The Canadian Official Historian, C. P. Stacey {{wrote that}} several Canadian {{formations}} reported {{an increase in}} morale. Wilmot wrote that the <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> essential because it raised {{the morale of the}} Second Army and depressed that of the German defenders.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspect in}} the {{attempted}} <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a 23-year-old Nigerian born into a middle-class family. Abdulmutallab was raised in Kaduna, in Nigeria's Muslim-dominated north, a place he returned to on his vacations.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 the United States changed tactics from {{strategic}} {{bombing of}} military sites to indiscriminate bombing of cities, {{including the use}} of incendiary cluster bombs. The first successful firebombing raid against Japan was an attack on Kobe on 4 February 1945. The <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> centred upon Hyogo and Minato wards.|$|E
50|$|In August 1945, on Truman's orders, two atomic <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> {{dropped on}} Japanese cities. The first <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dropped on Hiroshima, {{and the second}} <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dropped on Nagasaki by the B-29 bombers named Enola Gay and Bockscar respectively.|$|R

50|$|On 23 August 1973 a <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> {{found in}} an {{abandoned}} bag in Baker Street station ticket hall. The <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> defused.A week later another <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> found {{by a member of}} staff at the same station and was also defused. It was planted by the Provisional IRA.|$|R
5|$|In World War II, {{the bomber}} mafia's {{theory of the}} primacy of unescorted {{daylight}} strategic <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> proved wrong. Fleets of heavy bombers {{were not able to}} achieve victory without the cooperation of the Army and Navy, and required the protection of long-range fighters for deep penetration missions. Overall casualties in the war were not minimal, and victory did not come significantly quicker. Precision in <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> not achieved until long-range fighter escorts became available and air superiority was achieved, as opponents had warned. The strategic bombing concept, however, was {{a major factor in the}} eventual victory and became the first core doctrine of the independent United States Air Force. Its proponents continued to promote the doctrine into the nuclear age, forming the Strategic Air Command to carry out a vision modified to fit the needs of the Cold War and the threat of nuclear warfare. The bomber mafia was gradually replaced in the 1950s and 1960s by advocates of intercontinental ballistic missile warfare.|$|E
5|$|On 13 August 1994, a bomb {{planted by}} the IRA near the pier was defused by a {{controlled}} explosion. A similar bomb {{by the same}} perpetrators had exploded in Bognor Regis on the same day. The <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> intended to mark the 25th anniversary of the start of The Troubles. The pier was closed for several days owing to police investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Oklahoma City <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> a {{domestic}} terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, the bombing killed 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed {{one-third of the}} building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies {{in the wake of}} the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. The Oklahoma City <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil until the September 11 attacks six years later, and it still remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in United States history.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> {{placed on}} the lower path of a Mach-Zehnder {{interferometer}} with a single-photon light source. If the photon takes the lower path and the <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> live, then the photon is absorbed and triggers the bomb; otherwise, if the <b>bomb</b> <b>is</b> a dud, the photon will pass through unaffected.|$|R
50|$|Five <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> detonated in Mahabodhi temple {{premises}} on 7 July 2013. 4 <b>bombs</b> <b>were</b> also detonated in town while {{three were}} defused.|$|R

5|$|The <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> ETA's first {{attack in}} Majorca since {{it tried to}} kill King Juan Carlos I {{in the summer of}} 1995, and its deadliest attack since it killed two Civil Guard {{officers}} in Capbreton, France in 2007. The attack came {{on the eve of the}} 50th anniversary of ETA's founding, and days before the King's yearly visit to Majorca.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} time since 2007 in which ETA killed more than one person in one of its attacks. On December 2, 2007, two {{undercover}} Civil Guards were shot dead in the French town of Capbreton, Aquitaine. It was also the deadliest attack in Spanish soil since the Madrid-Barajas Airport.|$|E
5|$|After the bombing, the {{residence}} of the President of Croatia was moved from the Banski dvori to the Presidential palaceformerly known as Villa Zagorjein the Pantovčak area of Zagreb. Funds to repair the Banski dvori were approved in 1995, and the site became the official residence of the Croatian Government. A plaque commemorating the <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> placed at the Banski dvori facade 20years after the attack, in 2011. The bombing is also commemorated by the Zagreb City Museum as the event is featured in the Zagreb in Independent Croatia collection of its permanent display.|$|E
25|$|In early June 2008 an SC 1000 <b>bomb</b> <b>was</b> dredged {{from the}} River Lea near Three Mills Island in London.

5|$|During {{offensive}} {{operations at}} Saint-Mihiel, though artillery <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> in force, Banker {{and her team}} of operators manned the switchboards. When the First Army headquarters moved to Bar-le-Duc in September, Banker and her operators had {{to work in a}} place which was damaged extensively. They operated even under heavy bombing by German planes, but no team members were injured. They worked under severe weather conditions without heating, and their barracks leaked, and were later gutted, making conditions even harsher.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Berlin, No.467 Squadron {{began to}} {{concentrate}} on targets in France and Belgium as the Allied air campaign shifted focus from strategic bombing to destroying airfields and disrupting lines of communication prior to {{the invasion of the}} continent. On the night of 10/11 April, Balmer led not only his own unit but a total of 148 aircraft of No.5 Group RAF in an assault on Toulouse, striking at an airfield, and aircraft and explosives factories. The <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> highly accurate, and the Australians suffered no losses on the raid.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, {{the town}} gained borough status and had its first mayor. In the early 20th century Yeovil had around 11,000 {{inhabitants}} and {{was dominated by}} the defence industry, making it a target of German raids during World War II. The worst of the <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> in 1940 and continued until 1942. During that time 107 high explosive bombs fell on the town. 49 people died, 68 houses were totally destroyed and 2,377 damaged.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the FBI {{had three}} {{hypotheses}} regarding {{who might have}} been responsible for the bombing. The first was international terrorists, possibly the same group that had carried out the World Trade Center bombing two years earlier. The FBI also thought that a drug cartel might have been carrying out an act of vengeance against DEA agents as the building held a DEA office. The last hypothesis was that the <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> done by anti-government right-wing radicals attempting to start a rebellion against the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Philosophically, Newall {{remained}} a close follower of Trenchard during the interwar period; {{his time in}} the Independent Bombing Force had left him convinced that strategic <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> an exceptionally powerful weapon, and one that could not effectively be defended against. In this, he was a supporter of the standard doctrine of the day, which suggested that the destructive power of a bomber force was sufficiently great that it could cripple an industrial economy in short order, and that so merely its presence could potentially serve as an effective deterrent. He was promoted to air chief marshal on 1 April 1937.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the timing}} of the second <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> {{delegated}} to Tibbets. Scheduled for August 11 against Kokura, the raid was moved earlier by two days to avoid a five-day period of bad weather forecast to begin on August 10. Three bomb pre-assemblies had been transported to Tinian, labeled F-31, F-32, and F-33 on their exteriors. On August 8, a dress rehearsal was conducted off Tinian by Sweeney using Bockscar as the drop airplane. Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission.|$|E

5|$|The British Royal Air Force {{carried out}} two bombing raids on Sofia, {{the capital of}} Bulgaria, in {{retaliation}} for the attacks on Yugoslavia. The invasion resulted in the surrender of Yugoslav forces on 17 April. The senior Luftwaffe officer responsible for the <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> captured by the Yugoslavs {{at the end of the}} war and was tried and executed for war crimes, in part for his involvement in the bombing of Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|At 9:03a.m., {{the first}} of over 1,8009-1-1 calls related to the <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> {{received}} by Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA). By that time, EMSA ambulances, police, and firefighters had heard the blast and were already headed to the scene. Nearby civilians, who had also witnessed or heard the blast, arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers. Within 23minutes of the bombing, the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, consisting of representatives from the state departments of public safety, human services, military, health, and education. Assisting the SEOC were agencies including the National Weather Service, the Air Force, the Civil Air Patrol, and the American Red Cross. Immediate assistance also came from 465members of the Oklahoma National Guard, who arrived within the hour to provide security, and {{from members of the}} Department of Civil Emergency Management.|$|E
5|$|She is {{then taken}} to the capital. Archer and T'Pau also arrive after T'Pol's husband, Koss, {{provides}} transporter security codes. They present the Kir'Shara to the Command and reveal that the embassy <b>bombing</b> <b>was</b> merely a pretext to weaken the pacifist Syrranites prior to the Andorian strike. Visibly angered, V'Las lunges for the Kir'Shara, but is stunned by High-Minister Kuvak, who orders the fleet to stand down. Enterprise returns to Vulcan, and Koss visits to release T'Pol from their marriage. Meanwhile, the Vulcan High Command is dissolved, granting Earth greater autonomy, and the katra of Surak is transferred to a Vulcan high priest. V'Las, relieved of his post, meets secretly with Talok, revealed as a Romulan agent, who states that the reunification of their worlds {{is only a matter}} of time.|$|E
