Mass {{imbalances}} can {{be eliminated}} or reduced using <b>balancing</b> <b>counterweights.</b> Aerodynamic imbalances evolve from deviations in the aerodynamic {{properties of the}} blades. These lead to different thrust and tangential forces and moments, and they depend {{not only on the}} rotational frequency but also on the wind speed. Aside from lateral vibrations, they induce axial and torsional vibrations of WT. The main reason for aerodynamic imbalance is a relative deviation of the pitch angles of the blades. This can only be eliminated by a correction of those angles. Additional masses are not helpful here [1]. In practice, both types of imbalances are frequently observed both separately and in combination.|$|R

5000|$|Crankshafts {{used with}} the 305 had the same casting number as the 350 with one discernable {{difference}} - the 305 crank is lighter in weight to compensate for engine <b>balancing.</b> (The <b>counterweights</b> are smaller, which makes it unsuitable {{for use in a}} 350 where metal would have to be welded back on.) The medium journal 305, like its big-brother 350, would be further developed in the 1990s, although with a reduced 3.00" [...] stroke (using 5.94" [...] connecting rods), into the [...] "Generation II SBC" [...] GM LT-Series engine L99 263.|$|R
5000|$|Mass balancing: the {{aileron control}} system is mass <b>balanced,</b> with {{integral}} <b>counterweights</b> inside the wings.

50|$|For {{the physics}} and theory behind balanced-arm lamps, see Classical mechanics, linkage and torque. There are {{different}} methods {{to balance the}} lamp-cap of a balanced-arm lamp. Some lamps have two coil springs working in parallel {{on both sides of}} the pivoting arm. (A set of springs functions in the same way as a single spring.) Others are <b>balanced</b> with <b>counterweights</b> (a method frequently used in drawing-boards). Friction between parts of the lamp arm can also be used to maintain balance. There are a number of mechanical solutions (coupling, hydraulics and pneumatic arms) which have occasionally been used for balanced-arm lamps.|$|R

The forged steel crankshaft is fully <b>balanced</b> with eight <b>counterweights</b> {{and supported by}} five main bearings. A helical gear pressed in No. 3 counterweight drives twin contra-rotating balance shafts in the shaft housing within the lower crankcase.|$|R
50|$|It is {{customary}} {{to apply}} paint (typically yellow) or colored tape to the weights that counterbalance the batten (pipe) {{to indicate that}} they should not be removed from the arbor.

The lift lines for manual rigging run from the batten up to loft blocks, across the stage to a head block, {{and down to the}} <b>counterweight</b> <b>balancing</b> the load of the line set.

50|$|The shadoof {{consists}} of an upright frame on which is suspended a long pole or branch, {{at a distance of}} about one-fifth of its length from one end. At the long end of this pole hangs a bucket, skin bag, or bitumen-coated reed basket. The bucket can be made in many different styles, sometimes having an uneven base or a part {{at the top of the}} skin that can be untied. This allows the water to be immediately distributed rather than manually emptied. The short end carries a weight (clay, stone, or similar) which serves as the counterpoise of a lever. When correctly <b>balanced,</b> the <b>counterweight</b> will support a half-filled bucket, so some effort is used to pull an empty bucket down to the water, but only the same effort is needed to lift a full bucket.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters in undercut slopes design is {{the determination of the}} maximum stable undercut span. The maximum stable undercut span is a function of slope geometry, the strength parameters of the slope material, condition of discontinuities, underground water condition, etc. However, the desired production capacity and therefore the size of excavating equipment will sometimes ask for a wider undercut span. The influence of arching phenomenon in geo-material on the stability of undercut slopes is investigated earlier. It is believed that due to arching effect, some load transfer from the undercut area into stationary remaining side toes leads to a more stable slope. However, the transferred load may result in ploughing failure of side toes. One technique for preventing the ploughing failure is the use of <b>counterweight</b> <b>balance</b> on side toes. In this study, the influence of counterweight size on the stability of the undercut slopes was investigated through a series of numerical model tests using FLAC 3 D software. It was concluded that there is a meaningful relationship between the <b>counterweight</b> <b>balance</b> size and the maximum stable undercut span where increasing a counterweight size results in a wider stable span. Finally, the numerical results were compared with pre-conducted physical modeling test and a nonlinear relationship was proposed between the counterweight size and the maximum stable undercut span...|$|R

5000|$|The {{inclined}} lift, or inclined elevator—occasionally inclinator—is not a funicular, {{since it}} has only one car carrying payload on the slope. The car is either winched up to the station {{on the top of}} the incline where the cable is collected on a winch drum, or the single car is <b>balanced</b> by a <b>counterweight</b> and operated the same way as a funicular with two cars. Many inclined lifts were constructed along the pressure lines of storage power plants for transporting building materials. Examples are the Gelmerbahn leading to the Gelmersee and the Funicolare Piora-Ritom leading to Lago Ritom, both in Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|Contrary {{unlike other}} rotaries, the early Gnome engines like the Gnome Omega, Lambda and Delta used a unique {{arrangement}} of valves in order to eliminate pushrods that operated during the inlet phase of the combustion cycle on more conventional engines. Instead, a single exhaust valve on the cylinder head was operated by a pushrod that opened the valve when the pressure dropped {{at the end of}} the power stroke. A pressure-operated inlet valve, which was <b>balanced</b> by a <b>counterweight</b> to equalize the centrifugal forces, was placed in the centre of the piston crown, where it opened to allow the fuel-air charge to enter from the engine's central crankcase.|$|R
50|$|On {{the small}} motor pinnace Arielle, a 13-metre boat {{propelled}} by a 65HP French made Baudouin diesel engine which sailed from New York to Le Havre in 1936, {{the task of}} steering a motor boat in the Atlantic swells was more daunting. Arielle had two rudders; the main one under the hull, in the propeller race, was for manual steering and the smaller auxiliary rudder was transom mounted. This auxiliary rudder could be mechanically driven by a special wind vane mounted atop of the coachroof consisting of two rectangular airfoils set at an angle on a vertical axle and <b>balanced</b> by a <b>counterweight.</b> It was simple and worked quite well, but could not steer the boat in very light breezes or flat calm.|$|R
5000|$|The boxer {{configuration}} is {{the only}} configuration in common use {{that does not have}} unbalanced forces with a four-stroke cycle regardless of the number of cylinders, as long as both banks have the same number of cylinders. These engines do not require a <b>balance</b> shaft or <b>counterweights</b> on the crankshaft to balance the weight of the reciprocating parts, which are required in most other engine configurations. However, in the case of boxer engines with fewer than six cylinders, unbalanced moments (a reciprocating torque also known as a [...] "rocking couple") are unavoidable due to the [...] "opposite" [...] cylinders being slightly out of line with each other. Other engine configurations with natural dynamic balance include the straight-six, the straight-eight, the V12, and the V16.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{reducing}} the dynamic reactions (shaking force, shaking moment and driving torque) of planar crank-rocker four-bars through counterweight addition. Determining the counterweight mass parameters constitutes a nonlinear optimization problem, which suffers from local optima. This paper, however, proves {{that it can}} be reformulated as a convex program, that is, a nonlinear optimization problem of which any local optimum is also globally optimal. Because of this unique property, it is possible to investigate (and by virtue of the guaranteed global optimum, in fact prove) the ultimate limits of <b>counterweight</b> <b>balancing.</b> In a first example a design procedure is presented that is based on graphically representing the ultimate limits in design charts.

50|$|Large camera cranes {{are almost}} {{indistinguishable from the}} usual boom-type cranes, with the {{exception}} of special equipment for smoothly moving the boom and controlling noise. Small camera cranes and crane-trucks have a lightweight construction, often without a mechanical drive. The valves are controlled manually by <b>balancing</b> the load-specific <b>counterweight,</b> facilitating manipulation. To improve usability and repeatability of movement of the crane in different takes, the axis of rotation arrows are provided with limbs and a pointer. In some cases, the camera crane is mounted on a dolly for even greater camera mobility. Such devices are called crane trolleys. In modern films robotic cranes allow use of multiple actuators for high-accuracy repeated movement of the camera in trick photography. These devices are called tap-robots; some sources use the term motion control.|$|R

5000|$|Some people {{argue that}} {{elevators}} began as simple rope or chain hoists (see Traction elevators below).

40|$|In the {{mechanisms}} area, minimization {{of the magnitude}} of the acceleration of the center of mass (ACoM) implies shaking force balancing. For a mechanism operating in cycles, the case when the ACoM is zero implies that the gravitational potential energy (GPE) is constant. This article shows an efficient and effective optimum synthesis method for minimum acceleration of the center of mass of a spherical 4 R mechanism by using dual functions and the <b>counterweights</b> <b>balancing</b> method. Once the dual function for ACoM has been written, one can minimize the shaking forces from a kinematic point of view.

40|$|To perform {{simulations}} of partial or microgravity environments on earth requires some method of {{compensation for the}} earth's gravitational field. This paper discusses an active compensation system that modulates the tension in a counterweight support cable {{in order to minimize}} state deviation between the compensated body and the ideal weightless body. The system effectively compensates for inertial effects of the counterweight mass, viscous damping of all pulleys, and static friction {{in all parts of the}} gravity compensation system using a hybrid PI(proportional plus integral) /fuzzy control algorithm. The dynamic compensation of inertia and viscous damping is performed by PI control, while static friction compensation is performed by the fuzzy system. The system provides a very precise gravity compensation force, and is capable of non-constant gravity force compensation in the case that the payload mass is not constant. The only additional hardware requirements needed for the implementation of this system on a passive <b>counterweight</b> <b>balance</b> system are: a strain gauge tension sensor, and a torque motor with encoder...|$|R
5000|$|The sarissa was {{the pike}} {{used by the}} Ancient Macedonian army. The actual length of the sarissa is now unknown, but {{apparently}} it was {{twice as long as}} the dory. This makes it at least 14 ft, but 18 ft appears more likely. (The cavalry xyston was 12.5 ft by comparison.) The great length of the pike was <b>balanced</b> by a <b>counterweight</b> at the rear end, which also functions as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground. Because of its great length, weight and differing balance, a sarissa was wielded two-handed. This meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence. Instead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved for light skirmishers - peltasts) to their left forearm. Although this reduced the shield wall, the extreme length of the spear prevented most enemies from closing, as the pikes of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the front row. In addition, the last 6-18 ranks of soldiers held their spears in the air over the front ranks, making an effective barrier against missiles [...] This pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. It would also be very hard to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} find out whether a {{reduction}} in load-bearing on chicken legs would modify the activity and leg bone tissue, an original suspension device was developed in order to alleviate half of the weight-load on the legs. Thirty-six 5 d-old male meat-type chicks were assigned to 12 groups, each of 3 birds: a control bird (C), a bird equipped with a harness (H) and one equipped with a harness and suspended from a <b>balance</b> (S). The <b>counterweights</b> of the <b>balance</b> reduced the load on the legs by 50 %. Behaviour in the birds was recorded twice for a 22 -hour period. The birds were slaughtered at 19 d of age. Their legs were then weighed and the humeri, tibiotarsi and femurs were used for compu-tation of length, biomechanical stiffness and composition. Tibiotarsi were also used for histomorphometry. Body weight at 19 d of age was significantly higher in the C birds (642 g vs. 586 g in the H and S groups, P < 0. 05). The distance travelled as measured in the second week of the experi-ment was greater in S birds (338 m per 22 h vs. 246 in the C group and 252 in the H group, P < 0. 05). The length of the tibiotarsi and femora was greater in the S birds when corrected for body weight (P < 0. 05). Bone stiffness, composition and histological parameters were not significantly different in the 3 groups. We thus concluded that a reduction in load-bearing on the legs of young chicks en-hances locomotor activity and longitudinal growth of leg bones. Bone quality was not affected, prob...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis on}} {{management}} and pedagogy in bilingual education details {{the development of}} Estonia's early and late Estonian-language immersion programmes in a context where a need for increased social cohesion underpinned programming, political will was mobilised and leadership was distributed among stakeholders, Genesee (2003 : 17) considers the Estonian early immersion programme {{as one of the}} most carefully planned of its kind. The research study documents management and pedagogical practices, including the ideational forces and concrete mechanisms that have contributed to the development of sustainable programming. Beardsmore (2007) calls for additional studies that simultaneously investigate pedagogy and management in bilingual education. The study incorporates action research, as the researcher investigated the development of a programme he had helped to co-manage and acted as an informant for the study. The personal account is grounded in an analysis of programme planning and reporting documents and of data from interviews with government decision-makers, and in a case study of four schools offering late immersion. Students, parents, deputy headteachers and headteachers were surveyed. Fifty-one lessons were observed. This case study of language immersion, with its successes and setbacks, is also grounded in a literature review that explores the concepts of bilingualism, bilingual education, stakeholding, distributed leadership, professional learning communities and pseudo-communities. The review also examines the economic and cognitive benefits of bilingualism. The study is further informed by moderate social constructivism, and complexity theory. Bilingual education is thus situated in a larger ecology of structural interdependencies. It is argued that know ledge about these concepts, and their interdependencies can potentially be used to build contexts favourable for bilingual education. A large number of assumptions, beliefs and pedagogical practices, as well as forces, mechanisms and counterweights were found to influence immersion programme development. Individual teacher assumptions, beliefs and practices tended to fall on a continuum between fostering or it is argued undermining student learning. All three were identified as having considerable impact on learning environments. In particular, the study revealed challenges faced by teachers in integrating content and language. Planning mechanisms such as results-based management frameworks were crucial in programme development. However, these mechanisms were in and of themselves inert, being powered by forces such as stakeholder inclusion, a belief in immersion, and stakeholder learning. Whilst an Immersion Centre that led and coordinated programming was a central component in programme development, this mechanism was fuelled by the moral authority of its staff, their sense of mission, and dialogue for partnership. Maintaining <b>balance</b> through <b>counterweights</b> such as accountability for process with accountability for results also contributed to programme success. The thesis proposes a redefinition of the terms CLIL (content and language integrated learning) and bilingual education. The thesis also argues that stakeholders such as educators and managers need to develop complexity competence which includes a high degree of competence in a wide range of fields and heightened meta-cognitive, meta-affective and meta-social skills. Two frameworks are offered for identifying and navigating key elements of the complexities of bilingual education - one is primarily pedagogically focused (A Continuum for Bilingual Education) and the other is primarily management focused (A Reciprocal Co-evolutionary Paradigm for the Development of Bilingual Education). <...|$|R
