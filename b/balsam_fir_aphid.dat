40|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990 s, the <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly (Neodiprion abietis) became a {{significant}} defoliating insect of precommercially thinned <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) stands in western Newfoundland, Canada. In 1997, a nucleopolyhedrovirus (NeabNPV) was isolated from the <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly and, as no control measures were then available, NeabNPV was developed for the biological control of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly. In order to register NeabNPV for operational use under the Canadian Pest Control Products Act, research {{was carried out in}} a number of areas including NeabNPV field efficacy, non-target organism toxicology, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly ecology and impact on <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> trees, and NeabNPV genome sequencing and analysis. As part of the field efficacy trials, approximately 22 500 hectares of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly-infested forest were aerially treated with NeabNPV between 2000 and 2005. NeabNPV was found to be safe, efficacious, and economical for the suppression of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly outbreak populations. Conditional registration for the NeabNPV-based product, Abietiv™, was received from the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (Health Canada) in April 2006. In July 2006, Abietiv was applied by spray airplanes to 15 000 ha of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly-infested forest in western Newfoundland in an operational control program...|$|R
50|$|The {{outbreaks}} of the <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly cause {{a reduction in}} tree growth which in turn can cause tree mortality. The <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly, more specifically third to fifth instar larvae are responsible for defoliation and foliage weight loss in trees. <b>Balsam</b> <b>fir</b> sawfly defoliation does not stimulate the release of buds or shoots, which contributes to a slow recovery and severe impact on the <b>balsam</b> <b>fir.</b> N. abietis outbreaks have been documented to increase in intensity in thinned forests of Atlantic Canada.|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{investigated}} ecophysiological {{and growth}} re-sponses of short (0. 4 to 1. 3 m in height) advance regeneration of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies balsamea L.) {{six years after}} removal of 0, 40, 50, 60 and 100 % of the overstory basal area (BA) in two yellow birch–conifer stands. Partial cuts significantly increased stomatal conduc-tance of red spruce only. Light-saturated photosynthesis (leaf-area basis) of both species increased with BA removal, but un-like red spruce, specific leaf area (SLA) of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> decreased with increased cutting intensity. Partial cuts appreciably in-creased the concentration of N and Ca in red spruce and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> foliage, respectively, and resulted in decreased foliar con-centrations of K in red spruce and Mg in <b>balsam</b> <b>fir.</b> The height and lateral growth of both species increased with BA removal, although partial cuts were more beneficial to <b>balsam</b> <b>fir.</b> The data suggest that short advance regeneration of red spruce and <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> can coexist under partial overstory conditions, but <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> has physiological characteristics and a capacity for morphological adjustment (SLA) that places it at an advantage when in competition with red spruce...|$|R
50|$|Red {{spruce and}} <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> are common at lower {{elevations}} {{of the mountain}} conifer forests. Hardwoods that grow among the conifers include paper birch, yellow birch, and American mountain-ash (Sorbus americana). With increasing elevation, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> becomes more abundant. Near treeline, black spruce joins <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> in the krummholz. Herbaceous plants include wood sorrel, bunchberry, yellow clintonia, and spinulose woodfern (Dryopteris carthusiana). Mosses and lichens cover exposed rocks.|$|R
5000|$|Swamp - swamp forest types never {{completely}} dry out, so <b>balsam</b> <b>firs</b> have constant access to water. The ground {{is covered in}} sphagnum and other mosses. In swamps, <b>balsam</b> <b>firs</b> grow densely and slowly, and are slender.|$|R
50|$|Catskill forest {{historian}} Michael Kudish {{has studied}} the range's <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> distribution patterns. There are no other peaks where <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> occurs {{on the slopes of}} the peak, but not the summit, and factors such as elevation, soil, and topography do not suffice to explain the phenomenon. He has concluded that all peaks represent different stages of forest evolution, in which the stunted and twisted ridge hardwoods gradually have replaced <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> over the last 8,500 years.|$|R
40|$|Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) {{was a major}} {{component}} of mesic forests in the Upper Great Lakes region, but presently persists in only a few locations. Many of these stands experience poor regeneration due to herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), suggesting that hemlock will become progressively less common in these stands. We tested the hypothesis that <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies balsamea) facilitates establishment of eastern hemlock at 11 sites in northern Wisconsin. Hemlock saplings are three times as dense and twice as tall when growing within patches of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> compared to growing outside such patches. Hemlock saplings growing outside <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> patches are also four times as likely to exhibit deer browsing damage as those growing inside. These results suggest that patches of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> create a physical or visual barrier to deer and thus provide a refuge for hemlock saplings from white-tailed deer browsing. Because <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> saplings are much more abundant than hemlock in northern Wisconsin forests and establish on a wider range of sites, foresters could use patches of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> to facilitate local hemlock establishment and so promote restoration of this important forest type...|$|R
50|$|The larvae of the {{spruce budworm}} moth cause {{defoliation}} which {{will lead to}} death if it occurs several years in a row, though black spruce is less susceptible than white spruce or <b>balsam</b> <b>fir.</b> Trees most at risk are those growing with <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> and white spruce.|$|R

As the climate changes, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies balsamea) and other boreal forest species in North America {{will have to deal with}} an influx of hardwood tree species attempting to expand their ranges northward. The success of this migration into the boreal forest and its influence on the ecosystem largely depends on the competitive relationship between <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> and these hardwood species in the forest understory. To gain insight into the future role of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> in the forest ecosystem of this region, this study examined how stand structure, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> photosynthesis rates, and nitrogen concentrations varied between different forest types at the deciduous/boreal forest ecotone in Lake Superior Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada.

40|$|To {{assess the}} impact of natural enemies on the {{distribution}} of eastern hemlock looper various <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> stands were examined at Black Pond, in central Newfoundland. In 1995, 1996 and 1997 insects were collected using Malaise traps suspended into the <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> canopy. First, natural enemy abundance was assessed based on <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> stand vigour. A non-continuous vigour gradient was established using three silvicultural methods (root pruning, thinning, and fertilizing) and control treatments. Natural enemy abundance, in general and known eastern hemlock looper natural enemy abundance and diversity was higher in <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> stands that were more vigourous. These more vigorous stands provided natural enemies with more alternate hosts or prey. Second, natural enemy abundance was estimated based on the time since thinning and vegetation diversity of <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> stands.

5000|$|The Appalachians {{are also}} home to two species of <b>fir,</b> the boreal <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> (...) , and the {{southern}} high elevation endemic, Fraser fir (...) [...] Fraser fir is confined to the highest parts of the southern Appalachian Mountains, where along with red spruce it forms a fragile ecosystem known as the Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. Fraser fir rarely occurs below 5500 ft, and becomes the dominant tree type at 6200 ft. [...] By contrast, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> is found from near sea level to the tree line in the northern Appalachians, but ranges only {{as far south as}} Virginia and West Virginia in the central Appalachians, where it is usually confined above 3900 ft asl, except in cold valleys. Curiously, it is associated with oaks in Virginia. The <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> of Virginia and West Virginia is thought by some to be a natural hybrid between the more northern variety and Fraser fir. While red spruce is common in both upland and bog habitats, <b>balsam</b> <b>fir,</b> as well as black spruce and tamarack, are more characteristic of the latter. However <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> also does well in soils with a pH as high as 6.|$|R

40|$|The {{spruce budworm}} Choristoneura fumiferana Clem. is the {{foremost}} forest pest in Canada. The species is endemic to eastern North America. Since {{the turn of}} the century the insect has become a major problem in the “Great Lakes St. Lawrence Forest Region” of Ontario, an area where prior to recent times the insect did not occur in damaging numbers. Analysis of the life cycle of the insect reveals that the only limiting factor capable of controlling outbreaks is a lack of food. The required tree species is <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> Abies balsama (L.) Mill. The forests of Ontario have been altered to favour the <b>balsam</b> <b>fir.</b> Logging of the former pine forests that once dominated the landscape and the fires which followed are responsible for such change. It has also been shown that changes in the climate may also be responsible for the increase in <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> as a dominant species of the forests of Ontario. Once established <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> forests and the spruce budworm are a self-regulating natural system, an evolved process that ensures a future food supply for the insect. The suppression of forest fires since the logging era is also shown to encourage the continual presence of high <b>balsam</b> <b>fir</b> content forests. The budworm will continue to thrive and cause damage in that region where it did not formerly occur in significant numbers...|$|R
