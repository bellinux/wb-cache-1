Measurement accuracy, repeatability, reproducibility, <b>bias,</b> <b>data</b> shifts, and data drifts {{are only a few}} common issues identified in measurement, and any useful system must be evaluated from the technical point of view to assure that it addresses these criteria. It is essential that measurement error is quantified so that managers react to changes in conditions, but not changes due to measurement variation. At the very least, all measurements need to show statistical confidence intervals or so-called “error bars”. Independent organizations like the Advertising Research Foundation evaluate the validity of commonly used measurement systems.|$|E

40|$|Before condemning {{data mining}} one should {{distinguish}} between objective and <b>biased</b> <b>data</b> mining. The former is commendable. Even <b>biased</b> <b>data</b> mining is appropriate when used to illustrate {{and not to}} test hypotheses. In the context of testing, the problem with <b>biased</b> <b>data</b> mining arises not from the fitting of many regression, but from inadequate reporting of results. The trend towards reporting the results of more alternative specifications, and thus addressing the fragility problem, should be encouraged. To do that the incentives that economists face should be changed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the underlying event structure in pp collisions begins with an efficient and minimally biased data sample. This document describes the feasibility of obtaining zero <b>bias</b> <b>data</b> and presents an approach to triggering minimum bias collisions with the CMS detector. Triggering such collisions that often have {{just a handful of}} particles is difficult and can lead to severe biases on the data, thus the possibility to obtain zero <b>bias</b> <b>data</b> is evaluated for various beam bunch patterns and luminosity regions. For regions where zero bias triggering is not feasible, the merits of utilising the forward hadronic calorimeter (HF) as a minimum bias trigger is discussed and fully simulated. We find that using HF in a single-side configuration, a hard core (non-diffractive) efficiency of ∼ 80 % can be attained, whilst retaining some sensitivity to diffractive type collisions. Estimated rates and suggested prescale factors are presented for each beam-bunch pattern configuration. The merits of zero-bias and HF-triggered minimum bias are also discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{investigate}} response <b>bias</b> in survey <b>data</b> on annual driving mileage {{and evaluate the}} performance of a proposed remedy, Orbit. Individuals systematically exaggerate their deviation from the sample average, and using the self-reported data leads to misleading estimates of the income elasticity of travel mileage. I extend the Orbit procedure, which is designed to correct for reporting bias, to allow misreporting at the lower censoring point. Orbit fails to detect the nature of the bias and distorts the income elasticity estimate even further. The message for practitioners using <b>biased</b> <b>data</b> is therefore a cautionary one. ...|$|R

The asymptotic mean squared error is also derived in order to obtain the optimal value of smoothing parameters required in the proposed estimator. The results are stated under a stationary ergodic assumption, without assuming any traditional mixing conditions. A simulation study is carried out to compare the proposed estimator with the local linear regression estimate...|$|R

40|$|In machine learning, a bias occurs {{whenever}} training {{sets are}} not {{representative for the}} test data, which results in unreliable models. The most common <b>biases</b> in <b>data</b> are arguably class imbalance and covariate shift. In this work, we aim {{to shed light on}} this topic in order to increase the overall attention to this issue in the field of machine learning. We propose a scalable novel framework for reducing multiple <b>biases</b> in high-dimensional <b>data</b> sets in order to train more reliable predictors. We apply our methodology to the detection of irregular power usage from real, noisy industrial data. In emerging markets, irregular power usage, and electricity theft in particular, may range up to 40 % of the total electricity distributed. <b>Biased</b> <b>data</b> sets are of particular issue in this domain. We show that reducing these biases increases the accuracy of the trained predictors.

In the absence of sex-selective abortion, sex-selective infanticide can be deduced from very skewed birth statistics.

40|$|Superposition time {{functions}} {{offer one}} of the effective ways of handling variable-rate data. However, {{they can also be}} biased and misleading the engineer to the wrong diagnosis and eventually to the wrong analysis. Since the superposition time functions involve rate as essential constituent, the superposition time is affected greatly with rate issues. Production data of shale gas wells are usually subjected to operating issues that yield noise and outliers. Whenever the rate data is noisy or contains outliers, {{it will be hard to}} distinguish their effects from common regime if the superposition time functions are used as plotting time function on log-log plots. Such deceiving presence of these flow regimes will define erroneous well and reservoir parameters. Based on these results and with the upsurge of energy needs there might be some costly decisions will be taken such as refracting or re-stimulating the well especially in tight formations. In this work, a simple technique is presented in order to rapidly check whether there is <b>data</b> <b>bias</b> on the superposition-time specialized plots or not. The technique is based on evaluating the kernel of the superposition time function of each flow regime for the maximum production time. Whatever beyond the Kernel-Equivalent Maximum Production Time (KEMPT) it is considered as <b>biased</b> <b>data.</b> The hypothesis of this technique is that there is no way to see in the reservoir more than what has been seen. A workflow involving different diagnostic and filtering techniques has been proposed to verify proposed notion. Different synthetic and field examples were used in this study. Once the all problematic issues have been detected and filtered out, it was clear that whatever went beyond the KEMPT is a consequence of these issues. Thus, the proposed KEMPT technique can be relied on in order to detect and filter out the <b>biased</b> <b>data</b> points on superposition-time log-log plots. Both raw and filtered data were analyzed using type-curve matching of linear flow type-curves for calculating the original gas in-place (OGIP). It has been found that <b>biased</b> <b>data</b> yield noticeable reduced OGIP. Such reduction is attributed to the early fictitious onset of boundary dominated flow, where early false detection of the drainage boundaries defines less gas in-place occupied in these boundaries...|$|R
