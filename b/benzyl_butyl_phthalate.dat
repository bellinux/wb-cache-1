Single-drop microextraction (SDME) {{coupled to}} {{capillary}} gas chromatography (GC) was {{established for the}} determination of four phthalate esters in wastewater, including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-octyl <b>phthalate</b> (DnOP) and <b>butyl</b> <b>benzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (BBP). The SDME parameters such as extractants, extracting time，stirring rate and immerging depth of needle point were studyed and optimized. The abovementioned phthalate esters were quantified by external standardization method using GC coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID). The linear regression calibration curves, detection limits (S/N= 3) and the linear ranges of the method for determining each phthalate were determined, respectively. The concentrations of components abovementioned in a real wastewater sample, {{the average of the}} recoveries obtained in the spiked wastewater samples and the corresponding relative standard deviations were determined, respectively. The results showed the proposed method several attributes, friendly enviroment, economic and highly efficient pretreatment, less time, simplicity, sensitivity, accuracy and wide linear range and so on...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} concern that estrogenic {{environmental}} compounds {{that act as}} endocrine-disrupting chemicals might potentially have adverse effects on hormone-sensitive organs such as the breast. This concern is further fueled by evidence indicating that natural estrogens, specifically 17 b-estradiol, are important factors in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. We have developed an in vitro–in vivo model {{in which we have}} demonstrated the carcinogenicity of E 2 in human breast epithelial cells MCF- 10 F. Hypermethylation of NRG 1, STXBP 6, BMP 6, CSS 3, SPRY 1, and SNIP were found at different progression stages in this model. The use of this powerful and unique model has provided a tool for exploring whether bisphenol A and <b>butyl</b> <b>benzyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> have relevance in the initiation of breast cancer. These studies provide firsthand evidence that the natural estrogen 17 b-estradiol and xenoestrogenic substances like bisphenol A are able to induce neoplastic transformation in human breast epithelial cells...|$|R
40|$|The aquatic environments of the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China {{have been}} {{contaminated}} by various industrial chemicals from local industries. In this study, the spatial-temporal distribution of six priority phthalate esters (PAEs) in surface {{water and sediments}} from the PRD was investigated. The PAEs were detected with total concentrations (S 6 PAEs) ranging from 0. 35 to 20. 70 姠L 1 in surface water and dry weight ranging from 0. 88 to 5. 69 姠g 1 in sediments. The S 6 PAEs concentrations in surface water {{were higher in the}} wet season than those in the dry season, while the opposite pattern was observed in sediments. Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was the most abundant congener, which was higher than those reported in the literature. Risk quotients for relevant aquatic organisms were obtained and showed that most of these PAEs, in particular, <b>butyl</b> <b>benzyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> DEHP and di-n-octyl phthalate, have significant potential health and ecological risks for the aquatic environment studied.
