5|$|Commentators {{generally}} agree that, {{to precipitate}} {{such a course}} of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the sounding rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe waterspout strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the <b>bilges</b> up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.|$|E
5|$|U-43 was due {{to depart}} Lorient on a war patrol to an area off Freetown, west Africa, but early on 4 February 1941, she sank while tied to Ysere, an old sailing ship which {{was used as a}} {{floating}} pier. Valves and vents had been tampered-with the previous day, but no one had noticed the slow, but steady ingress of water into the <b>bilges.</b> To make matters worse and contrary to a Befehlshaber der U-Boote (BdU—U-boat command headquarters) directive, a hatch had been left open, allowing water to pour into the after torpedo room. Two petty officers were found to be most at fault; but Lüth, as captain, was ultimately responsible. However, according to author Jordan Vause, no record of punishment seems to have survived and Lüth's career {{does not appear to have}} been affected. U-43 was refloated and Lüth took it back out into the North Atlantic in May 1941.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} put in dry dock {{for the first time}} at Lyttelton and the carpenter, Frederick Dailey, {{prepared}} a lengthy report detailing the numerous empty bolt holes and slack hull fittings he found. Six feet (1.8 metres) of water had seeped into the ship's <b>bilges</b> and lower hold through badly-sealed joints in the planking. While these were repaired there was considerable dispute between the RGS and Dundee Shipbuilders as to who was responsible for the defects, but the Discovery left for the Antarctic on December 21, 1901 after three weeks in New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|A <b>bilge</b> pump is a {{water pump}} used to remove <b>bilge</b> water. Since fuel can {{be present in}} the <b>bilge,</b> {{electric}} <b>bilge</b> pumps are designed to not cause sparks. Electric <b>bilge</b> pumps are often fitted with float switches which turn on the pump when the <b>bilge</b> fills to a set level. Since <b>bilge</b> pumps can fail, use of a backup pump is often advised. The primary pump is normally located at the lowest point of the <b>bilge,</b> while the secondary pump would be located somewhat higher. This ensures that the secondary pump activates only when the primary pump is overwhelmed or fails, and keeps the secondary pump free of the debris in the <b>bilge</b> that tends to clog the primary pump.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bilge</b> keel is used {{to reduce}} a ship's {{tendency}} to roll. <b>Bilge</b> keels are employed in pairs (one for {{each side of the}} ship). A ship may have more than one <b>bilge</b> keel per side, but this is rare. <b>Bilge</b> keels increase hydrodynamic resistance to rolling, making the ship roll less. <b>Bilge</b> keels are passive stability systems.|$|R

25|$|Watertight {{subdivision}} limits loss of buoyancy and freeboard in {{the event}} of damage, and may protect vital machinery from flooding. Most ships have some pumping capacity to remove accumulated water from the <b>bilges,</b> but a steel ship with no watertight subdivision will sink if water accumulates faster than pumps can remove it. Standards of watertight subdivision assume no dewatering capability, although pumps kept in working order may provide an additional measure of safety {{in the event}} of minor leaks. The most common watertight subdivision is accomplished with transverse bulkheads dividing the elongated hull into a number of watertight floodable lengths. Early watertight subdivision tested with hoses sometimes failed to withstand the hydrostatic pressure of an adjoining flooded compartment. Effective watertight subdivision requires these transverse bulkheads to be both watertight and structurally sound.|$|E
500|$|To {{minimise}} their draught the Beacons {{were given}} a very full hull shape with squared-off <b>bilges</b> and a flat bottom. Admiral G. A. Ballard commented that they were built [...] "along the lines of an extremely elongated packing crate." [...] This made them steady gun platforms and gave them {{quite a bit of}} buoyancy. If they ran aground, this shape allowed them to be pulled off easily and they remained upright if stranded by a receding tide. However, this hull shape made their steering erratic at low speeds or in a following sea and they made a large amount of leeway in a strong side breeze.|$|E
500|$|Flight 19 was the {{designation}} {{of a group of}} five Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers that disappeared over the Bermuda Triangle on December 5, 1945 after losing contact during a United States Navy overwater navigation training flight from Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale, Florida. All 14 airmen on the flight were lost, as were all 13 crew members of a Martin PBM Mariner flying boat that subsequently launched from Naval Air Station Banana River to search for Flight 19. [...] The PBM aircraft was known to accumulate flammable gasoline vapors in its <b>bilges,</b> and professional investigators have assumed that the PBM most likely exploded in mid-air while searching for the flight. Navy investigators could not determine the exact cause of the loss of Flight 19.|$|E
50|$|Large {{commercial}} vessels need <b>bilge</b> alarms {{to notify}} the crew how much and where the <b>bilge</b> is rising. These <b>bilge</b> alarms are electric devices that {{are also designed to}} detect leakages in the ship early before major damage is done to the vessel. Oil content meters are sometimes referred to as <b>bilge</b> alarms.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>bilge</b> keel {{is a long}} fin of metal, {{often in}} a [...] "V" [...] shape, welded {{along the length of}} the ship at the turn of the <b>bilge.</b> <b>Bilge</b> keels are {{employed}} in pairs (one for each side of the ship). A ship may have more than one <b>bilge</b> keel per side, but this is rare. <b>Bilge</b> keels increase the hydrodynamic resistance when a vessel rolls, thus limiting the amount of roll a vessel has to endure.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>bilge</b> keel {{is often}} in a [...] "V" [...] shape, welded {{along the length of}} the ship at the turn of the <b>bilge.</b> Although not as {{effective}} as stabilizing fins, <b>bilge</b> keels have a major advantage in their low impact on internal ship arrangements. Unlike fins, <b>bilge</b> keels do not have any components inside the hull that would adversely affect cargo or mission spaces. Like fins, <b>bilge</b> keels have the disadvantage of increasing the hydrodynamic resistance of the vessel, thus hindering forward motion.|$|R
500|$|Though severe, {{the damage}} to Shinano was at first judged to be manageable. The crew were {{confident}} in the ship's armor and strength, which translated into lax initial efforts to save the ship. [...] This overconfidence extended to Abe. [...] He doubted the sub's torpedoes could inflict serious damage, since he was well aware that American torpedoes were inferior to Japanese torpedoes in both potency and accuracy. [...] He ordered the carrier to maintain its maximum speed even after the last torpedo hit. [...] The resultant extensive flooding caused the carrier to list 10 degrees to starboard within a few minutes. Despite the crew pumping [...] of water into the port <b>bilges,</b> the list increased to 13 degrees. [...] When it became apparent the damage was more severe than first thought, Abe ordered a change of course towards Shiono Point. Progressively increasing flooding increased the list to 15 degrees by 03:30. Fifty minutes later, Abe ordered the empty port outboard tanks to be counter-flooded, reducing the list to 12 degrees for a brief time. After 05:00 he ordered the civilian workers {{to be transferred to}} the escorts as they were impeding the crew in their duties.|$|E
500|$|After launching, {{the sisters}} were {{transferred}} to Kronstadt for fitting out as the shallow waters around Saint Petersburg prevented deep-draft ships from being completed. This added more delays as the dockyard there lacked the equipment to efficiently fit out the ships. Both ships {{were assigned to the}} Baltic Fleet upon completion and they were not fully equipped until around 1872. The monitor [...] accidentally rammed Admiral Lazarev in Kronstadt harbor on 22 October 1871. The former was only slightly damaged, but the latter had a [...] hole punched in its hull. Water poured in and the ship took on a list of 8° and nearly capsized before other ships in the harbor could use their pumps to reduce the flooding. The ship's watertight bulkheads proved to be poorly caulked and sealed and the commission that investigated the accident recommended that the bulkheads be tested during construction by intentionally flooding them. The Navy ignored this recommendation, which directly led to the loss of the coast-defense ship [...] in 1897. Another recommendation which was followed was to attach all of the ship's pumps to the <b>bilges</b> to allow a flooded compartment to be pumped out as quickly as possible. This modification was tested aboard Admiral Lazarevin 1872 and became standard practice for the navy.|$|E
2500|$|At 11:40p.m., on April 14, {{one of the}} ship's lookouts rang a bell {{to signal}} that an object lay {{directly}} in the ship's path. The vessel turned to avoid a collision, but the submerged portion of an iceberg gouged its bulkhead and <b>bilges.</b> In the confusion that followed, Wick was last seen {{on the deck of}} the sinking ocean liner, waving to relatives as they were helped into lifeboats. Caroline Bonnell, who boarded one of the first lifeboats dispatched from the ship, told reporters what happened later: [...] "There was a big wave. The sea was calm, otherwise, and I asked a sailor what it was. He said, 'the Titanic has sunk!'" [...] Wick's body was never recovered.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, 2 D {{nonlinear}} {{viscous flow}} caused by rolling motion of submerged cylinder {{with and without}} <b>bilge</b> keels are simulated using the finite-volume method in order to investigate {{the relationship between the}} damping moment induced by the <b>bilge</b> keel and the width of the <b>bilge</b> keel. The cylinder is submerged far away from the free surface to eliminate the interaction of the cylinder and the surface wave induced by the motion of it, and in this way, the damping moments obtained are caused by the cylinder and the <b>bilge</b> keels only. Verification and validation of the numerical results are performed in the conditions of different rolling periods and maximal rolling angles. Three parameters such as the width of the <b>bilge</b> keel, the rolling period and the maximal rolling angle are taken into account, and the effect of the width of the <b>bilge</b> keel is discussed. The analysis of the numerical result shows that there is a minimum effective width of the <b>bilge</b> keel, so the further research is performed, in which a result that the damping moment of the cylinder with the given <b>bilge</b> keels is less than the one without <b>bilge</b> keels is discovered. The calculation data is analyzed in detail, and the reason is discussed by the investigation of the damping moment components in the different conditions. After that, the damping moments of the cylinder with different <b>bilge</b> keel width in different conditions are calculated and compared. The result of the systematic research shows that the damping moment of the submerged cylinder with <b>bilge</b> keels increases nonlinearly while the width of the <b>bilge</b> keel increases linearly when the width of <b>bilge</b> keel is larger than the minimum effective width...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bilge</b> keels are {{effective}} passive devices in mitigating the rolling motion, and {{the usage of}} them covers almost all the sea going vessels. This paper focuses on the viscous effect of the <b>bilge</b> keel, ignored {{the effect of the}} free surface and the effect of the ship hull, for the general viscous characteristic of the <b>bilge</b> keel. In order to investigate the viscous effect of the <b>bilge</b> keel on the total damping moment, a special 2 dimensional numerical model, which includes a submerged cylinder with and without <b>bilge</b> keels, is designed for the simulation of forced rolling. Three important factors such as <b>bilge</b> keels width, rolling periods, as well as maximal rolling angles are taken into account, and the viscous flow field around the cylinder is simulated by some codes based on the viscous method in different conditions, in which the three factors are coupled. Verification and validation based on the ITTC method are performed for the cylinder without <b>bilge</b> keels in the conditions of different rolling periods and maximal rolling angles. The primary calculation of damping moment induced by the cylinder with 0 mm, 4 mm, and 10 mm width <b>bilge</b> keels shows some interesting results, and a systematic analysis is conducted. The analysis of the damping moment components suggests there is phase difference between the damping moment induced by the cylinder and the <b>bilge</b> keels, and when the <b>bilge</b> keels width reaches a special size, the total damping moment is mitigated. The calculation of the damping moments induced by the cylinder with some larger <b>bilge</b> keels are also performed, and the results suggest that, the damping moment induced by the <b>bilge</b> keels is increased rapidly and becomes the dominant part in the total damping moment while the width of the <b>bilge</b> keels are increased, but the damping moment induced by the cylinder is not changed significantly. Some illustration of the vortices formation and shedding is included, which is the mechanism of the damping moment caused by the <b>bilge</b> keels. The present work shows an interesting problem, and it is useful for the <b>bilge</b> keel design...|$|R

2500|$|Edward Harland's {{new company}} quickly {{attracted}} {{an order of}} three boats from John Bibby & Sons. These boats were named Venetian, Sicilian and Syrian; the current company's order book still has the three boats listed as No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3. Impressed with the boats, Bibby ordered six more boats from Harland in 1860. The boats that Edward Harland designed were long, had a narrow beam and were flat-bottomed; the boats became known as [...] "Bibby's coffins". On 26 January 1860, Harland married Rosa Matilda Wann, of Vermont, Belfast, who {{was the daughter of}} Thomas Wann, a stockbroker and insurance agent. In 1861, Harland chose the 27-year-old Gustav Wilhelm Wolff, his former personal assistant, to become a partner in the firm, forming Harland and Wolff. Harland's company had a prosperous relationship with Thomas Henry Ismay's White Star Line, a prominent shipping company, ensuring regular orders and financial success. Harland's designing skills created ships with flatter bottoms and squarer <b>bilges</b> to increase capacity. According to Edward Harland's obituary in The Times, he designed his company's ocean liners [...] "on the model of a fish swimming through the water." [...] Harland's company received orders during the American Civil War from the Confederate States of America, who bought fast steamers to evade the Union blockade. In 1874 Edward Harland recruited William James Pirrie, a former apprentice at the company as a partner; Pirrie later became chairman of the company, and was given the task of finding buyers and negotiating deals. Harland was once asked the nature of the three men's business relationship and replied: [...] Harland applied for several patents including, in 1860 for [...] "improvements in constructing and covering the decks of ships and other floating bodies", in 1871 for [...] "improvements in apparatus for propelling vessels", in 1878 for [...] "improvements in screw-propellers." [...] In 1880 Harland and his two partners decided to expand further and built their own engine works. Harland began having less involvement in the running of the shipyard, and in 1889 he retired from daily involvement in the business.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bilge</b> {{water can}} be found aboard almost every vessel.

50|$|When {{designing}} a <b>bilge</b> keel {{there are important}} decisions to consider. To minimize hydrodynamic drag the <b>bilge</b> keel should be placed in way of a flowline where it does not oppose crossflow. For such a usage {{the ends of the}} <b>bilge</b> keel should be tapered and properly faired into the hull. Also, a <b>bilge</b> keel should not protrude from the hull so far that the device could be damaged when the vessel is alongside a pier, even with a few degrees of adverse heel. <b>Bilge</b> keels on commercial vessels should not protrude below the baseline either, where they could be damaged or fouled by grounding. Note that small <b>bilge</b> keels are often fitted to smaller fishing boats precisely to protect the hull on drying moorings and to help keep the vessel upright.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bilge</b> keel is {{constructed}} from flat plate {{so as to}} present a sharp obstruction to roll motion. The roll damping provided by a <b>bilge</b> keel is more {{than that of a}} barehull ship, but falls short of other roll damping devices. Nevertheless it is considered prudent naval architecture to install a <b>bilge</b> keel whenever possible as it is the only device effective in the severest of seas. <b>Bilge</b> keels can also be used in conjunction with other roll damping devices.|$|R
