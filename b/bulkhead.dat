5|$|The armor {{scheme of}} the Gangut-class ships had some {{significant}} weaknesses. The rear transverse <b>bulkhead</b> was unprotected {{by any other}} armor but was the same thickness as the forward <b>bulkhead</b> which was defended by the upper belt armor. The thinness of the barbette armor was a serious defect which could have proved fatal in a battle. And {{the lack of a}} splinter <b>bulkhead</b> behind the armor of the turrets, barbettes and conning towers left all of those locations vulnerable to main gun hits. But the biggest weakness was the lack of an anti-torpedo <b>bulkhead,</b> which made them highly vulnerable to mines or torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the forward}} and rear <b>bulkhead</b> was the bomb bay, which was {{constructed}} with a double-frame to strengthen it for carrying the bomb load. The {{space between the}} bomb bay and rear <b>bulkhead</b> was used up by Funkgerät radio equipment and contained the dorsal and flexible casemate ventral gunner positions. The rear <b>bulkhead</b> contained a hatch which allowed access {{into the rest of}} the fuselage which was held together by a series of stringers. The wing was a two spar design. The fuselage was formed of stringers to which the fuselage skin was riveted. Internally the frames were fixed only to the stringers, which made for simpler construction at the cost of some rigidity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bulkhead</b> partition: The 5th century book Garden of Strange Things by Liu Jingshu {{mentioned}} that a ship could allow water {{to enter the}} bottom without sinking, while the Song Dynasty author Zhu Yu (fl. 12th century) wrote in his book of 1119 that the hulls of Chinese ships had a <b>bulkhead</b> build; these pieces of literary evidence for <b>bulkhead</b> partitions are confirmed by archaeological evidence of a 24m (78ft) long Song Dynasty ship dredged from the waters off the southern coast of China in 1973, the hull of the ship divided into twelve walled compartmental sections built watertight, dated to about 1277. Western writers from Marco Polo (1254–1324), to Niccolò Da Conti (1395–1469), to Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) commented on <b>bulkhead</b> partitions, which they viewed as an original aspect of Chinese shipbuilding, as Western shipbuilding did not incorporate this hull arrangement until the early 19th century.|$|E
5000|$|Transverse and {{longitudinal}} waterproof <b>bulkheads</b> {{were introduced}} in ironclad designs between 1860 and the 1880s, anti-collision <b>bulkheads</b> having been made compulsory in British steam merchant ships prior to 1860. [...] Before this a hull breach {{in any part of}} a vessel could flood {{the entire length of the}} ship. Transverse <b>bulkheads,</b> while expensive, increase the likelihood of ship survival in the event of damage to the hull, by limiting flooding to breached compartments separated by <b>bulkheads</b> from undamaged ones. Longitudinal <b>bulkheads</b> have a similar purpose, but damaged stability effects must be taken into account to eliminate excessive heeling. Today, most ships have means to equalize the water in sections port and starboard (cross flooding), which helps to limit the stresses experienced by the structure and also to alter the heel and/or trim of the ship.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bulkheads</b> made of panels {{were set}} into {{the tops of the}} floors to divide the hull into compartments. These were not watertight, as {{centrally}} placed limber holes run through the floor for the drainage of the bilge. While the presence of <b>bulkheads</b> invites comparisons with Chinese ships, the ones on the Kadakkarapally Boat are different in that Chinese <b>bulkheads</b> are watertight and thus serve a somewhat different function.|$|R
50|$|The design had {{numerous}} shortcomings, including {{a lack of}} internal <b>bulkheads</b> and a slow diving time. Surviving boats were modernized after the Russian Civil War by installing <b>bulkheads,</b> new diesels, pumps and extra torpedo tubes (the external drop collars were removed).|$|R
5|$|On August 12, 1985, Japan Airlines Flight 123, a Boeing 747-146SR, {{suffered}} a rupture {{of the pressure}} <b>bulkhead</b> in its tail section, caused by undetected damage during a faulty repair to the rear <b>bulkhead</b> after a tailstrike seven years earlier. Pressurized air subsequently rushed out of the <b>bulkhead</b> and blew off the plane's vertical stabilizer, also severing all four of its hydraulic control systems. The pilots were {{able to keep the}} plane airborne for 32 minutes using differential engine power, but without any hydraulics or the stabilizing force of the vertical stabilizer, the plane eventually crashed in mountainous terrain. There were only 4 survivors among the 524 on board. This accident is the deadliest single-aircraft accident in history.|$|E
5|$|Titanics lower decks {{were divided}} into sixteen {{compartment}}s. Each compartment was separated from its neighbour by a <b>bulkhead</b> running {{the width of the}} ship; there were fifteen bulkheads in all. Each <b>bulkhead</b> extended at least to the underside of E Deck, nominally one deck, or about , above the waterline. The two nearest the bow and the six nearest the stern went one deck further up.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should be}} transported in open vehicles, open {{containers}} or trailers, with a gas-tight <b>bulkhead</b> separating driver from load. If cylinders must be carried inside a vehicle {{it must be}} well ventilated.|$|E
2500|$|The fifth {{compartment}} {{that contained}} the ship's two nuclear reactors {{was built to}} withstand larger forces than other interior <b>bulkheads.</b> Like the exterior hull, these <b>bulkheads</b> were designed to withstand pressure up to depths of [...] The reactors were additionally encased in [...] of steel and resiliently mounted to absorb shocks in excess of 50G. The <b>bulkheads</b> of the fifth compartment withstood both explosions, allowing the two reactors to shut down automatically and prevent a nuclear meltdown and widespread contamination of the sea.|$|R
50|$|Following the Titanic disaster, {{ships were}} {{refitted}} for increased safety. For example, the double bottoms of many existing ships, including the RMS Olympic, were extended {{up the sides}} of their hulls, their waterlines, to give them double hulls. Another refit that many ships underwent were changes to the height of the <b>bulkheads.</b> The <b>bulkheads</b> on Titanic extended 10 feet (3 m) above the water line. After the Titanic sank, the <b>bulkheads</b> on other ships were extended higher to make the compartments fully watertight.|$|R
50|$|The design had ten {{internal}} <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|R
5|$|Search {{and rescue}} version for the Royal Air Force. Fitted with {{relocated}} rear cabin <b>bulkhead</b> giving greater cabin length, extra fuel and additional observation windows; 19 built.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{equipped}} with Krupp cemented armor. The level of armor {{protection for the}} Moltke class was increased from the Von der Tann design, to 10cm (3.9in) in the forward main belt, 27cm (10.6in) in the citadel, and 10cm (3.9in) aft. The casemates were protected by 15cm (5.9in) vertically and 3.5cm (1.4in) on the roofs. The forward conning tower was protected by 35cm (14in), and the aft tower had 20cm (7.9in) of armor. The turrets had 23cm (9.1in) on the face, 18cm (7.1in) on the sides, and 9cm (3.5in) on the roofs. The deck armor and sloping armor were both 5cm (2.0in), as was the torpedo <b>bulkhead</b> around the barbettes. The torpedo <b>bulkhead</b> was 3cm (1.2in) in other, less critical areas. As with Von der Tann, the armor was Krupp cemented and nickel steel.|$|E
5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo <b>bulkhead</b> were used for coal storage.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{waterline}} belt, [...] thick amidships and tapered to [...] at the ends, {{extended from}} the upper deck to [...] below the waterline. Transverse protective <b>bulkheads</b> of [...] armor {{extended from the}} gun deck to the armored deck across the fore and aft ends of the belt armor. Similar <b>bulkheads</b> fitted on the gun deck in wake of the 10-inch barbettes form the fore and aft limits of the side armor between the main and gun decks. Above the gun deck, [...] nickel steel was fitted in wake of the 3-inch battery. The 6-inch guns on the gun deck were isolated by splinter <b>bulkheads</b> of [...] nickel steel. The <b>bulkheads</b> extended continuously across the ship, while [...] nickel steel extended fore and aft.|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{compartment}} {{that contained}} the ship's two nuclear reactors {{was built to}} withstand larger forces than other interior <b>bulkheads.</b> Like the exterior hull, these <b>bulkheads</b> were designed to withstand pressure up to depths of 1000 m. The reactors were additionally encased in 13 cm of steel and resiliently mounted to absorb shocks in excess of 50G. The <b>bulkheads</b> of the fifth compartment withstood both explosions, allowing the two reactors to shut down automatically and prevent a nuclear meltdown and widespread contamination of the sea.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: These {{compartments}} {{are formed}} by non-structural <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the <b>bulkhead</b> separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 2012, the slurry wall for the station site was being taken down. On June 25, 2012, a $324.6 million contract was awarded to E.E. Cruz and Company and Tully Construction Company for the station's plumbing, electricity, ancillaries, and entrances. In March 2013, the <b>bulkhead</b> separating the new construction from the 1970s-era tunnel at 99th Street was completed.|$|E
5|$|In November 1922, U.S. Customs Service agents, {{seized a}} cache of Colt {{magazine}} guns aboard President Arthur. The entire crew was questioned but all denied any knowledge of the eight weapons found stowed behind a <b>bulkhead.</b> In August the following year, President Arthur took on board a seaman suffering from pneumonia from the Norwegian freighter Eastern Star in a mid-ocean transfer. The ship's doctor and nurse attended to the sailor but were unable to save him.|$|E
500|$|The ship's armor {{configuration}} {{differed from}} that of her half-sisters. Most of her side was covered by [...] of wrought-iron armor, but transverse armored <b>bulkheads</b> of the same thickness protected the gun deck from raking fire and {{the upper part of}} the hull outside the <b>bulkheads</b> was unprotected. The teak backing of the armor was increased to [...] Kremls deck had a maximum thickness of [...] The conning tower was also protected by 4.5 inches of armor. The ship's hull was divided by four watertight transverse and two longitudinal <b>bulkheads</b> for protection against underwater damage.|$|R
500|$|A {{consistent}} {{thickness of}} [...] for the protective wing <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{ship was}} divided by 12 <b>bulkheads</b> into 13 compartments.|$|R
5|$|The armor {{protection}} of the Gangut-class ships had to protect against two different threats as revealed during the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese high explosive shells had riddled the unarmored portions of Russian ships and had even sunk several ships with their heavy armor belts unpenetrated. The Russians decided that the entire {{side of the ship}} needed to be armored, even though this would limit the thickness of the main belt. They developed a system where the outer armor would break up or at least slow shells down and burst immediately behind the outer armor and an inboard armor <b>bulkhead</b> would stop the splinters and shell fragments from reaching the vitals. This system likely would have worked against the British armor-piercing shells that performed so badly at the Battle of Jutland, but would have failed against the improved shells introduced afterwards with their redesigned fuses. A related weakness was that the turrets and conning towers lacked the inboard splinter <b>bulkhead</b> even though they used armor thickness roughly equivalent to that of the main belt.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre <b>bulkhead.</b> Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with the cockpit {{at the front}} of the first <b>bulkhead.</b> The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of the lower right section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the external side of the cockpit.|$|E
50|$|The ship's armor {{configuration}} {{differed from}} that of her half-sisters. Most of her side was covered by 4.5 in of wrought-iron armor, but transverse armored <b>bulkheads</b> of the same thickness protected the gun deck from raking fire and {{the upper part of}} the hull outside the <b>bulkheads</b> was unprotected. The teak backing of the armor was increased to 15 in. Kremls deck had a maximum thickness of 1.14 in. The conning tower was also protected by 4.5 inches of armor. The ship's hull was divided by four watertight transverse and two longitudinal <b>bulkheads</b> for protection against underwater damage.|$|R
5000|$|A {{consistent}} {{thickness of}} 1.5 {{in for the}} protective wing <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|R
500|$|After Fitzgerald foundered, Great Lakes {{shipping}} companies {{were accused of}} valuing cargo payloads more than human life, since the vessel's cargo hold of [...] had been divided by two non-watertight traverse [...] "screen" [...] <b>bulkheads.</b> The NTSB Fitzgerald investigation concluded that Great Lakes freighters should be constructed with watertight <b>bulkheads</b> in their cargo holds.|$|R
5|$|Though {{the ships}} were poorly armored {{compared}} to foreign designs in general, the ships' underwater protection {{was the greatest}} weakness in the armor scheme. The torpedo <b>bulkhead</b> was placed {{too close to the}} outer hull, which reduced its ability to absorb damage. This weakness {{played a central role in}} the loss of both España to grounding in 1923 and the sinking of Alfonso XIII by a single mine in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Capelle, {{the deputy}} {{director}} of the Reichsmarineamt, stated that by mid November 1906, the testing for the underwater protection designs would be complete. He suggested that if the torpedo <b>bulkhead</b> needed to be strengthened, the ship might be too heavy for the 28cm(11in) guns, if the displacement of around 19,000t(21,000short tons) was to be retained. Tirpitz refused to consider using smaller guns, even if it meant increasing the displacement of the ship. Von Eickstedt proposed employing a secondary battery of 17cm(6.7in) guns instead of the 15cm(5.9in) the design called for, but the increased weight would have made it impossible to mount eight main battery guns.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal <b>bulkhead</b> and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E
50|$|The S3 primary {{structure}} {{is made of}} a hexagonal-shaped aluminum structure and includes four <b>bulkheads</b> and six longerons, beams that connect the <b>bulkheads.</b> The secondary structure includes brackets, fittings, attach platforms, EVA activity equipment and miscellaneous mechanisms. S3 was delivered to the Space Station Processing Facility at Kennedy Space Center on 7 December 2000.|$|R
5000|$|Coastal <b>bulkheads</b> {{are most}} often {{referred}} to as seawalls, <b>bulkheading,</b> or riprap revetments. These manmade structures are constructed along shorelines with the purpose of controlling beach erosion. Construction materials commonly used include wood pilings, commercially developed vinyl products, large boulders stacked to form a wall, or a seawall built of concrete or another hard substance.|$|R
