5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs that are to be used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> some members of the breed.|$|E

30|$|Nearly {{one half}} (46 %) of the coded {{concepts}} <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> {{the first group}} (first to third interview), additional 43 % <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> group 2 (fourth to sixth interview), and 7 % <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> group group 3 (seventh to eighth interview), respectively. Only one new concept <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> the fourth and final group (ninth to tenth interview): a single patient reported cutting down on smoking cigarettes because smoking made the nausea/vomiting worse. Given that this impact is relevant only to the population of patients who smoke tobacco―and its causal link to nausea/vomiting among CKD patients on maintenance hemodialysis with SHPT treated with oral calcimimetics is questionable―it is reasonable to dismiss this particular concept and assume that the ten transcripts demonstrated saturation of concept.|$|R
30|$|The {{following}} {{statistics were}} accumulated while performing the literature review and summarized here for VG fire patterns. The statistics {{can be found}} in Additional file 1 associated with this review paper. The fuel-controlled conditions did not have any damage associated with ventilation openings, therefore it will not be considered here. In ventilation-controlled conditions, cue 1 was the most positively <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> 82  % of the studies (37 / 45), cue 2 <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> 73  % of the studies (33 / 45), cue 4 <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> 64  % of the studies (29 / 45), cue 6 <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> 62  % of the studies (28 / 45), cue 3 <b>was</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> 53  % of the studies (24 / 45), and cue 5 <b>was</b> only <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> 11  % of the studies. Given these findings, damage cues 1, 2 and 4 are used as the most accurate damage cues for classifying a fire pattern generated by ventilation.|$|R

5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} of a point mutation known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have <b>been</b> <b>identified</b> <b>in</b> Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E
