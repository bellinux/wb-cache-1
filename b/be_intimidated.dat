5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more intrigued by {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself. Believing that the director might <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> by the script as it was unlike anything he had done before, Gosling had concerns about Refn's desire to participate. Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} to leave or stay was personal. Reasons for leaving ranged from noble (to join the fight), to fearful.

Constable Gunn had a reputation, which he had shown on several occasions, as a man who would not back down nor <b>be</b> <b>intimidated,</b> and was known to have killed two men while holding that office. Gunn was a former Texas Ranger, who'd made his way up to Wyoming from Texas. Bogan hated Gunn, who had reprimanded him on several occasions by this point. However, by later witness accounts, Bogan feared Gunn, which probably led to what happened next.|$|E
25|$|On 2 May 1989, Hungary started {{dismantling}} its {{barbed wire}} border with Austria, opening a large {{hole through the}} Iron Curtain to the West that was used by {{a growing number of}} East Germans. By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East Germans had escaped to the West before the GDR denied travel to Hungary, leaving the CSSR (Czechoslovakia) as the only neighboring state where East Germans could escape to. Thousands of East Germans tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the Prague Embassy and the Hungarian Embassy where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to the CSSR on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of East Germans participated in the Monday demonstrations in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators; many were arrested and beaten. However, the people refused to <b>be</b> <b>intimidated.</b> On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.|$|E

After some initial successes, the unexpected surrender of the strategically important town of Grave was a serious blow to English morale. Leicester's fury turned on the town's governor, Baron Hemart, whom he had executed despite all pleadings. The Dutch nobility were astonished: even the Prince of Orange would not have dared such an outrage, Leicester was warned; but, he wrote, he would not <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> by the fact that Hemart [...] "was of a good house".|$|E

500|$|By {{contemporary}} accounts, d'Hautpoul {{was a big}} man, possibly {{taller than}} Joachim Murat, who was nearly six feet tall. Endowed with broad shoulders and a big voice.

Early in the French Revolution, commissioners visited the various regiments to weed out dangerous, and prospectively traitorous nobles; generally, [...] the commissioners cowed the army into submission, but d'Hautpoul's cavalry regiment refused to <b>be</b> <b>intimidated.</b> When the commissioners came for their colonel, a scion of impoverished nobility, his soldiers refused to give him up: [...] "No d'Hautpoul, no 6th Chasseurs." [...] Thus, despite his noble birth, at the exhortations of his soldiers he remained in the French Revolutionary Army.|$|E

500|$|Bruce David Forbes, {{author of}} Religion and Popular Culture in America, {{felt that the}} video drew on Madonna's {{childhood}} experiences and dramatized her efforts to renegotiate these relationships, in her daily interactions with her lover and father, and in relation to Catholicism, which the singer {{referred to in the}} line [...] "Oh father I have sinned". Dunn noticed that like the Pepsi commercial shot for her earlier single [...] "Like a Prayer", Madonna's persona is split into a child and adult, who repeatedly fuse and separate. Leslie C. Dunn commented that as the narrative developed, the child is shown singing, but the adult Madonna's voice is heard, and when the adult Madonna appears in a hallway, her shadow is that of a child. Madonna responded to these observations by saying: [...] "I think the biggest reason I was able to express myself and not <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> was not having a mother." ...|$|E

When January went, the band had to finish the album; they were conscious of the pressure as [...] "expectations for the record grew larger" [...] and [...] "completing it became tougher and tougher". Finally, the band was settled with the song [...] "Square One", which Martin has described as [...] "a call to arms" [...] and a [...] "plea" [...] {{to each of them}} [...] "not to <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> by anything or anyone else". Once finished, the band felt like they could do their own songs and not have to think of anyone else's demands. During this month, the band was into the final weeks of production and had put the finishing touches on the tracks.|$|E
500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of Gin Tama has received positive and mixed responses. The humor was noted {{to be improved}} after the series' introduction although some jokes were hard to understand because {{some of them are}} references to Japanese culture and other series. The notes on the DVD releases were criticized for lacking explanation of cultural jokes. Additionally, the humor's quality was found to be inconsistent within the first episodes due to the depth some bring, to the point that some viewers may abandon the series. The quality from the series was found to improve as the series continues as people would not <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> by its large number of episodes. The characters' action were praised due to their knowledge that their tendencies to [...] "break the fourth wall", while the female characters were found appealing based on their unusual qualities. The series has been noted for its ability to shift between comedy and drama without a loss of quality.|$|E

500|$|News of {{the armed}} {{uprising}} at Gonzales reached Santa Anna on October 23. [...] Aside from the ruling elite {{and members of the}} army, few in Mexico knew or cared about the revolt. [...] Those with knowledge of the events blamed the Anglos for their unwillingness to conform to the laws and culture of their new country. [...] Anglo immigrants had forced a war on Mexico, and Mexican honor insisted that the usurpers be defeated. [...] Santa Anna transferred his presidential duties to Miguel Barragán in order to personally lead troops {{to put an end to}} the Texian revolt. Santa Anna and his soldiers believed that the Texians would be quickly cowed. The Mexican Secretary of War, José María Tornel, wrote: [...] "The superiority of the Mexican soldier over the mountaineers of Kentucky and the hunters of Missouri is well known.

500|$|Donkey Kong Jr. Math has {{received}} criticism for its qualities {{as an educational}} game. Elizabeth Sweedyk, associate computer science professor at Harvey Mudd College, called Donkey Kong Jr. Math a realistic educational video game, criticizing such games as [...] "not fun." [...] 1UP.coms Kevin Gifford called it a game that children {{would never want to}} play. Fellow 1UP.com writer Jeremy Parish commented that the game shouldn't be judged on being an educational game, citing quality educational titles as The Oregon Trail and Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?. However, he noted that it should be judged for being a boring game. Ars Technica's Frank Caron compared it to other educational games, calling it [...] "no Brain Age" [...] and preferring to play Math Blaster instead. Educational video game developer Traci Lawson wondered whether the word game Bookworm would have been as well received by players when they were children; she felt that they would <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> by it, comparing this to how she felt when she played Donkey Kong Jr. Math. In contrast to the negative reception, Allgame's Skyler Miller called it a creative use of Donkey Kong Jr.s graphics and gameplay.|$|E
500|$|After {{buying the}} rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active {{development}} in November 1995. Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaption of the book before, when he bought {{the rights to}} the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey. In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to <b>be</b> <b>intimidated</b> by Katzenberg and had an argument with him how much should the film appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson's ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous. Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film , and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; [...] "We both ended up doing a lot of everything," [...] Adamson said. [...] "We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything." ...|$|E
