According to the different inverse <b>bulging</b> process, two modes can be singled: the initial inverse <b>bulging</b> (IIB) and the local inverse <b>bulging</b> (LIB). IIB includes two parameters: inverse <b>bulging</b> height ratio (HIb/t) and inverse <b>bulging</b> pressure ratio (PIb/t). LIB is influenced by IIB and has a direct relationship with liquid chamber pressure in the forming process. The optimal inverse <b>bulging</b> parameters of hemispherical bottom cylindrical part and flat bottom cylindrical part are obtained by numerical simulation. Process parameters including the clearance between the punch and the blank holder and the blank holder entrance radius that have a large influence on inverse <b>bulging</b> effect are optimized, {{so as to make}} inverse <b>bulging</b> effect behave better in hydroforming process. Finally, the accuracy of the numerical simulation results was verified by experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study aims to {{determine}} flow stress of a steel tube by using hydraulic <b>bulge</b> test. A new proposed analytical model for analyzing <b>bulge</b> shapes of hydroformed tubes is postulated. <b>Bulge</b> test apparatus designed using FEA simulation of hydroforming and STKM 11 A steel tubes {{are used in}} the hydraulic <b>bulge</b> test. <b>Bulge</b> heights and internal pressures are measured during <b>bulge</b> testing. Tube thicknesses at vertex of a <b>bulge</b> shape are measured by a dial caliper gauge. <b>Bulge</b> curvatures and contact points are measured by taking digital photos of <b>bulge</b> shapes combined with measurement methods in CAD software. Effective stress- strain relationships are obtained from the newly developed analytical model using those measured values. Flow stress curves obtained from the effective stress – strain relationships are compared with those by other researchers and tensile test. Finite element analysis methods are used to conduct simulation of tube hydroforming using the flow stress curves. Predicted internal pressures versus <b>bulge</b> heights and tube thicknesses are compared with experimental results. Verification of the developed analytical model is presented. The flow stress at neck point of formed tube is determined...|$|R

40|$|A {{combination}} of conformational search, energy minimization, and energetic evaluation using a continuum solvent treatment has been employed {{to study the}} stability of various conformations of the DNA fragment d(CGCAGAA) /d(TTCGCG) containing a single adenine <b>bulge.</b> The extra-helical (looped-out) <b>bulge</b> conformation derived from a published x-ray structure and intra-helical (stacked <b>bulge</b> base) model structures partially based on nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data were used as start structures for the conformational search. Solvent-dependent contributions to {{the stability of the}} conformations were calculated from the solvent exposed molecular surface area and by using the finite difference Poisson-Boltzmann approach. Three classes (I-III) of <b>bulge</b> conformations with calculated low energies can be distinguished. The lowest-energy conformations were found in class I, corresponding to structures with the <b>bulge</b> base stacked between flanking helices, and class II, composed of structures forming a triplet of the <b>bulge</b> base and a flanking base pair. All extra-helical <b>bulge</b> structures, forming class III, were found to be less stable compared with the lowest energy structures of class I and II. The results are consistent with NMR data on an adenine <b>bulge</b> in the same sequence context indicating an intra-helical or triplet <b>bulge</b> conformation in solution. Although the total energies and total electrostatic energies of the low-energy conformations show only relatively modest variations, the energetic contributions to the stability were found to vary significantly among the classes of <b>bulge</b> structures. All intra-helical <b>bulge</b> structures are stabilized by a more favorable Coulomb charge-charge interaction but destabilized by a larger electrostatic reaction field contribution compared with all extra-helical and most triplet <b>bulge</b> structures. Van der Waals packing interactions and nonpolar surface-area-dependent contributions appear to favor triplet class II structures and to a lesser degree also the intra-helical stacked <b>bulge</b> conformations. The large conformational variation found for class III conformers might add a favorable entropic contribution to the stability of the extra-helical <b>bulge</b> form...|$|R

Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication.
