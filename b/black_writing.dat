25|$|Henry Fairfield Osborn {{was best}} known for his Dawn Man theory of human origins which he wrote would be found in Tibet and Mongolia. Osborn firmly {{believed}} that Asia had been the cradle of humankind. Davidson <b>Black</b> <b>writing</b> a paper in 1925 titled Asia and the dispersal of primates wrote that the origins of man were to be found in Tibet, British India, the Yung-Ling and the Tarim Basin of China, his last paper published in 1934 before his death argued for human origins in an Eastern Asian context. William King Gregory also wrote that the Tarim Desert is the most likely place for human origins.|$|E
25|$|La Rose was {{editor-in-chief}} of New Beacon Books {{until his death}} in 2006. He edited the occasional journal New Beacon Review (1968, 1985, 1986) and co-edited with Andrew Salkey the special issue of the magazine Savacou (Nos. 9/10, 1974) that provided a comprehensive anthology of <b>black</b> <b>writing</b> in Britain during the period of the Caribbean Artists Movement. La Rose published his first collection of poems, Foundations, in 1966 and his second collection, Eyelets of Truth Within Me, in 1992 (both published by New Beacon Books). His poems and essays have been widely anthologised, and his journalism was published regularly in Race Today. He co-authored Kaiso Calypso Music: David Rudder in Conversation with John La Rose in 1990. He co-produced and scripted the documentary film Mangrove Nine, about the resistance to police attacks on the popular Mangrove restaurant in the early 1970s, with the film director Franco Rosso. He produced a short film on the Black Church in Britain as part of a Full House BBC 2 television programme on the Caribbean arts in 1973.|$|E
500|$|While {{reviewing}} a 1983 {{concert by}} the Smiths and the Go-Betweens at The Venue in London, Barney Hoskyns, {{writing for the}} NME, described [...] "Hand in Glove" [...] as [...] "one of the year's few masterpieces, {{a thing of beauty}} and a joy forever". In the 1984 edition of The Rock Yearbook, Hoskyns said the song [...] "swept into my heart". Bill <b>Black,</b> <b>writing</b> for Sounds, described it as a [...] "daunting" [...] debut. Writing for Allmusic, Ned Raggett called the song a [...] "stunning, surprising debut" [...] and describes the music as [...] "sparkling," [...] highlighting Marr's [...] "careful overdubbing of acoustic and electric guitars". He also described Rourke's bass and Joyce's drumming as [...] "sparse but effective", and said that Joyce [...] "especially shone".|$|E

500|$|... "We R Who We R" [...] was {{performed}} {{for the first}} time on the second season of The X Factor Australia on November 14, 2010. Prior to the performance a minor controversy was sparked when Kesha's male background dancers were seen wearing red armbands that had been supplied locally. Kesha was concerned they could be mistaken for a swastika symbol, so the armbands were removed. [...] "We R Who We R" [...] {{was performed}} live {{for the first time}} in North America on November 21, 2010, at the 2010 American Music Awards. The performance started off with Kesha opening with her previous single, [...] "Take It Off", while playing on the keyboard; she soon transitioned into [...] "We R Who We R". For the performance she wore a mirrored body suit and a black leather jacket. Male background dancers surrounded the stage throughout the performance. Confetti fell from the ceiling during the song's synth-filled finale and as the performance ended, Kesha played riffs on a guitar. She then turned the guitar around, revealing the word [...] "hate" [...] in <b>black</b> <b>writing</b> with a slash through it. She then smashed the guitar into pieces, ending the performance. In 2011, Kesha embarked on her first headlining tour, the Get Sleazy Tour, where she performed [...] "We R Who We R" [...] alongside a cover of Beastie Boys track [...] "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)", as a part of the concert's encore. At the 2013 Kids' Choice Awards, Kesha performed a segment of [...] "We R Who We R" [...] and [...] "C'Mon".|$|E

2500|$|Justice <b>Black,</b> <b>writing</b> for the plurality, {{reversed}} {{the judgment of}} the Fifth Circuit and upheld the District Court’s dismissal of the matter. [...] The central issue to the plaintiff’s claim was the “reasonableness” of the Commission’s order according to state law, which Black agreed was a different standard than constitutional due process. [...] Black compared the situation in this case to that in Railroad Commission v. Pullman Co., arguing that this was a matter of interpretation of state law which needed to be handled authoritatively by the state court system, and that state court review was adequate, {{especially in light of the}} fact that questions of federal law could still be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court via writ of certiorari from the Texas Supreme Court.|$|E
