5|$|Phenformin, another <b>biguanide,</b> was {{withdrawn}} from the market because of {{an increased risk of}} lactic acidosis (rate of 40-64 per 100,000 patient-years).

5|$|Metformin {{was first}} {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine.

This result was completely forgotten, as other guanidine analogs, such as the synthalins, took over and were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin.|$|E

500|$|French {{diabetologist}} Jean Sterne {{studied the}} antihyperglycemic properties of galegine, an alkaloid isolated from Galega officinalis, which is related in structure to metformin {{and had seen}} brief use as an antidiabetic before the synthalins were developed. Later, working at Laboratoires Aron in Paris, he was prompted by Garcia's report to reinvestigate the blood sugar-lowering activity of metformin and several <b>biguanide</b> analogs.

40|$|AIMS: This study {{reports the}} {{activity}} of two <b>biguanides</b> against MS 2 bacteriophage used as a surrogate virus for nonenveloped mammalian viruses and provides an explanation as to their apparent limited efficacy. METHODS AND RESULTS: When tested in a standard suspension test, two polyhexamethylene <b>biguanides</b> (PHMB), VANTOCIL TG and COSMOCIL CQ, reduced the viability of MS 2 by only 1 - 2 log(10) PFU ml(- 1). Exposure time up to 30 min did not affect {{the activity of}} the <b>biguanides,</b> although both PHMB were shown to strongly interact with MS 2 proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Inactivation kinetics and change in virus hydrophobicity suggested that PHMB induces the formation of viral aggregates. This hypothesis was supported using dynamic light scattering that showed an increase in viral aggregates sizes (up to 500 nm) in a concentration-dependent manner. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It has been reported that viral aggregation is responsible for virus survival to the biocide exposure. Here, this might be the case, because the virucidal activity of the <b>biguanides</b> was modest and viral aggregation important. The formation of viral aggregates during virus exposure to PHMB was unlikely to overestimate the virucidal potential of the <b>biguanides...</b>|$|R
50|$|Buformin delays {{absorption}} of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract, increases insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake into cells, and inhibits synthesis of glucose by the liver. Buformin {{and the other}} <b>biguanides</b> are not hypoglycemic, but rather antihyperglycemic agents. They do not produce hypoglycemia; instead, they reduce basal and postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetics. <b>Biguanides</b> may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels.|$|R
40|$|Diabetic {{hearts are}} known to be more {{susceptible}} to ischemic disease. <b>Biguanides,</b> like metformin, are known antidiabetic drugs that lower blood glucose concentrations by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing glucose disposal in muscle. Part of these metabolic effects is thought to be mediated by the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In this work, we studied the relationship between AMPK activation and glucose uptake stimulation by <b>biguanides</b> and oligomycin, another AMPK activator, in both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant cardiomyocytes. In insulin-sensitive cardiomyocytes, insulin, <b>biguanides</b> and oligomycin were able to stimulate glucose uptake with the same efficiency. Stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin or <b>biguanides</b> was correlated to protein kinase B (PKB) or AMPK activation, respectively, and were additive. In insulin-resistant cardiomyocytes, where insulin stimulation of glucose uptake was greatly reduced, <b>biguanides</b> or oligomycin, in the absence of insulin, induced a higher stimulation of glucose uptake than that obtained in insulin-sensitive cells. This stimulation was correlated with the activation of both AMPK and PKB and was sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol- 3 -kinase/PKB pathway inhibitors. Finally, an adenoviral-mediated expression of a constitutively active form of AMPK increased both PKB phosphorylation and glucose uptake in insulin-resistant cardiomyocytes. We concluded that AMPK activators, like <b>biguanides</b> and oligomycin, are able to restore glucose uptake stimulation, in the absence of insulin, in insulin-resistant cardiomyocytes via the additive activation of AMPK and PKB. Our results suggest that AMPK activation could restore normal glucose metabolism in diabetic hearts and could be a potential therapeutic approach to treat insulin resistance...|$|R

50|$|However, in hyperinsulinemia, <b>biguanides</b> {{can lower}} fasting levels of insulin in plasma.

40|$|Metformin {{is widely}} {{prescribed}} as a first-choice antihyperglycemic drug {{for treatment of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus, and recent epidemiological studies showed its utility also in cancer therapy. Although it is in use since the 1970 s, its molecular target, either for antihyperglycemic or antineoplastic action, remains elusive. However, {{the body of the}} research on metformin effect oscillates around mitochondrial metabolism, including the function of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) apparatus. In this study, we focused on direct inhibitory mechanism of <b>biguanides</b> (metformin and phenformin) on OXPHOS complexes and its functional impact, using the model of isolated brown adipose tissue mitochondria. We demonstrate that <b>biguanides</b> nonspecifically target the activities of all respiratory chain dehydrogenases (mitochondrial NADH, succinate, and glycerophosphate dehydrogenases), but only at very high concentrations (10 − 2 – 10 − 1 [*]M) that highly exceed cellular concentrations observed during the treatment. In addition, these concentrations of <b>biguanides</b> also trigger burst of reactive oxygen species production which, in combination with pleiotropic OXPHOS inhibition, can be toxic for the organism. We conclude that the beneficial effect of <b>biguanides</b> should probably be associated with subtler mechanism, different from the generalized inhibition of the respiratory chain...|$|R

40|$|SummaryDysfunctional mTORC 1 {{signaling}} {{is associated}} with a number of human pathologies owing to its central role in controlling cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. Regulation of mTORC 1 is achieved by the integration of multiple inputs, including those of mitogens, nutrients, and energy. It is thought that agents that increase the cellular AMP/ATP ratio, such as the antidiabetic <b>biguanides</b> metformin and phenformin, inhibit mTORC 1 through AMPK activation of TSC 1 / 2 -dependent or -independent mechanisms. Unexpectedly, we found that <b>biguanides</b> inhibit mTORC 1 signaling, not only in the absence of TSC 1 / 2 but also in the absence of AMPK. Consistent with these observations, in two distinct preclinical models of cancer and diabetes, metformin acts to suppress mTORC 1 signaling in an AMPK-independent manner. We found that the ability of <b>biguanides</b> to inhibit mTORC 1 activation and signaling is, instead, dependent on the Rag GTPases...|$|R

40|$|Optimal therapy of {{diabetes}} {{has to be}} based on the known pathophysiology of metabolic disturbances and should eventually alleviate reduced secretion of insulin as well as reduce the usually present resistance to insulin in order to normalize the average blood glucose levels.
