Still better {{instances}} {{of the power}} I refer to, {{because they are more}} analogous to the cases to be explained, are furnished by the attraction existing between glass and air, so well known to barometer and thermometer makers, for here the adhesion or attraction is exerted between a solid and gases, bodies having very different physical conditions, having no power of combination with each other, and each retaining, during the time of action, its physical state unchanged[A]. When mercury is poured into a <b>barometer</b> <b>tube,</b> a film of air will remain between the metal and glass for months, or, as far as is known, for years, for it has never been displaced except by the action of means especially fitted for the purpose. These consist in boiling the mercury, or in other words, of forming an abundance of vapour, which coming in contact with every part of the glass and every portion of surface of the mercury, gradually mingles with, dilutes, and carries off the air attracted by, and adhering to, those surfaces, replacing it by other vapour, subject to an equal or perhaps greater attraction, but which when cooled condenses into the same liquid as that with which the tube is filled.|$|E

60|$|During the {{few days}} spent at Mirzapore with my kind friend, Mr. C. Hamilton, I was {{surprised}} to find the temperature of the day cooler by nearly 4 degrees than that of the hills above, or of {{the upper part of the}} Soane valley; while on the other hand the nights were decidedly warmer. The dewpoint again was even lower in proportion, (7.5 degrees) and the climate consequently drier. The atmosphere was extremely dry and electrical, the hair constantly crackling when combed. Further west, where the climate becomes still drier, the electricity of the air is even greater. Mr. Griffith mentions in his journal that in filling <b>barometer</b> <b>tubes</b> in Affghanistan, he constantly experienced a shock.|$|R

There, Chanut and Descartes made {{observations}} with a Torricellian <b>barometer,</b> a <b>tube</b> with mercury. Challenging Blaise Pascal, Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if atmospheric pressure could be used in forecasting the weather.|$|R

5000|$|In 1646 Chanut met and {{corresponded with}} the philosopher René Descartes, asking {{him for a}} copy of his Meditations. Upon showing Christina of Sweden some of the letters, the queen became {{interested}} in beginning a correspondence with Descartes. She invited him to Sweden, but Descartes was reluctant until she asked him to organize a scientific academy. He resided with Chanut, and finished his Passions of the Soul. Chanut lived at Västerlånggatan, 450 meters from Tre Kronor (castle) on Gamla Stan. There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a Torricellian <b>barometer,</b> a <b>tube</b> with mercury. Chanut was criticized when he organized a private mass in his house. Descartes died of pneumonia according to Chanut. Over time there have been speculations regarding the death of the philosopher. Theodor Ebert claimed that Descartes did not meet his end by being exposed to the harsh Swedish winter climate, as philosophers have been fond of repeating, but by arsenic poisoning.|$|R
50|$|Bourdon tubes measure gauge pressure, {{relative}} to ambient atmospheric pressure, {{as opposed to}} absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid <b>barometers</b> use Bourdon <b>tubes</b> closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a reciprocating pump, an orifice restriction in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Tapping {{on the face of}} the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.|$|R
40|$|Here we analyse the energetics, performance, and {{optimization}} {{of flight}} in a moving atmosphere. We begin by deriving a succinct expression describing {{all of the}} mechanical energy flows associated with gliding, dynamic soaring, and thermal soaring, which we use to explore the optimization of gliding in an arbitrary wind. We use this optimization to revisit the classical theory of the glide polar, which we expand upon in two significant ways. First, we compare the predictions of the glide polar for different species under the various published models. Second, we derive a glide optimization chart that maps every combination of headwind and updraft speed to the unique combination of airspeed and inertial sink {{rate at which the}} aerodynamic cost of transport is expected to be minimized. With these theoretical tools in hand, we test their predictions using empirical data collected from a captive Steppe Eagle (Aquila nipalensis) carrying an inertial measurement unit, global positioning system, <b>barometer,</b> and pitot <b>tube.</b> We show that the bird adjusts airspeed in relation to headwind speed as expected if it were seeking to minimize its aerodynamic cost of transport, but find only weak evidence to suggest that it adjusts airspeed similarly in response to updrafts during straight and inter-thermal glides...|$|R
