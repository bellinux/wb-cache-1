5|$|Another {{portion of}} modern VT 14, between East Brookfield and Williamstown center, {{was to be}} {{improved}} by another turnpike corporation, the Williamstown Center Turnpike, which was chartered on November 14, 1803. The charter provided that the road <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state after having been in operation for 25 years (later amended to 40 years). The company, however, did not do anything in its {{first two years of}} existence and only began laying out the road in 1805.|$|E
5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It {{ended up in the}} possession of General George S. Patton, who kept it, in violation of orders that such finds should <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, {{the direct}} carpool lane ramps between I-5 and SR55 were completed; {{these were the}} first in Orange County. The year also saw further {{widening}} of SR55 between SR22 and McFadden Avenue. Between 1996 and 2002, the fifth lane in both directions was constructed between I-5 and SR91, funded with a sales tax of half a cent approved by Measure M. In April 2007, the Orange County Transportation Authority approved funds to study the feasibility of extending the Costa Mesa Freeway south to 17th Street via tunnels or flyover ramps. The segment of SR55 from Finley Street to the Newport Channel bridge was legally authorized to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Newport Beach in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{days after}} its premiere in Milan, Cannibal Holocaust was confiscated under {{the orders of}} a local magistrate, and Ruggero Deodato {{was arrested and charged}} with obscenity. As all copies were to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authorities, the film was {{distributed}} internationally via subterfuge. In January 1981, during the film's theatrical run in France, the magazine Photo suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film were real, which would have made Cannibal Holocaust a snuff film. Following the publication of the Photo article, the charges against Deodato were amended to include murder. The courts believed that the actors who portrayed the missing film crew and the native actress featured in the impalement scene were killed for the camera.|$|E
5|$|An {{elaborate}} bureaucracy {{was created}} to regulate German imports of raw materials and finished goods {{with the intention of}} eliminating foreign competition in the German marketplace and improving the nation's balance of payments. The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles. As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with IG Farben, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at Leuna. Any profits in excess of that amount would <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.|$|E
50|$|The Toul {{detachment}} was discontinued on 1 September 1959 {{and replaced}} by Detachment 7, 7514th Support Group when Luneville-Chenevieres <b>was</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the United States Army.

5|$|As {{it entered}} Cleveland County, the National Weather Service and Storm Prediction Center {{activated}} emergency procedures, preparing to evacuate staff and others {{present at the}} facility {{in the event that}} the supercell should turn right, placing areas surrounding the Norman campus in the tornado's path (under NOAA protocol in situations posing a danger to personnel at local Weather Forecast Offices and related guidance centers, responsibility over the issuance of warnings and statements on the unfolding outbreak would have been transferred to the nearest NWS Forecast Office, based in Tulsa, while the SPC's forecasting responsibilities would <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base). The supercell, however, continued on a northeastward track, sparing the Norman area.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{continued}} {{the project of}} eliminating at-grade crossings between streets and railroads, the Montclair Branch was the next to receive the structural change. Bloomfield criticized the Lackawanna railroad for making a disgrace of the community. The railroad proposed using $700,000 (1911 USD) of funds to construct a brand new station at Watsessing Avenue along with a new downtown Bloomfield Station. The cost of elevating and depressing the railroad came up to about $20,000 (1911 USD) for the Lackawanna. This contract by the railroad and township was approved after negotiations dating back to 1908. The negotiations included a park to be built between both stations {{on both sides of}} the railroad. The park land cost the township $50,000 to buy for the construction, and it was to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Essex County Park Commission.|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} {{had been}} made on the memorial by 1926. While some debate occurred in respect to the form that the memorial would take, {{the focus of the}} discussions concerned the location of the memorial, and this centred on the future of Government House {{and the role of the}} Governor. A number of left-wing politicians argued that the grounds of Government House should <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> State and used to build the memorial while the conservatives desired to retain the status quo. By 1925 the National War Memorial committee was prepared to accept the Government House grounds as the site of the memorial, but they delayed making an announcement. This proved to be fortuitous, as legal issues prevented the plan from going ahead. Instead a portion of the grounds, located at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue, was put aside for the purpose. (The plan to move the Governor and to use the grounds as part of a larger war memorial were revisited, over 80 years later, in 2007).|$|E

25|$|According to one tradition, Saint Peter {{brought it}} to Rome, and {{passed it on to}} his successors (the Popes). In 258, when Christians were being persecuted by Emperor Valerian and the Romans demanded that relics <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government, Pope Sixtus II instead gave the cup to one of his deacons, Saint Lawrence, who passed it to a Spanish soldier, Proselius, with {{instructions}} to take it to safety in Lawrence's home country of Spain.|$|E
25|$|The NDU {{book ends}} by {{suggesting}} that HTS <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC). There {{were a number of}} reasons the team suggested USASOC would be a better fit for HTS: TRADOC had been a prime cause of multiple programmatic problems for HTS throughout its history; the US military has a history of intentionally forgetting and deinstitutionalizing cultural programs; and the future operating environment would be utilizing Special Operations forces to a greater degree than regular Army/Marines units.|$|E

25|$|Congress enacted {{legislation}} in September 1961 declaring the White House a museum. Furniture, fixtures, and decorative arts {{could now be}} declared either historic or of artistic interest by the President. This prevented them from being sold (as many objects in the executive mansion {{had been in the}} past 150 years). When not in use or display at the White House, these items were to <b>be</b> <b>turned</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Smithsonian Institution for preservation, study, storage, or exhibition.

25|$|The Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty (Chinese: , 1271–1368) also {{attempted}} to use paper currency.
