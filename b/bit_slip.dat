When drill bit contacts with workpiece surface, the vibration will cause the drill <b>bit</b> <b>slipping</b> on the workpiece surface, affecting the quality of the drilled hole, so that hole position accuracy can not meet the requirements, which cause the drilling failure. This paper presents a method based on force feedback to suppress the Surface Contact Slipping (SCS). The method using three-dot force sensors to feedback robots kinematics, keeps the drill vertical with the workpiece surface, to suppress slipping.

50|$|One way to {{maintain}} timing between transmitting and receiving devices is to employ an asynchronous protocol such as start-stop.

5000|$|Spiral ratchet screw drivers, often colloquially called Yankee {{screwdrivers}} (a brand name), {{provide a}} special mechanism that transforms linear motion into rotational motion. Originally the [...] "Yankee" [...] name was used on all tools {{sold by the}} North Brothers Manufacturing Company but later, after Stanley purchased the company, it became synonymous with only this type of screwdriver. The user pushes the handle toward the workpiece, causing a pawl in a spiral groove to rotate the shank and the removable bit. The ratchet can be set to rotate left or right with each push, or can be locked so that the tool can be used like a conventional screwdriver. One disadvantage of this design {{is that if the}} <b>bit</b> <b>slips</b> out of the screw, the resultant sudden extension of the spring may cause the bit to scratch or otherwise damage the workpiece.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{cause is}} [...] "losing count", as {{on a hard}} drive: if a hard drive {{encounters}} {{a long string of}} 0s, without any 1s (or a string of 1s without 0s), it may lose track of the frame between fields, and suffer bit slip.When a pulse of N consecutive zero bits are sent, clock drift may cause the hardware to apparently detect N-1 zero bits or N+1 zero bits—both kinds of errors are called <b>bit</b> <b>slip.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{receiver}} {{does not}} control the data rate, so it must avoid <b>bit</b> <b>slip</b> by synchronizing its reception with the source clock. Many S/PDIF implementations cannot fully decouple the final signal from influence of the source or the interconnect. Specifically the process of clock recovery used to synchronize reception may produce jitter. If the DAC {{does not have a}} stable clock reference then noise will be introduced into the resulting analog signal. However, receivers can implement various strategies that limit this influence.|$|E
50|$|Specifically, RLL bounds {{the length}} of {{stretches}} (runs) of repeated bits during which the signal does not change. If the runs are too long, clock recovery is difficult; if they are too short, the high frequencies might be attenuated by the communications channel. By modulating the data, RLL reduces the timing uncertainty in decoding the stored data, which {{would lead to the}} possible erroneous insertion or removal of bits when reading the data back. Run-length-limited codes were widely used in hard disk drives until the mid-1980s and are still used in digital optical discs such as CD, DVD, MD, Hi-MD and Blu-ray. This mechanism ensures that the boundaries between bits can always be accurately found (preventing <b>bit</b> <b>slip),</b> while efficiently using the media to reliably store the maximal amount of data in a given space.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pilot hole}} also reduces the power needed {{to turn a}} large drill bit, and reduces the large bit {{breakage}} risk. For twist drill bits, the pilot size is usually selected so that the chisel point of the larger drill {{does not need to}} remove any material, which reduces the chance of splitting the web of the bit. A pilot thus sized also prevents a larger drill <b>bit</b> from <b>slipping</b> on the material and guides the larger bit effectively. Very large holes may be stepped by drilling successively larger pilot holes before the final size drill is used.|$|R

His second start in the three runner Fulwell Chase was shrouded in controversy after he was pulled up due to the <b>bit</b> <b>slipping</b> through his mouth. Questions were raised after large sums were placed on forecasts involving the other two runners Venture To Cognac, returning after a thirteen month absence, and Great Dean, a 66/1 shot who'd failed to complete his previous two starts.

In between the Kempton race and his next start at Ascot, he drifted out from 7/2 favourite to 8/1 despite assurances from his owners that nothing was amiss. It was in Ascot's Whitbread Trial Handicap Chase where he met his first defeat when completing over fences. Although disappointing, the effort was still respectable as he beaten by less than twelve lengths while giving away upwards of 19lbs to Grand National winners Aldaniti and Grittar. Little Owl returned to the track nine days later for a handicap chase at Newcastle where he took a heavy fall while not appearing to travel well.

It is {{found that the}} following defects are readily detectable via Fourier spectrum analysis: (1) <b>bit</b> <b>slip,</b> (2) breakup causing loss of image, and (3) disabled track {{at the top of}} the imagery. The scratches made on the film during mass production, which are difficult to detect by visual observation, also show themselves readily in Fourier spectrum analysis. A relation is established between the number of scratches, their width and depth and the intensity of their Fourier spectra. Other defects that are found to be equally suitable for Fourier spectrum analysis or visual (image analysis) detection are synchronous loss without blurring of image, and density variation in gray scale. However, the Fourier spectrum analysis is found to be unsuitable for detection of such defects as pin holes, annotation error, synchronous loss with blurring of images, and missing image in the beginning of the work order.

The wide signal {{bandwidth}} attainable with the 960 inch per second longitudinal tape transport, combined with {{high density recording}} at about 20, 000 bits per inch provide a multichannel 20 Megabit/second recorder with a 64 : 1 time expansion capability.

Stability of the tape movement is achieved by use of a control system which provides instantaneous adjustment of the pack contact forces as a function of direction, velocity, acceleration and pack diameter. This results in full versatility when programming the transport motion. The high density digital signal is phase encoded and processed through the recorder as an analog signal, then is demodulated using a phase lock loop to recover the clock. The sample and hold phase comparator controls a VCO at a fixed nominal frequency, followed by a divider.

40|$|The Soft Decision Analyzer (SDA) is an {{instrument}} that combines hardware, firmware, and software to perform realtime closed-loop end-to-end statistical analysis of single- or dual- channel serial digital RF communications systems operating in very low signal-to-noise conditions. As an innovation, the unique SDA capabilities allow it to perform analysis of situations where the receiving communication system <b>slips</b> <b>bits</b> due to low signal-to-noise conditions or experiences constellation rotations resulting in channel polarity in versions or channel assignment swaps. SDA s closed-loop detection allows it to instrument a live system and correlate observations with frame, codeword, and packet losses, as well as Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) events. The SDA s abilities are not confined to performing analysis in low signal-to-noise conditions. Its analysis provides in-depth insight of a communication system s receiver performance {{in a variety of}} operating conditions. The SDA incorporates two techniques for identifying slips. The first is an examination of content of the received data stream s relation to the transmitted data content and the second is a direct examination of the receiver s recovered clock signals relative to a reference. Both techniques provide benefits in different ways and allow the communication engineer evaluating test results increased confidence and understanding of receiver performance. Direct examination of data contents is performed by two different data techniques, power correlation or a modified Massey correlation, and can be applied to soft decision data widths 1 to 12 bits wide over a correlation depth ranging from 16 to 512 samples. The SDA detects receiver <b>bit</b> <b>slips</b> within a 4 bits window and can handle systems with up to four quadrants (QPSK, SQPSK, and BPSK systems). The SDA continuously monitors correlation results to characterize slips and quadrant change and is capable of performing analysis even when the receiver under test is subjected to conditions where its performance degrades to high error rates (30 percent or beyond). The design incorporates a number of features, such as watchdog triggers that permit the SDA system to recover from large receiver upsets automatically and continue accumulating performance analysis unaided by operator intervention. This accommodates tests that can last in the order of days in order to gain statistical confidence in results and is also useful for capturing snapshots of rare events...|$|R

In this thesis, both modes are implemented in software and hardware. In particular, the hardware structure and method of hardware implementation are investigated. Parallel and serial transfers are applied to the hardware implementation of SCFB mode and OCFB mode, respectively. Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Description Language (VHDL) and LSI design with 0. 18 CMOS technology supported by Canadian Microelectronics Corporations (CMC) are used in the process of hardware implementation. The hardware structures of both modes are synthesized by using Synopsis tools provided by CMC as well.

Furthermore, the relationship between efficiency, probability of queue overflow, and buffer size is investigated. It is definite that both of modes can obtain higher efficiency than cipher feedback mode. OCFB mode performs marginally better with respect to error propagation and synchronization recovery delay in some circumstances. SCFB mode is able to achieve higher efficiency with a given buffer size and probability of buffer overflow in an efficient hardware implementation.

SCFB mode is a hybrid of OFB mode and CFB mode; hence, it has a high throughput and the capability of self-synchronizing. The marker-based synchronous stream cipher is also able to obtain synchronization under limited circumstances. [...] In this thesis, SCFB mode and the marker-based mode are both implemented in digital hardware targeting the FPGA technology. The device we have used is the Xilinx Spartan- 3 E FPGA. Commonly, SCFB mode is implemented by using the block cipher, AES, as the keystream generator; however, in our research, we use the stream cipher, Grain- 128, as the keystream generator for SCFB mode implementation. The designed system structure and synthesis results of the two modes are given in this thesis.

[...] Through the FPGA hardware implementation, we obtain that SCFB mode configured for a stream cipher, Grain- 128, can run at the speed of 89 Mbps on a real FPGA and an efficiency of SCFB mode is 100 %. The marker-based mode can reach the speed of 113 Mbps and has an efficiency of 94 %.
