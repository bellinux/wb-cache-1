5|$|Concorde {{needed to}} fly long {{distances}} to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant. Turbofan engines were rejected {{due to their}} larger cross-section producing excessive drag.

5|$|During {{the flight}} test program, the issuing of NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3) did not {{prove to be}} the {{opportunity}} as envisioned by Hawker, as NBMR-3 sought performance characteristics of which the P.1127 was not only unable to meet, but unlikely to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> meet in its current form either. As such, in 1961, there was little military interest in the P.1127 program, although, in January 1961, Hawker was requested to provide a quote for the costs involved in a potential 100 production standard P.1127 aircraft. Meanwhile, Hawker believed that the continuing development of the P.1127 would serve a successful demonstration, acting to dissuade potential customers from pursuing competing 'paper' VTOL aircraft projects.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{during the}} Second World War, Allied {{aircraft}} construction saw the UK of necessity concentrating on heavy bombers, leaving {{the production of}} transport aircraft to the USA. This would have left the UK with little experience in transport construction {{at the end of}} the war, so in 1943, a committee under Lord Brabazon of Tara investigated the future of the British civilian airliner market. The Brabazon Committee called for several different aircraft to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> specifications composed by the committee for roles felt to fulfil Britain's civilian aviation needs.|$|E

5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to deal with problems caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} local {{opposition to the}} Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy {{would be unable to}} thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could <b>be</b> <b>developed.</b> <b>To</b> this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, Casey became Chief Engineer at MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ), Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). He faced {{enormous}} engineering challenges. Most of New Guinea {{consisted of}} mountains and jungle, {{with very few}} airstrips, ports or roads. All of these had to <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> support operations. To provide additional expertise in construction, Casey had Leif Sverdrup assigned to his staff as chief of the Construction Section, with the rank of colonel. As U.S. Army engineers were few, Casey worked closely with his Australian Army counterpart at General Sir Thomas Blamey's Allied Land Forces headquarters, Major General Clive Steele. Construction activities in Australia were also undertaken by civilians of the Allied Works Council. Casey attempted to coordinate {{the activities of the}} various agencies. He had to fend off attempts by the U.S. Army Air Forces to gain control of his aviation engineer battalions. The Royal Australian Air Force organized its own airbase construction squadrons and only with difficulty was Casey able to control their activities.|$|E

5|$|The {{difficulty}} of deploying artillery in New Guinea {{led to a}} need for a gun which could be broken down into light parts and transported by aircraft or jeeps. The Army had {{only a small number of}} British 3.7 inch Mountain Howitzers, and Australia's request for United States M116 75mm pack howitzers was not immediately filled. In September 1942, the Army's Director of Artillery, Brigadier John O'Brien, suggested that a variant of the 25-pounder <b>be</b> <b>developed</b> <b>to</b> meet this requirement. This proposal was agreed to, and all development work was conducted in Australia by the Army, the Ordnance Production Directorate and Charles Ruwolt Pty Ltd. The process of designing the gun began in September 1942, and an acceptable weapon was ready by January the next year. The three agencies cooperated well as they were strongly motivated to provide the Army with a useful light artillery piece as quickly as possible. During this period, the Army received thirty-eight 75mm pack howitzers, and deployed some of these guns to New Guinea.|$|E
