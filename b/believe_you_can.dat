5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
500|$|In 2012 Napravnik {{became the}} first woman jockey to win the Kentucky Oaks, riding <b>Believe</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can.</b> The race was also her first Grade I win. She then rode in the Belmont Stakes for the first time, {{finishing}} fifth aboard Five Sixteen. Later that year, she won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile aboard Shanghai Bobby, becoming only the second woman jockey to win a Breeder's Cup race. [...] Her injury for 2012 was relatively minor: a non-displaced fracture of her toe, obtained when her horse hit the side of the starting gate at Saratoga. [...] She finished the race and returned to ride the next day. She ended the year ranked 8th in national earnings, winning $12,451,713, which surpassed the earnings and national placing record for a female jockey previously held by Julie Krone. As a result, sports analysts viewed her as the most successful woman jockey since Krone.|$|E
500|$|Southampton's fifth round {{match was}} against Norwich City {{at home on}} 5 February 2003. Two goals {{in the space of}} three minutes, scored by Svensson and Tessem was enough to take the team into the quarter-finals. Southampton defender Claus Lundekvam was pleased with the win and said {{following}} the match: [...] "When you get to this stage in the competition you have to <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> win it." [...] The club then faced Wolverhampton Wanderers at home in the following round. Former Wolves player Chris Marsden gave Southampton the lead in the 56th minute and with nine minutes remaining of normal time, the team added a second goal when Tessem's shot took a deflection off Paul Butler's legs to go inside the goal net. The victory meant Southampton reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup {{for the first time in}} 17 years. At Villa Park, Southampton played First Division team Watford on 13 April 2003. Brett Ormerod opened the scoring two minutes before half time and set up the second goal which the ball was taken over the line by Watford defender Paul Robinson. Despite Marcus Gayle scoring a late header to half the scoreline Southampton won the match.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Colbert's announcement, Colbert Report {{staff had}} {{consulted}} representatives of both parties. Joe Werner, {{executive director of}} the State Democratic Party, had been called by a Colbert representative three weeks before the announcement, for queries regarding filing dates and other requirements. Katon Dawson, chairman of the State GOP, had been called on October 15, a handful of hours before the show declaring Colbert's candidacy was taped. Estimations of Colbert's chances were mixed, but neither party disputed his ability to place himself on their respective ballots. The dual Republican–Democrat nature of the run, however, elicited opposing responses from the party representatives. Dawson found nothing in his party's regulations preventing Colbert from running on both ballots, but Werner was more leery at the suggestion. Said Werner: [...] "I don’t <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do that." [...] "It's in our rules somewhere that you can't be on two ballots." ...|$|E
