Norint gauti geresnės kiekybės mėsą ir išlaikyti gerą kiaulių vislumą, veisėjai turėtų atsižvelgti į naudingų požymių ir paveldimumo tarpusavio ryšį. Todėl, vykdant selekciją, labai svarbu įvertinti su selekcija susijusių požymių paveldimumą. Svarbu ištirti paršavedžių įtaką palikuonių mėsos kokybei. Veislinių paršavedžių vertinimas pagal palikuonių mėsos kokybę yra atliekamas beveik visose Europos sąjungos šalyse. Šis vertinimas labai svarbus kiaulių selekcijos procesui ir tiesiogiai turi įtakos gaminamos kiaulienos konkurencingumui. Darbo tikslas: Nustatyti paršavedžių įtaka palikuonių mėsos kokybei. Darbo uždaviniai: 1. Išanalizuoti surinktus literatūros duomenis apie mėsos kokybinius rodiklius ir juos įtakojančius faktorius; 2. Ištirti paršavedžių įtaką palikuonių mėsos kokybei; 3. Statistiškai apdoroti, išanalizuoti ir įvertinti surinktus duomenis. Introduction. In recent years, {{the concept}} of food quality has {{received}} a lot of attention from food producers and retailers as well as from public authorities and health educators. There are a lot of discusses a practical approach to defining the term ‘quality’. But although there have been many attempts to clarify and define the concept, there still no general agreement on the term (Grebitus et al, 2006). For European food industry, quality is a key factor because the high quality of a product is the basis for success in this highly competitive market. However, it is difficult to decide which sort of meat has the best nutrition value or technological properties (Kortz, 2003). Work object. To set the sows influence on meat quality of offspring. Work methodics. Meat quality indexes were measured at ‘Meat characteristics and quality assessment laboratory’ after 48 hours afterslaughtering. Samples were held in refrigerator in + 4 oC temperature. During the test it was researched: the cooking losses were determined by boiling the meat in the circulating water bath for 30 min. The changes of weight of the meat sample were determined by weighing the meat samples before and after boiling. The meat mildness was determined according to the Warner-Bratzler method. The meat abondance of water was determined as the diminuation of the sample weight during 24 h holding the sample hung in a special bag with the net air temperature + 40 C. The water binding capacity was determined according to the Grau and Hamm method. The ash was determined by burning the organic matter of meat at temperature 600 to 8000 C. The colour was determined according to the CIE-LAB method by measuring meat lightness (L*), colour intensity (b*) and colour tone (a*). The quantity of dry matters as determined by drying the samples to the constant mass and weighing with the automatic scales for dry matters. Meat pH was measured with pH. The quantity of fat was determined according to the Sosclet method. Results. The sows had the biggest influence on meat color, water <b>brinding,</b> cooking losses and toughness (P < 0. 001), less influence was on meat Ph. The meat color intense: brightness L* - 8, 13, magnolia a * - 3, 17, ruddiness b * - 3, 71. Water <b>brinding</b> – 10, 71 % (P < 0, 001). Cooking losses 8, 16 % (P < 0, 001). Toughness 0, 81 kg/cm 2 (P < 0, 001). Statistics on the dependable differences of meat chemical composition have been established between the groups of offspring from separate sows. If has been concluded that estimating of sows by the offsprings meat quality. Importantly clarification boar and sows tuning, some safely, qualitative of pork within the region...|$|E

50|$|At Waitrose, <b>Brind</b> {{continued}} {{the policy of}} hiring good buyers and letting them get on with it. By the early 1990s <b>Brind</b> had hired a team of five wine buyers, {{all of whom were}} experts in their own field, and Masters of Wine. Under his direction, the 'Waitrose list' became known for its emphasis on individual wines from individual producers. <b>Brind</b> insisted on limiting big brand and own-label wines. He lamented the dominance of the big brands in the market place through deep discounting and the adverse effect it had on the real wine business. For this reason <b>Brind</b> emphasised the need for wine specialists in each store. Thus Waitrose developed a reputation for providing interesting wines, not sold by any other supermarket. Under <b>Brind's</b> stewardship both Waitrose and <b>Brind</b> won numerous domestic and international awards.|$|R

In 2003, <b>Brind</b> was invited to the NCI workshop on abortion and breast cancer, {{where he was the}} only one to formally dissent from the workshop's finding that there is no link between the two. <b>Brind</b> blames the lack of support for his findings on a conspiracy, arguing that the NCI and other major medical organizations are engaged in a [...] "cover-up" [...] for the purpose of [...] "protecting the abortion industry".|$|R
