2500|$|Having {{completed}} {{an early version}} of La Strada with co-screenwriter Tullio Pinelli in 1952, Fellini offered their [...] "modern fairy tale" [...] to producer Luigi Rovere with whom he was still under contract. Rovere had solid reasons for turning it down: apart from the script of La Strada being an unrecognizable genre, Fellini’s last film, The White Sheik, was a critical and commercial flop. In a show of soldarity, Rovere loaned the script to a Venetian professor of calligraphy turned film producer, Lorenzo Pegoraro, [...] who had admired The White Sheik. Convinced that La Strada would never attract an audience, Pegoraro requested that Fellini develop a comedy instead. Biographers differ as to who conceived I Vitelloni. For Tullio Kezich, it was Fellini who hit on the idea “after an afternoon-long consultation" [...] with Ennio Flaiano. For Hollis Alpert, it was Pinelli <b>brain-storming</b> with Fellini and Flaiano who came up “with a notion the other two liked: the pleasures and frustrations of growing up in a provincial town”.

40|$|Abstract Summary: A {{workshop}} {{aiming to}} share experiences made concerning {{the idea of}} the Flipped Classroom as well as ICT and Learning within higher education, and in relation to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. Participants will be given an insight to the authors’ experiences of facilitating student active learning in an introductory course to SOTL and the scholarly and didactic considerations behind it. Abstract text: Content We aim to share experiences made concerning {{the idea of the}} flipped classroom and ICT and learning as a valuable way of working within higher education and in relation to the scholarship of teaching and learning. Based on experiences made during the course "Akademiskt lärarskap", 5 credits, the authors aim to recreate a typical (one day) course session with a focus on student active learning, the idea of the "flipped classroom" and mediating learning. Scholarly basis A scholarly point of departure in our course and the workshop, draws on the idea of the “flipped classroom” where research indicates that podcasts used in the ”flipped classroom way” can be an effective way of personalising the learning experience in especially on-line courses (cf. Bolliger et al, 2010; Spies, 2011). The characteristics of podcasting increase the impression of permanent contact between students and teachers and allows for a diverse range of student skills and learning methods. Even if podcasting can be a powerful tool it should serve as a complement to the traditional resources on a course (Fernandez et al, 2009). To conclude, when podcasts are presented to students, they tend to use them as a means towards better understanding (Mc Garr, 2009) Another scholarly basis is the theoretical concept “Designs for learning” that highlights the material and temporal conditions for learning as in for example learning resources, buildings, classrooms and curriculum. However, there can also be a focus on designs in learning – highlighting the whole learning process of an individual, as a learner designs his or her way, choosing apt resources to transform her understanding into new representations. In this theoretical context communication and representation are seen as a social process of sign-making. The perspective also stresses participants’ creation and production (Selander & Kress, 2010). The design oriented perspective {{can be used as a}} tool for understanding learning, recognition of learning and the conditions for learning in higher education today (Leijon & Lindstrand, 2012). Closely connected to the design oriented perspective is the idea that working with media increases motivation, encouraging both activity and cooperation in a learning situation. Working with different media forms such as sound and moving images allow participants to avail themselves of a variety of types of texts, with different affordances, and to use them as resources in a learning process (cf. Leijon, 2010). Session outline Participants will be given an insight to the authors’ experiences of student active learning in the course “Akademiskt lärarskap” through a podcast presenting the course structure and the scholarly and didactic considerations behind it. The pod gives the group a common ground for a <b>brain-storm</b> aiming to a) produce further questions and b) gather experiences regarding the subject of student centered teaching and learning activities. By basis of interest the participants will be divided into smaller constellations which will then be given the task of mediating their questions and/or experiences through the production of analogue or digital posters. The posters will be presented within the workshop session and a brief discussion on the process and session topic will round off the workshop. - Pod/introduction - 10 minutes - <b>Brain-storm</b> - 20 - Group work - 20 - Mediating questions and/or experiences - 20 - Presentation - 10 - Final discussion - 10 Expected outcomes Participants partaking in the workshop will be expected to: • Reflect upon the benefits and consequences of student active teaching and learning activities. • Gain hands-on experience of a “Flipped classroom” process in a higher education setting. Discuss the podcast and the idea of mediating knowledge as resource for learning...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the Barcelona Convention and its related protocols, {{together}} {{known as}} the Barcelona System, will be analysed. The Barcelona System is designed to protect and preserve the marine environment of the Mediterranean Sea. It is astonishing that the Convention, which was adopted as early as 1976, has inspired only few lawyers to write about it. Not even the extensive amendment procedure of 1995 and the subsequent adoption of new protocols lead to the whirl of comments, otherwise common in our field. As a result, the Barcelona System is the domain {{of only a handful}} of lawyers, of whom Professor Scovazzi of the University of Milan is probably the most well-known. Besides the limited amount of articles, there is a huge amount of internet publications in the form of workshop reports, <b>brain-storm</b> sessions, exhortations, considerations, news paper articles and expressions of concern. The latter range is interesting to get an impression of the fields of current interest, but have only limited value for juridical purposes. The overall picture of (juridical) sources is thus rather pale. For this reason, I put the various protocols in their context and analysed them after briefly mentioning their global and regional counterparts, with which I compared them. However, the comparison is not always very detailed, since the aim is to show the weaknesses and strengths of the protocols and not those of the other instruments. Besides that, it was not my intention to elaborate extensively on comparison because the primary purpose of the paper is to give an - if you wish critical- overview of the Barcelona System, since this, as far as I know, does not exist. The interested lawyer, who wants to know more about the Barcelona System can therefore only do one thing: read the Convention and protocols, of which the present paper is the result. To provide the necessary juridical background, I begin with the various maritime zones of Mediterranean interest. The case, as you shall see, is that the Mediterranean States have been reluctant to claim much more than a territorial sea of 12 nautical miles. However, some States have recently begun to establish different types of zones beyond the 12 nautical mile limit. This is a point of huge interest and of major importance regarding the enforcement powers of the coastal States in an area that used to be high seas...|$|R
