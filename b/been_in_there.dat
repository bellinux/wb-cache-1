25|$|Shortly after 3:00am, Chief Nevins {{attempted}} {{his first}} sally into the vestibule of the theatre; {{no one had}} <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> since District Chief Farley's departure {{more than three hours}} prior. His first attempts failed, but eventually he worked his way into the vestibule. Outside the doors leading into the lobby, he found the body of a woman, legs partially burned away, face and arms disfigured. She was sitting upright with her back against the south wall. Nevins decided that at that point there were likely many more bodies to be found. He kept the news confined to his senior District Engineers, not wishing to incur a stampede into the fragile theatre of people seeking loved ones.|$|E
500|$|Ralph Abernathy {{stated in}} his 1989 {{autobiography}} And the Walls Came Tumbling Down that King had a [...] "weakness for women", although they [...] "all understood and {{believed in the}} biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage. It was just {{that he had a}} particularly difficult time with that temptation." [...] In a later interview, Abernathy said that he only wrote the term [...] "womanizing", that he did not specifically say King had extramarital sex and that the infidelities King had were emotional rather than sexual. Abernathy criticized the media for sensationalizing the statements he wrote about King's affairs, such as the allegation that he admitted in his book that King had a sexual affair the night before he was assassinated. In his original wording, Abernathy had claimed he saw King coming out of his room with a lady when he awoke the next morning and later claimed that [...] "he may have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> discussing and debating and trying to get her {{to go along with the}} movement, I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 29, 2008, Clark made {{comments}} on Face the Nation that were critical of Republican John McCain, {{calling into question}} the notion that McCain's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president. [...] "I certainly honor [...] service as a prisoner of war", Clark said, [...] "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded—it wasn't a wartime squadron. He hasn't <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and ordered the bombs to fall." [...] When moderator Bob Schieffer noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he [...] "ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down", Clark responded that, ultimately, Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience, as McCain has done throughout his campaign. Clark's retort, however, is what drew rebuke. In referring to McCain's military experience, he stated: [...] "Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president." [...] Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark's comment. However, Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as MoveOn.org and military veteran groups such as VoteVets.org; Obama ultimately stated that Clark's comments were [...] "inartful" [...] and were not intended to attack McCain's military service. In the days following the controversial interview, Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat. In each program, Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honors McCain's service, he has serious concerns about McCain's judgment in matters of national security policy, calling McCain [...] "untested and untried".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{should think}} that is it," [...] the young captain said. [...] "It is {{certainly}} as awkward a looking place to attack in boats as I ever saw.

6000|$|... "There {{are places}} you couldn't go into without some one picking a quarrel with you afore you have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> two minutes, and a quarrel here means knives out afore {{you have time}} to think.

The very fact that this was an old house in which no one had lived for a long time made it safer. Whitefoot knew that those who lived {{in that part of the}} Green Forest {{probably}} knew that no one lived in that old stub, and so no one was likely to visit it.|$|E
