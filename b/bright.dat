5|$|For {{many years}} in his {{parliamentary}} career Disraeli hoped to forge a paternalistic Tory-Radical alliance, but he was unsuccessful. Before the Reform Act 1867, the working class did not possess the vote and therefore had little political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with John <b>Bright,</b> a Lancashire manufacturer and leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to persuade <b>Bright</b> to sacrifice his distinct position for parliamentary advancement. When Disraeli attempted to secure a Tory-Radical cabinet in 1852, <b>Bright</b> refused.|$|E
5|$|GK Persei, {{also known}} as Nova Persei 1901, is a <b>bright</b> nova that {{appeared}} halfway between Algol and Delta Persei. Discovered on 21 February 1901 by Scottish amateur astronomer Thomas David Anderson, it peaked at magnitude 0.2almost as <b>bright</b> as Capella and Vega. It faded to magnitude 13 around 30 years after its peak brightness. Xi Persei, traditionally known as Menkhib, a blue giant of spectral type O7III, {{is one of the}} hottest <b>bright</b> stars in the sky, with a surface temperature of 37,500 K.

5|$|Peckinpah {{originally}} wanted actor Jack Palance to {{play the}} role of Rudy Butler but could not afford his salary.

Due to his friendship with <b>Bright,</b> Peckinpah cast him as the con man. Al Lettieri was brought to Peckinpah's attention for the role of Butler by producer Albert S. Ruddy, who was working with the actor on The Godfather (1972). Like Peckinpah, Lettieri was a heavy drinker, which caused problems while filming due to his unpredictable behavior.|$|E

5|$|The Moon has an {{exceptionally}} low albedo, {{giving it a}} reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun.

5|$|The {{colouration}} of {{the males}} allows them to visibly {{stand out from the}} brown forest floor. This <b>bright</b> colouration provides a sexual advantage for the adult males, increasing their likelihood of successfully mating. The result is rapid evolutionary selection within the species for brighter plumage and more conspicuous behaviour patterns in the males. The <b>bright</b> colouration also makes the males more susceptible to predation. Males are more expendable for this reason; {{only a small number of}} males are needed within any generation in order to perpetuate the species. While sexual selection leads to <b>bright</b> plumage, natural selection in turn favors defensive colouration in the birds. There is higher fitness in birds monitoring nests whose colouration acts as camouflage-protection from predation.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The <b>brightest</b> {{stars in}} galaxies {{have been used}} as {{distance}} indicators since Hubble(1936). However, the accuracy of the <b>brightest</b> stars for distance estimates has been controversial. Recently, Rozanski and RowanRobinson (1994) argued large errors in the distance determination : 0. 58 mag and 0. 90 mag, respectively, for the <b>brightest</b> red stars and the <b>brightest</b> blue stars, while Karachentsev and Tikhonov(1994) suggested much smaller errors in the distance determination : 0. 37 mag for the <b>brightest</b> red stars and 0. 46 mag for the <b>brightest</b> blue stars. The reasons for these conflicting results are not yet known. We have investigated the accuracy of this method using a sample of 17 galaxies(LMC, SMC, NGC 6822, IC 1613, M 31, IC 10, M 33, WLM, NGC 3109, Sextans B, Sextans A, NGC 300, LeoA, NGC 2403, M 81, IC 4182, M 101) for which Cepheid distances are known and reliable photometry of the <b>brightest</b> stars are available (Figure 1).
