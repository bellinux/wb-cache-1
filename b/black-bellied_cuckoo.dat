50|$|The genus Playa is {{considered}} paraphyletic. The little cuckoo (P. minuta) doesn't cluster with the squirrel cuckoo and the <b>black-bellied</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> {{as it was}} traditionally classified.|$|E
50|$|In Guyana, the <b>black-bellied</b> <b>cuckoo</b> can {{be found}} in Kanashen community, COCA. In Bolivia it {{can be found}} in the {{department}} of La Paz. In Colombia it is found from the south of La Meta, northwest of Guainía and southern Vaupés (eastern Andes section) and below 500 meters above the sea level.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{characteristic}} song is a compassed [...] "dyerií-dyu, dyerií-dyu, dyerií-dyu…" [...] sometimes repeated {{for one or}} a few minutes. This {{makes it}} difficult to trace their position. They typically remain motionless in the forest when singing. Also they produce faint grunts. There are 30 recordings in the foreground and 9 background recordings of the <b>black-bellied</b> <b>cuckoo.</b>|$|E
50|$|These are vocal {{species with}} {{persistent}} and loud calls. They feed on large insects such as cicadas, wasps and caterpillars (including those with stinging hairs or spines which are distasteful to many birds). Squirrel and <b>black-bellied</b> <b>cuckoos</b> {{are large and}} powerful species, and occasionally take vertebrate prey such as small lizards.|$|R
50|$|P. melanogaster {{lives in}} {{tropical}} rainforests, humid forests of firm land, scrub and occasionally in wooded savannas. Individuals do not frequent open areas, like P. cayana does. The <b>black-bellied</b> <b>cuckoo</b> stays at upper {{levels of the}} forest. It is known that this species loses between 9.8 and 10.8% of suitable habitat within its range of distribution every three generations (13 years approximately).|$|E
50|$|P. melanogaster {{is often}} {{confused}} with the squirrel cuckoo (Piaya cayana) because both species share the same habitat. The squirrel cuckoo is more frequently observed in the canopy. They differ because P. cayana is seen more frequently in the canopy forest of firm land; also because the squirrel cuckoo has exposed yellow-greenish skin in the orbital area, the chest plumage is grey and it lacks the characteristic hood of the <b>black-bellied</b> <b>cuckoo.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black-bellied</b> <b>cuckoo</b> or black-bellied {{squirrel}} cuckoo (Piaya melanogaster) is a bird {{of the family}} Cuculidae found in the Amazon region. The genus Playa is {{considered part of the}} cuckoos of the New World. Even though this species has a wide distribution, little is known about its ecology and natural history. This species is considered as monotypic. The word melanogaster means [...] "black belly"; it has Greek roots, melas meaning [...] "black" [...] and gaster meaning [...] "belly".|$|E
50|$|These {{birds are}} birds with {{relatively}} slender bodies, long tails and strong legs. The <b>black-bellied</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is essentially restricted to rainforest, {{but the more}} widespread squirrel cuckoo also occurs in other forest types, woodlands or mangroves. Piaya cuckoos, unlike many Old World species, are not brood parasites; they build their own nests in trees and lay two eggs. Parasitic cuckoos lay coloured eggs to match those of their passerine hosts, but the non-parasitic Piaya species, like most other non-passerines, lay white eggs.|$|E
