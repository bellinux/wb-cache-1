5|$|Andrei Rublev won several awards. In 1969, {{the film}} was {{screened}} at the Cannes Film Festival.

Nevertheless, it won the prize of the international film critics, FIPRESCI. In 1971 Andrei Rublev won the Critics Award of the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics, and in 1973 the Jussi Award for best foreign film.|$|E

Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in Berlin on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear that the battle for Berlin would be the final battle of the war. Berlin was bombarded <b>by</b> <b>Soviet</b> artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, Berlin was cut off from the rest of Germany.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 988 AD, the Mezhyhirya Monastery {{was one of}} {{the first}} monasteries {{established}} in the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus'.

At the time of its height, the Mezhyhirya Monastery was considered a spiritual center of Rus royal Rurikid house and later Cossacks. Currently, the area of the former monastery is located on a fenced-in woodland territory next to Novi Petrivtsi village and is directly connected with a private residence for Ukrainian government officials.|$|E

5|$|Historically, migratory whales such as blue, fin, sei {{were very}} {{abundant}} in the island waters, but were severely reduced in numbers to near-extinction by commercial and illegal hunts including the mass illegal hunts <b>by</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union and Japan in 1960s to 1970s. Southern right and sperm were most severely hunted among these, hence the area was called the Middle Ground by whalers. It is likely that these two were once seasonal residents around the island where right whales prefer sheltered, very shallow bays while sperm whales mainly inhabit deep waters.|$|E

Approximately 17,000 Armenians living in twenty-three of Shahumyan's villages were deported out of the region.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 {{a statue}} of Żółkiewski was built in Źółkiew, but it was {{demolished}} in 1939 <b>by</b> <b>Soviet</b> troops {{in the aftermath of}} the Soviet invasion of Poland. In modern Poland Źółkiewski is celebrated as a military hero, but modern Russia's Unity Day instead celebrates the anniversary of the surrender of the Polish forces he installed in the Moscow garrison. As of 2011, the St. Lawrence's Church and castle in Źółkwia were being renovated by a team of Polish and Ukrainians conservators.|$|E
