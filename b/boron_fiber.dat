The coreless fiber is made by the chemical removal of the tungsten boride core exposed by splitting the as-grown fiber. The easily splittable fiber is made by the chemical vapor deposition of boron on a larger than usual tungsten substrate. It is expected that the ease of splitting is related to residual stresses in these fibers. Measurements of the axial residual stresses in both the normal and the splittable fibers are presented and the results compared.

40|$|The {{effect of}} notches on the {{strength}} of <b>boron</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced 6061 aluminum alloy was determined at room temperature, 300 F, and 600 F. Both unidirectional and cross-plied specimens were tested. The strengths of individual fibers were measured, and upper and lower bounds of composite strength were calculated using bundle theory. Fracture tests were performed on specimens containing center slots of various lengths, and the values of the critical stress intensity factor for initial crack propagation or final failure were calculated. For unidirectional specimens, these parameters depended on thickness; for cross-plied specimens, fairly constant values were obtained at room temperature. The cross-plied material invariably failed at a lower stress as the environmental temperature was raised...|$|E
40|$|An elastoplastic, {{axisymmetric}} {{finite element}} model {{has been used to}} predict the initiation and propagation of a crack in a composite model consisting of a single broken <b>boron</b> <b>fiber</b> embedded in an annular sheath of aluminum matrix.

40|$|A {{series of}} doping {{experiments}} are reported for MgB 2 conductors {{that have been}} synthesized using doped <b>boron</b> <b>fibers</b> prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods. Undoped MgB 2 samples prepared from CVD prepared fibers consistently give critical current densities, Jc, {{in the range of}} 500, 000 A/cm 2 in low field at 5 K. These values fall by a factor of about 100 as the magnetic field increases to 3 T. For heavily Ti-doped <b>boron</b> <b>fibers</b> where the B/Ti ratio is comparable to 1, there is a substantial suppression of both Tc, superconducting volume fraction, and Jc values. If, however, a sample with a few percent Ti in B is deposited on a carbon substrate and reacted at 1100 ◦C, then Tc is suppressed only a couple of degrees and critical current densities are found to be Jc ∼ 2 − 5 × 10 6 A/cm 2 for superconducting layers ranging from 4 − 10 µm thick.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} axial residual stresses in <b>boron</b> <b>fibers</b> is presented. With this method, the axial residual stress distribution {{as a function}} of radius is determined from the fiber surface to the core including the average residual stress in the core. Such measurements on boron on tungsten (B/W) fibers show that the residual stresses for 102, 142, 203, and 366 micron diam fibers are similar, being compressive at the surface and changing monotonically to a region of tensile stress within the boron. At approximately 25 % of the original radius, the stress reaches a maximum tensile stress of about 860 MN sq m and then decreases to a compressive stress near the tungsten boride core. Data are presented for 203 -micron diam B/W fibers that show annealing above 900 C reduces the residual stresses. A comparison between 102 -micron diam B/W and boron on carbon (B/C) show that the residual stresses are similar in the outer regions of the fibers, but that large differences near and in the core are observed. Fracture of <b>boron</b> <b>fibers</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{validity}} of linear elastic fracture mechanics and other fracture criteria was investigated with laminates of <b>boron</b> <b>fiber</b> reinforced aluminum (R/A 1) and of carbon fiber reinforced epoxide (CFRP). Cracks are assessed by fracture strength Kc or Kmax (critical or maximum {{value of the}} stress intensity factor). The Whitney and Nuismer point stress criterion and average stress criterion often show that Kmax of fiber composite materials increases with increasing crack length; however, for R/A 1 and CFRP the curve showing fracture strength {{as a function of}} crack length is only applicable in a small domain. For R/A 1, the reason is clearly the extension of the plastic zone (or the damage zone n the case of CFRP) which cannot be described with a stress intensity factor...|$|E

40|$|Boron fibers {{made by a}} {{commercial}} chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process {{have been used as}} precursors for the formation of magnesium diboride (MgB 2) superconducting wires. Prior to a reaction with magnesium, the addition of dopants such as carbon and titanium to the <b>boron</b> <b>fiber</b> has been shown to enhance the superconducting properties of MgB 2. These dopants also influence the kinetics of the reaction with magnesium. In this study, the effect of carbon dopant additions on the microstructure of boron fibers was investigated using powder x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

40|$|Literature data {{related to}} the thermally-induced {{strength}} degradation of B/Al composites were examined {{in the light of}} fracture theories based on reaction-controlled fiber weakening. Under the assumption of a parabolic time-dependent growth for the interfacial reaction product, a Griffith-type fracture model was found to yield simple equations whose predictions were in good agreement with data for <b>boron</b> <b>fiber</b> average strength and for B/Al axial fracture strain. The only variables in these equations were the time and temperature of the thermal exposure and an empirical factor related to fiber surface smoothness prior to composite consolidation.

The measurements were made under vacuum by the forced vibration of composite bars at free-free flexural resonance near 2000 Hz and at strain application below 0. 000001. The damping of B/Al composites {{was found at}} all temperatures to be significantly greater than the damping of the Al 2 O 3 /Al and SiC/Ti composites, with little variation observed in the dynamic moduli of specimens having almost the same fiber content.

40|$|Future {{generation}} aerospace {{vehicles will}} require specialized hybrid material forms for component structure fabrication. For this reason, high temperature composite prepregs in {{both dry and wet}} forms {{are being developed}} at NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC). In an attempt to improve compressive properties of carbon fiber reinforced composites, a hybrid carbon-boron tape was developed and used to fabricate composite laminates which were subsequently cut into flexural and compression specimens and tested. The hybrid material, given the designation HYCARB, was fabricated by modifying a previously developed process for the manufacture of dry polymer matrix composite (PMC) tape at LaRC. In this work, <b>boron</b> <b>fibers</b> were processed with IM 7 /LaRC(TradeMark) IAX poly(amide acid) solution-coated prepreg to form a dry hybrid tape for Automated Tow Placement (ATP). <b>Boron</b> <b>fibers</b> were encapsulated between two (2) layers of reduced volatile, low fiber areal weight poly(amide acid) solution-coated prepreg. The hybrid prepreg was then fully imidized and consolidated into a dry tape suitable for ATP.
