Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E

5|$|Black drongos were {{introduced}} just <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> World War from Taiwan {{to the island}} of Rota {{to help in the}} control of insects.

Predation by and competition from black drongos have been suggested as factors in the decline of endemic bird species such as the Rota bridled white-eye and the Guam flycatcher.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>Second</b> World War (1939–1945) the British wanted to reduce growth of Egyptian {{influence}} in Sudan, {{which had become}} more likely {{as a result of}} the 1936 treaty, while also suppressing the ultra-nationalist neo-Mahdist movement. They gave their support to Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani of the Khatmiyyah sect as a counterpoise to Sayyid Abd al-Rahman. Sayyid Abd al-Rahman responded by telling the British that Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani was pro-Italian due to his family commitments in Eritrea, but this was not accepted by the British.|$|E
