40|$|We {{compared}} {{the mechanism of}} O 2 dissociation catalyzed by Cu 38, Ag 38, and Au 38 nanoparticles. Overall, our results indicate that O 2 dissociation is extremely easy on Cu 38, with an almost negligible barrier for the O-O <b>breaking</b> <b>step.</b> It presents an energy barrier close to 20 kcal/mol on Ag 38, which decreases to slightly more than 10 kcal/mol on Au 38. This behavior is analyzed to quantify the impact of relativity and of dispersion interactions through a comparison of nonrelativistic, scalar-relativistic, and dispersioncorrected DFT methods. Nonrelativistic calculations show a clear trend down the triad, with larger in size nanoparticle (NP), weaker O 2 adsorption energy, and higher O 2 dissociation barrier, which is so high for Au 38 to be in sharp contrast with the mild conditions used experimentally. Inclusion of relativity has {{no impact on the}} O 2 adsorption energy, but it reduces the energy barrier for O 2 dissociation on Au 38 from 30. 1 to 11. 4 kcal/mol, making it even lower than that on Ag 38 and consistent with the mild conditions used experimentally.

40|$|We {{propose a}} class of {{left-right}} symmetric models (LRSMs) with spontaneous D parity breaking, where SU(2) _R breaks at the TeV scale while discrete left-right symmetry breaks around 10 ^ 9 GeV. By embedding this framework in a non-supersymmetric SO(10) Grand Unified Theory (GUT) with Pati-Salam symmetry as the highest intermediate <b>breaking</b> <b>step,</b> we obtain g_R / g_L ~ 0. 6 between the right- and left-handed gauge couplings at the TeV scale. This leads to a suppression of beyond the Standard Model phenomena induced by the right-handed gauge coupling. Here we focus specifically on the consequences for neutrinoless double beta decay, low energy lepton flavour violation and LHC signatures due to the suppressed right handed currents. Interestingly, the reduced g_R allows us to interpret an excess of events observed recently {{in the range of}} 1. 9 TeV to 2. 4 TeV by the CMS group at the LHC as the signature of a right handed gauge boson in LRSMs with spontaneous D parity breaking. Moreover, the reduced right-handed gauge coupling also strongly suppresses the non-standard contribution of heavy states to the neutrinoless double beta decay rate as well as the amplitude of low energy lepton flavour violating processes. In a dominant type-II Seesaw mechanism of neutrino mass generation, we find that both sets of observables provide stringent and complimentary bounds which make it challenging to observe the scenario at the LHC.

40|$|The scribe {{and break}} {{technique}} (or dicing) is a widely employed method in the industry of semiconductors to separate infrared laser diodes made from gallium arsenide (GaAs). The scribing step allows to create a precursor crack which is then propagated during the <b>breaking</b> <b>step,</b> along preferential { 110 } cleavage planes of GaAs. The main drawback of the scribing process is that it generates a lot of undesirable cracks and particles that degrade the performances of devices. In this dissertation, we have investigated the indentation process as a possible way to replace the scribing operation. For that purpose, we have investigated the morphology of the crack field and the cracking sequence {{as a function of}} the indenter geometry (shape, apex angle) and experimental conditions (maximal load, loading rate). Such investigations have been made with the help of a new tool: the in-situ SEM instrumented indentation which allows us to establish the cracking sequence and to correlate direct observations with the load-displacement histories. A new experimental technique has also been developed: cleavage cross-sectioning techniques allow us to determine the morphology of the crack field beneath the surface. The second research axis was focused on the interaction between deformation mechanisms and crack initiation. These investigations have been conducted with the help of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and cathodoluminescence. In the first part of the dissertation, we have shown that acute wedge indenters with an included angle of 60 ° promote the formation of a well defined half-penny crack, the nucleation of which is affected by load rate and indenter radius. The relation between the final half-penny crack size and the maximum indentation load was made with the help of a fracture mechanics model. The crack field has been compared for several indenter shape including conical (60 ° and 120 ° apex angles), cube corner and Vickers indenters. In the second part of this dissertation we have determined that the indenter apex angle influences the slip systems that are activated and the nature of dislocations that are found under the indenter. In particular, we have shown that below 60 ° wedge indenters, mainly diverging slip systems are activated whereas under obtuse wedge indenters, mainly converging slip systems are activated. The converging pattern predominant under obtuse indenters is correlated with a delayed half-penny crack formation and is so interpreted as a plastic shielding phenomenon. Some experiments have been performed on commercial devices under production conditions. Although some adjustments are needed to reduce the chipping-out effect that occurs at the indenter extremities, the results are encouraging...|$|E
