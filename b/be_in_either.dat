5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had grown {{too big for the}} part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit what was in the script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> the trailer or the film.|$|E

25|$|The Official Language Act {{provides}} that the Union government shall use both Hindi and English in most administrative documents that {{are intended for}} the public. The Official Languages Rules, in contrast, provide for {{a higher degree of}} use of Hindi in communications between offices of the central government (other than offices in Tamil Nadu, to which the rules do not apply). Communications between different departments within the central government may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> Hindi or English, although a translation into the other language must be provided if required. Communications within offices of the same department, however, must be in Hindi if the offices are in Hindi-speaking states, and in either Hindi or English otherwise with Hindi being used in proportion to the percentage of staff in the receiving office who have a working knowledge of Hindi. Notes and memos in files may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> Hindi or English, with the Government having a duty to provide a translation into the other language if required.|$|E

25|$|The term {{working class}} applies {{to those that}} work at this tier in the social hierarchy. Definitions of this term vary greatly. While Lloyd Warner found the vast {{majority}} of the American population to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> the upper-lower class or lower-lower class in 1949, modern-day experts such as Michael Zweig, an economist for SUNY–Stony Brook, argue that the working class constitutes most of the population.|$|E
25|$|This {{probability}} is the p-value, considering only extreme {{results that}} favor heads. This {{is called a}} one-tailed test. However, the deviation can <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> direction, favoring either heads or tails. The two-tailed p-value, which considers deviations favoring either heads or tails, may instead be calculated. As the binomial distribution is symmetrical for a fair coin, the two-sided p-value is simply twice the above calculated single-sided p-value: the two-sided p-value is 0.115.|$|E

25|$|The diagram above {{depicts a}} {{reaction}} between m-cresol and methanol where a c-alkylation product is produced. The c-alkylation reaction means {{that instead of}} replacing the hydrogen atom on the -OH group, the methyl group (from the methanol) replaces the hydrogen on a carbon in the benzene ring. The products of this c-alkylation can <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> a para- or ortho- orientation on the molecule, {{as seen in the}} diagram, and water, which is not shown. Isomers of the dimethylphenol (DMP) compound are the products of the para- and ortho-c-alkylation. Dimethylphenol (DMP) compound is listed as an aquatic hazard by characteristic, and is toxic with long lasting effects.|$|E
25|$|A {{hypothetical}} vacuum metastability event {{would be}} theoretically possible if our universe {{were part of}} a metastable (false) vacuum in the first place, an issue that was highly theoretical and far from resolved in 1982. A false vacuum is one that appears stable, and is stable within certain limits and conditions, but is capable of being disrupted and entering a different state which is more stable. If this were the case, a bubble of lower-energy vacuum could come to exist by chance or otherwise in our universe, and catalyze the conversion of our universe to a lower energy state in a volume expanding at nearly the speed of light, destroying all of the observable universe without forewarning. Chaotic Inflation theory suggests that the universe may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> a false vacuum or a true vacuum state.|$|E
25|$|A {{electrode}} typically {{consists of}} carbon support, Pt particles, Nafion ionomer, and/or Teflon binder. The carbon support functions as an electrical conductor; the Pt particles are reaction sites; the ionomer provides paths for proton conduction, and the Teflon binder increases the hydrophobicity of the electrode to minimize potential flooding. In order {{to enable the}} electrochemical reactions at the electrodes, protons, electrons and the reactant gases (hydrogen or oxygen) must {{gain access to the}} surface of the catalyst in the electrodes, while the product water, which can <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> liquid or gaseous phase, or both phases, must be able to permeate from the catalyst to the gas outlet. These properties are typically realized by porous composites of polymer electrolyte binder (ionomer) and catalyst nanoparticles supported on carbon particles. Typically platinum is used as the catalyst for the electrochemical reactions at the anode and cathode, while nanoparticles realize high surface to weight ratios (as further described below) reducing the amount of the costly platinum. The polymer electrolyte binder provides the ionic conductivity, while the carbon support of the catalyst improves the electric conductivity and enables low platinum metal loading. The electric conductivity in the composite electrodes is typically more than 40 times higher as the proton conductivity.|$|E

500|$|An {{impedance}} step is {{an example}} of a device introducing a discontinuity. [...] It is achieved by a step change in the physical dimensions of the waveguide. [...] This results in a step change in the characteristic impedance of the waveguide. [...] The step can <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> the E-plane (change of height) or the H-plane (change of width) of the waveguide.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in 1939, the U.S. Army {{required}} all cadets to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> infantry or {{field artillery}} units. Therefore, {{the band was}} split into two separate units {{at opposite ends of}} the campus dormitories and named Infantry and Artillery Bands. When the two units performed together, they formed the Combined Band. 1942 saw the band expand to 250members, but the need for manpower for the war effort caused membership to plummet. By the end of the 19421943 school year, it dropped it to only 90bandsmen. As [...] "a crusty old army man", Dunn understood the nation's urgent need for troops, and he accepted the fact that the Aggie Band could only return after the war was over.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} case {{concerns the}} ways that a circle (1-sphere) can be wrapped around another circle. This can be visualized by wrapping a rubber band around one's finger: it can be wrapped once, twice, three times and so on. [...] The wrapping can <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> of two directions, and wrappings in opposite directions will cancel out after a deformation. The homotopy group π1(S1) is therefore an infinite cyclic group, and is isomorphic to the group Z of integers under addition: a homotopy class is identified with an integer by {{counting the number of}} times a mapping in the homotopy class wraps around the circle. This integer can also be thought of as the winding number of a loop around the origin in the plane.|$|E

500|$|All of the {{stations}} are open-air structures featuring passenger canopies {{for protection from}} adverse weather conditions. The RTD has established criteria for station design {{with the intention of}} incorporating each station effectively into its surrounding community. All stations feature three elements according to the criteria: the platform, its transition plaza and the intermodal passenger transport available to and from the facility. Platforms are designed to accommodate four-car trains and may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> a side, island or side center style. The transition plaza is the area where passenger services can be found between the platform and where intermodal access is available. All stations are decorated with works of public art as part of the RTD's [...] "Art-n-Transit" [...] program. [...] They include independent works as well as pieces incorporated into the canopies, columns, pavers, windscreens, fencing and landscaping.|$|E
500|$|Gawain's trek {{leads him}} {{directly}} into {{the centre of the}} Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it lies in the writer's dialect area and matches the topographical features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century. The Green Chapel is thought to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>either</b> Lud's Church or Wetton Mill, as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author. Ralph Elliott located the chapel ("two myle henne" [...] v1078) from the old manor house at Swythamley Park {{at the bottom of a}} valley ("bothm of the brem valay" [...] v2145) on a hillside ("loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde" [...] v2147) in an enormous fissure ("an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge" [...] v2182-83). Several have tried to replicate this expedition and others such as Michael Twomey have created a virtual tour of Gawain's journey entitled 'Travels with Sir Gawain' that include photographs of landscapes mentioned and particular views mentioned in the text.|$|E
500|$|The Chapel is {{considered}} by Gawain as an evil place: foreboding, [...] "the most accursed church", [...] "the place for the Devil to recite matins"; but when the mysterious Knight allows Gawain to live, Gawain immediately assumes the role of penitent to a priest or judge, as in a genuine church. The Green Chapel may also be related to tales of fairy hills or knolls of earlier Celtic literature. Some scholars have wondered whether [...] "Hautdesert" [...] refers to the Green Chapel, as it means [...] "High Hermitage"; but such a connection is doubted by most scholars. As {{to the location of}} the Chapel, in the Greene Knight poem, Sir Bredbeddle's living place is described as [...] "the castle of hutton", causing some scholars to suggest a connection with Hutton Manor House in Somerset. Gawain's journey leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand.
