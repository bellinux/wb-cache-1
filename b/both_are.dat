5|$|Chevelle {{has been}} {{classified}} as alternative metal, post-grunge, and hard rock. The band's albums Wonder What's Next and This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In) <b>both</b> <b>are</b> described as nu metal.|$|E
5|$|Jackrabbits are {{actually}} hares rather than rabbits though <b>both</b> <b>are</b> mammals {{in the order}} Lagomorpha. Wyoming is home to three species of hares, all in the genus Lepus. These are the black-tailed jackrabbit, the white-tailed jackrabbit, and the snowshoe hare.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mrs Lammle, we have <b>both</b> <b>been</b> deceiving, {{and we have}} <b>both</b> <b>been</b> deceived. We have <b>both</b> <b>been</b> biting, and we have <b>both</b> <b>been</b> bitten. In a nut-shell, there's {{the state}} of the case.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{square of}} opposition demonstrates {{two sets of}} contradictories A and O, and E and I (i.e. they cannot <b>both</b> <b>be</b> true and cannot <b>both</b> <b>be</b> false), two contraries A and E (i.e. they can <b>both</b> <b>be</b> false, but cannot <b>both</b> <b>be</b> true), and two subcontraries I and O (i.e. they can <b>both</b> <b>be</b> true, but cannot <b>both</b> <b>be</b> false) according to Aristotle’s definitions. However, the logical hexagon provides that U and Y are also contradictory.|$|R
6000|$|The resemblance, as Byron admits, [...] "related {{merely to}} our {{apparent}} personal dispositions." [...] <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> noble, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> poets, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> [...] "patrician republicans," [...] and <b>both</b> <b>were</b> lovers of pleasure {{as well as}} lovers and students of literature; but their works do not provoke comparison. [...] "The quality of 'a narrow elevation' which [Matthew] Arnold finds in Alfieri," [...] is not characteristic of the author of Childe Harold and Don Juan.|$|R
5|$|Lower Man. The {{mountain}} has two tops, {{which used}} to be distinguished as Helvellyn Low Man (or Lower Man) and Helvellyn High Man (or Higher Man). <b>Both</b> <b>are</b> drawn and labelled on a panoramic view of the range found in Jonathan Otley's guidebook of 1823.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{materials}} {{found in}} the environment also induce plant resistance as well. Chitosan derived from chitin induce a plant's natural defense response against pathogens, diseases and insects including cyst nematodes, <b>both</b> <b>are</b> approved as biopesticides by the EPA to reduce the dependence on toxic pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Politically, {{the island}} is divided between the Republic of Ireland, an {{independent}} state, and Northern Ireland (a constituent country of the United Kingdom). They share an open border and <b>both</b> <b>are</b> part of the Common Travel Area.|$|E
60|$|<b>Both</b> <b>were</b> the {{children}} of poor parents, <b>both</b> had <b>been</b> pupil-teachers at the school; and <b>both</b> <b>were</b> destined to earn their own bread. Personally speaking, and socially speaking, these were the only points of resemblance between them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Both</b> <b>were</b> {{produced}} by Toei Company Ltd. Visual 80, and <b>both</b> <b>were</b> {{based on the}} original short story written by Osamu Dazai in 1940.|$|R
500|$|... "I {{discovered}} in nature the nonutilitarian delights that I sought in art. <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> {{a form of}} magic, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> games of intricate enchantment and deception." ...|$|R
5|$|Prayers {{dedicated}} to Varahi include Varahi Anugrahashtakam, for her blessing, and Varahi Nigrahashtakam, for destruction of enemies; <b>both</b> <b>are</b> composed in Tamil.|$|E
5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{school and}} Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedanta schools, <b>both</b> <b>are</b> {{premised on the}} {{assumption}} that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya believed that some souls are eternally doomed and damned.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} include Xenotarsosaurus from Argentina and Compsosuchus from India as basal abelisaurids, {{while others}} consider {{them to be}} outside Abelisauroidea. The French Genusaurus and Tarascosaurus have also been called abelisaurids but <b>both</b> <b>are</b> fragmentary and may be more basal ceratosaurians.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, <b>both</b> {{versions}} <b>were</b> issued, and <b>both</b> <b>were</b> minor chart hits.|$|R
60|$|It {{is also to}} be observed, that {{towards the}} end of Charles II.'s reign, the High Churchmen and the Catholics {{regarded}} themselves as on the same side in political questions, and not greatly divided in their temporal interests. <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> sufferers in the Plot, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> enemies of the sectaries, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> adherents of the Stuarts.|$|R
50|$|The {{temporary}} union between Nikita Khrushchev and Marshal Georgy Zhukov {{was founded}} on their similar backgrounds, interests and weaknesses: <b>both</b> <b>were</b> peasants, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> ambitious, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> abused by Stalin, both feared the Stalinists, and both wanted to change these things. Khrushchev and Zhukov needed one another to eliminate their mutual enemies in the Soviet political elite.|$|R
5|$|Spinning drop method: This {{technique}} {{is ideal for}} measuring low interfacial tensions. The diameter of a drop within a heavy phase is measured while <b>both</b> <b>are</b> rotated.|$|E
5|$|The book An Imperial Affliction, which {{features}} within both the original novel and the film, is fictitious, as is its author Peter Van Houten; <b>both</b> <b>are</b> {{used to enhance}} the themes and story.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{buildings}} on the site are two outhouses, located {{to the rear of}} the school building. <b>Both</b> <b>are</b> non-functional, display models. One outhouse is an original 1870s structure, transported to the site and reassembled. The other outhouse is a copy, built from salvaged materials during the school restoration. Neither outhouse is historically associated with Chana School and <b>both</b> <b>are</b> considered non-contributing factors in the schoolhouse's National Register of Historic Places listing.|$|E
50|$|When the Falklands War {{broke out}} in early April 1982, <b>both</b> ships <b>were</b> rapidly {{surveyed}} and it <b>was</b> determined <b>both</b> <b>were</b> in very good material shape, and <b>both</b> <b>were</b> immediately drydocked (Tiger in Portsmouth and Blake at Chatham) and recommissioning work was begun.|$|R
6000|$|And heartless Age perhaps will smile, [...] Or wonder whence those {{feelings}} sprung; [...] Yet let not sterner souls revile, [...] For <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> open, <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> young.|$|R
50|$|Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, {{who have}} <b>both</b> <b>been</b> with the {{department}} for 13 months, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> subsequently placed on paid administrative leave while the investigation is ongoing.|$|R
5|$|There are {{two main}} issues {{concerning}} the locomotory abilities of Tyrannosaurus: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been. <b>Both</b> <b>are</b> relevant to the debate about {{whether it was a}} hunter or a scavenger.|$|E
5|$|Two hybrids of N. rajah {{have been}} {{formally}} described and given specific names: N. × alisaputrana and N. × kinabaluensis. <b>Both</b> <b>are</b> listed on CITES Appendix II {{and the latter}} is also considered Endangered (EN (D)) under current IUCN criteria.|$|E
5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common. The gemstone moissanite (silicon carbide) can be treated as a diamond simulant, though more costly to produce than cubic zirconia. <b>Both</b> <b>are</b> produced synthetically.|$|E
60|$|There was a strife 'twixt man and maid-- Oh {{that was}} at the birth of time! But what befell 'twixt man and maid, Oh that's beyond the grip of rhyme. 'Twas, 'Sweet, I must not bide with you,' And 'Love, I cannot bide alone'; For <b>both</b> <b>were</b> young and <b>both</b> <b>were</b> true, And <b>both</b> <b>were</b> hard as the nether stone.|$|R
25|$|The Umikaze {{ships were}} rated at {{first-class}} destroyers on 28 August 1912, and served to 1 June 1930 when <b>both</b> <b>were</b> converted to minesweepers. <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> subsequently scrapped in 1936.|$|R
50|$|Two {{vessels of}} the Royal Navy have borne the name, HM galley Pigot. <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> {{acquired}} in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War, and <b>both</b> <b>were</b> lost that year; her crew destroyed {{the first to}} avoid her capture, and the Americans captured the second. <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> named for General Sir Robert Pigot, the general commanding the British Army at Newport, Rhode Island, during their service there.|$|R
5|$|Alloa Inch is {{an island}} in the tidal reaches of the River Forth near Alloa that {{consists}} of reed beds and salt marshes. There is a derelict farmhouse on the island and the Scottish Wildlife Trust has managed the island as a nature reserve since 1996. Just upstream is the smaller Tullibody Inch - <b>both</b> <b>are</b> part of the Firth of Forth SSSI, which also includes the John Muir Country Park.|$|E
5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. <b>Both</b> <b>are</b> relative terms, and <b>both</b> <b>are</b> generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details that are relevant to the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Both of the attendants– Dakini to {{her left}} and Varnini to her right– are {{depicted}} nude, with matted or dishevelled hair, three-eyed, full-breasted, wearing the serpentine sacred thread and the mundamala, and carrying the skull-bowl in the left hand and the knife in the right. Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, <b>both</b> <b>are</b> depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and drinking the dripping blood from Chhinnamasta's severed head, rather than her neck. The attendants are absent in some depictions.|$|E
50|$|Rollins and Coltrane had <b>both</b> <b>been</b> {{members of}} groups with Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk in the past. Rollins had had some recent success, and <b>both</b> <b>were</b> {{emerging}} as prominent solo tenor saxophone players.|$|R
