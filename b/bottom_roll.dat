The goal of the ENP is to extend the dwell time of the sheet between the two rolls thereby maximising the de-watering. Compared to a standard roll press that achieves up to 35% solids after pressing, an ENP brings this up to 45% and higher—delivering significant steam savings or speed increases. ENPs densify the sheet, thus increasing tensile strength and some other physical properties.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{cold rolling}} process, {{asymmetric}} shape defects {{are still a}} common problem to strip quality. For the mills with inverse symmetry roll shifting system, different roll wear and thermal contour of top roll system and <b>bottom</b> <b>roll</b> system could cause asymmetric shape defects during shifting operation. In this paper, three dimension finite element simulation models of inverse shifting roll system were established to calculate the parameters and to analyze the effects. Based on the idea in the mill engineering that mill style option depended on the product grade, shifting weakness was evaluated and the opinion of limit shifting was suggested. To improve control effect to asymmetric shape defects in cold rolling, shape control system with asymmetric shape control ability is developed, including asymmetric edge drop control at upstream stands and asymmetric flatness control at last stand. The further improvement of asymmetric shape control theory and practice is the key way to reach the higher precision of shape quality in cold strip mills...|$|E

The recrystallization texture in asymmetrically rolled materials is also considerably weaker than that in conventionally rolled one. With proper design of the ASR parameters, the shear deformation textures are still present in recrystallized materials after final heat treatment (SSHT). The presence of the shear texture orientations significantly improves both the average r and Delta r values. Furthermore, with 20 % ASR reduction and annealing, an average grain size is approximately 3 times smaller in comparison to that observed in conventionally rolled material...|$|R
40|$|Roll bending is an {{efficient}} metal forming technique, where plates are bent {{to a desired}} curvature using forming rolls. This type of sheet forming process {{is one of the}} most widely used techniques for manufacturing axisymmetric hollow shapes. Moreover, this process is beginning to be taken into serious consideration by industries for producing large, thick parts such as the conically shaped crown of a Francis turbine runner or of a wind turbine tower. Because of the numerous processing parameters, reducing the bending force and improving the accuracy of the final shape are significant challenges in the roll bending process. Therefore, the primary aim of this research is to find the strategies for reducing forming forces and improving final part quality by employing numerical and experimental methods. In this thesis, a 3 D dynamic Finite Element (FE) model of an asymmetrical roll bending process is developed using the Ansys/LS-Dyna software. The simulation results are then compared with experiments performed with instrumented parts and roll bending machine. The parameters that affect the accuracy of the final shape, the bending forces and the residual strain left in the formed plate have been investigated. Applying this 3 D dynamic FE model in an industrial context may predict the forming forces or the accuracy of the final shape’s radius and thus will decrease the setup time before manufacturing. The forming forces can be reduced by heating the plate. In this research, the relationships between the heating plate temperature and the output parameters of roll bending process such as applied forces and final shape quality have been studied by performing FE simulation and analytical computations. These results yield to a better understanding of the mechanism of the process and provide an opportunity for the design of {{an efficient}} heating system to control the heat energy to be input in the plate during the roll bending process. This research also proposes a new, simple approach for reducing flat areas and forming forces. This approach includes moving the <b>bottom</b> <b>roll</b> slightly along the feeding direction and adjusting the <b>bottom</b> <b>roll</b> location. The FE results indicate that this new approach effectively minimizes the flat area extents and reduces also the forming forces...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, the roll compaction {{is part of}} the dry granulation process, densifying fine powders into ribbons that will be later milled to produce granules with good flowability for subsequent die compaction process. Roll compactors are constructed with a sealing system, limiting the loss of powder from the sides. However, the sealing system may result in unwanted non-uniformity of the ribbon's properties. In this work, a 3 D Finite Elements Method (FEM) modeling is used to analyze the roll compaction process and the effect of sealing system designs on the compacted ribbon's density distribution. A density dependent Drucker-Prager Cap (DPC) constitutive model for microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH- 101) was calibrated and implemented in Abaqus/Explicit. Two different FEM models were investigated, one with a fixed side sealing called cheek plates and another where the side sealing is integrated with the <b>bottom</b> <b>roll</b> called rimmed-roll. Both numerical and experimental results clearly show the non-uniform roll pressure and density distribution for the cheek plates assembly, whereas the rimmed-roll shows an overall more uniformly distributed resultant pressure and density distribution. These results demonstrate the capability of FEM modeling to provide insight and help achieving {{a better understanding of the}} roll compaction process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|AbstractIn {{hot rolling}} mills, {{premature}} failure of rolls {{is a major}} concern as it adversely affects the mill operation as well as production. Analysis of failed roll materials and actual rolling conditions in service are therefore necessary to understand the roll failure mechanism and thereby improve the wear resistance and extend the service life of rolls. The hot strip mill referred here consists of six stands wherein high chromium (Hi-Cr) iron rolls and Indefinite Chilled Double Poured (ICDP) cast iron rolls are being used for finishing rolling of the strips in the last two stands. The thin strip mill produces strips in the thickness range of 1. 0 – 12. 7 mm. This work describes two different types of roll failure cases and their analysis which was carried out using destructive as well as non-destructive testing techniques (NDT). The cases are as follows:(a) Case I: enhanced ICDP <b>bottom</b> <b>roll</b> of fifth stand (F# 5) which failed from the neck portion. (b) Case II: analysis of sub-surface defect of ICDP rolls of the last stand (F# 6). Destructive testing (including metallography and chemical analysis) was carried out on the failed roll samples in the first case and gross abnormality in microstructure was observed. Some foreign particle/entrapment was observed after dressing of the working surface of roll at 566 mm diameter (initial diameter of roll was 620 mm and scrap diameter was projected to be 540 mm). The chemical composition of the particle was analyzed by a portable X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) alloy analyzer and it was confirmed that the particle is basically a ferroalloy which was entrapped in the shell of the roll, probably during casting/manufacturing of roll...|$|E

40|$|A {{square steel}} pipe is {{reshaped}} from a welded round pipe by roll forming. The effect of ellipse preforming on the cross-sectional {{size of the}} square steel pipe was investigated by experiment and three-dimensional finite element simulation. When designing a roll-forming machine for a square steel pipe, {{the diameter of the}} paired top and <b>bottom</b> <b>rolls</b> is usually set larger than that of the side roll pair, thereby avoiding interference between the roll axes driven by electric motors. When the diameter of the top roll is larger than that of the side roll, the width of a corner part of the formed pipe is larger than the height. A square pipe was formed from a preformed elliptical pipe to make the width and height of the corner part equal. As a result of ellipse preforming, the peripheral length of a square product increases {{and the size of the}} corner part of that product decreases. Therefore, elliptical preforming is effective in forming square pipe with a sharp corner. However, excessive preforming causes a hollow at the flat surface of a square product.

40|$|Torsional {{vibration}} of drive shafts, rolls, {{and vertical}} vibration of rolling mill housings due to impact rolling loads {{should be considered}} because they can shorten the lives of rolling mill components. Moreover these dynamic loads can affect the quality and physical properties of the strip. This thesis contains the simulation of different vibration modes in a hot Roughing mill which consists of a Horizontal mill with an attached Edger (Fig. 5. 1). Four vibrations of the Roughing Mill system have been studied: (i) torsional vibration of Horizontal mill (ii) vertical vibration of Horizontal mill (iii) torsional vibration of Vertical Edger (iv) horizontal vibration of slab between the two mills. There are many published works on torsional and vertical vibration of rolling mills especially for cold rolling. In their simulations, the vibrations were calculated with the excitation of a step or ramp-step function, {{but they did not}} consider the oscillation of rolling force and torques caused by the rolls having different velocities due to torsional vibration under asymmetrical rolling conditions. However, the following parameters have been taken into account when calculating the vibration in this thesis: (i) asymmetry in horizontal mill (different roll speed) (ii) variation of rolling force and torques (top and <b>bottom</b> <b>rolls)</b> in horizontal mill (iii) backlash on the drives couplings (iv) non-linear stiffness and damping of hot slab (v) push-pull between the two mills during interaction conditions The study showed that the asymmetry and slab vertical damping introduced the greatest damping on the torsional and vertical vibration of horizontal mill respectively. Moreover, higher vibrations amplitudes achieved in both mills as a result of backlash on shafts or push-pull between the two mills. Stability and torsional vibration of horizontal mill for different slippage conditions also been investigated. The self-excited vibration (continual slippage when the torque is replaced by a friction torque) introduced the highest amplitude compared with normal slippage (no torque for a short time) ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{steadily}} {{increase in}} demand for roll formed products due to their application for fields such as automotive, construction, architecture, etc., roll forming companies are challenge with rising customer demands. Companies are struggling to bring a product through from design to manufacture at improved rates, whilst achieving tighter tolerances. The roll forming process may also induce undesirable forming defects such as twist, distortion and straightness problems. Traditionally these issues would be resolved through an empirical approach which heavily relies on the designer's expertise and intuition. This approach can increase undesired development costs due to materials wasted and time delayed. Over the years, numerical simulations have been deployed to try and geometrically validate these defects and ultimately reduce the development phase of a product. The designer has the capability to virtually investigate changes in specific parameters without the risk of expensive tooling costs. The industry partner of this project, Hadley Group, Birmingham, implement Belleville washers into the roll tool configuration. The purpose of these washers is to apply pressure to the strip during roll forming in order to drive material through each forming station. They are also used to adjust {{the gap between the}} top and <b>bottom</b> forming <b>rolls,</b> since the incoming material gauge can vary by the nominal tolerance values from coil to coil. For the purpose of this paper, an investigation is carried out focusing on an individual parameter within the finite element analysis (FEA) of the cold roll forming process, i. e. the 'unknown' spring acting on the top roll during the forming process due to the implementation of Belleville washers in the pillar set up. The work explained in this paper shows the eects of the pressure applied to the forming process on the geometric attributes of the section being formed. The outcome will determine the viability of this parameter, which may ultimately require the numerical design methodology of roll formed products to be amended accordingly...|$|R

Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of natural enemies. Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to natural enemies. For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool.
