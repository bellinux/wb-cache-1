40|$|For the {{commissioning}} {{and operation}} of modern particle accelerators, automated error detection and diagnostics methods are becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we present two such methods, which are capable of localising sources of <b>beam</b> <b>offset</b> jitter {{with a combination of}} correlation studies and so called degree of freedom plots. The methods were applied to the ATF 2 beam line at KEK, where one of the major goals is the reduction of the <b>beam</b> <b>offset</b> jitter. Results of this localisation are shown in this paper. A big advantage of the presented method is its high robustness especially to varying optics parameters. Therefore, we believe that the developed <b>beam</b> <b>offset</b> jitter localisation methods can be easily applied to other accelerators...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of porosity formation during the fusion welding of titanium and its alloys is studied. Porosity formed during the electron beam welding of titanium is characterized using high-resolution X-ray tomography, residual gas analysis and metallographic sectioning; the results confirm that porosity formation {{is associated with}} evolution of gas, especially hydrogen. A model for hydrogen diffusion-controlled bubble growth is proposed, {{to aid in the}} interpretation of these findings. To investigate further the effect of hydrogen on porosity formation, hydrogen charging is used to achieve different hydrogen levels prior to welding. The results confirm that porosity can be suppressed even at every high hydrogen levels, when welding is carried out with optimized welding parameters and perfect joint alignment; on the other hand, porosity is exacerbated when a small <b>beam</b> <b>offset</b> is employed. This is because any <b>beam</b> <b>offset</b> alters the size of the liquid zone at the melting front, where the joint edges first become melted. It is proposed that the thickness of the liquid film at the melting front is crucial for bubble nucleation and bubble survival in the weld pool; bubbles can escape through the keyhole by breaking through this liquid film, when it is too thin. This challenges the common assumption of bubble escape by flotation to the weld pool surface. Thus the nucleation rate in the liquid zone at the melting front determines the likelihood of porosity occurring. This suggests that the <b>beam</b> <b>offset</b> is likely to be one factor influencing porosity formation in these circumstances. The paper provides fundamental insights into the {{mechanism of}} porosity formation during the welding of titanium alloys and guidance to aid in its elimination. © 2011 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Maintaining head-on {{collisions}} {{over many}} hours {{is an important}} aspect of optimizing the performance of a collider. For current LHC operation where the beam optics is fixed during periods of colliding beam, mainly ground motion induced perturbations have to be compensated. The situation will become significantly more complex when luminosity leveling will be applied following the LHC luminosity upgrades. During β^{*} leveling the optics in the interaction region changes significantly, feed-downs from quadrupole misalignment may induce significant orbit changes that may lead to <b>beam</b> <b>offsets</b> at the collision points. Such <b>beam</b> <b>offsets</b> induce a loss of luminosity and reduce the stability margins for collective effects that is provided by head-on beam-beam. It is therefore essential that the <b>beam</b> <b>offsets</b> at the collision points are minimized during the leveling process. This paper will review sources and mitigation techniques for the orbit perturbation at the collision points during β^{*} leveling, and present results of experiments performed at the LHC to mitigate and compensate such offsets...|$|R
40|$|Dissimilar Al/steel {{butt joints}} of 6. 0 mm thick plates have been {{achieved}} using fiber laser keyhole welding autogenously. The cross sections, interface microstructures, hardness and tensile properties of Al/steel butt joints obtained under different travel speeds and laser <b>beam</b> <b>offsets</b> were investigated. The phase morphology and thickness of the intermetallic compound (IMC) layers at the interface were analyzed by scanning electronic microscopes (SEM) using the energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The results show that travel speeds and laser <b>beam</b> <b>offsets</b> are of considerable importance for the weld shape, morphology and thickness of IMC layers, and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of Al/steel butt joints. This proves that the IMC layers consist of Fe 2 Al 5 phases and Fe 4 Al 13 phases by EBSD phase mapping. Increasing laser <b>beam</b> <b>offsets</b> from 0. 3 mm to 0. 7 mm significantly decreases the quantity of Fe 4 Al 13 phases and the thickness of Fe 2 Al 5 layers at the interface. During tensile processing, the Fe 2 Al 5 layer with the weakest bonding strength is the most brittle region at the interface. However, an intergranular fracture that occurred at Fe 2 Al 5 layers leads to a relatively high UTS of Al/steel butt joints...|$|R

40|$|Titanium and its alloys {{are prone}} to hydrogen-assisted {{porosity}} formation during welding, but this effect is not yet sufficiently understood. Research aimed at elucidating the behaviour of hydrogen during electron beam welding of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is presented. Characterisation is carried out using high resolution X-ray tomography, residual gas analysis and metallographic sectioning; this confirms that porosity formation is associated with hydrogen evolution. To quantify the dependence between porosity formation and hydrogen content in the base material, a hydrogen diffusion-controlled bubble growth model is used to simulate bubble growth in the melt, and thus to make predictions of the hydrogen concentration barrier needed for pore formation. The modeling results are supported up by experimentation on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V of different hydrogen levels, achieved by electrochemical charging. The results confirm that vigorous hydrogen degassing happens at high hydrogen levels. But porosity can be suppressed when welding is carried out with optimized welding parameters and perfect joint alignment; on the other hand, porosity is exacerbated when a small <b>beam</b> <b>offset</b> is employed. The influence of <b>beam</b> <b>offset</b> on porosity formation is discussed.

For radiating elements in the feed array, polyrod or dielectric rod radiators fed by waveguide are investigated. Polyrod antennas shrink the cross section of the waveguide required, are fairly directive, and can be tapered to reduce sidelobes.
