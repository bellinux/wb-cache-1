5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the final, the three finalists and Lloyd Webber visited Salzburg to visit some of the {{locations}} made famous <b>by</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> of Music, including Leopoldskron Palace and Nonnberg Abbey, to give the finalists a chance to understand the real Maria von Trapp.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were {{summoned to the}} hillside <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a hunting horn, {{to take part in}} various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.|$|E
5|$|Carey also {{requested}} that the Sounders have their own marching band, {{the first of its}} kind in MLS. This led to the creation of the Sound Wave, a 53-member marching band consisting of brass and marching percussion. The band plays music from multiple genres, such as Latin, rock and pop, and sits on the north end of CenturyLink Field. The March to the Match, in which fans march from Occidental Park to CenturyLink Field before each home match, has been accompanied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Wave.|$|E

5|$|Cooper is woken early <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of {{a raucous}} {{party in the}} Great Northern Hotel. He leaves to meet Truman, while Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly) meets his brother Benjamin (Richard Beymer) to discuss the new Icelandic investors in their {{property}} developments. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) arrives, disoriented and wishing to return to work, but the Hornes send him home. Cooper, Truman and Doctor Hayward (Warren Frost) discuss Johnson's bloodied shirt, learning that the blood is not Laura's but that of drug smuggler Jacques Renault.|$|E
5|$|Manne {{had strong}} {{preferences}} in {{his choice of}} drum set. Those preferences, however, changed several times over his career. He began with Gretsch drums. In 1957, intrigued <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> {{of a kind of}} drum made by Leedy (then owned by Slingerland), he had a line made for him that also became popular with other drummers. In the 1970s, after trying and abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E
5|$|Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Franz Schubert. At midnight {{the devil}} Chernabog awakes and summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain. The spirits dance and {{fly through the}} air until driven back <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of an Angelus bell as night fades into dawn. A chorus is heard singing Ave Maria as a line of robed monks is {{depicted}} walking with lighted torches through a forest and into {{the ruins of a}} cathedral.|$|E

5|$|The North Link {{project was}} {{approved}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Transit Board in June 2012, setting a $2.1 billion budget and {{expected completion date}} of 2021. The contract for tunneling and station construction was awarded to JCM Northlink LLC (a joint venture of Jay Dee, Coluccio, and Michels) for $462 million in 2013. The majority of design work for Roosevelt station was completed in 2014 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} of Evanescence's {{material was}} released in the late 1990s through independent label Bigwig Enterprises, beginning with their self-titled EP in 1998, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Asleep EP the following year. The band recorded and released a demo album in 2000, titled Origin, and sold it at their concert venues. Very few copies of Origin were pressed, and soon went on sale for high prices online.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning, Rasminah is awakened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a guitar, {{played by}} the house's owner, Hoesin (Djoemala). Afraid that he is collaborating with her pursuer, she sneaks outside, only to be confronted by Parta and Doel. Retreating, she is chased by the pair. Hoesin intervenes and, after a fierce fight, defeats the two and chases them away. He then reassures Rasminah and escorts her home.|$|E

5|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{distinctly}} Vivaldian style, as the fast tempo and classical-style chord progression anticipates the lyrics to follow. The opening chords and the melody emphasize the tonic of the leading notes: Fm–E–D–Cm–D–E–Fm–D–E–Fm, resembling a Baroque work. This is followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of dance music, produced by a powerful beat from the instruments. Madonna's vocal range spans from F3 to C5, and has a different sound from her previous work, more mature, centered, and with a lower range.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} {{referred to as}} the South 200th Street station, but was officially named for the nearby lake in December 2012 <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound</b> Transit Board. Construction on the extension began in May 2013 and on the station in September 2014; the project was budgeted at $383 million. Angle Lake station opened to the public on September 24, 2016.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} to speak English, the children– Ralph says just the surviving girl– {{explained that they}} came from a land where the sun never shone and the light was like twilight. William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E

5|$|Although Musique funèbre was internationally acclaimed, his new {{harmonic}} techniques led {{to something}} of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear John Cage's Concert for Piano and Orchestra. Although he was not influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> or {{the philosophy of the}} music, Cage's explorations of indeterminacy set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His Three Postludes were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.|$|E
5|$|As {{the elder}} sibling, Durga cares for Apu with motherly affection, but spares no {{opportunity}} to tease him. Together, they share the simple joys of life: sitting quietly under a tree, viewing pictures in a travelling vendor's bioscope, running after the candy man who passes through the village, and watching a jatra (folk theatre) performed by a troupe of actors. Every evening they are delighted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a distant train's whistle. One day, they {{run away from home}} {{to catch a glimpse of}} the train, only to discover Indir lying dead on their return.|$|E
5|$|Bragg's men {{continued}} northward to Bardstown {{where they}} rested and sought supplies and recruits. Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio, the main Union {{force in the}} state, was pressing toward Louisville. Bragg left his army and met Kirby Smith in Frankfort, where {{he was able to}} attend the inauguration of Confederate Governor Richard Hawes on October 4. Buckner, although protesting this distraction from the military mission, attended as well and gave stirring speeches to the local crowds about the Confederacy's commitment to the state of Kentucky. The inauguration ceremony was disrupted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of cannon fire from an approaching Union division and the inaugural ball scheduled for that evening was canceled.|$|E

5|$|Five months later, Wendy is on {{a subway}} train with her roommate Laura {{and her friend}} Sean. When she sees more omens she begins to get off, but sees Julie {{entering}} the car and decides to stay. Wendy notices Kevin {{sitting in the back}} of the car. The train derails, and everyone aboard shortly dies; Julie is hit by a stray wheel, and Kevin is crushed between the train and the tunnel wall. Wendy survives the crash, but is hit by another train. This turns out to be another premonition, and they attempt to stop the train. The screen goes black, followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of screeching metal.|$|E
5|$|In 1755, Benedict Arnold was {{attracted}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of a drummer {{and attempted to}} enlist in the provincial militia for service against the French, but his mother refused permission. In 1757 when he was sixteen, he did enlist in the Connecticut militia, which marched off toward Albany and Lake George. The French had besieged Fort William Henry in northeastern New York, and their Indian allies had committed atrocities after their victory. Word of the siege's disastrous outcome led the company to turn around; Arnold served for 13 days. A commonly accepted story that Arnold deserted from militia service in 1758 is based on uncertain documentary evidence.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} whaling, great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to scavenge, and compressed air inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|E
