5|$|How much <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> {{to apply}} to each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider and bike times the coefficient of friction µ of the tire on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with a rear wheel skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can generate enough <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the functional role of <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> observed when humans execute turning maneuvers. Deceleration caused by <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> contributes to changing the movement {{direction of the}} center of mass (COM) and maintaining constant velocity. We argue that <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> also prevent over-rotation of the body about the vertical axis during maneuvers. We analyzed data from sidestep and crossover cuts at average initial running velocities of 3 m s- 1. Absent <b>braking,</b> lateral <b>forces</b> would result in body rotations 1. 4 - 3 times the change in COM movement direction, causing the orientation of the body to be substantially mis-aligned with the direction of movement {{at the end of the}} step. A simple model based on the hypothesis that body rotation should match COM deflection can explain 70 % of the variance in <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> employed during running turns.

40|$|Longitudinal {{vibration}} control for a suspension bridge subjected to vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> and earthquake excitations based on magnetorheological dampers Meng-Gang Yang 1, 2, 3 and CS Cai 2, 4 In {{order to reduce}} the excessive longitudinal vibration of a suspension bridge induced by vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> (as one of the possible dynamic loadings) and earthquake excitations, a mixed control methodology using magnetorheological (MR) dampers is developed in this study. Firstly, the corresponding preferred controls subjected to vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> and earthquake excitations, separately, are obtained by simulation analyses for seven control strategies. Then, a mixed control system is established to obtain the best control efficiency and reduce the energy consumption of MR dampers, based on the displacement responses and changing rate of accelerations. Finally, this system is applied to reduce the longitudinal vibration responses of the Pingsheng Bridge. The numerical results show that the passive-on control and the semi-active fuzzy control are the corresponding preferred controls subjected to vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> and earthquake excitations, respectively. The mixed control has a good agreement with the corresponding preferred controls under four dynamic loadings including the vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>forces,</b> the Pingsheng Bridge earthquake wave, the El Centro wave, and the Takochi-oki wave, which verifies the reliability and effectiveness of this system. The mixed control has good performance and applicability for different loading combinations composed of vehicle <b>braking</b> <b>forces</b> and earthquake excitations...|$|R
25|$|Typically ABS {{includes}} a central {{electronic control unit}} (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, {{and at least two}} hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{kinetic energy}} {{increases}} with {{the square of}} the speed, an object doubling its speed has four times as much kinetic energy. For example, a car traveling twice as fast as another requires four times as much distance to stop, assuming a constant <b>braking</b> <b>force.</b> As a consequence of this quadrupling, it takes four times the work to double the speed.|$|E

25|$|Passenger trains {{have had}} {{for a long time}} a 3-wire version of the {{electro-pneumatic}} brake, which gives seven levels of <b>braking</b> <b>force.</b> In most cases the system is not fail-safe, with the wires being energized in sequence to apply the brakes, but the conventional automatic air brake is also provided to act as a fail safe, and in most cases can be used independently {{in the event of a}} failure of the EP brakes.|$|E
25|$|Brake pads are {{available}} with numerous shapes and materials. Many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting, or brake shoe, with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake. Some are made as one piece with the attachment directly molded in the pad for lower production costs; brake pads of the cartridge type are {{held in place by}} a metal split pin or threaded grub screw and can be replaced without moving the brake shoe from its alignment to the rim. The rubber can be softer for more <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> with less lever effort, or harder for longer life. Many pad designs have a rectangular shape; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim. Larger pads do not necessarily provide more <b>braking</b> <b>force,</b> but will wear more slowly (in relation to thickness), so can usually be thinner. In general, a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads, as long as the mounting is compatible. Carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads, and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} caliper design uses a single {{hydraulically}} actuated piston within a cylinder, although high performance brakes use {{as many as}} twelve. Modern cars use different hydraulic circuits to actuate the brakes on each set of wheels as a safety measure. The hydraulic design also helps multiply <b>braking</b> <b>force.</b> The number of pistons in a caliper {{is often referred to}} as the number of 'pots', so if a vehicle has 'six pot' calipers it means that each caliper houses six pistons.|$|E

25|$|When <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> is applied, {{the act of}} {{abrasive}} {{friction between}} the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers and other braking system components consists mostly of disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad causing additional dust from heightened brake disc wear and brake pad wear.|$|E
25|$|Most bicycle hubs {{incorporate}} a freewheel {{to allow the}} pedals to remain stationary while the bicycle is in motion, so that the rider can coast, i.e., ride without pedalling using forward momentum. A fixed-gear drivetrain has the drive sprocket (or cog) threaded or bolted directly to {{the hub of the}} back wheel, so that the pedals are directly coupled to the wheel. During acceleration, the pedal crank drives the wheel, but in other situations, the rear wheel can drive the pedal cranks. This direct coupling allows a cyclist to apply a <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> with the legs and bodyweight, by resisting the rotation of the cranks. It also makes it possible to cycle backwards.|$|E
25|$|Rim brakes require regular maintenance. Brake pads {{wear down}} {{and have to be}} replaced. And before they wear out completely, their {{position}} may need to be adjusted as they wear. Because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal, the pads may lose their centering as they wear, causing the pads to wear unevenly. Over longer time and use, rims become worn. Rims should be checked for wear periodically as they can fail catastrophically if the braking surface becomes too worn. Wear is accelerated by wet and muddy conditions. Rim brakes require that the rims be straight (not out-of-round or warped). If a rim has a pronounced wobble, then the <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> may be intermittent or uneven, and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of single front wheel brake can yield large deceleration on underbone motorcycle. However, the motorcycle motion potentially {{exposed to the}} nosedive effect during this application. Therefore, {{in order to avoid}} this issue, the {{application of}} concurrent brake are required. Hence, this research was carried out to understand the basic braking performance for underbone motorcycle and elucidate the influenced of concurrent braking application involving the front and rear brake component. A theoritical study was carried out in this work through the derivation of motion equation for underbone motorcycle. The preliminary results showed that the total <b>brake</b> <b>force</b> and the <b>brake</b> <b>force</b> component acting on the front wheel had increased linearly with its deceleration intensity. Further study showed that in order to achieve higher safety range, the <b>brake</b> <b>force</b> applied on the front wheel should be at least 70 % higher than the rear <b>brake</b> <b>force</b> intensity. This is probably due to the weight transferred condition during the underbone motorcycle braking...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{study on the}} changes in riding behaviour, such as changes in speed {{as well as the}} <b>brake</b> <b>force</b> and {{throttle}} force applied, when motorcyclists ride over a curve section road using an instrumented motorcycle. In this study, an instrumented motorcycle equipped with various types of sensors, on-board cameras, and data loggers, was developed in order to collect the riding data on the study site. Results from the statistical analysis showed that riding characteristics, such as changes in speed, <b>brake</b> <b>force,</b> and throttle force applied, are influenced by the distance from the curve entry, riding experience, and travel mileage of the riders. A structural equation modeling was used to study the impact of these variables on the change of riding behaviour in curve entry section.

25|$|Air {{brakes on}} the train are {{supplied}} with air from a compressor on each locomotive. When a locomotive is shut off, the compressor no longer supplies the brake system with air. An air brake pipe connects to each car and locomotive {{on the train}}. When air leaks from the various components, the air pressure drops. If {{the system is not}} recharged with air, the locomotive air brakes will become ineffective and provide no <b>braking</b> <b>force.</b> When the air brake control valves sense a drop in pressure in the brake pipe, they are designed to activate the brakes on each car. However, if the rate of leakage is slow and steady, the automatic brakes may not be applied {{as in the case of}} the Lac-Mégantic accident. The train had locomotives that could automatically restart the air-brake system in the event of a brake failure, provided that these locomotives were not shut down as they would be. Also, the TSB found that the “reset safety control” on the lead locomotive was not wired to set the entire train’s brakes in the event of an engine failure.|$|E

500|$|Most of the <b>braking</b> <b>force</b> of {{standard}} upright bikes {{comes from the}} front wheel. As the analysis above shows, if the brakes themselves are strong enough, the rear wheel is easy to skid, while the front wheel often can generate enough stopping force to flip the rider and bike over the front wheel. This is called a stoppie if the rear wheel is lifted but the bike does not flip, or an endo (abbreviated form of end-over-end) if the bike flips. On long or low bikes, however, such as cruiser motorcycles and recumbent bicycles, the front tire will skid instead, possibly causing a loss of balance. [...] Assuming no loss of balance, {{it is possible to}} calculate optimum braking performance depending on the bike's geometry, the location of center of gravity of bike and rider, and the maximum coefficient of friction.|$|E
