40|$|Abstract—Robotic {{knee surgery}} {{performs}} <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> without relying on mechanical jigs during bone preparation of TKA (Total Knee Arthroplasty). The inaccuracy induced by loose jig fixation and slot width tolerance can, subsequently, be avoided. Mill is usually {{used as the}} bone cutter {{in most of the}} current knee surgical robots, in which all bones are milled out. This might not be desired. In some cases, the cut bone may be used by the surgeon for adjustment of soft tissue balance and/or varus/valgus for some patients. Therefore the existent <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> method may not be adequate. Different scenarios of <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> in order to preserve the cut-off bones to be in pieces should be developed. In the proposed cutting process, the side edge instead of the bottom edge of the mill is used to move and cut the bone along the designated boundary of the cutting plane. Thus cut-off bone {{is in the form of}} pieces rather than blurs or chips. However, this cutting process will give rise to large and non-uniform cut forces on the cutter. As a result, the cutter is under large bending and the cutting trajectory may be deviated or, even worse, the cutter may be broken. To overcome the problem, the paper proposed an adaptive impedance force control strategy to maintain the stability and accuracy of <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> process. I...|$|R

In this article, a finite element model (FEM) of orthogonal <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> is developed. Cutting force intra-operatively can provide the surgeon with additional on-line information to support him to control quality of cutting surface. The obtained cutting force decreased little with cutting speed increasing, but ascended evidently with cutting depth increasing. The results of finite element simulations are aimed at providing optimization of cutting parameters and the basic information for hybrid force-velocity control of a robot-assisted bone milling system...|$|R

40|$|Common {{practice}} of surgical treatments in orthopaedics and traumatology involves <b>cutting</b> processes of <b>bone.</b> These operations introduce risk of thermo-mechanical damage, since {{the threshold of}} critical temperature producing thermal osteonecrosis is very low.

Ten university teaching hospital patients between 35 and 51  years of age were recruited. They all underwent elective abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for nonmalignant indications such as fibroids and menorrhagia. The round and infundibulopelvic ligaments were divided with the LOTUS shears or the Power Blade <b>cutting</b> bipolar <b>forceps</b> at open hysterectomy, and the time taken to complete the division was recorded. Two hundred histological samples were examined for thermal damage by the blinded histopathologist. The main outcome measures were the degree of thermal damage on histology, the time taken to divide each structure, and the need for additional haemostasis. Thermal damage was present in 99 / 200 slides. The LOTUS shears caused thermal damage in 47 sections. The <b>cutting</b> bipolar <b>forceps</b> caused thermal damage in 52 sections. The degree of thermal damage was less with the LOTUS shears. The mean times taken by the LOTUS shears to divide the round ligaments and infundibulopelvic ligaments were 9.24 s and 20.02  s, respectively. The corresponding times for the bipolar forceps were 9.69 s and 27.53  s, respectively. The LOTUS shears were associated with shorter bisection times and less thermal damage in this pilot study.

40|$|Since 1990 s, the {{complexity}} and frequency of orthopaedic interventions involving <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> and assembly have led to extensive development of computer assistance technologies to improve clinical outcomes through increased accuracy and reproducibility. Navigation systems, robots and patient-specific instruments are undergoing clinical trials or are already in use for knee and hip arthroplasty, high tibial open-wedge osteotomy, periacetabular osteotomy, tumor resection, craniotomy, and maxillofacial osteotomy [1 - 9]. In 2004, the methodology for evaluating the quality in orthopaedic surgery was subject to a substantial evolutionary step with the International Society for Computer Assisted Orthopaedic Surgery (CAOS-int) {{in conjunction with the}} American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) [10]. These societies undertook {{the creation of a new}} ASTM standard for assessing and comparing the performances of CAOS systems. This standard was published in 2010 as F 2554 - 10 [11] and used the definition of accuracy and precision parameters provided by the ASTM standard E 177 - 08 [12]. The standard F 2554 - 10 was recently used for assessing the positioning accuracy of surgical assistance systems [13, 14]. However, this attempt at formulating an objective methodology for evaluating the quality in orthopaedic surgery did not account for the standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that are commonly used in mechanical engineering since years [15], especially the ISO 1101 standard that is applied since the 1980 s for evaluating mechanical cutting and assembly processes [16]. Considering bone as a specific mechanical material, the ISO 1101 standard could be used to define the dimensional and geometrical specifications of the desired <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> and assemblies and evaluate the quality of the performed cutting and assemblies. Implicitly, this ISO-based methodological idea is already known among the scientific community. In 2009, Pearle et al. [17] and Rivkin et al. [18] have proposed the concept of orthopaedic quantitative and objective surgery, by emphasizing the needs for quantitative and objective data for evaluating the added value of assistance technologies. However, despite its obvious conformity with the ISO standards methodology, no research work undertook to implement this quantitative and objective surgery concept by specifically using the ISO 1101 standard and guidelines. In this context, we propose a new quality concept, called ISO-CAOS, which aims at formulating and validating the first ISO-based evaluation of the quality of <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> and assembly in CAOS surgery. The specific objectives we aim to achieve are (1) to develop new quantitative models of <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> and assembly that comply with the standard ISO 1101, and (2) to implement new objective methods and techniques for measuring the quality in CAOS surgery that comply with the common ISO guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{ultrasonic}} osteotome is a tissue-specific {{device that}} allows the surgeon to make precise osteotomies while protecting collateral or adjacent soft tissue structures. The recurring impacts pulverize the noncompliant crystalline structure resulting in a precise cut. The more compliant adjacent soft tissue is not affected by the ultrasonic oscillation. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} is to present our experience of using this technology in osteotomies. Materials and Methods: We reviewed 96 patients, both male and female; of different ages in which ultrasonic osteotome was used to perform an osteotomy of different manners (Craniotomy, laminotomy, facetectomy, etc.). Patients with head injury, spine injury, degenerative spine diseases, and brain tumors were included in this study. Results: In all these patients, the bone cut was even with minimal surrounding bone loss. The time required for the osteotomy was reduced to half.

In the former case, a micro-scale finite-element (FE) fracture model was suggested, accounting for bone’s microstructure and using X-FEM for crack-propagation analysis [1, 2]. The cortical bone tissue was modelled as four-component heterogeneous materials. The morphology of a transverse-radial cross section captured with optical microscopy was used to generate FE models; extensive experimental studies provided necessary mechanical input data [3]. The problem of <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> was treated within the framework of tool-bone interaction analysis [4, 5]. A two-domain approach was used, with a process zone simulated using a smooth-particle hydrodynamics method. This zone was embedded in a continuum domain with macroscopic anisotropic properties obtained in experiments. This study is supported by analysis of damage induced by interaction between the cutting tool and the bone tissue using wedge-indentation tests and considering also the anisotropic behaviour of the bone...|$|R
40|$|Background: Resection of bone tumors {{within the}} pelvis {{requires}} good cutting accuracy to achieve satisfactory safe margins. Manually controlled <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> {{can result in}} serious errors, especially due to the complex three-dimensional geometry, limited visibility, and restricted working space of the pelvic bone. This experimental study investigated cutting accuracy during navigated and non-navigated simulated <b>bone</b> tumor <b>cutting</b> in the pelvis. Methods: A periacetabular tumor resection was simulated using a pelvic bone model. Twenty-three operators (10 senior and 13 junior surgeons) were asked to perform the tumor cutting, initially according to a freehand procedure and later {{with the aid of}} a navigation system. Before cutting, each operator used preoperative planning software to define four target planes around the tumor with a 10 -mm desired safe margin. After cutting, the location and flatness of the cut planes were measured, as well as the achieved surgical margins and the time required for each cutting procedure. Results: The location of the cut planes with respect to the target planes was significantly improved by using the navigated cutting procedure, averaging 2. 8 [*]mm as compared to 11. 2 [*]mm for the freehand cutting procedure (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). There was no intralesional tumor cutting when using the navigation system. The maximum difference between the achieved margins and the 10 -mm desired safe margin was 6. 5 [*]mm with the navigated cutting process (compared to 13 [*]mm with the freehand cutting process). Conclusions: Cutting accuracy during simulated bone cuts of the pelvis can be significantly improved by using a freehand process assisted by a navigation system. When fully validated with complementary in vivo studies, the planning and navigation-guided technologies that have been developed for the present study may improve <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> accuracy during pelvic tumor resection by providing clinically acceptable margins...|$|R
50|$|Erbium lasers {{are both}} hard and soft tissue capable. They {{can be used}} for a host of dental {{procedures}}, and allow for more procedures to be done without local anesthesia. Erbium lasers {{can be used for}} hard tissue procedures like <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> and create minimal thermal and mechanical trauma to adjacent tissues. These procedures show an excellent healing response. Soft tissue applications with erbium lasers feature less hemostasis and coagulation abilities relative to the CO2 lasers. The new CO2 laser operating at 9,300 nm features strong absorption in both soft and hard tissue and is the newest alternative to erbium lasers.|$|R
40|$|Anterior {{dislocation}} of a posterior stabilised total knee arthroplasty {{secondary to}} a polyethylene tibial post fracture is rare. We report one such case in an 89 -year-old Chinese {{woman who had}} undergone total knee arthroplasty using the Insall Burstein II prosthesis 7 years earlier. The failure was due to sagittal malalignment of the components. Owing to more pronounced anterior bowing of the distal femoral shaft in southern Chinese, neutral component placement is often biased toward hyperextension. When the knee reaches full extension, anterior impingement occurs. Surgeons must therefore take extra care in preoperative planning and <b>bone</b> <b>cutting</b> in this population. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
