He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> increasing {{the size of the}} United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> Although doctors {{told him that}} he would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public followed closely throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E

Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and then only liquids.|$|E
25|$|Before {{headlining}} {{their own}} tours, Mindless Behavior toured with many established musicians, such as The Backstreet Boys, Jason Derulo, Justin Bieber, {{and was an}} opening act for Janet Jackson during her Number Ones, Up Close and Personal tour. The group had become quite popular from appearing on BET's 106 & Park, and also headlined the first BET Closer to My Dreams Tour alongside Diggy Simmons, Lil Twist, Trevante and Jawan Harris. In 2011, Mindless Behavior headlined the Scream Tour with Diggy Simmons, which featured The OMG Girlz, Jacob Latimore, and Hamilton Park. The group also performed at the White House twice and were the first African American boy band to do so. Also in 2011, they performed at the prestigious White House Easter Egg Roll. In 2012, they were performers at Arthur Ashe Kids' Day. In 2013, the group performed for Wade's World Foundation, an organization by Dwyane Wade that provides support to community-based organizations that promote education, health and social skills for children in at-risk situations. They were also welcomed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> to perform at the Kids Inaugural Ball.|$|E
500|$|Among {{those at}} the station was Robert Todd Lincoln, who sixteen years before had watched his father die from an assassin's bullet. Garfield was taken on a {{mattress}} upstairs to a private office, where several doctors examined him, probing the wound with unwashed fingers. [...] At his request, Garfield was taken <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> and his wife, then in New Jersey, was sent for. Blaine sent word to Vice President Arthur in New York City, who received threats against his life because of his animosity toward Garfield and Guiteau's statements.|$|E

500|$|An early {{example of}} the First Lady's {{protective}} nature occurred when Senator Strom Thurmond entered the President's hospital room that day in March, passing the Secret Service detail by claiming he was the President's [...] "close friend", presumably to acquire media attention. Nancy was outraged and demanded he leave. While the President recuperated in the hospital, the First Lady slept {{with one of his}} shirts to be comforted by the scent. When Ronald Reagan was released from the hospital on April 12, she escorted him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, Senator Patrick Leahy, the Chair of the Judiciary Committee, {{called on}} the Senate to approve Johnsen and several other nominees, and denounced the [...] "unprecedented delays in the {{consideration}} of qualified and noncontroversial nominations". The Washington Post agreed, editorializing that the treatment of Johnsen's nomination was a [...] "travesty" [...] and adding: [...] "Ms. Johnsen is highly qualified and should be confirmed. At the very least, senators should have the decency to give her an up-or-down vote." [...] Nevertheless, the Senate did not act on the nomination before it ended its 2009 session. [...] As a result, the nomination was sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> leaving Obama {{to decide whether to}} renominate Johnsen. Obama also had the option of making a recess appointment, which would have enabled Johnsen to fill the post {{until the end of the}} 2010 session of the Senate.|$|E
2500|$|Grant's {{popularity}} was high, but fading. [...] Washburne conjectured {{that had}} Grant stayed abroad longer, {{the wave of}} adulation that greeted him on his return might have carried {{him all the way}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> [...] Conkling placed Grant's name in nomination with an elegant speech, his most famous line being: [...] "When asked which state he hails from, our sole reply shall be, he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree." [...] With 370 votes needed for nomination, the first ballot had Grant at 304, Blaine at 284, Sherman at 93, and the rest scattered to minor candidates. [...] Subsequent ballots followed, with roughly the same result; neither Grant nor Blaine could win. [...] After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative James A. Garfield of Ohio. [...] Grant received 306 votes on the final ballot, his supporters staying committed to their man to the bitter end. [...] Logan moved that the nomination be made unanimous, and it was, but those 306 Stalwarts were immortalized in Republican myth.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{modification}} {{was done}} to raise the desk by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. [...] The first time a base was made for the Resolute Desk was during the John F. Kennedy Administration. [...] This base was made of pine and did not match the desk very well. [...] That base is very visible in the famous photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. playing under the Resolute Desk. In January 1977, President Carter requested the desk be sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> from the Smithsonian Institution. [...] Photos from January–February 1977 show the Resolute Desk being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show the desk being used without a base. President Reagan requested that the desk be raised higher since he was hitting his legs {{on the top of}} the knee hole. The White House's earliest image of the desk with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982. A new, better-fitting base was built for the desk in 1986, and that base has remained with the desk since that time.|$|E
