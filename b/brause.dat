25|$|<b>Brause</b> {{came upon}} the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Regiment, which had {{expended}} all its ammunition: he procured for it a fresh supply, and ordered it to return into the village, along with the 2nd Battalion of the 14th Regiment; while the 1st Battalion of this regiment threw itself into Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and relieved the 2nd Regiment, which now retired, as did also {{the remainder of the}} 5th Brigade (Tippelskirch's) to the rear of Wagnelée, where it reformed.|$|E
25|$|These two battalions, thus posted, {{caught the}} eye of Blücher as he looked round for the nearest {{available}} force, and he immediately ordered them to advance, and join in the contest; and General <b>Brause,</b> on being made acquainted with this disposition, led forward the 3rd Battalions of the 14th and 22nd Regiments, and the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Elbe Landwehr, while the four remaining battalions of his brigade, making a change of front to their left, formed up, in reserve, in rear of the Namur road. On approaching the more immediate scene of the action.|$|E
25|$|The Prussian 7th Brigade (General <b>Brause's),</b> {{which had}} been rejoined by {{detached}} battalions, was pushed forward {{as far as the}} Roman road, to occupy the position vacated by the advance of 5th Brigade (Tippelskirch's), to which was to act as support if needed.|$|R
50|$|Battle of Ligny (1815): The French Army of the North under Napoleon Bonaparte {{defeated}} a Prussian army {{under the}} command of Prince Blücher. At the start of the battle the cross roads was occupied by the Prussian 5th Brigade (Greneral Tippelskirch's). When the 5th Brigade advanced on Saint-Amand-la-Haye the 7th Brigade (General <b>Brause's)</b> occupy the position.|$|R
25|$|Greneral Jürgass ordered {{forward the}} Prussian 7th Brigade (General Brause's) {{in support of}} that of the 5th Brigade (General Tippelskirch's), which had {{suffered}} a very severe loss. When General <b>Brause</b> had, at an earlier period, taken post at the Trois Burettes, upon Tippelskirch advancing from that point to Wagnelée;(as previously explained), he stationed both the 3rd Battalions of the 14th and 22nd regiments upon an eminence on {{the left of the}} high road, for the purpose of keeping up the communication with Tippelskirch; and he pushed on the other two battalions of the 14th Regiment towards Brye, that they might be nearer at hand, if required, for the contest in the villages of Wagnelée and Saint-Amand-la-Haye, while the two squadrons of the Elbe Landwehr Cavalry, attached to his brigade, kept a look out upon both sides of the road.|$|E
25|$|Finding that Maison {{evacuated}} Ghent, Thielmann moved south-west to Avelgem, hoping catch Solignac's division. He {{called in}} some dispersed troops and invited Wallmoden to march to Oudenaarde to help defeat the French. Thielmann's 2nd Brigade under Prince Paul von Württemberg took {{the main road}} from Avelgem, while Brause's 1st Brigade used a different route. At 6:00 am on 31 March, Brause's brigade cleared the French outposts from Zwevegem. The 1st Battalion of the 1st Saxon Landwehr Regiment covered the right flank toward Harelbeke while Hellwig's Freikorps covered the left flank {{in the direction of}} Bellegem. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Saxon Landwehr and four guns constituted the reserve while the remainder of 1st Brigade formed the centre. While the 1st Brigade deployed, the 2nd Brigade arrived in Zwevegem. When <b>Brause</b> reported a French battle line in front of him, Thielmann and Prince Paul went forward to investigate. After an inspection, Thielmann waved his troops forward.|$|E
25|$|It was 08:00 {{when these}} dispositions were completed; and about 11:00, Pirch's Corps, {{which more than}} an hour before had left its bivouac near Mazy, was formed up in reserve to Zieten. The 5th Infantry Brigade (Greneral Tippelskirch's) stood across the high road, near the Trois Burettes and the {{intersection}} with the old Roman road, in the customary Prussian Brigade order of three lines of columns of battalions at deploying intervals, and had in its front the two batteries of artillery, Numbers 10 and 37. The 6th Brigade (General Krafft's) was posted in similar order {{in the rear of the}} Farm of Bussy, and in left rear of Brye. The 7th Brigade (General <b>Brause)</b> stood more to the left: it had only the 14th Regiment then present, for the 22nd Regiment and the Elbe Landwehr did not rejoin it until about 13:00. The 8th Brigade (Colonel Langen's) was ordered to remain on the high road leading from Sombreffe to Fleurus, until the arrival of the III Corps (Thielemann's). One of its battalions — the 3rd of the 21st Regiment — and two Squadrons of the Neumark Dragoons attached to this corps, had been left in the line of outposts beyond the Meuse, towards Philippeville; and did not rejoin it until 20 June.|$|E
25|$|About this time, General Jürgass {{received}} {{orders to}} cover with his cavalry (of the II Corps) the retreat of the Prussian infantry from Saint-Amand-la-Haye and Wagnelée. General <b>Brause,</b> perceiving that the French had attacked the 1st Cavalry Brigade (Marwitz's, of the III Corps), on his right, and endangered his {{communication with the}} rear, hastened with the Fusilier Battalions of the 22nd Regiment (which had continued in reserve in rear of Saint-Amand-la-Haye) towards the high road, upon which {{the greater part of}} the 7th Brigade (Brause's) had by this time been collected. The Prussians, on retiring from Saint-Amand-la-Haye, were closely followed by the French. The 1st Battalion of the 14th Regiment was still in the Hamlet of Saint-Amand when it received the order to retire. During its retreat it was attacked whilst in a hollow way. It immediately showed a front on each flank, and succeeded in driving back the French. Jürgass now sent forward the 4th Squadron of the Brandenburg Hussars to attack French tirailleurs (skirmishers), who were beginning to advance from out of Saint-Amand-la-Haye. The latter were immediately forced back upon the village. Somewhat later, however, the French tirailleurs poured forth in greater numbers from out of Wagnelée, and threw themselves upon the right flank of the retreating Prussians. A mêlée ensued, in which Jürgass was shot in the shoulder.|$|E

50|$|In a {{small village}} on the Faroe Islands, the people's only source of income is {{trapping}} a local breed of wild birds. The corrupt capitalist Mr. <b>Brause</b> exploits the locals, forcing them {{to work for a}} low wage while selling the birds with a high profit. A disease strikes the village, and many inhabitants become ill. A local physician, Dr. Stefan Horn, discovers that the source of the sickness is the birds. He sends a telegram to a medical research institute in Copenhagen. The scientists in the capital corroborate his suspicions. <b>Brause</b> destroys their letter and tells the villagers that they can continue with their trade. Eventually, Stefan and his cousin, Arne, manage to expose the truth before the people. <b>Brause</b> flees the islands.|$|E
50|$|Pirch {{placed the}} whole of the rearguard under the orders of General <b>Brause,</b> the Commander of the 7th Brigade, and {{reinforced}} Lieutenant Colonel Sohr with the 11th Hussars and four pieces of horse artillery. <b>Brause</b> posted the remaining battalions of the 8th Brigade in rear of the wood, and the three Regiments of Cavalry on the right, with the Foot Battery No. 12 in their front. The 7th Brigade, deployed into line, remained in reserve.|$|E

50|$|With this view, {{he ordered}} General <b>Brause</b> to relieve, with the 7th Brigade, the troops then engaged; and {{together}} with the vanguard under Lieutenant Colonel Sohr, to blockade the town. At {{the same time he}} directed the remainder of the Corps to bivouac near Temploux.|$|E

50|$|Ballot Measure 2 of 1998 is {{a ballot}} measure, since ruled unconstitutional, that added an {{amendment}} to the Alaska Constitution that prohibited the recognition of same-sex marriage in Alaska. The Ballot measure was sparked by the lawsuit filed by Jay <b>Brause</b> and Gene Dugan, after the two men were denied a marriage license by the Alaska Bureau of Vital Statistics. In <b>Brause</b> v. Bureau of Vital Statistics, 1998 WL 88743, the Alaska Superior Court ruled that the state needed compelling reason to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples and ordered a trial on the question. In response, the Alaska Legislature immediately proposed and passed Resolution 42, which became what is now known as Ballot Measure 2. Ballot Measure 2 passed via public referendum on November 3, 1998 with 68% of voters supporting and 32% opposing. The Bause case was dismissed following the passage of the ballot measure.|$|E
50|$|In August 1994, Jay <b>Brause</b> and Gene Dugan, a {{same-sex}} male couple, {{filed an}} application for a marriage license which was denied by the Alaska Office of Vital Statistics. They filed suit in the Alaska Superior Court, arguing that their rights to privacy and equal protection -both of which are referenced in the Alaska Constitution- were violated by the office's refusal {{to allow them to}} marry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brause</b> {{studied at}} Koszęcin, in Poland. Along with his botanical career he {{continued}} {{throughout his life}} a military career, first in the artillery during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, then as an officer in Charlottenburg, with an expedition to Central Africa in 1907-1908. In retirement, he {{was associated with the}} botanical garden and museum in Berlin as well as the Botanischer Verein der Provinz Brandenburg (Botanical Association of Brandenburg Province).|$|E
50|$|Although the {{arguments}} in <b>Brause</b> for full legal recognition of same-sex marriage were effectively mooted by the constitutional amendment, the plaintiffs alternatively argued that principles of equality demanded that same-sex couples be accorded {{the rights and}} benefits of marriage, even if marital status itself were to describe only different-sex couples. However, the Alaska Supreme Court dismissed the case on procedural grounds, determining that the plaintiffs had failed to present an actual controversy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brause</b> {{came upon}} the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Regiment, which had {{expended}} all its ammunition: he procured for it a fresh supply, and ordered it to return into the village, along with the 2nd Battalion of the 14th Regiment; while the 1st Battalion of this regiment threw itself into Saint-Amand-la-Haye, and relieved the 2nd Regiment, which now retired, as did also {{the remainder of the}} 5th Brigade (Tippelskirch's) to the rear of Wagnelée, where it reformed.|$|E
50|$|General <b>Brause</b> {{proceeded}} to post the Fusilier Battalion of the 22nd Regiment {{in the direction}} of the Porte de Fer, and the Fusilier Battalion of the 2nd Elbe Landwehr towards the Brussels Gate. The main body of the 7th Brigade, under Colonel Schon, was stationed in rear of the suburb. The first mentioned battalion stood, under cover, at four hundred paces distance from the Porte de Per, having its Tirailleurs in the avenue near the gate. Just as General <b>Brause</b> rode up to examine its formation, an alarm was spread in front that the French was making a sortie. The General desired the commanding officer, Major Jochens, to lead his battalion quickly against the defenders, to overthrow them, and then, if possible, to penetrate into the town along with the retreating troops. As Major Jochens approached the gate, he found in its immediate vicinity the Tirailleurs of the 6th Brigade, still maintaining the contest in that quarter. The attacking column and the Tirailleurs now rushed towards the gate and the walls; which the French, probably not deeming themselves strong enough to resist this pressure, abandoned in the greatest haste.|$|E
50|$|In 1995 two men, Jay <b>Brause</b> and Gene Dugan, {{relying on}} the then-gender-neutral {{marriage}} code of Alaska submitted an application for a marriage license to the Alaska Bureau of Vital Statistics, Third Judicial District at Anchorage, which was denied despite satisfying all of {{the requirements of the}} state with the exception of being of the same gender. In the wake of the Hawaii Supreme Court's decision in Baehr v. Lewin, in which the Hawaii Supreme Court held that the State's marriage statute constituted sex discrimination under the Hawaii Constitution but was later overturned, the two men sued the State of Alaska. They sought to have the marriage statute denying same-sex marriage declared unconstitutional, and seeking an injunction that would permanently prevent the State from applying or enforcing the statutes denying same-sex marriages. Before the initial hearing was held, the Alaska Legislature made an amendment to the marriage statute to discard the gender-neutral language and restrict marriage to only one man and one woman. <b>Brause</b> and Dugan responded by amending their complaint to ask for a court declaration that this statute was also unconstitutional, arguing that by failing to issue them a marriage license the State had denied them due process and infringed their right to privacy under Alaska's Constitution.|$|E
