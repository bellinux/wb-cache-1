It is {{interesting}} that the contour lines around {{the southern part of}} the Hinagu segment and the Midorikawa fault zone show an S-shaped distribution across the fault (Fig.  3). According to Hagiwara (1987), a lateral displacement of a geological structure can be recognized from <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> as changes in contour direction and interval, discontinuous contour and S- or U-shaped features across a fault. For example, S-shaped contours of <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> are observed over a left lateral displacement of the Naguri fault (Hagiwara et al. 1997). Thus, we consider that the S-shaped distributions observed for the Hinagu segment and the Midorikawa fault zone indicate a right lateral faulting (Fig.  3). This is consistent with the geological and geomorphological estimation of the faulting (HERP 2013 a, c).|$|R

Three-dimensional gravity analysis {{is the process of}} removing the predictable components from the free-air gravity anomalies and has proven to be useful for interpreting the subsurface structures and active processes at mid-ocean ridges. The three-dimensional effects of the seafloor and Moho topography, assuming a constant crustal thickness and constant crust and upper mantle densities, are subtracted from the free-air anomalies, yielding the mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> at mid-ocean ridges are believed to be largely due to the three-dimensional thermal structure, which can be predicted using a simple passive flow model. When the gravity contribution from the predicted thermal structure is removed from the mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies,</b> the residual mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> are created, which represent lateral variations in the crustal thickness and/or density variations from the assumed model. Three-dimensional gravity analysis has been carried out over three areas along the Pacific-Antarctic East Pacific Rise (EPR) : (1) the eastern intersection of the Menard transform with the EPR, (2) the overlapping spreading center (OSC) at 36. 5 °S and, (3) the western intersection of the Raitt transform with the EPR. This geophysical analysis provides an essential tool for understanding the subsurface crustal/upper mantle structure of the fast spreading EPR, and more specifically at transform and nontransform offsets along the EPR. Several interesting features were observed at the eastern intersection between the Menard transform and the EPR. The continuous nature of the residual mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> along the ridge axis suggests that the 60 km of ridge axis surveyed here has a fairly uniform crustal/upper mantle structure. Significant features are not observed in the residual mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> at the ridge-transform intersection or along the eastern 75 km of the Menard transform. At the ridge-transform intersection, fresh lavas from the observed overshot ridge have filled in the transform valley and have subsequently thickened the crust, eliminating any crustal thinning that is occurring there. The large OSC at 36. 5 °S has a left-stepping offset of approximately 34 km. The most significant feature in the gravity data from this study area is the observed low in the mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> which extends from the northern ridge segment, eastward to the "inactive" rift and continued along the southern ridge segment. This gravity low suggests that this region is underlain by thicker crust and/or hotter, less dense material. No significant features are observed in the residual mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> associated with the overlap basin or the two smaller basins that border the "inactive" rift. The western ridge-transform intersection (RTI) between the Raitt transform and the EPR significantly differs from the Menard transform study area. A transform valley is not observed at this RYE and neither is an overshot ridge. Instead, a transformparallel median ridge is observed east of the RTI, and a fossil transform valley is observed north of the RTI. A low in the residual mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> is associated with the fossil transform valley and the median ridge, suggesting that these areas are underlain by thicker crust and/or less dense material. Positive residual mantle <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> observed at the inside corner of the RYE suggest that this area is underlain by thinner crust and/or colder, more dense material; while at the outside corner of the ridge-transform intersection, a residual anomaly low is observed which suggests that the outside corner is underlain with thicker crust and/or hotter, less dense material...|$|R
40|$|Based on gravity {{analysis}} and previous integrated studies combining potential fields and seismic data, we {{demonstrate that the}} Iberia-Africa plate boundary region is characterized by several tectonically inverted transtensional domains inherited from the Jurassic. Gravity data, when filtered for short wavelengths, show conspicuous positive <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> associated with the Gorringe Bank, the Guadalquivir Bank and the Ronda/Beni-Bousera peridotitic massifs. Gravity modelling combined with seismic and geological data shows that the filtered <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> are compatible with relatively high-density and shallow-buried bodies, which correspond to partly serpentinized peridotitic slices with similar densities and geometries as those proved for the Gorringe Bank. The study indicates that the Alpine convergence between Africa and Iberia since Late Cretaceous times reactivated these transtensional domains, which were less deformed westwards and thus preserved their segmentation. The interpretation of these <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> and their distribution substantiates the double-polarity subduction model proposed for the region, and agrees with the present-day seismically diffuse character of the Iberia-Africa plate boundary.

He studied the fossils of the Siwaliks, examining the collections at the British Museum along with A T Hopwood and W E Swinton around 1926-27. The Trigonometrical Survey of India had found discrepancies in measurements based on triangulation and those made using astronomy observations. This was described in 1855 by Archdeacon J. H.

Wadia reviewed this matter in 1938 and suggested that it required further work to resolve the debate. Another topic that interested him was the age of the Salt Range which had been suggested as either Cambrian, Pre-Cambrian or Eocene. Birbal Sahni and his fellow researchers reported angiosperms and insect fossils. Wadia suggested that there was some thrust of Cambrian plates over Eocene plates in some areas. Wadia took an interest in soil science. In 1954, he suggested that the Pleistocene Ice Age of the northern hemisphere was a time of great rainfall (the Pluvial Age) in the semi-tropical and tropical latitudes. One of his early contributions was to explain the knee-bend or syntaxis in the mountain ranges around Nanga Parbat.|$|E

The aim is to investigate the effects of high-frequency components (by way of the terrain correction) on the resulting grid of mean gravity anomalies, and hence the geoid. The gravity anomaly types investigated comprise simple <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> and refined <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies,</b> both computed using a constant topographic mass density. Irrespective of which anomaly type is used for gridding, the relevant additional correction terms are applied to yield an approximation of the mean Helmert anomaly.

40|$|The Bouguer {{correction}} using a mean {{sea level}} reduction datum compensates the gravitational effect {{of the mass of}} the terrain above sea level. This correction generally results in long -wavelength <b>Bouguer</b> gravity <b>anomalies</b> if the mass of the terrain is isostatically compensated. These anomalies correlate with regional elevations, especially in areas with significant regional variations in elevation, such as western North America. The adverse effect of this correlation is that other anomalies of potential interest in a tectonic or geologic analysis may be overshadowed. To circumvent this problem in an analysis of gravity in Arizona, a residual <b>Bouguer</b> gravity <b>anomaly</b> map has been constructed for the state in which a trend surface of the elevation is used as the reduction datum in the Bouguer correction. Elevation values from topographic maps and not gravity station elevations have been used to prepare the regional elevation datum because station elevations do not adequately sample the range in elevations. Small- and large-wavelength residual <b>Bouguer</b> gravity <b>anomalies</b> and trends of anomalies are brought out more clearly by the residual <b>Bouguer</b> gravity <b>anomaly</b> map than by previous gravity maps. The most prominent features in the residual anomalies are a strong gravity gradient 50 km wide striking west -northwest across southern Arizona and a large wavelength residual <b>Bouguer</b> gravity <b>anomaly</b> low in the Coconino Plateau of northwest Arizona.

50|$|The <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> {{usually are}} {{negative}} {{in the mountains}} because they involve reducing out the attraction of the mountain mass, by about 100 milligals per kilometre of mountain height. In large mountain areas, they are even more negative than this because of isostasy: the rock density of the mountain roots is lower, compared with the surrounding earth's mantle, causing a further gravity deficit. Typical anomalies in the Central Alps are −150 milligals (−1.5 mm/s²). Rather local anomalies are used in applied geophysics: if they are positive, this may indicate metallic ores. At scales between entire mountain ranges and ore bodies, <b>Bouguer</b> <b>anomalies</b> may indicate rock types. For example, the northeast-southwest trending high across central New Jersey (see figure) represents a graben of Triassic age largely filled with dense basalts. Salt domes are typically expressed in gravity maps as lows, because salt has a low density compared to the rocks the dome intrudes. Anomalies can help to distinguish sedimentary basins whose fill differs in density {{from that of the}} surrounding region - see Gravity Anomalies of Britain and Ireland for example.|$|R
