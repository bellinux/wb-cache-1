5|$|Winston Churchill was {{impressed}} by Henson. Grimley comments that they had much in common, both spending years as isolated figures speaking out for beliefs that were dismissed {{at the time and}} later vindicated. As prime minister, Churchill persuaded Henson out of retirement in 1940 to resume his old duties as a Canon of Westminster Abbey. After overcoming the momentary strangeness of <b>being</b> <b>back</b> in his old post after nearly thirty years he preached with vigour until cataracts made his eyesight too poor to continue. He retired from the Abbey in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Hours before {{striking}} the Philippines on November4, both agencies reported Thelma {{to have reached}} its peak intensity. The JTWC estimated the storm to have attained one-minute sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) while the JMA estimated ten-minute sustained winds at 75km/h (45mph). Additionally, its barometric pressure reached 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg). Thelma soon made landfall in Samar before weakening to a minimal tropical storm. Maintaining gale-force winds, the system eventually passed over Palawan Island on November6 before moving over the South China Sea. Despite <b>being</b> <b>back</b> over water, strong wind shear prevented re-intensification and caused Thelma to weaken to a tropical depression by November7. Now moving westward, the depression eventually made its final landfall over the Mekong River Delta in Southern Vietnam on November8. Over {{the next couple of}} days the system weakened into an area of low pressure as it moved westwards, before it moved into the Andaman Sea during November 10. Once in the Andaman Sea, the systems remnants contributed to the formation of the Karaikal tropical cyclone during the next day.|$|E

25|$|Later that season, Elliott {{signed to}} drive the No. 21 for Wood Brothers Racing in 2007, {{in part due to}} his {{championship}} provisional, which guaranteed starting the race. Since fellow champion Dale Jarrett had used all of his guaranteed starts in his Toyota for Michael Waltrip Racing, Elliott was the only champion eligible for the provisional not guaranteed a spot by being in the top 35 in owner's points. His first race for the team was the Coca Cola 600 at Charlotte, which he qualified without needing one of his six provisionals. He led the race at one point until he was involved in a wreck around lap 200. At Michigan, Elliott gave the team a much needed 11th-place finish, and was kept in the car until the fall Richmond race. The car then fell out of the top 35 again but at Bristol got back into top 35 in points. Ken Schrader returned to the No. 21 replacing Elliott at a testing session at Talladega Superspeedway due to the team <b>being</b> <b>back</b> in the top 35 in owners points. He returned for the final four races after the 21 fell out of the top-35 once again.|$|E

500|$|Chambers {{has spoken}} highly of his {{relationship}} with his co-stars, explaining that: [...] "Luke and I joined at the same time so we've always had a kinship and on our dressing room corridor we have Patsy, Rosie, Phoebe, Rakie and Jaye so there's always some banter going on, it's like <b>being</b> <b>back</b> at school. I think we're lucky because the guests we have on the show often comment on what a good atmosphere Holby has.

Kavner {{described}} the show as, [...] "like <b>being</b> <b>back</b> in school, {{a chance to play}} a wide variety of characters, some really vicious people, to not rest on laurels, to not play it safe". Kavner commented, [...] "What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [...] {{we did a lot of}} looking at people to find out who to base our characters on. We did our homework on our lunch hour." [...] She received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Best Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program.|$|E
500|$|Like Ken Tucker, Hanson {{also loved}} how Olivia coped with someone posing as herself, {{saying that it}} made her seem like an [...] "honest, real woman".

Rhea Dee of Pinkraygun.com almost entirely focused on Olivia's reactions to <b>being</b> <b>back</b> in the prime universe. Dee praised the realistic tone, writing that normally in other shows she was used to the female character being [...] "annoying" [...] after trauma, but [...] "not once in this episode did I feel like Olivia’s emotions were irrational".|$|E

The play in which he starred, You Never Can Tell, transferred to the Haymarket Theatre that December having made its debut at the Theatr Clwyd in Wales earlier that year. It was the second time the actor had appeared in the play, the first <b>being</b> <b>back</b> in Bristol fifty years previously when he starred as the youthful lead, Valentine. This time he was cast as William, the elderly waiter, a part which he considered to be [...] "a real hell to play", partly because of the many meals he had to serve up on stage, whilst at the same time trying to remember the complex script. [...] He enjoyed the play immensely and was thrilled at its successful run.

Hordern admitted that, on the whole, the experience made him feel [...] "a little happier" [...] about life.|$|E

Cause Beyoncé, she blew up solo, so how's it going to work in a group together?". He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's [...] "excitement <b>being</b> <b>back</b> in the studio together", calling the process [...] "natural". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period. This further inspired them to record the conversations and use it as the main theme of the record.|$|E
