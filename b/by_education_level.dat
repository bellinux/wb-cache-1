40|$|Human capital {{obtained}} through {{education has been}} shown to be one of the strongest drivers of entrepreneurship performance. The entrepreneur’s human capital, though, is only one of the input factors into the production process of her venture. In this paper we will analyze to what extent the <b>education</b> <b>levels</b> of other (potential) stakeholders affect the entrepreneur’s performance. The <b>education</b> <b>level</b> of consumers may shape the demand function for an entrepreneur’s output, whereas the <b>education</b> <b>level</b> of employees may affect the entrepreneur’s productivity and thereby shape her supply function. Based on this, we hypothesize that the performance of an entrepreneur is not only affected positively <b>by</b> her own <b>education</b> <b>level</b> but in addition, also <b>by</b> the <b>education</b> <b>level</b> of the population. We find empirical support for this hypothesis using an eight years (1994 - 2001) panel of labor market participants in the EU- 15 countries. An implication of our finding is that entrepreneurship and higher education policies should be considered in tandem with each other. ...|$|R

If there are significant differences between employment-status persistence (structural and spurious state dependence) of immigrants and natives, then the standard static assimilation model produces biased predictions for the labour market outcome of immigrants. We find significant persistence of the employment-status which differs between immigrants and natives, also across immigrant groups. The static assimilation model of employment-status overestimates (underestimates) the early (later) marginal assimilation rates and the assimilation process is 5 - 10 years shorter compared to the dynamic assimilation model. A similar analysis based on the degree of educational levels reveals that the persistence of employment-status is also differed among subgroups <b>by</b> <b>education</b> <b>levels</b> leading to different labour market outcomes...|$|R
