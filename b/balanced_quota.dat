40|$|Synopsis [...] An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} answer some basic questions about consumer product testing. Using two toothpastes as the test products, the performance of two con-sumer panels differing in size and type was compared. The so-called local panel, which was the smaller panel, consisted of families selected because they were known to discriminate, i. e., accurately observe product properties. The so-called national panel was a <b>balanced</b> national <b>quota</b> sampling of about 300 families. After the two-week use period, the written responses to questionnaires were tallied. Data were compared for 89 local families of 403 persons and 249 national families of 832 persons. The two sets of data showed virtually complete parallels in terms of over-all prefer-ence, hedonic scoring, and the correlation of flavor preference with over-all preference...|$|R

The DCE in this study focuses {{on the nature of}} the employment contract and pays particular attention to preferences over geographical location. The study focuses specifically on how the characteristics and selection criteria of the teacher trainees affect preferences. While some of the trainees have been competitively selected, gender <b>balance</b> and <b>quotas</b> for those with a low caste background also determine selection. Additionally, approximately half of the trainees were selected from a pool of current contract teachers (para-teachers). 2 Here, these trainees are examined to gain further insights on the preferences of teachers who are local to rural areas. The results also provide estimates of the monetary compensation needed to attract teachers to remote schools.|$|R

We examine harvesting behavior, at-sea discards and economic performance under various <b>quota</b> <b>balancing</b> mechanisms [...] provisions intended to help fishermen match random catches with quota holdings [...] in a multiple species fishery. We show that regulations that allow frictionless quota trading reduce at at-sea discards and increase economic performance. Regulations that offer fishermen flexibility to choose the mix of species landed do not eliminate discards, and can create unintended management problems. Our results provide new insights for improving the design quota-managed fisheries...|$|R
40|$|To {{deal with}} the {{tensions}} created by ethnic diversity and inequalities, many African countries have instituted affirmative action programmes ranging from informal ethnic <b>balancing</b> to explicit <b>quotas.</b> This study examines the reasons for affirmative action in Nigeria {{and the effectiveness of}} the Federal Character Commission (FCC) that was set up to oversee the programme. It argues that the affirmative action is an important aspect of governance in divided societies. Furthermore, while the FCC has not succeeded in achieving its formal objectives, it has nevertheless encouraged the non-violent resolution of ethnic grievances.

40|$|The dynamic {{efficiency}} of closures in bioeconomic systems depends upon stock levels and in situ values that evolve over time, and on relative costs of implementation. A {{model of a}} harvested metapopulation is presented in which second-best reduction of harvest from open-access levels using input <b>quotas</b> <b>balances</b> monitoring costs against dynamic benefits of mitigating overharvesting. Temporary or permanent closures—though generally still second best—are preferable to quotas under certain conditions, as demonstrated for a representative patch and time period. Interactions between patches are discussed. Numerical solutions illustrate comparative dynamics of closure use, and show their potential benefits in a dynamic regulatory path.

40|$|Increasing {{concern has}} been {{expressed}} by both scholars and officials about political bias and influence in the IMF. This is seen as threatening {{the effectiveness of the}} institution. But how can the problem be resolved? One way would be to try to create greater political <b>balance</b> by changing <b>quotas</b> and therefore voting rights. In limited form, this is the approach that was adopted at the Fund’s Annual Meetings in Singapore in September 2006. The article critically examines this option. It goes on to explore the idea of granting greater independence to the Fund. Although far from straightforward, it may be sensible for policy to begin to work towards this objective. However, IMF independence would also force the world to decide what purposes the Fund should fulfil and what instruments it would need in order to fit these purposes. ...|$|R
40|$|Our study {{determines the}} {{competitive}} {{positions of the}} dairy sectors of Hungary and the other European Union (EU) Member States {{in the light of}} the abolition of the milk quota. We analyse the recent market positions of the EU Member States, the changes in the relationships between global, EU and Hungarian milk procurement prices, and the medium-term forecasts for the international markets for milk and milk products, including the results of our own model. In most Member States, milk production is below the quota level, although the most competitive countries are paying substantial penalties for excess production. The medium-term projections and the price relationships underline the fact that, due to the liberalisation of the milk market and the rapid rise in global demand, the impacts of global market developments in the EU will be further enhanced. Owing to sustained international demand, the EU’s export opportunities will improve, reducing the pressure on the internal market, and this will have a spill over effect on Hungarian milk prices. Although in terms of trade <b>balance</b> and <b>quota</b> utilisation Hungary is one of the least competitive Member States, the concentration, modernisation and selection processes that have taken place in the country’s dairy sector in recent years could, taking into account the favourable medium-term market forecasts, result in a slight increase in milk production levels. Thus, in contrast to the European Commission’s projection, according to our profitability based model projection the Hungarian dairy herd and milk production are expected to increase slightly during the period 2016 - 2020...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds free {{companies}} of building infrastructures dimensioned for peak service demand {{and allow them}} to only pay for the resources they actually use. Being a PaaS cloud customer, on the one hand, o↵ers a company the opportunity to provide applications in a dynamically scalable way. On the other hand, this scalability may lead to financial loss due to costly use of vast amounts of resources caused by program errors, attacks, or careless use. To limit the e↵ects of involuntary resource usage, we present DQMP, a decentralized, fault-tolerant, and scalable quota-enforcement protocol. It allows customers to buy a fixed amount of resources (e. g., CPU cycles) that can be used flexibly within the cloud. DQMP utilizes the concept of di↵usion to equally <b>balance</b> unused resource <b>quotas</b> over all processes running applications of the same customer. This enables the enforcement of upper bounds while being highly adaptive to all kinds of resourcedemand changes. Our evaluation shows that our protocol outperforms a lease-based centralized implementation in a setting with 1, 000 processes. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{fisheries}} managed using individual transferable quotas (ITQs) it {{is generally}} assumed that quota markets are well-functioning, allowing quota to flow on either a temporary or permanent basis to those able to make best use of it. However, despite {{an increasing number of}} fisheries being managed under ITQs, empirical assessments of the quota markets that have actually evolved in these fisheries remain scarce. The Queensland Coral Reef Fin-Fish Fishery (CRFFF) on the Great Barrier Reef has been managed under a system of ITQs since 2004. Data on individual quota holdings and trades for the period 2004 - 2012 were used to assess the CRFFF quota market and its evolution through time. Network analysis was applied to assess market structure and the nature of lease-trading relationships. An assessment of market participants' abilities to <b>balance</b> their <b>quota</b> accounts, i. e., gap analysis, provided insights into market functionality and how this may have changed in the period observed. Trends in ownership and trade were determined, and market participants were identified as belonging to one out of a set of seven generalized types. The emergence of groups such as investors and lease-dependent fishers is clear. In 2011 - 2012, 41 % of coral trout quota was owned by participants that did not fish it, and 64 % of total coral trout landings were made by fishers that owned only 10 % of the quota. Quota brokers emerged whose influence on the market varied with the bioeconomic conditions of the fishery. Throughout the study period some quota was found to remain inactive, implying potential market inefficiencies. Contribution to this inactivity appeared asymmetrical, with most residing in the hands of smaller quota holders. The importance of transaction costs in the operation of the quota market and the inequalities that may result are discussed in light of these findings...|$|R
