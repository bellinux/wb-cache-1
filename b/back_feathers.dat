5|$|While it is {{structurally}} {{similar to}} the Cotinga species, the purple-throated cotinga differs from them in {{that it has a}} heavier, stubbier bill, distinctive pale fringing on the <b>back</b> <b>feathers,</b> and barred underparts in the female. While it is still generally considered to be closely related to the Cotinga species, recent molecular analysis has suggested that the species may in fact form a separate clade with other canopy-dwelling cotingas, specifically the neotropical bellbirds of the genus Procnias, the cotingas of the genus Carpodectes, the black-faced cotinga of the monotypic genus Conioptilon, and the bare-necked fruitcrow of the monotypic genus Gymnoderus. Of these genera, the molecular analysis suggested that the purple-throated cotinga was most closely related to the neotropical bellbirds. This cotinga does not have a recognized subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their <b>back</b> <b>feathers,</b> although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as quails and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
25|$|Immature birds differ {{little from}} adults; they have lighter margins to the <b>back</b> <b>feathers,</b> {{producing}} a scalloped effect. The light {{parts of the}} plumage are almost white, paler than in adults; the unfeathered parts are also paler. Nestlings are covered in peculiarly dense down, reminiscent of a duckling's; they are generally brownish buff, darker above, and already show the blackish facial marks of the adults.|$|E

500|$|The ruff {{normally}} feeds using {{a steady}} walk and pecking action, selecting food items by sight, {{but it will}} also wade deeply and submerge its head. On saline lakes in East Africa it often swims like a phalarope, picking items off the surface. It will feed at night as well as during the day. It is thought that Ruff use both visual and auditory cues to find prey. [...] When feeding, the ruff frequently raises its <b>back</b> <b>feathers,</b> producing a loose pointed peak on the back; this habit is shared only by the black-tailed godwit.|$|E
500|$|Like other fairywrens, male red-winged fairywrens {{have been}} {{observed}} carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females {{as part of a}} courtship ritual. In this species, the petals that have been recorded have been yellow or, rarely, white. Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren's own, or another's, territory. The [...] "face fan" [...] display is commonly seen as a part of aggressive or sexual display behaviours; it involves the flaring of the blue ear tufts by erecting the feathers. The silvery blue upper <b>back</b> <b>feathers</b> are also used more prominently in display than other species.|$|E
500|$|The Buckeye male weighs {{an average}} of , and the hen [...] The breed has yellow skin and lays brown eggs. Its primary color is a {{mahogany}} red with black tails; sometimes males have other dark feathering. According to the breed standard, a Buckeye's plumage should ideally resemble the hue of an Ohio Buckeye's seeds. Especially in the hen, the breed is very similar in appearance to the Rhode Island Red. The Buckeye can be differentiated by a bar of slate color on the <b>back</b> <b>feathers</b> close to the body; the body is also much more compact, with a short yet broad back.|$|E

500|$|The grey jay is a {{relatively}} large songbird, though smaller than other jays. A typical adult grey jay is between [...] long. Its wingspan is around [...] It weighs about [...] Adults have medium grey <b>back</b> <b>feathers</b> with a lighter grey underside. Its head is mostly white with a dark grey or black nape and hood, with a short black beak and dark eyes. The long tail is medium grey with lighter tips. The legs and feet are black. The plumage is thick, providing insulation in the bird's cold native habitat. Like most corvids, grey jays are not sexually dimorphic, but males are slightly larger than females. Juveniles are initially coloured very dark grey all over, gaining adult plumage after a first moult in July or August. The average lifespan of territory-owning grey jays is eight years; the oldest known grey jay banded and recaptured in the wild was at least 17 years old.|$|E
500|$|The common {{starling}} is [...] long, with a wingspan of [...] and {{a weight}} of [...] Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is [...] and the tarsus is [...] The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted {{than those of}} adult females {{at a given time}} of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and <b>back</b> <b>feathers),</b> which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, icterids or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.|$|E
2500|$|They {{are large}} ducks, with the males about [...] long, and {{weighing}} up to [...] Females are considerably smaller, and only grow to , {{roughly half the}} males' size. The bird is predominantly black and white, with the <b>back</b> <b>feathers</b> being iridescent and glossy in males, while the females are more drab. The amount of white on the neck and head is variable, {{as well as the}} bill, which can be yellow, pink, black, or any mixture of these. They may have white patches or bars on the wings, which become more noticeable during flight. Both sexes have pink or red wattles around the bill, those of the male being larger and more brightly colored.|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} select {{representative}} traits from phenotypic variability between broiler chicken grandparent lines using cluster analysis. Chicks from four dam lines and two sire lines of broiler grandparents were housed to assess performance traits (body weight, eviscerated carcass yield, breast yield and leg yield) and morphometric traits (<b>back</b> and leg <b>feathering),</b> which {{were used to}} calculate the Mahalanobis` distance, between chicken line pairwise. Phenograms were obtained based on those distances using UPGMA method in cluster analysis. The smallest relative contribution of traits for divergence between chicken lines was assessed to eliminate them. Body weight at 35 days, all carcass traits and <b>back</b> <b>feathering</b> at 28 days were the most representative traits to explain phenotypic variability between chicken lines. From observed clusters and the largest heterogeneity between chicken lines from different clusters, crosses between sire lines SL 1 and SL 2 with dam lines DL 3 and DL 4 might result in strain combinations with the largest heterosis. Cluster analysis on performance and morphometric traits is suitable to study phenotypic variability between broiler chicken grandparent lines. We suggest analyzing data from poultry breeding using cluster analysis...|$|R

60|$|There {{were four}} wet and weary {{men in the}} Siwash canoe that Nasmyth, who {{crouched}} astern, had just shot across the whirling pool with the <b>back</b> <b>feathering</b> stroke of his paddle which is so difficult to acquire. Tom from Mattawa, grasping a dripping pole, stood up in the bow. Gordon and Wheeler, the pulp-mill manager, knelt {{in the middle of}} the boat. Wheeler's hands were blistered from gripping the paddle-haft, and his knees were raw, where he had pressed them against the bottom of the craft to obtain a purchase. It was several years since he had undertaken any severe manual labour, though he was by no means unused to it, and he was cramped and aching in every limb. He had plied pole or paddle for eight hours, during which his companions had painfully propelled the craft a few miles into the cañon. He gasped with relief when Mattawa ran the bow of the canoe in upon the shingle, and then rose and stretched himself wearily. The four men stepped ashore. Curiously they looked about them, for they had had little opportunity for observation. Those who undertake to pole a canoe up the rapids of a river on the Pacific slope usually find it advisable to confine their attention strictly to the business in hand.|$|R
50|$|Feather pecking is not aggression.
