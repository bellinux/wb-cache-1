5|$|Although Sir Flinders {{himself did}} not join the {{expedition}} in 1929, he sent Olga {{with a group of}} other archaeologists to Qau, where they spent two months recording the reliefs from the tombs of the ancient rulers. She and a few colleagues, including Gerald Lankester Harding, then joined the season's primary expedition, which was <b>being</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> James Leslie Starkey at the Tell Far'a tomb group in Palestine. During the time she would not only supervise the work of a team, but also ran an evening clinic for the Arab workers and families, as well as other local people. In all, she would help up to forty people per day with minor injuries or upset stomachs. Sir Flinders joined the group in 1930 and after reviewing Olga's work, allowed her to publish it under her own name. In 1931, during the Petrie expedition to Tell el-'Ajjul, Olga discovered a Hyksos tomb which included a horse burial.|$|E

5|$|Lenin {{proposed}} a three-month armistice in his Decree on Peace of November 1917, which {{was approved by}} the Second Congress of Soviets and presented to the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. The Germans responded positively, viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} focus on the Western Front and stave off looming defeat. In November, armistice talks began at Brest-Litovsk, the headquarters of the German high command on the Eastern Front, with the Russian delegation <b>being</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Trotsky and Adolph Joffe. Meanwhile, a ceasefire until January was agreed. During negotiations, the Germans insisted on keeping their wartime conquests – which included Poland, Lithuania, and Courland – whereas the Russians countered that this was a violation of these nations' rights to self-determination. Some Bolsheviks had expressed hopes of dragging out negotiations until proletarian revolution broke out throughout Europe. On 7 January 1918, Trotsky returned from Brest-Litovsk to St. Petersburg with an ultimatum from the Central Powers: either Russia accept Germany's territorial demands or the war would resume.|$|E
5|$|The dignitaries and canons {{constituted}} the chapter {{and had the}} primary role of aiding the bishop in the governance of the diocese. Often the bishop was the titular head of the chapter only and was excluded from its decision-making processes, the chapter <b>being</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> the dean as its superior. As the diocese of Moray based its constitution on that of Lincoln Cathedral, the bishop was allowed to participate within the chapter but only as an ordinary canon. Moray was not unique in this: the bishops of Aberdeen, Brechin, Caithness, Orkney and Ross were also canons in their own chapters. Each morning, the canons held a meeting in the chapterhouse where a chapter from the canonical rule book of St Benedict was read before {{the business of the}} day was discussed.|$|E
5|$|Tuyen's group {{ended up}} <b>being</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Thảo but his initial coup plans were shelved when American CIA agent Lucien Conein {{instructed}} Thảo's superior, General Khiêm, {{to stop the}} coup {{on the grounds that}} it was premature. Thảo's motivation for involvement in the plotting is generally attributed to communist instructions for him to cause infighting within the ARVN whenever possible. He resumed plotting, intending to stage the coup on 24 October. He had recruited various infantry, marine and paratroop units for his scheme, totalling 3,000 men. Thảo's group did not carry out the coup after senior generals persuaded him to integrate his forces into their larger group, which was more likely to succeed. Thảo reasoned that aligning himself with a group of officers that were likely to successful would yield more influence in the resulting junta. The coup was successfully executed on 1 November 1963 under the leadership of Generals Dương Văn Minh and Trần Văn Đôn.|$|E

5|$|By midday, {{the crowds}} {{returned}} around St. Philip Neri's Church. General George Cadwalader ordered the crowds to disperse, {{but they did}} not. By the evening, the sheriff had arrived with a 150-strong posse. Throughout the evening, the military presence grew, and three cannons were stationed on the streets. The soldiers cleared the streets near the church, despite being pelted with rocks by the mob. In response to the rock throwers, General Cadwalader ordered a cannon to be fired at the crowd on Third Street. A man named Charles Naylor begged the general not to fire; he and several others were arrested and held within the church. By the morning of July 7, most of the soldiers had left, but the crowds returned, <b>being</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> an alderman and the sheriff, and demanded that the remaining guard release Naylor. Everyone except Naylor was released. The crowds grew, and a cannon was brought from a nearby wharf and used to threaten the church. After further negotiations, Naylor was released and carried home to cheers on people's shoulders.|$|E
5|$|Similar to his {{previous}} {{three years at}} Marseille, Nasri began the new season under new management as the club was now <b>being</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> the Belgian Eric Gerets. Due to the departure of Ribéry to Bayern Munich, Gerets installed Nasri as {{the focal point of}} the attack and he responding by having his best season at the club. He appeared in 42 total matches scoring a career-high six goals and also assisting on a career-high 15 goals. Nasri formed partnerships in the midfield with winger Mathieu Valbuena and midfielders Lorik Cana and Benoît Cheyrou as Marseille boasted the third-best attack in the league behind champions Lyon and Bordeaux, who finished first and second in the league respectively. Initially, Nasri struggled during the infancy of the campaign due to dealing with the effects of a severely sprained ankle suffered in the pre-season. He failed to score a goal or provide an assist in the team's first eight league matches. On 24 November 2007, he assisted on two goals in a 2–0 victory over Metz. Nasri closed out the fall season by assisting on the equalizing goal in a 2–2 draw with Bordeaux and making the final pass on the match-winning goal against Le Mans.|$|E

5|$|The 1920s saw high {{inflation}} and large public deficits. Several public committees were created solely to cut costs. One such proposal {{was to build}} a road to Flåm, with the proposal <b>being</b> <b>led</b> <b>by</b> Hans Kristian Seip, who was director of Bergen Public Road Administration. In 1925, following the appointment of Mowinckel's First Cabinet, it was proposed that the railway be built as a road, and the tracks laid later. One of NSB's board members proposed instead building a suspended railway. The plans to cancel the railway were stopped because of parliamentarian support for the railway. Part of the political support was because there was agreement on a national railway plan, and removing parts of it would disrupt the geographical compromise. However, Parliament did vote {{to reduce the number}} of intermediate stations to one, which would allow trains to meet at Berekvam. The cost saving for a road was estimated at 30 percent. The issue of a road was taken up in a new vote in Parliament in 1927, but was again rejected.|$|E
5|$|The Allied advance quickly {{ran into}} trouble. The {{reconnaissance}} squadron was ambushed by the northern flank of Krafft's blocking line and withdrew. The 1st and 3rd Parachute Battalions were also stalled by Krafft's defences {{and spent the}} rest of the day skirting his line. The 3rd Parachute Battalion went south and halted in Oosterbeek for most of the night while 1st Parachute Battalion went further north but hit Spindler's forces and was unable to reach the Arnhem-Ede road of Leopard route. Instead Dobie decided to abandon his plan and help Frost at the bridge and the battalion headed south into Oosterbeek overnight. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion was largely unopposed, bypassing the defences that did not as yet reach down as far as the river. They were slowed by cheering Dutch civilians and did not reach the bridges until late in the day. The railway bridge was blown by German engineers as the Allies approached it and the pontoon bridge was missing its central section. At dusk, the men of A Company under Major Digby Tatham-Warter observed Gräbner's force cross the bridge. Most of the battalion and various other supporting units—including two jeeps of Gough's squadron, four 6-pounder anti-tank guns, Brigade HQ (but without Lathbury), and Royal Engineers (in total numbering about 740 men)— moved into Arnhem centre as night fell and owing to the oversight in German orders were able to secure the undefended northern end of the road bridge.
