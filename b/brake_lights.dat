5|$|Later that year, Rindt drove, {{again in}} a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 {{kilometre}} race at Zeltweg. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of Mike Parkes owing to a special lever that manually activated the <b>brake</b> <b>lights.</b> Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes to brake earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.|$|E

40|$|Rear-end {{collisions}} {{comprise a}} large proportion of all vehicle crashes. A variant of the standard centre high mounted stop light (CHMSL) that flashes under conditions of heavy braking was developed to reduce the incidence and severity of rear-end collisions. The developer of the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> commissioned MUARC to conduct a driving simulator evaluation of the effectiveness of the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light.</b> Forty-two participants completed a series of simulator drives that were designed to examine whether participants’ braking performance under certain conditions was more effective in response to a heavily braking vehicle fitted with the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> compared with a heavily braking vehicle fitted with a standard CHMSL. Among other things, it was found that, relative to the CHMSL condition, participants reacted by braking in a shorter time at an intermediate headway to the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light,</b> and <b>braked</b> harder in response to the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> at both a near and intermediate headway. The results suggest that the Heavy <b>Braking</b> <b>Light</b> is a device that, through widespread use, may contribute to a reduction in the incidence and severity of rear-end collisions...|$|R

Sergeant Darisse then began following Vasquez. Vasquez eventually slowed his car when approaching a slower-moving vehicle, and Sergeant Darisse observed the car's right rear <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> hadn't turned on. Sergeant Darisse {{believed that it was}} a violation of North Carolina traffic law to drive a vehicle with a broken <b>brake</b> <b>light,</b> so he activated his blue lights and stopped Vasquez (observing that as he did so, the right <b>brake</b> <b>light</b> [...] "flickered on"). Sergeant Darisse informed Vasquez and Heien that he had stopped them for a broken <b>brake</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R

25|$|Externally, the S50-1 was {{installed}} with rounded <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> and integrated tail lights, with a centrally installed turn signal, similar in appearance to the Ford Galaxie of 1960.

25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> from rear position lights and turn signal lights.|$|E

25|$|It {{should also}} be noted that UK {{legislation}} considers all lights, reflectors and reflective material to be lights, and all items resembling special warning beacons (of any color) must be covered and not just disconnected (as this is a separate offence) while on the public highway. Similarly, no distinction is made between lights mounted on light bars and those mounted anywhere else on the vehicle (e.g. headlights, indicators, <b>brake</b> <b>lights)</b> - all are covered by the same regulations.|$|E

25|$|The R31 Skyline {{was also}} {{produced}} in Australia, with a 3.0L motor (RB30E) available in sedan or wagon form, {{as well as}} a four-cylinder version called the Nissan Pintara. The wagon had the same front style as the coupe and sedan—the only difference being that it lacked the four round <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> that had been a consistent element of Skyline design (except for the R31 series one/two which had rectangular taillights with a solid bar through the centre which was also shared by the Pintara). These cars were manufactured in Australia due to the heavy import laws which made it expensive to bring cars into Australia.|$|E
25|$|Cars are {{typically}} fitted with multiple types of lights. These include headlights, {{which are used}} to illuminate the way ahead and make the car visible to other users, so that the vehicle can be used at night; in some jurisdictions, daytime running lights; red <b>brake</b> <b>lights</b> to indicate when the brakes are applied; amber turn signal lights to indicate the turn intentions of the driver; white-coloured reverse lights to illuminate the area behind the car (and indicate that the driver will be or is reversing); and on some vehicles, additional lights (e.g., side marker lights) to increase the visibility of the car. Interior lights on {{the ceiling of the}} car are usually fitted for the driver and passengers. Some vehicles also have a trunk light and, more rarely, an engine compartment light.|$|E
