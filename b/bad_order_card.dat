During each turn, players alternate playing cards from their hands. There are Order and Special <b>Order</b> <b>cards</b> <b>Order</b> <b>cards</b> allow a player to activate a number of units on a specified section -left flank, center, or right flank.

Attacks are made by rolling a number of dice, depending on the attacking unit and any defensive terrain. Each six-sided die is labeled with each unit symbol; if the rolled symbol matches the target's unit type, a single figure is removed. A flag roll on the die forces the unit to retreat one square.|$|R

40|$|Obesity in {{children}} is a nationwide problem. Physical activity {{is one way to}} help children stay fit and prevent obesity. Unfortunately, access to technology involving sedentary behavior is easier than ever. Fortunately, for this generation of students {{there is a way to}} combine physical activity and technology through exergaming. In order to encourage students to participate in exergaming, the students should be able to play games they prefer. The purpose of this study was to apply a paired choice preference assessment, rank <b>order</b> <b>card</b> sort, and social validity surveys to determine the preference order of six exergames for six elementary students and measure heart rates as the children played the six exergames. The results of this study show that children had different preferences as evident by the rank <b>order</b> <b>card</b> sort, social validity survey, and paired choice preference assessment. The pre-rank <b>order</b> <b>card</b> sort was significantly correlated with the paired choice assessment. On the other hand, the pre-social validity survey was not significantly correlated with the paired choice assessment...|$|R

Forwarded from one foreman to another through departments until fully checked off, the <b>order</b> <b>card</b> recycled to the office.Metcalfe also issued each worker bound pads of service cards, printed with his name, hourly rate of pay, and payroll number.

40|$|ABSTRACT [...] We {{know that}} binary {{decision}} diagram is a data structure {{that is used}} to store a Boolean function. They are used to find out the terminal reliability of a computer communication network. To generate the binary decision diagram of a given computer communication network, we need to order the edges of the given computer communication network because the size of the binary decision diagram is dependent on the ordering of the variables (edges). There are three types of variable ordering; optimal, good and <b>bad</b> <b>ordering.</b> Optimal ordering are those ordering which generate minimum size binary decision diagram. In this paper we have shown that if a directed computer communication network has m disjoints min-paths then m! optimal variable orderings exist to generate the binary decision diagrams of the given computer communication network...|$|R
