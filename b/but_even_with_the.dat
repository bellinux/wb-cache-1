25|$|Expansion {{continued}} into the third century AD, pushing the borders of viticulture beyond {{the areas of the}} holm oak to places such as Bordeaux in Aquitania and Burgundy, where the more marginal climate included wet, cold summers that might not produce a harvest each year. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> risk of an occasional lost harvest, the continuing demand for wine among the Roman and native inhabitants of Gaul made the proposition of viticulture a lucrative endeavor. By the 6th century AD, vines were planted throughout Gaul including the Loire Valley, the Île-de-France (Paris Basin) which included the areas of modern-day Champagne, as well as Brittany.|$|E

25|$|When {{the monarchy}} was {{restored}} in 1660, theatres re-opened. Early {{interpretations of the}} play, from the late 17th to early 18th century, typically showed Prince Hamlet as a heroic figure. Critics responded to Hamlet {{in terms of the}} same dichotomy that shaped all responses to Shakespeare during the period. On the one hand, Shakespeare was seen as primitive and untutored, both in comparison to later English dramatists such as Fletcher and especially when measured against the neoclassical ideals of art brought back from France with the Restoration. On the other, Shakespeare remained popular not just with mass audiences <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> very critics made uncomfortable by his ignorance of Aristotle's unities and decorum.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} the first humans to arrive {{in the area that}} would become Maryland {{appeared}} around the 10th millennium BC, about the time that the last ice age ended. They were hunter-gatherers organized into semi-nomadic bands. They adapted as the region's environment changed, developing the spear for hunting as smaller animals, like deer, became more prevalent, and by about 1500 BC oysters had become an important food resource in the region. With the increased variety of food sources, Native American villages and settlements started appearing and their social structures increased in complexity. By about 1000 BC pottery was being produced. With the eventual rise of agriculture more permanent Native-American villages were built. <b>But</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advent of farming, hunting and fishing were still important means of obtaining food. The bow and arrow were first used for hunting in the area around the year 800. They ate what they could kill, grow or catch in the rivers and other waterways.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{most common}} {{criticism}} is the {{heavy emphasis on}} sailing, especially later in the game when Link must trek around the ocean to collect Triforce pieces. GameSpot wrote that while the main quest [...] "starts out in a very brisk manner", by {{the last third of}} the game, the [...] "focus on sailing ... is pretty tedious". Edge wrote that the sailing was [...] "convincingly organic", <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> warp feature, [...] "there remains an awful lot of relatively dull seafaring activity". Others complained about having to use the Wind Waker so frequently to change wind direction. IGN wrote that using the device became [...] "a tedious nuisance", and that the inability to skip the accompanying animation was [...] "more bothersome still". Some reviewers enjoyed the sailing; two Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewers appreciated the combat, exploration, and side quests available at sea. Another common criticism was the game's comparatively low level of difficulty. IGN wrote that once the player added enough hearts to Link's health meter, [...] "he becomes nearly invincible, which is a true shortcoming as far as we concerned".|$|E

However, some members of that group wanted to oppose the Flushing line's construction if there {{was not going to be}} an extension to Whitestone. After the January 20 vote to demand that the subway line through Flushing be built underground, groups representing communities in south Flushing collaborated to push for an elevated along what was then the LIRR's Central Branch, in the current right-of-way of Kissena Corridor Park. Eleven days later, the PSC announced its intent to extend the line as an el from Corona to Flushing, with a possible further extension to Little Neck Bay in Bayside.

2500|$|The initial {{idea for}} a video game {{adaptation}} of Blade Runner came from The Blade Runner Partnership (composed of Bud Yorkin and Jerry Perenchio of Tandem Productions). They originally approached Electronic Arts, Sierra and Activision, before Virgin Interactive agreed to take the project on. However, {{the rights to the}} film were spread out over several entities, each of whom owned a different aspect, making production of the game complex from a copyright perspective; The Ladd Company owned North American distribution rights to the film; Run Run Shaw owned international distribution rights; and The Blade Runner Partnership owned all ancillary rights, and were the bond guarantors, who had taken control of the film when it went over-budget and over-schedule towards the end of production. As a result, sorting out the rights took several years before Virgin were in a position to actually begin development.

2500|$|Texas has {{a long-standing}} rivalry with the University of Oklahoma. The {{football}} {{game between the}} University of Texas and Oklahoma {{is commonly known as}} the [...] "Red River Rivalry" [...] and is held annually in Dallas, Texas at the Cotton Bowl. Dallas is used as a [...] "neutral site" [...] since it is approximately midway between the two campuses. [...] The stadium is split, with each team having an equal number of supporters {{on each side of the}} 50yard line. [...] Texas state flags fly around the Longhorn end of the stadium and Oklahoma state flags fly around the Sooner end. [...] This border rivalry is often considered to be one of the top five current rivalries in the NCAA. [...] The Red River Shootout originated in 1900, while Oklahoma was still a territory of the United States, and it is the longest-running college-football rivalry played on a neutral field. Since 2005, the football game has received sponsorship dollars in return for being referred to as the [...] "SBC Red River Rivalry" [...] (changed to AT Red River Rivalry in 2006 after SBC merged with AT), a move which has been criticized both for its commercialism and its political correctness. [...] The University of Texas holds its annual Torchlight Parade during the week of the Red River Rivalry. In recent years, this rivalry has taken on added significance, since both football programs have been highly ranked and compete in the same division of the Big 12 conference. In 2005, the Dallas Morning News did an opinion poll of the 119 Division 1A football coaches as to the nations top rivalry game in college football. [...] The Texas-OU game was ranked third. The game typically has conference or even national significance. Since 1945, one or both of the two teams has been ranked among the top 25 teams in the nation coming into 60 out of 65 games. Twice Texas has defeated the Sooners a record eight straight times from 1940–1947 and 1958–1965. [...] One of the most significant meetings was in 1963 with Oklahoma ranked No. 1 and Texas ranked No. 2, the game won by Texas 28–7 en route to their first officially recognized national championship. [...] The series has also had its share of games that came down to the wire and comebacks most recently in 2009 when Texas cemented a 16–13 victory in the fourth quarter over OU. [...] The game has also been the result of controversy. [...] The meeting in 1976 was a heated affair as the Oklahoma staff was accused of spying on Texas' practices, a move later confirmed by former OU head coach Barry Switzer. [...] In the 2008 season Texas scored 45 points over then No. 1 Oklahoma for the win, <b>but</b> <b>even</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> victory Texas would not go on to the Big 12 Championship game due to BCS rankings. Six of the last ten showings featured one of the participants in the BCS National Championship Game (2000, 2003–2005, 2008, 2009), including national titles won by Oklahoma in 2000 and by Texas in 2005. [...] Texas leads the all-time series 61–44–5, with a 49–39–4 edge in Dallas. [...] Texas also holds a 35–32–3 advantage over Oklahoma in the post-modern era.|$|E
