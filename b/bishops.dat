50|$|Hippolytus of Rome was {{a disciple}} of Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp, a disciple of Apostle John. Hippolytus's works were {{considered}} lost {{prior to their}} discovery at a monastery on Mt. Athos in 1854. While his major work The Refutation of All Heresies was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, On the Twelve Apostles of Christ and On the Seventy Apostles of Christ, are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers.

5|$|Today all {{cardinals}} {{are required}} to be <b>bishops,</b> but priests named cardinal at an advanced age often petition the Pope for an exception to this rule.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and the <b>bishops</b> of the kingdom {{disagreed}} on who should be appointed. The <b>bishops</b> insisted {{that it should not}} be a clerk (a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury's monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, and insisted that they alone had the right to elect the archbishop. However, only two <b>bishops</b> in England or Normandy were monks (Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and Serlo, Bishop of Séez), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with the <b>bishops,</b> and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a short list selected by the <b>bishops.</b> Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.|$|E

5|$|Boniface was {{energetic}} {{in defending}} the liberties of his see, and clashed with King Henry over {{the election of}} Henry's clerk Robert Passelewe to the see of Chichester. Robert Grosseteste, the Bishop of Lincoln, had examined Passelewe, and found him unfit for episcopal office, and Boniface then quashed the election in 1244. He was also involved in disputes with the king's half-brothers, especially Aymer de Valence, who was Bishop of Winchester. He also quarrelled with his suffragan <b>bishops,</b> who resented his attempts to supervise their affairs closely. In 1250 Boniface attempted a visitation of his province, and this disturbed his suffragan <b>bishops,</b> who protested that Boniface was taking exorbitant amounts of money during his visits. They appealed to the pope, who reaffirmed the right of Boniface to conduct his visitation, but set a limit on the amount that could be taken from any monastery or church. After the visitation, Boniface left England again, and only returned in 1252, after the pope had decided the bishops' appeal in Boniface's favour. After his return, he continued to assert his rights and settled a number of disputes with his <b>bishops.</b> He secured professions of obedience from all but three of the 37 <b>bishops</b> consecrated during his time as archbishop.

During Cuthbert's time as archbishop he no longer claimed authority over all of Britain, like his predecessor Theodore. Pope Gregory III in 735 had sent a pallium to the bishop of York, raising the see of York {{to the status of}} an archbishopric.

In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing {{the origin of the}} Polish statehood, but the display of the Polish Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic prelates in the Vatican and elsewhere.
