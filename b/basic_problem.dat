25|$|The plot {{generally}} {{begins with}} a <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> that the characters must overcome.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the knapsack problem that have arisen from the vast number of applications of the <b>basic</b> <b>problem.</b> The main variations occur by changing the number of some problem parameter such {{as the number of}} items, number of objectives, or even the number of knapsacks.|$|E
25|$|Retaining {{literacy}} {{was as much}} {{a problem}} as acquiring it, particularly among the rural population. Literacy rates declined between 1966 and 1976.

25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> is {{that the}} {{constructor}} is a peculiar function; when it starts off, there is no object, only raw memory. And {{by the time it}} finishes, you have a fully initialized object. Therefore, i) The constructor cannot be called on an object ii) However, it needs to access (and initialize) non-static members. This makes calling the constructor directly an error. The solution is the placement form of operator new.|$|E
25|$|It is because, {{a nation}} which shared blood and history is clear, {{and just like}} my body can't be another's, the reason that a certain nation can't become another {{is the same as}} {{brothers}} living in the same house. If two gather and become one, one would be higher and the other lower, so it becomes a <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> that one orders from above, and the other obeys from below.|$|E
25|$|A <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> {{with this}} {{explanation}} is that the Serrano decision and school finance equalization were actually quite popular among California voters. It is true that Californians who voted for Proposition 13 were less likely than other voters to support school finance, but Proposition 13 supporters were not more likely to oppose the Serrano decision, and on average they were typically supportive of both the Serrano decision and of school finance equalization.|$|E

25|$|To limit global {{temperature}} to a hypothetical 2 degrees Celsius rise would demand a 75% decline in carbon emissions in industrial countries by 2050, if {{the population is}} 10 billion in 2050. Across 40 years, this averages to a 2% decrease every year. In 2011, the emissions of energy production continued rising regardless of the consensus of the <b>basic</b> <b>problem.</b> Hypothetically, according to Robert Engelman (Worldwatch institute), {{in order to prevent}} collapse, human civilization would have to stop increasing emissions within a decade regardless of the economy or population (2009).|$|E
25|$|One {{argument}} against Dualism is {{with regard to}} causal interaction. If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism is lack of explanation of how the material and immaterial are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally material—this is the <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> of causal interaction.|$|E
25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> facing {{designers}} of color televisions was this: Sending each {{frame of the}} moving image meant sending three signals, red, green and blue. The sequential systems, like Baird's earlier efforts, sent the three images one after another. In order for motion to appear smooth, images must change at least 16 times a second. To reduce flicker, over 40 frames per second (fps) is mandatory. In sequential systems, each color requires a separate field. For this reason, very high refresh (field) rates were necessary. CBS' system refreshed at 144fps. (Peter Goldmark's CBS team tried several field rates. Within the 6 MHz allowable channel bandwidth, the most acceptable rate was 144 fps. This rate made pictures incompatible with existing systems working at 50 or 60Hz.|$|E

25|$|The {{checks for}} {{responsiveness}} and breathing {{are carried out}} with the person horizontally supine. If unconscious but breathing, the recovery position is appropriate. If not breathing, rescue ventilation is necessary. Drowning can produce a gasping pattern of apnea while the heart is still beating, and ventilation alone may be sufficient, as the heart may be basically healthy, but hypoxic. The airway-breathing-circulation (ABC) sequence should be followed, rather than starting with compressions as is typical in cardiac arrest, as the <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> is lack of oxygen. Five initial breaths are recommended, as the initial ventilation may be difficult because {{of water in the}} airways which can interfere with effective alveolar inflation. Thereafter a sequence of two breaths and 30 chest compressions is recommended, repeated until vital signs are re-established, the rescuers are unable to continue, or advanced life support is available.|$|E
25|$|Astrophysicist Sten Odenwald {{stated that}} the <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> is that through {{intensive}} studies of thousands of detected exoplanets, most of the closest destinations within 50 light years do not yield Earth-like planets in the star's habitable zones. Given the multi-trillion-dollar expense {{of some of the}} proposed technologies, travelers will have to spend up to 200 years traveling at 20% the speed of light to reach the best known destinations. Moreover, once the travelers arrive at their destination (by any means), {{they will not be able}} to travel down to the surface of the target world and set up a colony unless the atmosphere is non-lethal. The prospect of making such a journey, only to spend the rest of the colony's life inside a sealed habitat and venturing outside in a spacesuit, may eliminate many prospective targets from the list.|$|E

25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> with {{estimating}} a gas {{allowance for}} contingencies {{is to decide}} what contingencies to allow for. This is addressed in the risk assessment for the planned dive. A commonly considered contingency is to share gas with another diver from {{the point in the}} dive where the maximum time is needed to reach the surface or other place where more gas is available. It is likely that both divers will have a higher than normal RMV during an assisted ascent as it is a stressful situation. It is prudent to take this into account. The values should be chosen according to recommendations of the code of practice in use or the training agency, but if a higher value is chosen it is unlikely that anyone would object. Recreational divers may have the discretion to use RMV values of their own choice, based on personal experience and informed acceptance of risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} Chinese {{reaction to}} the President's appointment was very favorable, and {{it was evident that}} a man of Marshall's unquestioned personal integrity was essential in the role of mediator. But the <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> proved insoluble. Neither the Nationalists nor the Communists could overcome their distrust of each other: The Nationalist were convinced that the Soviet Union had obstructed the efforts of their government to assume control over Manchuria in spite of the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of August 1945, and that the Chinese Communists were tools of the Soviets The Chinese Communists were suspicious of the Kuomintang, and believed that its aim was the destruction of the party. The Government leaders were unwilling to permit Communist participation in the Government until the Communists had given up their armed forces, while the Communists believed that to do so without guarantees of their legal political status would end in their destruction.|$|E

500|$|The Borodinos {{were the}} most {{numerous}} class of battleships ever built by Russia. Although they were intended to be near duplicates of Tsesarevich, {{as soon as the}} contracts were signed it became clear that they would be quite different from the French-built ship. [...] The <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> facing the navy was that the Borodinos would have heavier engines and larger turrets which would require a designer to build a ship which had the same speed, draft, guns and armor as Tsesarevich, but a greater displacement. [...] The new design was made up by D. V. Skvortsov of the Russian Naval Technical Committee (NTC). [...] He completed his new design in July/August 1898, one month after the original contract had been signed. [...] The new concept was roughly [...] tons heavier and slightly larger and wider than the Tsesarevich.|$|E

[...] Although part-silver Kennedy half dollars were struck in 1970, they were only for collectors and were not put aside for assay. Commissioners could instead test 21,975 dimes and 11,098 quarters, all made from copper-nickel clad, though as the Associated Press, reporting on the 1973 Assay Commission, put it, [...] "a discovery of a bum coin hasn't occurred in years." [...] Only one in every 100,000 clad or silver-clad pieces was put aside for the Assay Commission, and only one in every 200,000 dimes. [...] At the 1974 meeting, one copper-nickel Eisenhower dollar was discovered which weighed [...] below specification; after reference to the rules, the coin was deemed barely within guidelines. [...] Numismatist Charles Logan, in his 1979 article about the impending end of the Assay Commission, stated that this incident pointed out [...] "the <b>basic</b> <b>problem</b> with the annual trial. First, the members were not exactly sure how their job was done, or what the requirements were. [...] Second, they really {{did not want to}} report a fault in the coinage. [...] Finally, even if the one dollar coin had been found faulty, [...] little consequence, except to prompt greater vigilance at the Mint." ...|$|E
