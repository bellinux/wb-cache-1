5|$|Andy Harries {{was born}} in Inverness, Scotland on 7 April 1954 {{and grew up in}} Peterborough, England, {{receiving}} primary education at West Town Primary School until 1961, and secondary education at the public Oakham School. He grew up aspiring to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> correspondent in Vietnam, or an investigative journalist; his idols were Harold Evans, Jon Swain and John Pilger. He left college at the age of 17 with poor A Level results and became a trainee reporter on the Peterborough Evening Telegraph newspaper. His time on the newspaper raised his awareness of politics, and he sought to further his understanding of it by studying at university. He applied to various northern universities to break away from his southern middle-class lifestyle, and was accepted at Hull University.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 he {{made the}} {{decision}} that if there was going to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war,</b> {{he wanted to be a}} fighter pilot, and so immediately joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Within three months Lock had been called up and began flight training. On the outbreak of War in September 1939, as a trained pilot Lock joined the RAF as a sergeant pilot. After further training at No. 6 Flying School RAF Little Rissington, he was commissioned as a pilot officer (service number 81642) and posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick, North Yorkshire, flying Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E

25|$|Wilson was {{promoted}} major general in November 1913. French confided {{that he intended}} to have his own term as CIGS extended by two years to 1918, and to be succeeded by Murray, at which point Wilson was to succeed Murray as sub-CIGS. After a 17 November 1913 meeting of BEF senior officers (French, Haig, Wilson, Paget, Grierson), Wilson privately recorded his concerns at French’s lack of intellect and hoped there would not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> just yet.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, Georgia {{adopted a}} {{strategy}} regarding the reintegration of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The strategy is called Involvement through Cooperation {{and it was}} presented to the international organisations as well as to Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The document says Georgia views peaceful methods as the only way for conflict solution and that there won’t <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> with these regions. It envisions engagement of people of these two regions through education as well as social, economic and business projects, instead of isolation.|$|E

60|$|And is, then, example nothing? It is everything. Example is {{the school}} of mankind, and they will learn at no other. This <b>war</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> against that example. It <b>is</b> not <b>a</b> <b>war</b> for Louis the Eighteenth, or even for the property, virtue, {{fidelity}} of France. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> for George the Third, for Francis the Second, {{and for all the}} dignity, property, honor, virtue, and religion of England, of Germany, and of all nations.|$|R

25|$|In September 2012, Desmond Tutu {{suggested}} that Blair should follow {{the path of}} former African leaders who had been brought before the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman, interviewed on BBC radio, concurred with Tutu's suggestion that there should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> crimes trial. In a statement made in response to Tutu's comments, Blair defended his actions. He was supported by Lord Falconer, who stated that the war had been authorised by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} {{provoked a}} furious outburst in the United States, especially when Germany refused to apologize, instead countering that the destroyer was operating in what Germany considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> zone and had suffered the consequences. The {{sinking of the}} Reuben James did not lead the US to declare war on Germany; it did, however, provide a pretext to officially transfer the US Coast Guard from its peacetime role as {{an arm of the}} US Treasury Department to a wartime function as part of the US Navy. Congress also amended the Neutrality Act to permit the arming of US-registered merchant ships and authorized them to enter European waters {{for the first time since}} 1939.|$|E
25|$|Sacrificial rituals {{among the}} Aztecs and in Mesoamerica, in general, {{must be seen}} in the context of {{religious}} cosmology: sacrifice and death was necessary for the continued existence of the world. Likewise, each part of life had one or more deities associated with it and these had to be paid their dues in order to achieve success. Gods were paid with sacrificial offerings of food, flowers, effigies, and quail. But the larger the effort required of the god, the greater the sacrifice had to be. Blood-fed the gods and kept the sun from falling. For {{some of the most important}} rites, a priest would offer his own blood, by cutting his ears, arms, tongue, thighs, chest or genitals, or offer a human life or even a god's life. The people who were sacrificed came from many segments of society, and might <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> captive, slave, or a member of Aztec society; the sacrifice might also be man or woman, adult or child, noble or commoner.|$|E

500|$|Frémont, {{a career}} army officer, frontiersman and politician, was {{in command of}} the {{military}} Department of the West from July 1861 to October 1861. [...] Although Frémont claimed his proclamation was intended only as a means of deterring secessionists in Missouri, his policy had national repercussions, potentially setting a highly controversial precedent that the Civil War would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> of liberation.|$|E
500|$|Chilembwe {{opposed the}} {{recruitment}} of Nyasa people to fight what he considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> totally unconnected to them. He promoted a form of Christian pacifism and argued {{that the lack of}} civil rights for Africans in the colonial system should exempt them from the duties of military service. In November 1914, following reports of large loss of life during fighting at Karonga, Chilembwe wrote a letter to The Nyasaland Times in Blantyre, explicitly appealing to the colonial authorities not to recruit black troops: ...|$|E
500|$|So-called “war dances” of {{indigenous}} North American tribes {{may also be}} classified as weapon dances. [...] Recent interest in preserving Native American traditions has led to such groups as The Warriors of AniKituhwa, a Cherokee dance group who recreate Cherokee dances, including the war dance, do research and offer dance workshops for their community. A dance such as the Comanche Sun Dance of the 1870s was an invocation of invulnerability to the White Man's bullets; the dance was a preliminary ritual to battle and would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> dance and, hence, a weapon dance.|$|E

500|$|While {{this proved}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> winning formulae, the New Model Army being {{organized}} and politically active {{went on to}} dominate {{the politics of the}} Interregnum and by 1660 was widely disliked. The New Model Army was paid off and disbanded at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. For many decades the excesses of the New Model Army under the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell was a horror story and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army. [...] The militia acts of 1661 and 1662 prevented local authorities from calling up militia and oppressing their own local opponents. Calling up the militia was possible only if the king and local elites agreed to do so.|$|E
500|$|... 1602, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, {{approached}} Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel's Editor in Chief {{with the}} intent for Gaiman {{to work on a}} project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the lines}} between comedy show and news show have blurred, Jon Stewart has come under {{pressure}} in some circles to engage in more serious journalism. Tucker Carlson and Daily Show co-creator Lizz Winstead have chastised Stewart for criticizing politicians and newspeople in his solo segments and then, in interviews with the same people, rarely taking them to task face-to-face. In 2004, Winstead expressed a desire for Stewart to ask harder satirical questions, saying, [...] "When you are interviewing a Richard Perle or a Kissinger, {{if you give them}} a pass, then you become what you are satirizing. You have a war criminal sitting on your couch—to just let him <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> criminal sitting on your couch means you are having to respect some kind of boundary." [...] She has argued that The Daily Show success and access to the youth vote should allow Stewart to press political guests harder without fearing that they will not return to the show. In 2010, Winstead had changed her views, commenting that since 2004, Stewart did some of the hardest-hitting interviews on TV. Stewart said in 2003 that he does not think of himself as a social or media critic and rejects the idea that he has any journalistic role as an interviewer.|$|E

500|$|In 1922, a {{competition}} was {{launched by the}} trustees of the Melbourne Public Library for a mural to commemorate the Great War. Rix Nicholas learned of the competition and quickly prepared and submitted an entry. Three judges, all respected Melbourne academic artists, submitted {{a report to the}} trustees, who met to consider the entries received. The trustees voted six to five to grant the commission to Harold Septimus Power, {{despite the fact that he}} had not fulfilled the conditions of entry; they then withheld the judges' report from publication, decided not to exhibit any of the competition entries, and delayed awarding any prize. One newspaper reported that Rix Nicholas's entry had been one of the top three. Rix Nicholas was furious, as were some former soldiers who wrote letters to newspapers about the incident. Pigot suggests that gender was a factor: [...] "While Rix Nicholas's claim to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> artist was legitimate, the fact that she was a woman meant that she was denied an equal place within the discourse". Later that same year, the Australian War Memorial decided to purchase a work by Rix Nicholas portraying a French woman (titled A Mother of France (1914)), but not to acquire the other work offered, showing an Australian soldier (A Man (1921)); according to Pigot, this reflected the gendered approach taken by institutions, which considered that subjects suitable for portrayal by artists were dependent upon their sex.|$|E
500|$|Jagger {{decided to}} work with the {{architect}} Lionel Pearson, who designed the stone structure of the memorial, and through June and July 1921 the RAWCF and the authorities considered the proposal. Jagger's model was similar to the eventual memorial, but had only two gunners at either end of an oblong memorial; the howitzer on the top was smaller than the eventual version, and pointed sideways, rather than lengthways along the pedestal. In reporting to the committee, Jagger said that he felt strongly that the design should unashamedly focus on the events of the war, noting that it [...] "should in every sense <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> memorial". Jagger explained that the artillery had [...] "terrific power" [...] and was the [...] "last word in force", and that the howitzer he had chosen was the only suitable weapon to symbolise those capabilities. During the design process, the committee presented Jagger with many suggestions. He gladly accepted their advice on technical matters related to artillery procedures and the appearance of the howitzer, but was protective of his artistic independence and would not brook suggestions which he felt would impinge {{on the quality of the}} work. There were concerns on the committee that the design would offend some members of the public, especially women, but the RAWCF eventually voted 50 to 15 in favour of accepting the design and the proposed cost of £25,000. Jagger was formally awarded the contract for the memorial in March 1922.|$|E
500|$|A sajal {{was ranked}} below the ajaw, and {{indicated}} a subservient lord. A sajal would be lord of a second- or third-tier site, answering to an ajaw, who may himself have been subservient to a kalomte. A sajal would often <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> captain or regional governor, and inscriptions often link the sajal title to warfare; {{they are often}} mentioned as the holders of war captives. Sajal meant [...] "feared one". The titles of ah tz'ihb and ah ch'ul hun are both related to scribes. The ah tz'ihb was a royal scribe, usually {{a member of the}} royal family; the ah ch'ul hun was the Keeper of the Holy Books, a title that is closely associated with the ajaw title, indicating that an ajaw always held the ah ch'ul hun title simultaneously. Other courtly titles, the functions of which are not well understood, were yajaw k'ahk ("Lord of Fire"), ti'huun and ti'sakhuun. These last two may be variations on the same title, and Mark Zender has suggested that the holder of this title may have been the spokesman for the ruler. Courtly titles are overwhelmingly male-oriented, and in those relatively rare occasions where they are applied to a woman, they appear to be used as honorifics for female royalty. Titled elites were often associated with particular structures in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of Classic period cities, indicating that such office holders either owned that structure, or that the structure was an important focus for their activities. A lakam was possibly the only non-elite post-holder in the royal court. The lakam was only found in larger sites, and they appear to have been responsible for the taxation of local districts.|$|E
