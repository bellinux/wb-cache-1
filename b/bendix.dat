5|$|CAB {{inspectors}} had inspected {{units at}} a Teterboro, New Jersey, <b>Bendix</b> Corporation plant and discovered workers using tweezers to bind up bundles of wires, thereby damaging them. The <b>Bendix</b> Corporation issued denials, {{stating that the}} units underwent 61 inspections during manufacturing, in addition to inspections during installation and maintenance work, and insisted that had the insulation on the wires been breached at some point, it would have surely been detected and the unit replaced.|$|E

50|$|After {{the series}} {{failed to take}} root, D'Andrea {{returned}} to his role as Jim Gillis on William <b>Bendix's</b> NBC sitcom, The Life of Riley; March became host of CBS's The $64,000 Question.|$|R
50|$|The {{film is a}} Technicolor {{remake of}} King Vidor's {{black-and-white}} film The Texas Rangers (1936), which starred Fred MacMurray in Holden's role, Jack Oakie in William <b>Bendix's,</b> Lloyd Nolan in MacDonald Carey's role, and Jean Parker as the girl they rescue.|$|R
50|$|In several ways, Riley was a {{prototype}} for later blue-collar sitcom protagonists such as blustery, get-rich-quick schemer Ralph Kramden (played, perhaps not coincidentally, by Jackie Gleason) and his animated stone-age counterpart Fred Flintstone; blustery bigot Archie Bunker; benign, bighearted Dan Conner; and King of Queens Doug Heffernan. Perhaps the greatest tribute to The Life of Riley was paid by Married... with Children: Ed O'Neill's language and {{manner of speaking}} as Al Bundy are remarkably similar to <b>Bendix's,</b> and Al's wife, like Riley's, is named Peg. <b>Bendix's</b> Riley, especially, was perhaps too guileless to be the true prototype for this group, but for making blue-collar characters as operable on television as on radio or in film, Chester Riley earned his place in broadcasting history.|$|R
5|$|T1E1 – Another {{prototype}} {{that used}} the <b>Bendix</b> mount on a M2 Half-track Car. It was cancelled in April 1942.|$|E
5|$|In October 1940, {{development}} {{began to}} produce a vehicle {{in response to a}} long-standing requirement for an anti-aircraft vehicle to protect the U.S. Army's mechanized troop convoys from aerial attack. The first vehicle produced {{in the development of a}} half track with an anti-aircraft armament was the T1, which had two M2 machine guns on a <b>Bendix</b> machine gun mountas used on jeepson a 4×4 truck. The T1E1 had a power-operated <b>Bendix</b> mount, and the T1E2 a Maxson mount. The T1E3 had an electro-dynamic Glenn L. Martin Company aircraft-type turret. Evaluation of these test vehicles led to the T1E2 design being preferred. The T1E2 became the M16 Half-track by replacing the M33 with the M45 mount and the M2 Half-track chassis with the M3 Half-track chassis.|$|E
5|$|T1E2 – This variant was {{essentially}} the same as the T1E1 except the <b>Bendix</b> mount was replaced with the M33 Maxson mount. After the M33 was replaced with the M45 Quadmount it was accepted as the M16 Half-track.|$|E
5000|$|Hal March and Tom D'Andrea {{appeared}} on The Colgate Comedy Hour in what subsequently became {{in the summer}} of 1955 the 11-episode NBC live military comedy series, The Soldiers. D'Andrea took leave from his role as Jim Gillis in William <b>Bendix's</b> The Life of Riley for The Soldiers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bendix's</b> {{insanity}} later {{reveals itself}} {{and in a}} fight with Jenny Sparks he is presumably killed. Fahrenheit stays with the team under the new leadership of Jackson King. In later missions, she is forced to kill, though she did not enjoy it. She began a relationship with fellow StormWatch Officer Hellstrike, which violated many Stormwatch rules.|$|R
50|$|Rose {{was meant}} to be a key player in <b>Bendix's</b> plan to {{establish}} his own new world order, but unfortunately The High's 50-year-old dream of a finer world got in the way. While raiding The Changers compound, Rose killed one of the Changers whilst he was in negotiations with Stormwatch Black. Jack Hawksmoor (of Stormwatch Black) then snaps her neck, killing her.|$|R
5|$|Following his Navy service {{he worked}} at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) until 1986 as an {{engineering}} contractor for Allied <b>Bendix</b> Aerospace working on the Deep Space Network project, as well as on several spacecraft projects. During the 1986 Voyager 2 fly-by of Uranus, he worked with the Radio Science Experiment, using the spacecraft carrier signal to deduce information about Uranus’ atmosphere and rings.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from baseball, Neuer became an umpire for local semi-pro and amateur baseball games, {{and worked for}} <b>Bendix</b> Aviation Corporation in Greene, New York until retiring in 1942. As an umpire, he {{was known for his}} entertaining style, adding extra emphasis on his calls to amuse game attendees. Neuer was married twice and had one son, Eugene, from his first marriage. He moved to Northumberland, Pennsylvania in the 1940s, where he lived until his death in 1966.|$|E
5|$|After their wedding, {{the couple}} {{returned}} to Provo, Utah, where Kinne had been attending college, {{but at the}} end of the fall semester, Kinne again put his studies on hold. He and his new wife returned to Independence, where both took jobs—Sharon, babysitting and tending shops, and James as an electrical engineer at <b>Bendix</b> Aviation. Although Sharon claimed to have miscarried the child that had brought about their marriage, she soon became pregnant again. In the fall of 1957, she gave birth to a girl they named Danna.|$|E
5000|$|Sondergaard's work in westerns {{included}} single {{appearances on}} Scott Brady's syndicated Shotgun Slade, Peter Breck's Black Saddle, Dale Robertson's Tales of Wells Fargo, Henry Fonda's and Allen Case's The Deputy, Richard Boone's Have Gun - Will Travel, William <b>Bendix's</b> Overland Trail (as Jack Rance in the 1960 episode [...] "West of Boston"), Clint Eastwood's Rawhide, Robert Horton's A Man Called Shenandoah, and Ralph Taeger's Hondo.|$|R
50|$|Midnighter {{featured}} {{in the first three}} of Garth Ennis's Kev miniseries, featuring Kev Hawkins, a former SAS soldier. Kev was introduced in the semi-parody The Authority: Kev, in which he killed Midnighter, Apollo {{and the rest of the}} Authority, though the Carrier resurrected them. On their last meeting they took down MI5's Royal Oak project, an attempt to replicate <b>Bendix's</b> experiments. Kev later featured without the Authority in the final book of his series, A Man Called Kev.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, Flynn {{achieved}} {{recognition in}} television, earning credits {{as a regular}} on William <b>Bendix's</b> The Life of Riley and on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. He appeared at least twice on NBC's The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. His appearance on March 30, 1961, was a patriotic program set at sea on the United States Navy aircraft carrier , oddly foreshadowing his later role on McHale's Navy. He guest starred on Walter Brennan's ABC sitcom, The Real McCoys and on the syndicated western, Pony Express.|$|R
5|$|During 1960, {{the list}} of {{manufacturers}} planning to build COBOL compilers grew. By September, five more manufacturers had joined CODASYL (<b>Bendix,</b> Control Data Corporation, General Electric (GE), National Cash Register and Philco), and all represented manufacturers had announced COBOL compilers. GE and IBM planned to integrate COBOL into their own languages, GECOM and COMTRAN, respectively. In contrast, International Computers and Tabulators planned to replace their language, CODEL, with COBOL.|$|E
5|$|Operation LANA: To {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary of Naval aviation (L is the Roman numeral for 50 and ANA stood for Anniversary of Naval Aviation) on 24 May 1961, Phantoms flew across the continental United States in under {{three hours and}} included several tanker refuelings. The fastest of the aircraft averaged 869.74mph (1,400.28km/h) and completed the trip in 2hours 47minutes, earning the pilot (and future NASA Astronaut), Lieutenant Richard Gordon, USN and RIO, Lieutenant Bobbie Young, USN, the 1961 <b>Bendix</b> trophy.|$|E
5|$|A {{veteran of}} the Spanish–American War, Neuer worked as a {{brakeman}} before taking up baseball professionally. He played for various minor league teams in 1905 and 1907 before making his debut for the New York Highlanders. With New York, he threw three shutouts in seven games, and was praised by manager Clark Griffith for his pitching ability during that stretch. However, his control deteriorated after that season, {{and over the next}} three years he played for various minor league teams. He retired after 1910 and became an umpire. He then worked at <b>Bendix</b> Aviation until his retirement in 1942.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, Parnell {{began to}} appear on {{television}} in both dramatic shows and situation comedies in roles {{similar to those that}} he had played in films. He portrayed William <b>Bendix's</b> factory foreman [...] "Hank Hawkins" [...] on The Life of Riley, and the character [...] "Bill Anders" [...] on five episodes of the ABC/Warner Brothers western series, Maverick. He appeared on the ABC/WB series, Conflict and The Alaskans, with Roger Moore, and a related NBC even shorter series, Klondike, with James Coburn and Ralph Taeger. He was cast in an episode of the NBC family drama, National Velvet.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was cast}} in eight episodes in {{different}} roles from 1952 to 1957 on The Roy Rogers Show.

40|$|In the 1960 s and 1970 s, Raymond Aron’s Main Currents of Sociological Thought {{introduced}} Tocqueville to {{a generation}} of sociologists alongside Weber, Durkheim and Marx. Granted, Tocqueville {{never made it to}} the inner circle of the sociological canon (that was reserved for the Marx-Durkheim-Weber trio), but Democracy in America was generally acknowledged as a classic in political sociology and {{some of the most important}} sociological works of American sociology in the 1960 s were Tocquevillian in character. Think of Martin Seymour Lipset’s Political Man (1960), or Reinhardt <b>Bendix’s</b> Nation-Building and Citizenship (1964). The late 1960 s mark the peak of Tocqueville’s prestige in sociology. From that point onwards, Tocqueville’s influence and prestige among sociologists begins to decline in such a way that today he is barely mentioned in sociology classrooms. This brings me to the issue I wish to tackle in this paper. Why is Tocqueville dead in sociology today?This research was funded by a British Academy-Leverhulme Small Research Grant (SG 132730) ...|$|R
5|$|The Australian Sea Kings {{had similar}} {{avionics}} {{to that of}} the Sea King HAS.1, with the same ARI 5995 search radar in a dorsal radome, but had American <b>Bendix</b> AN/ASQ-13A dipping sonar instead of the Plessey sonar of the Royal Navy Sea Kings. They also had more powerful engines giving improved high temperature hover performance. Australia's Sea Kings were flown by 817 Squadron RAN from HMAS Melbourne until the carrier was retired from service, without replacement. As the Sea King was too large to operate from the s, 817 Squadron was then forced to operate from land bases, in both ASW and utility roles, with the Sea King relinquishing the anti-submarine mission in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Miller portrayed Piggy in Robert Siodmaks The Rough and the Smooth {{opposite}} Tony Britton, William <b>Bendix</b> and Edward Chapman. He played Dr. Pfeiffer in {{the episode}} Twentieth Century Theatre: The Price of Freedom of the BBC Sunday Night Play. The same year, Miller starred in Michael Powell's psychological horror thriller Peeping Tom, playing {{a doctor who}} the main protagonist (Karlheinz Böhm), a serial killer who murders women while using a portable movie camera fitted with a spike to record their dying expressions of terror, approaches to cure his scopophilia. It was a controversial film {{at the time of}} release with themes of child abuse, sadomasochism and fetishism, although Miller's performance, played comically, stood in contrast to the film's dark themes, and it has since gained a cult following and is now considered a masterpiece.|$|E
5|$|In Hasbrouck Heights, {{the lanes}} split with the <b>Bendix</b> Diner located between the traffic lanes at the {{intersection}} of County Route 40 (Williams Avenue), the last traffic light on Route 17 before the New York state line. At the interchange with U.S. Route 46, which only features access to the eastbound direction of U.S. Route 46, Route 17 drops to two lanes in each direction and continues north with the lanes merging back together as the road interchanges with County Route 55 (Terrace Avenue) at an interchange. The road enters Hackensack with the lanes splitting again for the long interchange with Interstate 80. Along this strip, the road is again three lanes in each direction and includes an interchange with County Route 57 (Summit Avenue), crossing into Lodi. The lanes rejoin upon splitting from Interstate 80 with a lane dropping in each direction at the County Route 56 (Essex Street) interchange on the Maywood border. Route 17 continues north as a congested road through commercial areas, crossing into Rochelle Park where the route interchanges with County Route 62 (Passaic Street) at mile marker 11.46 before entering Paramus.|$|E
2500|$|On May 27, 1861, Gen. Butler sent a force [...] {{north to}} occupy the lightly defended {{adjacent}} town of Newport News at Newport News Point, an excellent anchorage for the Union Navy. This force established and significantly fortified Camp Butler and a battery at Newport News Point that could cover {{the entrance to the}} James River ship canal and the mouth of the Nansemond River. By May 29 Butler's force, which included the 1st Vermont Infantry, Col.

On June 8, 1861, the camp, which was commanded by Col. Phelps of the 1st Vermont Infantry, also was reinforced by the 9th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (Hawkin's Zouaves). Butler also further occupied and expanded Camp Hamilton, started by Col. Dimick in the equally lightly defended, adjacent town of Hampton, just beyond the confines of the fort and within the range of its guns. After Col.
