5000|$|Zebrasoma desjardinii (E. T. Bennett, 1836) - Desjardin's <b>sailfin</b> <b>tang</b> ...|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} one of the largest members of its genus. The largest scientifically {{measured}} <b>sailfin</b> <b>tang</b> was 40.0 cm (15.7 in).|$|R
50|$|The {{body of the}} <b>sailfin</b> <b>tang</b> is {{disc-shaped}} with a much elevated {{dorsal fin}} and a big anal fin. It has an extended snout. Compared to {{the other members of}} the genus Zebrasoma, the <b>sailfin</b> <b>tang</b> has larger but fewer pharyngeal teeth. On each side of the caudal peduncle is a single sharp spine (the so-called scalpel) which is used for defence and to establish dominance. When the fish is not using its scalpel, it is folded down inside a groove.|$|R
5000|$|In {{respect of}} Zebrasoma veliferum, adult Red Sea <b>Sailfin</b> <b>tang</b> {{has a few}} less anal fin rays (22-24 instead of 23-26) and {{different}} marking on the tail. As a juvenile, they are almost indistinguishable in color and markings.|$|R
50|$|Red Sea <b>sailfin</b> <b>tangs</b> {{natively}} live in lagoons and reefs in {{a tropical}} climate. The juvenile fishes {{live in the}} inner reef areas. They prefer saltwater with a specific gravity of 1.020 - 1.025, a pH between 8.1 and 8.4 and an ideal temperature range of 22 - 26 C (72 - 78 F). They may live at water depths of 2 - 30 m (6.5 - 100 ft) or more.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sailfin</b> <b>tang</b> is {{decorated}} with broad, pale yellow bands that alternate with darker bands over its body. The bending extends into both dorsal and anal fins. On the darker bands are yellow dots and stripes. The caudal fin is yellow. The head of the fish is white adorned with yellow dots. A dark band with yellow dots runs across the eye and another dark band with dots is located right behind the eye.|$|R

Some of the animals here include Asian arowana, Bermuda blue angelfish, chocolate chip star, clownfish, common carp, emperor angelfish, gold-spotted spinefoot, honeycomb moray, long-spine porcupinefish, orangespine, unicornfish, orbicular batfish, pangas catfish, queen coris , red-bellied pacu, red-bellied piranha, Red Sea <b>sailfin</b> <b>tang,</b> redtail catfish, redtoothed triggerfish, reef stonefish, Siberian sturgeon, small-spotted catshark, snowflake moray, spotted sailfin suckermouth catfish, spotted unicornfish, tambaqui, Vlamingii tang, white-spotted puffer and zebra moray.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sailfin</b> <b>tang</b> (Zebrasoma veliferum) is {{a marine}} reef tang {{in the fish}} family Acanthuridae. They may live at water depths of 1 - 60 m (3 - 200 ft) or more. The fish grow to a maximum length of 40 cm (15.8 in). It has an {{extensive}} range throughout Oceania, the Indian Ocean, and the South Pacific. Zebrasoma veliferum is a popular fish in the aquarium trade. They are herbivorous fish specializing in filamentous algae. Though their skin is light beige with stripes, it can turn dark brown under stress.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} 2 {{new species}} of Affecauda from the intestine of acanthuroid fishes of the Indo-West Pacific. Affecauda rugosa n. sp. is described from 1 mature specimen in excellent condition and 1 immature fractured specimen from the intestine of the <b>sailfin</b> <b>tang,</b> Zebrasoma veliferum (Acanthuridae), from Noumea, New Caledonia. Affecauda salacia n. sp. is described from the intestine of the ocellated spinefoot, Siganus corallinus (Siganidae), from Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef, Queensland, Australia. Each of these species is made distinct from the type-species, Affecauda annulata Hall & Chambers, 1999, by combinations {{of the extent of}} tegumental annulations, conformation of the oesophagus and position of the ovary. The description of 2 {{new species of}} Affecauda necessitates a revision of the generic diagnosis, which is here amended to incorporate the additional species. A key to species is provided. The description of further species of Affecauda from waters external to the Great Barrier Reef and from siganid fishes expands the biogeographical range for species of Affecauda, from species of Naso on the Great Barrier Reef, to acanthuroid fishes of the western Pacific...|$|R
