5|$|At 22:00 on 12 November Amazone and Elisa sailed from Le Havre {{to unite}} {{with the force}} at Cherbourg, hoping to evade the {{blockade}} in the darkness. They successfully passed the patrolling Diana and Niobe but were spotted sailing northwest at 00:30 by the British ships which gave chase, Niobe turning inshore {{in an attempt to}} cut off the French line of advance. With the wind in the northeast, the French frigates were unable to pass Cape Barfleur under pursuit, and Rosseau instead turned his squadron towards the Iles Saint-Marcouf at 04:00, using superior local knowledge to bypass the pursuing British ships. The heavily fortified islands had been under British control during the French Revolutionary Wars, but reverted to the French at the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Diana and Niobe attempted to intercept the French frigates <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> under the shelter of the guns, but were only able to fire two long-distance broadsides at the trailing Elisa.|$|E
5|$|The Germans had a {{fortified}} base, Stützpunkt Podglavica, near Podglavica in {{the village}} of Prkosi (between Vrtoče and Kulen Vakuf). The base, with about 500 members of the 373rd (Croatian) Infantry Division and an artillery battery, secured the roads from Petrovac to Bihać and Kulen Vakuf. In September 1943, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 10th Krajina Brigade and a battalion of the Drvar–Petrovac Partisan Detachment were directed to attack it. Bursać volunteered to throw hand grenades at the pillboxes and machine-gun nests protecting the base. Although her company commander objected because she still appeared ill, Bursać insisted on throwing the grenades. The three Partisan battalions attacked the base from three directions on 18September at 11pm. Bursać and her group of grenade throwers destroyed several pillboxes <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> under fire from another. They destroyed the pillbox, but Bursać received a serious leg wound and was carried to a less exposed area.|$|E
5|$|Fouroux was {{succeeded by}} Daniel Dubroca, who coached {{the team to}} the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he {{resigned}} after violently confronting referee David Bishop following France's World Cup quarter-final against England. Dubroca was replaced by Pierre Berbizier, who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier's replacement, Jean-Claude Skrela, coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> last in the tournament in 1999. He officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. Bernard Laporte was appointed as Skrela's successor in November. Laporte guided France through the 2003 and 2007 Rugby World Cups before stepping down to become Secretary of State for Sport. After Philippe Saint-André turned down the offer to replace Laporte, French Rugby Federation president Bernard Lapasset appointed Marc Lièvremont to guide France to the 2011 World Cup. Lièvremont's tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices, and player discontent. There were some bright moments, notably wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. But {{there was also a}} 59–16 loss to Australia in Paris, a 22–21 loss to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19–14 loss to Tonga during the 2011 World Cup. In August 2011, before the World Cup, it was announced that Philippe Saint-André would replace Lièvremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This came as no surprise to Lièvremont, as he had announced as early as May 2010 that he would not continue as the coach of France after the World Cup.|$|E

25|$|The nationalities {{policy was}} {{formulated}} by the Bolshevik party in 1913, four years <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> {{to power in}} Russia. Vladimir Lenin sent a young Joseph Stalin (himself a Georgian and therefore an ethnic minority member) to Vienna, {{at the time a}} very ethnically diverse city (capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire). Stalin reported back to Moscow with the ideas for the policy. It was summarized in Stalin's pamphlet (his first scholarly publication), Marxism and the National Question (1913). Ironically Stalin would also be the major proponent of its eventual dismemberment and the reemergence of Russification.|$|E
25|$|The {{essence of}} Hannibal's {{campaign}} in Italy was {{to fight the}} Romans by using local resources and raising recruits from among the local population. His subordinate Hanno was able to raise troops in Samnium, but the Romans intercepted these new levies in the Battle of Beneventum (214 BC) and eliminated them <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> under the feared leadership of Hannibal. Hannibal could win allies, but defending them against the Romans was a new and difficult problem, as the Romans could still field multiple armies greatly outnumbering his own forces.

25|$|Boulton's Letter's Patent {{specifications}} were {{sealed on}} 4 August 1868 and the complete patent was backdated to its application date of 5 February 1868. His British patent, the 392nd one completed in 1868, was issued more than 35 years before ailerons were 'reinvented' in France, and ailerons were later repatented in the United States by Glenn Curtiss of the Aerial Experiment Association in about 1911. Boulton's 1868 patent became forgotten and lost from sight until the same time, {{a few years}} <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> into general use in 1915. Aviation historian C. H. Gibbs-Smith acknowledged Boulton's priority of invention, stating that if the 1868 patent had been revealed {{at the time of}} the Wright brothers' legal filings, they might not have been able to claim the priority of invention for the lateral control of flying machines.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Roman Republic contributed {{significantly}} to many aspects of democracy, {{only a minority of}} Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of gerrymandering, so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. In addition, the Roman Republic was the first government in the western world to have a Republic as a nation-state, although it didn't have much of a democracy. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved. Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and their elected representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Other cultures, such as the Iroquois Nation in the Americas between around 1450 and 1600 AD also developed a form of democratic society <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> in contact with the Europeans. This indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} to Egypt, the AIF underwent {{a period of}} reorganisation as it was expanded from two infantry battalions to five prior to their transfer to Europe. As the battalion was rebuilt, further training was undertaken before it was sent to France, arriving there in late March 1916. For the next two-and-a-half years they participated {{in most of the}} main battles fought by the Australians on the Western Front. Their first major action came at Pozières in mid-1916 as part of the wider Battle of the Somme, being committed twice in July and August. In late August, the 18th was withdrawn to Belgium to recover, before {{returning to}} the Somme in October. For the rest of 1916, the battalion undertook defensive duties along the front, although they were not involved in any major attacks. The following year, the Germans shortened their lines and withdrew to the Hindenburg Line, after which the 18th Battalion took part in the fighting around Warlencourt in February as the Allies sought to follow up the German withdrawal. A brief advance followed <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> up against the forward positions of the Hindenburg Line. In May the 18th Battalion was committed to the Second Battle of Bullecourt before moving again to Belgium where they saw further action around the Ypres Salient at Menin Road in September and Poelcappelle in October before settling down for the winter.|$|E

Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, [...] "I know some people who always say, 'Oh, everything's so secret.' I think it's good.

500|$|In 1806, Charles {{issued a}} new guide for army and unit tactics. The main {{tactical}} innovation was {{the concept of}} the [...] "mass", an anti-cavalry formation created by closing up the spacing between ranks. However, Austrian commanders disliked the innovation and rarely used it unless directly supervised by Charles. Following the failures at Ulm and Austerlitz, the Austrians went back to using the six-companies-per-battalion model, abandoning the four-company-per-battalion that had been introduced by Mack on the eve of war in 1805. Problems persisted despite the reforms. The Austrians lacked sufficient skirmishers to successfully contend with their French counterparts, the cavalry was often sprinkled into individual units throughout the army, preventing the shock and hitting power evident in the French system, and even though Charles imitated the French corps command structure, leaders in the Austrian military establishment were often wary of taking the initiative, relying heavily on written orders and drawn-out planning <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> to a decision.|$|E
500|$|The 28th's {{first major}} action {{came during the}} Battle of Pozières in late July and early August when they took part in two attacks. During the first attack, the 28th {{suffered}} heavily when they were committed to a night-time attack on the heights that got held up in heavy wire entanglements that the preparatory bombardment had failed to destroy; the battalion's losses were the heaviest in the 7th Brigade, amounting to 10 officers and 360 other ranks. A follow up attack was undertaken on 4 August, which proved more successful, eventually securing the objective. The following day, the Australians were subjected to heavy shelling before they were withdrawn on 6 August. After this, the 28th was moved to a quieter sector around Ypres {{before returning to the}} Somme in the later part of 1916, and taking part in further fighting around Flers. In early 1917, the Germans began a surprise withdrawal along the front, which enabled them to hold the line with fewer troops, thus gaining a pool of reserves. [...] When the Allies discovered this, a brief advance followed, <b>before</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> up against the strongly prepared defences of the Hindenburg Line. After this, a series of attacks followed with the 28th Battalion being utilised mainly in supporting roles {{for the remainder of the}} year. Actions were fought at Bullecourt, Menin Road, Broodseinde and Poelcappelle during this time.|$|E
