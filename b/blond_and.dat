5|$|In 1977, Grant {{began the}} second Typhonian Trilogy with Nightside of Eden, {{in which he}} {{discussed}} {{some of his own}} personal magical ideas, outlining magical formulae with which to explore a dark, dense realm that he variously called 'Universe B' and 'the Tunnels of Set', conceived as a 'dark side' of the Qabalistic Tree of Life. Grant made connections between this realm and the extramundane deities of H.P. Lovecraft's horror fiction. The book proved controversial among occultists and Thelemites, and starkly divided opinion. The sequel appeared in 1980 as Outside the Circles of Time, and introduced Grant's thoughts on the relevance of Ufology and insectoid symbolism for occultism. This would prove to be the final Grant volume published by Muller, who would merge with <b>Blond</b> <b>and</b> Briggs in 1984, while the publishing rights to his works reverted to him the following year. His next book would not appear for another eleven years after Outside the Circles of Time.|$|E
25|$|Afro-Latin Americans {{have limited}} media appearance; critics have accused the Latin American media of {{overlooking}} the African, indigenous and multiracial populations {{in favor of}} over-representation of often <b>blond</b> <b>and</b> blue/green-eyed white Latin Americans rather than they look like white Latin Americans of typical Southern European features, especially in the popular telenovelas.|$|E

25|$|Brelan de dames (Three Queens of a Kind), a Belgian {{comic strip}} by artist Renaud Denauw and writer Jean-Luc Vernal, was also about {{a trio of}} action women, though in this case they came from various {{countries}} and racial backgrounds and, after a short stint in the secret service, became independent operators.

25|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} Beineman's body further revealed {{she had been}} raped prior to her murder, and that her torn panties had been forcefully placed inside her vagina; these panties revealed the presence of human semen and 509 human hair clippings measuring less than three-eights of an inch upon the material. These hair clippings were predominantly <b>blond,</b> <b>and</b> as such {{did not belong to}} the victim, whose own hair color had been dark brown.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{mechanism}} behind {{human skin}} color is mainly {{regulated by the}} enzyme tyrosinase, which creates {{the color of the}} skin, eyes, and hair shades. Differences in skin color are also attributed to differences in size and distribution of melanosomes in the skin. Melanocytes produce two types of melanin. The most common form of biological melanin is eumelanin, a brown-black polymer of dihydroxyindole carboxylic acids, and their reduced forms. Most are derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Eumelanin is found in hair, areola, and skin, and the hair colors gray, black, <b>blond,</b> <b>and</b> brown. In humans, it is more abundant in people with dark skin. Pheomelanin, a pink to red hue is found in particularly large quantities in red hair, the lips, nipples, glans of the penis, and vagina.|$|E

500|$|Bannon also {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} race in Women in the Shadows when Laura begins an affair with a woman representing herself as Eastern Indian, but who is actually a lighter skinned African American. The duality of their relationship is expressed not only in skin color but through their personalities. Laura, <b>blond</b> <b>and</b> passionate, contrasts with Tris, who is dark but emotionally detached. Race, in this instance, is a [...] "metaphor for the opposition between inside and outside that govern Bannon's sense of what a lesbian is".|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} {{of her parents}} was unhappy. The Duke was taciturn, unfaithful, prone to drinking and emotionally detached from his family. Victoria's mother was independent-minded and cultured. Although she was unsentimental and strict, the Duchess was a devoted mother {{and the most important}} person in her children's lives. As a child, Victoria had a difficult temperament. She was shy, serious and sensitive. In the judgment of her sister Marie: [...] "This passionate child was often misunderstood." [...] Princess Victoria Melita was talented at drawing and painting and learned to play the piano. She was particularly close to Marie. The two sisters would remain very close throughout their lives. They contrasted in appearance and personality. Victoria was dark and moody while Marie was <b>blond</b> <b>and</b> easy-going. Although she was one year younger, Victoria was taller and seemed to be the older of the two.|$|E
500|$|The curtains, made of rayon silk, {{measured}} [...] Sheldon Hall and Stephen Neale {{note the}} theatrical {{sense that the}} cinematographers achieved through shooting the sequence in virtually a single take. They mention that [...] "the camera traverses an enormous platform set contained within a curtained proscenium (also enormous)", and that the [...] "set itself revolves to meet the camera, rather than the camera entering {{the space of the}} set." [...] Linda Mizejewski, author of a book on the Ziegfeld girls, argues that the Pretty Girl sequence is more than just about being showy; it is symbolic of womanhood which [...] "powerfully visualizes women as the raw material for male aesthetic vision and design". In the film she believes that womanhood is defined by the [...] "young, white, <b>blond</b> <b>and</b> slender" [...] female, which in the sequence are [...] "delineated as the fluffy, artificial tiers of costuming and staging".|$|E

500|$|The [...] "peacocking" [...] element was not {{included}} into the script, but added to the episode during filming after actor Aziz Ansari mentioned to show co-creator Greg Daniels that he believed the character {{would be interested in}} pickup artist tactics like those outlined in Neil Strauss' book [...] Ansari and Daniels asked the wardrobe for something silly for Ansari to wear in the bar, and they tried about a half-dozen items before Ansari himself settled on the orange hat, which is actually a woman's hat. The two women Mark and Tom talk to at the bar were meant to mirror Leslie and Ann from the banquet. Although they do not resemble Poehler and Jones, the two women had the same color hair (brown and <b>blond)</b> <b>and</b> were seated at the table in the same spots in relation to Mark that Leslie and Ann were seated around him at the banquet.|$|E
500|$|The {{album cover}} denoted Madonna's {{continued}} fascination with Spanish culture and fashion. She wore a female toreador outfit with a lacy bustier, embroidered bolero {{jacket and a}} cummerbund with a flouncy bustle. Jeri Heiden, who had worked on the cover art for True Blue, was given the task of editing the photos and making them compatible for appearance in an album cover. Shot by Herb Ritts, the cover showed Madonna again as a platinum blond. Heiden explained {{in an interview with}} Aperture magazine in October 2006 that the cover was not meant to be a tie-in with the True Blue cover. [...] "It was just Madonna's look at the time– Platinum <b>Blond.</b> <b>And</b> of course the handwriting reappears on that album." [...] The album sleeve included a free poster and the gold wrap-around liner notes contained approximate running time to indicate the difference between the length of the remix and the original track. Brian Chin, a Rolling Stone journalist, wrote the liner notes for the album, explaining the process of remix and why the seven songs were chosen for the track list.|$|E

After Carey appeared on stage wearing a black skirt with a high slit and sporting a <b>blond</b> <b>and</b> straightened hairstyle, Joe joined her with several male and female back-up dancers, all of whom who wore black outfits. After performing the first verse and chorus, Nas joined the duo on stage for the Make It Last Remix. Later on in the show, she was honored with the [...] "Award of Achievement" [...] for earning a number one single in every year of the 1990s. Vibe commended the performance, writing that it [...] "offered an insight into how a little girl from Long Island, New York became hip hop's answer to Celine Dion." [...] In 2000, Carey performed the song on the Italian television show Quelli che... il Calcio.|$|E

500|$|He was {{subsequently}} {{cast as the}} title role in director Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biographical film James Dean. To immerse himself in the role, Franco {{went from being a}} non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, bleached his dark brown hair <b>blond,</b> <b>and</b> learned to ride a motorcycle as well as play guitar and the bongos. To have a greater understanding of Dean, Franco spent hours with two of Dean's associates. Other research included reading books on Dean and studying his movies. While filming James Dean, the actor, to get into character, cut off communication with his family and friends, as well as his then-girlfriend. [...] "It was a very lonely existence," [...] he notes. [...] "If I wasn't on a set, I was watching James Dean. That was my whole thinking. James Dean. James Dean." [...] Despite already being a fan of Dean, Franco feared he might be typecast if he'd captured the actor too convincingly. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "Franco could have walked through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead gets under the skin of this insecure, rootless young man." [...] He received a Golden Globe Award and nominations for an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG).|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Star" [...] {{has been}} a setlist staple on four of Madonna's concert tours: The Virgin Tour (1985), the Who's That Girl World Tour (1987), the Confessions Tour (2006), and the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16). On The Virgin Tour, Madonna {{performed}} the song wearing an entirely black costume, consisting of a crop top worn beneath a vest, fringed elbow length gloves, a fringed miniskirt, leggings, and low heel leather boots. She also wore a crucifix earring in one ear and a silver cross pattée was pinned to the right shoulder of her vest. Madonna sang the original version of the song, and pranced around the stage while showing her stomach. The performance {{was included in the}} [...] VHS, released in 1985. At the Who's That Girl World Tour, [...] "Lucky Star" [...] was performed as the second song of the set list. Madonna wore a black bustier like the music video to her single [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] (1987). Her hair was platinum <b>blond</b> <b>and</b> in a big bushy shape. The performance of [...] "Lucky Star" [...] included a disco ball spinning above the stage, as Madonna and her dancers moved around it as the light from the ball flickered on them like a star. Two different performances are found in [...] tour video filmed at Stadio Communale in Turin, Italy on September 4, 1987 and the Who's That Girl: Live in Japan tour video filmed at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan on June 22, 1987.|$|E
500|$|Bassist Frank Zincavage met Iyall at the SF Art Institute; the two {{hit it off}} and {{discussed}} putting a band together. They formed one with Woods and Derrah a few weeks later, drawing inspiration from the [...] "burgeoning local punk and post-punk scenes". Iyall recruited Woods because she enjoyed playing {{with him in the}} Mommers and Poppers. [...] " [...] seemed only natural that we invite Peter Woods to join us [...] played clean and was a natural on rhythm guitar." [...] Romeo Void officially formed on Valentine's Day in 1979.

[...] The band practiced in Iyall's flat in Mission District. It was decided that the group would embrace punk ideals despite the possibility that they become associated with the new wave movement. [...] "Even though I was going to the [...] so much, I also had criticisms: Everyone was leaning against the wall wearing black," [...] Iyall said. [...] "I guess we were considered new wave, but for me Romeo Void was a reaction against the regimentation of everyone having to be bleached <b>blond</b> <b>and</b> everything being about despair and no future, when I thought the do-it-yourself thing should encompass all the different kinds of emotions, and all the different colors. [...] I was proud of being American Indian, so I purposely never bleached my hair blond." ...|$|E
