5|$|Spencer {{seeks out}} the <b>Beautiful</b> <b>Girl</b> Across the Hall, but finds her with another man. Crushed, Spencer {{returns to his}} room, where the child is crying. He takes a pair of {{scissors}} {{and for the first time}} removes the child's swaddling. It is revealed that the child has no skin; the bandages held its internal organs together, and they spill apart after the rags are cut. The child gasps in pain, and Spencer cuts its organs with the scissors. The wounds gush a thick liquid, covering the child. The power in the room overloads; as the lights flicker on and off the child grows to huge proportions. When the lights burn out completely, the child's head is replaced by the planet. Spencer appears amidst a billowing cloud of eraser shavings. The side of the planet bursts apart, and inside, the Man in the Planet struggles with his levers, which are now emitting sparks. Spencer is embraced warmly by the Lady in the Radiator, as both white light and white noise crescendo.|$|E

25|$|The painter Edwin Henry Landseer {{submitted}} a picture called 'The Shrew Tamed' for the Royal Academy exhibition of 1861. It showed a <b>beautiful</b> <b>girl</b> in riding habit reclining against {{the neck of}} a horse which is on its knees among the straw. It was ostensibly not a portrait of Walters, but the alleged model, the noted horsewoman Annie Gilbert, resembles her, and the juxtaposition of horse, beautiful woman and prevailing mood of languor troubled contemporary critics; some clearly assumed Walters herself had been the subject. The picture gained the alternative title of 'The Pretty Horsebreaker'.|$|E
