2500|$|To {{extend their}} food supply, they ate portulaca. Gray also caught an [...] Python (probably Aspidites melanocephalus, a <b>black-headed</b> <b>python),</b> which they ate. Both Burke and Gray {{immediately}} {{came down with}} dysentery. Gray was ill, but Burke thought he was [...] "gammoning" [...] (pretending). On 25 March on the Burke River (just south {{of what is now}} the town of Boulia), Gray was caught stealing skilligolee (a type of watery porridge) and Burke beat him. By 8 April Gray could not walk; he died on 17 April of dysentery at a place they called Polygonum Swamp. The location of Gray's death is unknown, although it is generally believed to be Lake Massacre in South Australia. While the possibility that Burke killed Gray has been discounted, the severity of the beating Burke gave has been widely debated. The three surviving men stopped for a day to bury Gray, and to recover their strength—they were by this stage very weak from hunger and exhaustion. They finally reached Cooper Creek on 21 April, only to find that the camp had been abandoned several hours earlier.|$|E

50|$|The diet {{consists}} of mainly reptiles, including snakes, {{but they will}} eat mammals if available. Because <b>black-headed</b> <b>pythons</b> live in the desert, they heat up a lot quicker and stay warmer for longer. This means they can eat more because they digest food quicker in warmer conditions. When ingesting large prey this species positions one or two coils just ahead of its distended mouth and by constriction makes the task of swallowing easier.|$|R

50|$|Aspidites melanocephalus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>black-headed</b> <b>python,</b> is a species of snake in the family Pythonidae (the python family). The species is native to Australia. No subspecies are currently recognized.|$|E
50|$|Indigenous Australians, the Ngarlawongga and Banjima peoples, have dreamtime songs {{involving}} {{the origin of}} the black river goanna which {{is believed to have been}} created in the river. Likewise the <b>black-headed</b> <b>python</b> is believed to have been created in Indabiddy creek.|$|E

50|$|The western {{brown snake}} grows up to 1.5 m in total length (including tail). Its back can feature shades of orange-brown with flecks and bands, or appear plain. Its belly is cream to orange with pink blotches. Some {{individuals}} have jet black heads (this can {{cause it to}} be confused with the <b>black-headed</b> <b>python),</b> while others feature a black 'V' shape on the back of their neck, below their head.|$|E
5000|$|The three clans, {{together}} with the Warndarrang-speaking guyal group, made up a set of four patrilineal semimoieties, each of which had their own set of songs, myths, and rituals. Each semimoiety was also associated with a totem (olive python or fork-tailed catfish for mambali, goanna for guyal, <b>black-headed</b> <b>python</b> or antilopine kangaroo for burdal, and king brown snake for murrungun) and had responsibilities for that totem. [...] Note that Warndarang people use the same system of semimoieties, under the names mambali, murrungun, wurdal, and guyal (wuyal).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} several Australian Aboriginal myths (or sacred histories) {{from the}} Georgina River Basin region of Central Australia that concern the Triodia grasses {{known locally as}} spinifex (or aywerte). The sacred song lines of this Dreaming connect or relate to the Red Kangaroo, Wild Bee, Freshwater Bream, and <b>Black-Headed</b> <b>Python</b> totems joining distant groups in the arid interior of Australia. These sacred histories provide an epistemological foundation to the regional intellectual property over traditional spinifex technologies utilized for architectural, material and medicinal functions. The paper explores the contemporary re-vitalization of this knowledge in collaborative research partnership between a group of traditional tribal owners (the Indjilandji, Wakaya and Bularnu peoples) {{and a team of}} scientific researchers from the University of Queensland (including the author) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the isolation and molecular {{identification of a}} novel paramyxovirus found in Australian snakes. The virus is named Sunshine virus after the geographical origin of the first isolate: the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, Australia. For decades, Australian veterinarians have been presented with snakes displaying neurorespiratory signs. The clinical signs, pathological findings {{and the results of}} overseas diagnostic testing, have suggested {{that at least some of}} these snakes were infected with paramyxoviruses, most likely ferlaviruses. Australian veterinarians provided 463 samples to be screened for the presence of viruses and nine were found from five snakes from two collections. For all isolates, cytopathic effects consisted of extensive syncytial cell formation with minimal cell lysis. Further characterisation was performed on one of these isolates, BHP 1 -Lung (from a lung homogenate of a <b>black-headed</b> <b>python</b> [BHP], Aspidites melanocephalus with mild respiratory signs and stomatitis). Testing this isolate for haemagglutinating and neuraminidase activity provided equivocal results. The virus could not be found by electron microscopy. Polymerase chain reaction to detect a broad range of paramyxoviruses, reoviruses, adenoviruses and herpesviruses was also non-contributory. Through the use of high-throughput sequencing, BHP 1 -Lung was identified as a novel paramyxovirus. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleoprotein (N), matrix (M), fusion (F) and polymerase (L) proteins clustered this virus within the family Paramyxoviridae but outside of both subfamilies. Primers were designed that could detect Sunshine virus which enabled clinical data that is associated with Sunshine virus infection to be described. Clinical signs are typically non-specific (e. g. regurgitation, lethargy, inappetence) and/or can be localised to the neurological and/or respiratory systems. Gross pathology is usually unremarkable. Histopathological findings consist primarily of white matter spongiosis and gliosis of the hindbrain with a mild bronchointerstitial pneumonia...|$|E
