5|$|In {{his time}} in office, Joliet changed from an economy of a prison town with declining {{population}} to a fast-growing entertainment and tourism economy, focused on riverboat casinos.

5|$|Monsoon rains {{impact the}} health of the Indian economy; as Indian {{agriculture}} employs 600 million people and comprises 20% of the national GDP, good monsoons correlate with a <b>booming</b> <b>economy.</b> Weak or failed monsoons (droughts) result in widespread agricultural losses and substantially hinder overall economic growth. Yet such rains reduce temperatures and can replenish groundwater tables, rivers.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} years of the {{federation}} were characterised by a relatively peaceful political atmosphere and a <b>booming</b> <b>economy.</b> The government's coffers were kept full through revenue from Northern Rhodesia's copper mines, and overseas investment saw the rapid expansion of the cities of Salisbury, Bulawayo and Lusaka. High-standard tar roads replaced dirt tracks and the railway system was expanded. Welensky credited the high rate of development to the astute management of the federal Minister of Finance, Donald Macintyre.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the English Civil War Birmingham's <b>booming</b> <b>economy,</b> its {{expanding}} population, and its resulting high levels of social mobility and cultural pluralism, had seen it develop new social structures very different from those of more established areas. Relationships were built around pragmatic commercial linkages rather than the rigid paternalism and deference of feudal society, and loyalties to the traditional hierarchies of the established church and aristocracy were weak. The town's reputation for political radicalism and its strongly Parliamentarian sympathies saw it attacked by Royalist forces in the Battle of Birmingham in 1643, and it developed into a centre of Puritanism in the 1630s and as a haven for Nonconformists from the 1660s.|$|E
5|$|Downtown Bakersfield {{was heavily}} {{impacted}} by the earthquakes, and many damaged buildings were bulldozed {{to make room for}} buildings that were eventually constructed with newer architectural styles. After World War II, and with a <b>booming</b> <b>economy,</b> the region was experiencing a period of urban renewal. The Kern County Courthouse, St. Francis Church, and the original Beale Memorial Clock Tower were all damaged and were leveled or rebuilt. In what may have been an overambitious push for renewal, some historic buildings that may have been able to be salvaged also were brought down, though some stood for many years after the earthquakes. Some of Bakersfield's unreinforced masonry buildings survived the shocks and were still in use years later, but the cost of retrofitting these buildings was often prohibitive for their owners, and the Bakersfield City Council was given the authority to seize or demolish them in 1993. The city changed its approach in the late 1990s after building owners complained that the upgrade process was too expensive, and the possibility that the city may be left in possession of properties that were left needing the costly renovations.|$|E

50|$|The global {{digital divide}} is often characterised as {{corresponding}} to the north-south divide; however, Internet use, and especially broadband access, is now soaring in Asia compared with other continents.

Melbourne remained Australia's main business and financial centre until the late 1970s, when it began to lose this primacy to Sydney.|$|E

25|$|With a <b>booming</b> <b>economy</b> {{short of}} unskilled workers, {{especially}} after the Berlin Wall cut off the steady flow of East Germans, the FRG negotiated migration agreements with Italy (1955), Spain (1960), Greece (1960), and Turkey (1961) that brought in {{hundreds of thousands of}} temporary guest workers, called Gastarbeiter. In 1968 the FRG signed a guest worker agreement with Yugoslavia that employed additional guest workers.

50|$|By 1921 Queensland {{was poised}} to resume the {{economic}} boom interrupted by the First World War (1914-18). In the period 1922-1928, Queensland experienced its first and last economic boom between the outbreak of war in 1914 and the 1950s. The benefits of the <b>boom</b> <b>economy</b> were reflected throughout the State, but nowhere {{more so than in}} Brisbane, with 29% of the Queensland population in December 1924. In physical terms the boom was expressed in a spate of building activity that transported the central business district of Brisbane into the 20th century, shedding its late Victorian image.|$|R

25|$|India liberalised its FDI {{policy in}} 2005, {{allowing}} up to a 100% FDI stake in ventures.

The upward growth curve of the real-estate sector owes some credit to a <b>booming</b> <b>economy</b> and liberalised FDI regime. In March 2005, the government amended the rules to allow 100% FDI in the construction sector, including built-up infrastructure and construction development projects comprising housing, commercial premises, hospitals, educational institutions, recreational facilities, and city- and regional-level infrastructure. Between 2012 and 2014, India extended these reforms to defence, telecom, oil, retail, aviation, and other sectors.|$|E
