5|$|Ideas {{about the}} nature of law in general were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> In 1716, the Septennial Act was passed, which had a number of consequences. First, it showed that Parliament no longer {{considered}} its previous statutes unassailable, as it provided for a maximum parliamentary term of seven years, whereas the Triennial Act (1694) (enacted {{less than a quarter of}} a century previously) had provided for a maximum term of three years.|$|E
25|$|Tensions mounted {{steadily}} {{over the}} decade. In 1312, Isabella {{gave birth to}} the future Edward III, {{but by the end of}} the year Edward's court was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Edward was still relying upon his French in-laws– Isabella's uncle Louis, for example, had been sent from Paris to assist him– but Hugh Despenser the elder now formed part of the inner circle, marking the beginning of the Despensers' increased prominence at Edward's court. The Despensers were opposed to both the Lancastrians and their other allies in the Welsh Marches, making an easy alliance with Edward, who sought revenge for the death of Gaveston.|$|E
25|$|Following completion, {{the park}} quickly slipped into decline. One {{of the main}} reasons for this was the lack of {{interest}} from the Tammany Hall political machine, which was the largest political force in New York at the time. Around the turn of the 20th century, the park faced several new challenges. Cars were becoming commonplace, bringing with them their burden of pollution, and people's attitudes were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> No longer were parks to be used only for walks and picnics in an idyllic environment but also for sports and similar recreation. Following the dissolution of the Central Park Commission in 1870 and Andrew Green's departure from the project, and Vaux's death in 1895, the maintenance effort gradually declined. All of this changed in 1934, when Republican Fiorello La Guardia was elected mayor of New York City and unified the five park-related departments then in existence. Robert Moses was given the task of cleaning up the park. Moses, about {{to become one of the}} most powerful men in New York City, took over what was essentially a relic, a leftover from a bygone era.|$|E

500|$|The {{traditional}} {{image of}} Byzantine Greek merchants as unenterprising benefactors of state aid is <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> {{for that of}} mobile, pro-active agents. The merchant class, particularly that of Constantinople, became a force of its own that could, at times, even threaten the Emperor {{as it did in}} the eleventh and twelfth centuries. This was achieved through efficient use of credit and other monetary innovations. Merchants invested surplus funds in financial products called chreokoinonia (...) , the equivalent and perhaps ancestor of the later Italian commenda.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, {{it became}} clear that the legal {{rehabilitation}} of the Waffen-SS was out of HIAG's reach. At the same time, attitudes were <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> as the country emerged from a [...] "decade of suppression of Germany's Nazi past". Waffen-SS veterans' activities were increasingly greeted by suspicion from the community, while the government and military planners came to the realisation that they could meet their goals of rearmament without them. HIAG was thus increasingly marginalised and ignored by the political parties, while any pretences of moderation no longer served a purpose as no further benefits were forthcoming from the government.|$|E

500|$|Hispanics {{have been}} {{underrepresented}} in the all-volunteer armed forces, especially among officers. Although Hispanics make up 18% {{of the total}} Marine population, they make up 5.5% of the officers corps. [...] This is <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change,</b> as increasing numbers of Hispanics enter the military. The Marine Corps, realizing its shortage of Hispanics in the officer ranks, has a program to grow its own and sends young enlisted Marines to college while on active duty to obtain a degree and a commission. Prior to 2000, two Marines of Hispanic descent reached the ranks of brigadier general and above. Since then, seven Hispanics have been promoted {{to the rank of}} brigadier general and above. One of the seven, Joseph V. Medina, was a graduate of the United States Naval Academy. The other six obtained their commissions after enlisting in the Marines upon receiving their college degrees.|$|E
2500|$|However, this is <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> The Royal Netherlands Navy for one is {{starting}} to experiment with composite materials like resins or carbon fiber. These materials, when formed into a propeller, are flexible enough under pressure to “deflect,” which can reduce cavitation. Other [...] options are made from carbon fiber, epoxy resin, or even glass, {{and are able to}} produce “a hydro elastic effect”. Since these new propellers can flex and are not nearly as rigid under pressure, the risk of cavitation is reduced.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the failure}} to shift to more {{productive}} agricultural products {{may be related to}} ignorance about the benefits of changing land use. [...] A second explanation is a lack of availability of credit, caused by the high rate of failure of banks in the Plains states. [...] Because banks failed in the Dust Bowl region at a higher rate than elsewhere, farmers could not get the credit they needed to buy capital to shift crop production. In addition, profit margins in either animals or hay were still minimal, and farmers had little incentive in the <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their crops.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the state}} level, California {{was the first}} state to offer paid family leave {{benefits}} for its workers. While the benefits only last for 6 weeks [...] this is the first major step for maternity leave in the United States. New Jersey lawmakers are pushing legislation that would make their state the second state to add this worker benefit. Under one New Jersey proposal, workers who take leave would be paid through the state’s temporary disability insurance fund, [...] "augmented by a 0.1 percent charge on workers’ weekly wages." [...] Traditionally, many conservatives have opposed paid family leave, but there is a sign that this mindset is <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change.</b> Reverend Paul Schenck, a prominent member of the National Pro-Life Action Center recently stated that he would support paid maternity leave on the assumption that it might encourage women to follow through with their pregnancies instead of having abortions. According to Heyman, [...] "Across the political spectrum, people are realizing these policies have an enormous impact on working families. If you look at the most competitive economies in the world, all the others except the U.S. have these policies in place." ...|$|E
2500|$|This stereotypical {{attribution}} of sex-typical toys {{for girls and}} boys is gradually changing, with toys companies creating more gender neutral toys, as the benefits associated with allowing children to play with toys that appeal to them far outweighs controlling their individual preferences. For example, many stores are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> their gender labels on children's play items. Target removed all identification related to gender from their toy aisles and Disney did the same for their costumes. The Disney store is an especially prevalent example of gender in play because they are a global identity in the toy world. A study done regarding their website found that though they have removed gender labels from their costumes, the toys online reflect more stereotypical gender identities. For example, males were associated with physicality and females were associated with beauty, housing, and caring. Too, though they promote their toys as being for both genders, there is no section {{for boys and girls}} combined on their website. Those which are generally deemed for both genders more closely resemble what many would label [...] "boy toys," [...] as they relate closer to the stereotype of masculinity within play.|$|E
