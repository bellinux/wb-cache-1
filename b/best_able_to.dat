At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E

5|$|Until late 1939, A/S {{work had}} largely been ignored. In the opening {{months of the}} trade defence war, September 1939 to early 1940, three main points arose in this respect. Firstly, the Germans were {{incapable}} of maintaining a sustained anti-shipping campaign owing to {{a small number of}} U-boats. Second, the Air Staff's fear of massed air attacks on shipping did not take place and could be discarded. Thirdly, despite the first two points, losses to Allied shipping from U-boat attack was enough for importance of A/S to increase. The Royal Navy's belief in an ASDIC equipped surface fleet to effectively sweep the seas clear of U-boats proved unfounded (owing to the limitations of ASDIC and vulnerability of surface vessels).

25|$|Several mid-level {{evolutionary}} theories inform evolutionary psychology. The r/K selection theory {{proposes that}} some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow {{the strategy of}} having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest {{more or less in}} individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are <b>best</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are <b>best</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to life history theory, animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the Baldwin effect).|$|E
