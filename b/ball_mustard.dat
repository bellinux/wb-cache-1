50|$|The {{early use}} of mustard as a {{condiment}} in England is attested {{from the year}} 1390 in the book The Forme of Cury which was written by King Richard II's master cooks. It was prepared {{in the form of}} <b>mustard</b> <b>balls</b> — coarse-ground <b>mustard</b> seed combined with flour and cinnamon, moistened, rolled into balls, and dried — which were easily stored and combined with vinegar or wine to make mustard paste as needed. The town of Tewkesbury was well known for its high-quality <b>mustard</b> <b>balls,</b> originally made with ground mustard mixed with horseradish and dried for storage, which were then exported to London {{and other parts of the}} country, and are even mentioned in William Shakespeare's play King Henry the Fourth, Part II.|$|R

50|$|Originally {{the mustard}} was {{prepared}} by grinding the mustard seeds into mustard flour, combining this with finely-grated horseradish (and sometimes herbs and spices), then forming {{the mixture into}} balls which were then dried to aid preservation. The <b>mustard</b> <b>balls</b> would then be transported and sold in this form.|$|R
50|$|Wasabi Pow is a green wasabi. He is the smallest, {{speechless}} {{member of}} the Sushi Pack and the brute of the team. A spicy <b>ball</b> of hot <b>mustard,</b> he speaks hot sauce and can only communicate with squeaky noises (his teammates have no trouble understanding him), and {{has the power to}} shoot fireballs at foes. Think the Rabbids from Rayman and Scorpion from Mortal Kombat. He is voiced by Scott McNeil.|$|R
5000|$|Arsenical smokes {{were known}} to the Chinese {{as far back as}} c. 1000 BC [...] and Sun Tzu's [...] "Art of War" [...] (c. 200 BC) advises the use of fire weapons. In the second century BC, {{writings}} of the Mohist sect in China describe the use of bellows to pump smoke from burning <b>balls</b> of <b>mustard</b> and other toxic vegetables into tunnels being dug by a besieging army. Other Chinese writings dating around the same period contain hundreds of recipes for the production of poisonous or irritating smokes for use in war along with numerous accounts of their use. These accounts describe an arsenic-containing [...] "soul-hunting fog", and the use of finely divided lime dispersed into the air to suppress a peasant revolt in 178 AD.|$|R
50|$|England {{was exposed}} to new foods (such as the potato {{imported}} from South America), and developed new tastes during the era. The more prosperous enjoyed {{a wide variety of}} food and drink, including exotic new drinks such as tea, coffee, and chocolate. French and Italian chefs appeared in the country houses and palaces bringing new standards of food preparation and taste. For example, the English developed a taste for acidic foods—such as oranges for the upper class—and started to use vinegar heavily. The gentry paid increasing attention to their gardens, with new fruits, vegetables and herbs; pasta, pastries, and dried <b>mustard</b> <b>balls</b> first appeared on the table. The apricot was a special treat at fancy banquets. Roast beef remained a staple for those who could afford it. The rest ate a great deal of bread and fish. Every class had a taste for beer and rum.|$|R
5000|$|The poor {{consumed}} a diet {{largely of}} bread, cheese, milk, and beer, with small portions of meat, fish and vegetables, and occasionally some fruit. Potatoes were just {{arriving at the}} end of the period, and became increasingly important. The typical poor farmer sold his best products on the market, keeping the cheap food for the family. Stale bread could be used to make bread puddings,and bread crumbs served to thicken soups, stews, and sauces. [...] At a somewhat higher social level families ate an enormous variety of meats, especially beef, mutton, veal, lamb, and pork, as well as chickens, and ducks. The holiday goose was a special treat. Many rural folk and some townspeople tended a small garden which produced vegetables such as asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, lettuce, beans, cabbage, carrots, leeks, and peas, as well as medicinal and flavoring herbs. Some raised their own apricots, grapes, berries, apples, pears, plums, currants, and cherries. Families without a garden could trade with their neighbours to obtain vegetables and fruits at low cost.
