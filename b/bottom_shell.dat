500|$|The {{southern}} {{painted turtle}} (C.p.dorsalis), the smallest subspecies, is [...] long. Its top stripe is a prominent red, and its <b>bottom</b> <b>shell</b> is tan and spotless or nearly so.|$|E
500|$|The midland {{painted turtle}} (C.p.marginata) is [...] long. The {{centrally}} located midland {{is the hardest}} to distinguish from the other three subspecies. Its <b>bottom</b> <b>shell</b> has a characteristic symmetrical dark shadow in the center which varies in size and prominence.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{subspecies}} is {{the western}} painted turtle (C.p.bellii), which grows up to [...] long. Its top shell has a mesh-like {{pattern of light}} lines, and the top stripe present in other subspecies is missing or faint. Its <b>bottom</b> <b>shell</b> has a large colored splotch that spreads to the edges (further than the midland) and often has red hues.|$|E
50|$|They may be held {{in place}} by a {{built-in}} wedge, set screws threaded into the <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell,</b> or pinch bolts that tighten a split <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell.</b> As a standard sized bottom bracket threads into the eccentric, an oversized <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell</b> is required to accommodate the eccentric.|$|R
5000|$|The Thompson {{bottom bracket}} uses {{adjustable}} spindle cones and cups {{pressed into the}} <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell</b> like the Ashtabula bottom bracket. Unlike the Ashtabula crank, the non-drive side crank is removable, allowing for a smaller <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell.</b> Frames with either Italian or English <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell</b> diameters (independent of threading) may be fitted with Thompson bottom brackets. [...] Thompson bottom brackets are rare. The design {{is similar to a}} typical hub bearing and theoretically supports the load better, but is hard to seal effectively against dirt and water.|$|R

500|$|The {{painted turtle}} {{has a very}} similar {{appearance}} to the red-eared slider (the most common pet turtle) and the two are often confused. [...] The painted turtle can be distinguished because it is flatter than the slider. [...] Also, the slider has a prominent red marking {{on the side of}} its head (the [...] "ear") and a spotted <b>bottom</b> <b>shell,</b> both features missing in the painted turtle.|$|E
500|$|The adult {{painted turtle}} female is [...] long; the male is smaller. The turtle's top shell {{is dark and}} smooth, without a ridge. [...] Its skin is olive to black with red, orange, or yellow stripes on its extremities. [...] The {{subspecies}} can be distinguished by their shells: the eastern has straight-aligned top shell segments; the midland has a large gray mark on the bottom shell; the southern has a red line on the top shell; the western has a red pattern on the <b>bottom</b> <b>shell.</b>|$|E
500|$|The male eastern {{painted turtle}} (C.p.picta) is [...] long, while the female is [...] The upper shell is olive green to black and may possess a pale stripe {{down the middle}} and red {{markings}} on the periphery. The segments (scutes) of the top shell have pale leading edges and occur in straight rows across the back, unlike all other North American turtles, including the other three subspecies of painted turtle, which have alternating segments. The <b>bottom</b> <b>shell</b> is plain yellow or lightly spotted. Sometimes as few as one dark grey spot near the lower center of the shell.|$|E

50|$|With a {{one-piece}} (also called Ashtabula) crank {{and bottom}} bracket, the spindle and crank arms are a single piece. The <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell</b> is large to accommodate removal of this S-shaped crank. Bearing cups are {{pressed into the}} <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell.</b> The crank holds the cones, facing in; adjustment is made via the left-threaded non-drive side cone.|$|R

500|$|The painted turtle's {{shell is}} [...] long, oval, smooth with little grooves where the large scale-like plates overlap, and flat-bottomed. The {{color of the}} top shell (carapace) varies from olive to black. [...] Darker {{specimens}} are more common where {{the bottom of the}} water body is darker. The <b>bottom</b> <b>shell</b> (plastron) is yellow, sometimes red, sometimes with dark markings in the center. Similar to the top shell, the turtle's skin is olive to black, but with red and yellow stripes on its neck, legs, and tail. As with other pond turtles, such as the bog turtle, the painted turtle's feet are webbed to aid swimming.|$|E
2500|$|The gopher {{tortoise}} is {{a fairly}} large terrestrial reptile which possesses forefeet well adapted for burrowing, and elephantine hind feet. These features are common to most tortoises. The front legs have scales to protect the tortoise while burrowing. They are dark brown to gray-black in overall color, with a yellow plastron (<b>bottom</b> <b>shell).</b> A gular projection is evident on the anterior plastron where the head projects out from the shell. Sexual dimorphism is evident, with male gopher tortoises having concave plastrons, while those of females are flat. In addition, the gular projection on male plastrons is generally longer than in females. Carapace length can range from , with a height (to {{the peak of the}} shell at the middle of the body) of [...] Body mass averages , with a range of [...]|$|E

When the rear derailleur cable is routed partially along the down tube, it is also routed along the chain stay.

50|$|An {{eccentric}} is a {{cylindrical plug}} or bearing cup that fits into an enlarged <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell.</b> The plug is machined {{to accept a}} typical bottom bracket, but offset {{from the center of}} the plug, so that by rotating the plug, the location of the bottom bracket (and hence the chain tension) may be adjusted (fore and aft to tension the chain, the upper or lower eccentric position for a given chain length can be chosen to fine tune bottom bracket height). Once properly adjusted the plug is then fixed in place by a pair of set screws, a clamping <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell,</b> an expanding wedge in the plug, or the plug may be manufactured in left and right halves that clamp against the faces of the <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell</b> with screws that connect the two halves.|$|R
50|$|The largest {{subspecies}} is {{the western}} painted turtle (C. p. bellii), which grows up to 26.6 cm long. Its top shell has a mesh-like {{pattern of light}} lines, and the top stripe present in other subspecies is missing or faint.

50|$|The {{plastron}} (<b>bottom</b> <b>shell)</b> is {{yellow to}} reddish-orange {{with a dark}} pattern between scutes that follows the scute seams (this fades with age). This distinguishes it from P. floridana, which lacks the dark marks. The stripe down the hind foot is also a major characteristic, and P. suwanniensis can be distinguished by its lack of color on the legs. Females tend to grow larger than males, and have a smaller tail and more convex plastron.|$|E

The chain is folded over itself such that {{the bottom half of the}} chain is trapped between the sprocket and the upper half. The sprocket is then prevented from turning because the chain is wrapped around the bottom bracket. It is essential to take steps to protect the paintwork on the <b>bottom</b> bracket <b>shell</b> from damage by the chain.|$|R
