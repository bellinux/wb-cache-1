5000|$|The company {{announced}} on 26 January 2015 that the ACTUV autonomy software had been successfully tested {{off the coast}} of Mississippi to test sensor, maneuvering, and mission functions. Installed on a 42 ft work boat, the autonomy system navigated the complicated inshore environment of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway using only a pre-loaded navigational chart and inputs from commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) radars. The surrogate vessel traveled [...] while avoiding all obstacles, <b>buoys,</b> <b>land,</b> shoal water, and other vessels without pre-planned waypoints or human intervention. The first ACTUV, named Sea Hunter, was scheduled to launch in late fall 2015 and begin testing in the Columbia River.|$|R

With crops failing artificially inflated land prices plummeted; Eastern capital began to withdraw from the region. Banks collapsed and credit dried up. A decade of hard times followed, marked by the abandonment of entire communities. A sense of deep discontent with the current state of affairs was felt by the farmers who remained.|$|R
