40|$|International audienceBackground: <b>Blood–nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> {{disruption}} is pivotal in {{the development}} of neuroinflammation, peripheral sensitization, and neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury. Activation of toll-like receptor 4 and inactivation of Sonic Hedgehog signaling pathways within the endoneurial endothelial cells are key events, resulting in the infiltration of harmful molecules and immunocytes within the nerve parenchyma. However, we showed in a previous study that preemptive inactivation of toll-like receptor 4 signaling or sustained activation of Sonic Hedgehog signaling did not prevent the local alterations observed following peripheral nerve injury, suggesting the implication of another signaling pathway. Methods: Using a classical neuropathic pain model, the infraorbital nerve chronic constriction injury (IoN-CCI), we investigated the role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in chronic constriction injury-mediated <b>blood–nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> disruption and in its interactions with the toll-like receptor 4 and Sonic Hedgehog pathways. In the IoN-CCI model versus control, mRNA expression levels and/or immunochemical detection of major Wnt/Sonic Hedgehog pathway (Frizzled- 7, vascular endothelial-cadherin, Patched- 1 and Gli- 1) and/or tight junction proteins (Claudin- 1, Claudin- 5, and Occludin) readouts were assessed. Vascular permeability was assessed by sodium fluorescein extravasation. Results: IoN-CCI induced early alterations in the vascular endothelial-cadherin/β-catenin/Frizzled- 7 complex, shown to participate in local <b>blood–nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> disruption via a β-catenin-dependent tight junction protein downregulation. Wnt pathway also mediated a crosstalk between toll-like receptor 4 and Sonic Hedgehog signaling within endoneurial endothelial cells. Nevertheless, preemptive inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling before IoN-CCI could not prevent the downregulation of key Sonic Hedgehog pathway readouts or the disruption of the infraorbital <b>blood–nerve</b> <b>barrier,</b> suggesting that Sonic Hedgehog pathway inhibition observed following IoN-CCI is an independent event responsible for <b>blood–nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> disruption. Conclusion: A crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin- and Sonic Hedgehog-mediated signaling pathways within endoneurial endothelial cells could mediate the chronic disruption of the <b>blood–nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> following IoN-CCI, resulting in increased irreversible endoneurial vascular permeability and neuropathic pain development...|$|E

Myelin loss is a hallmark of neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer disease (Minodora and Hans 2005; Chen et al. 2011; Zavodszky et al. 2011). Myelin is also a major component of peripheral nerves.

The contralateral sciatic nerve was used as a control. We assessed changes in the nerves using Evans blue as a fluid tracer and morphological methods. Excess fluid was found in the endoneurium 1 day after cold injury, though the tight junctions between cells remained closed. From 3 to 5 days after the cold injury, the fluid was still present, but the tight junctions were open. Less tracer leakage was found from 3 to 5 days after the cold injury compared with 1 day after injury. The cold injury resulted in a breakdown of the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> function, which caused endoneurial edema. However, during the early period, the breakdown of the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> did not include the opening of tight junctions, but was due to other factors. Excessive fluid volume produced a large increase in the endoneurial fluid pressure, prevented liquid penetration into the endoneurium from the microvasculature.

Recovery of the compound muscle action potential was prompt and complete upon reperfusion following 1 hr of ischemia. However, after 3 hr of ischemia, recovery in the proximal portion of the sciatic nerve was less than 10 %, and conduction block occurred in the distal portion of the nerve. Nerve blood flow was restored to only 55 % and 45 % of resting values following 1 and 3 hr, respectively, of ischemia and did not recover even after 2 hr of reperfusion. The <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> was not statistically impaired to the passage of [14 C]sucrose following 1 hr of ischemia but was significantly impaired after 3 hr of ischemia. The permeability-surface area product was consistently greater following 1 hr of reperfusion than during the immediate reperfusion period.

40|$|International audienceRegarding nerves {{as simple}} cables and {{electrical}} conduits is a gross error {{that does not}} allow us to understand the anomalies and disorders observed postoperatively. Instead, nerves should be seen as a living tissue of which physiological regulation is as complex as that of the blood-brain barrier. This review describes the basic structure and functions of this <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> and highlights the mechanisms of its breakdown and the resultant disorders. For clinical practice, {{it is important to note}} that the diffusion of molecules from the perineurium or from the blood is very limited, and so the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> is a major pharmacologic barrier. Any stress upon neural physiological balance, particularly the terminal vascular blood supply, will induce the classic inflammatory cascade. Due to the complexity of the vascular system, nerve ischaemia will occur more quickly when the terminal blood supply is compromised. This blood supply can adapt in a variety of ways but when these possibilities of adaptation are exceeded, tissue ischaemia may be more extensive. Also, even after the initial injury has subsided, inflammation can cause a secondary insult. This could be particularly important in some patients with subclinical neuropathy...|$|E

To investigate {{the dynamics of}} glial development at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ), we developed a live imaging system to establish the relationship between glia, neuronal boutons, and the muscle subsynaptic reticulum. Using this system we observed processes from two classes of peripheral glia present at the NMJ. Processes from the subperineurial glia formed a <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> around the axon proximal to the first bouton. Processes from the perineurial glial extended beyond {{the end of the}} <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> into the NMJ where they contacted synapses and extended across non-synaptic muscle. Growth of the glial processes was coordinated with NMJ growth and synaptic activity. Increasing synaptic size through elevated temperature or the highwire mutation increased the extent of glial processes at the NMJ and conversely blocking synaptic activity and size decreased the presence and size of glial processes. We found that elevated temperature was required during embryogenesis in order to increase glial expansion at the nmj.

However, there is little agreement as to question which is more essential for intermittent claudication: ischemia or congestion. The aim of the present experimental investigation was to examine the effect of ischemia and congestion on the nerve root using dogs. The aorta was clamped as an ischemia model of the nerve root and the inferior vena cava was clamped as a congestion model at the sixth costal level for 30 min using forceps transpleurally. Measurements of blood flow, partial oxygen pressure, and conduction velocity in the nerve root were repeated over a period of 1 h after release of clamping. Finally, we examined the status of intraradicular <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> under fluorescence and transmission electron microscope. Immediately after clamping of the inferior vena cava, the central venous pressure increased by about four times and marked extravasation of protein tracers was induced in the lumbar nerve root. Blood flow, partial oxygen pressure, and conduction velocity of the nerve root were more severely affected by aorta clamp, but this ischemia model did not show any intraradicular edema. The <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> in the nerve root was more easily broken by venous congestion than by arterial ishemia.

40|$|The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a {{large family}} of zinc-dependent enzymes which are able to degrade the protein {{components}} of the extracellular matrix. They can be placed into subgroups based on structural similarities and substrate specificity. Aberrant expression of these destructive enzymes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated neuroinflammatory disorders. In this study we investigate the involvement of MMPs, from each subgroup, in Wallerian degeneration in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Wallerian degeneration describes the process initiated by transection of a nerve fibre and entails the degradation and removal of the axon and myelin from the distal stump. A similar degenerative process occurs as the final shared pathway contributing to most common neuropathies. MMP expression and localisation in the peripheral nervous system are compared with events in the CNS during Wallerian degeneration. Within 3 days after axotomy in the peripheral nervous system, MMP- 9, MMP- 7 and MMP- 12 are elevated. These MMPs are produced by Schwann cells, endothelial cells and macrophages. The temporospatial expression of activated MMP- 9 correlates with breakdown of the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier.</b> In the CNS, 1 week after optic nerve crush, four MMPs are induced and primarily localised to astrocytes, not microglia or oligodendrocytes. In the degenerating optic nerve, examined at later time points (4, 8, 12 and 18 weeks), MMP expression was down-regulated. The absence of MMPs in oligodendrocytes and mononuclear phagocytes during Wallerian degeneration {{may contribute to the}} slower removal of myelin debris observed in the CNS. The low level of the inactive pro-form of MMP- 9 in the degenerating optic nerve may explain why the blood-brain barrier remains intact, while the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> is rapidly broken down.

40|$|SummaryFollowing {{damage to}} {{peripheral}} nerves, a remarkable process of clearance and regeneration takes place. Axons downstream {{of the injury}} degenerate, while the nerve is remodeled to direct axonal regrowth. Schwann cells are important for this regenerative process. “Sensing” damaged axons, they dedifferentiate to a progenitor-like state, in which they aid nerve regeneration. Here, we demonstrate that activation of an inducible Raf-kinase transgene in myelinated Schwann cells is sufficient to control this plasticity by inducing severe demyelination {{in the absence of}} axonal damage, with the period of demyelination/ataxia determined by the duration of Raf activation. Remarkably, activation of Raf-kinase also induces much of the inflammatory response important for nerve repair, including breakdown of the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> and the influx of inflammatory cells.

Ultrastructural analysis of Gli mutants supports this notion.

40|$|Pro-inflammatory cytokines, {{including}} tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), play {{a pivotal}} role in the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a debilitating autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system. By up-regulating endothelial expression of chemokines and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), TNF-α facilitates the recruitment and trafficking of autoreactive leukocytes across the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> and into peripheral nerves, an early pathological hallmark of GBS. Literature indicates that TNF-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) are locally increased in patients with GBS, correlating with disease severity. Similar findings have been demonstrated in an animal model of GBS, experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN). Treatment options for patients with GBS are limited to nonspecific, immune-modulating strategies, including plasmapheresis and IVIg. Half of GBS patients fail to respond, and many remain severely disabled despite receiving treatment. Despite advancements, there remains a pressing need for the development of effective and specific immune-modulating therapeutic strategies for the management of GBS. Our group previously reported that statins therapeutically attenuate the course of EAN by inhibiting leukocyte migration. This dissertation project was designed to determine the mechanism(s) by which statins attenuate pathological transendothelial migration. We hypothesized that statins limit transendothelial migration of leukocytes into peripheral nerves by attenuating TNF-α-mediated, RhoGTPase-dependent secretion of chemokines by the peripheral nerve vascular endothelial cells (PNVECs) that form the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier.</b> Experiments using PNVECs are lacking, and there is no commercially available cell line. We formed a novel, immortalized cell line of PNVECs by SV 40 large T antigen transduction. We report in these cells that TNF-α increases mRNA and protein expression of MCP- 1 and ICAM- 1, and secretion of MCP- 1. Simvastatin pretreatment does not alter intracellular levels of MCP- 1 or ICAM- 1 mRNA or protein, but does markedly attenuate TNF-α-mediated MCP- 1 secretion. This effect is mimicked by a specific inhibitor of protein geranylgeranylation. Our novel findings suggest that TNF-α-mediated migration of autoreactive leukocytes into peripheral nerves during EAN proceeds, in part, by a mechanism that involves geranylgeranylation-dependent secretion of MCP- 1. We argue that identifying this precise geranylgeranylated target that mediates chemokine secretion will significantly advance the development of novel treatment options for patients with GBS...|$|E
40|$|Non-freezing cold {{injury is}} a {{prevalent}} cause of peripheral nerve damage, but its pathogenic mechanism is poorly understood, and treatment remains inadequate. Glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory and lipid peroxidation-inhibiting properties. We therefore examined whether dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid compound, would alleviate early-stage non-freezing cold injury of the sciatic nerve. We established Wistar rat models of non-freezing cold injury by exposing the left sciatic nerve to cold (3 - 5 °C) for 2 hours, then administered dexamethasone (3 mg/kg intraperitoneally) {{to half of}} the models. One day after injury, the concentration of Evans blue tracer in the injured sciatic nerve of rats that received dexamethasone was notably lower than that in the injured sciatic nerve of rats that did not receive dexamethasone; neither Evans blue dye nor capillary stenosis was observed in the endoneurium, but myelinated nerve fibers were markedly degenerated in the injured sciatic nerve of animals that received dexamethasone. After dexamethasone administration, however, endoneurial vasculopathy was markedly improved, although damage to the myelinated nerve fiber was not alleviated. These findings suggest that dexamethasone protects the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier,</b> but its benefit in non-freezing cold injury {{is limited to the}} vascular system...|$|E
40|$|Disturbancies in {{neurological}} functions {{associated with}} paraproteinaemic states are well documented. In recent years increasing {{attention has been}} given to paraproteinemia in the absence of evidence of malignancy. In this article we review the main clinical and pathological features associated with IgM paraproteins. Neurological complications affecting the central nervous system are rare, while peripheral neuropathies are frequently observed. Recent advances at the histological and molecular level have allowed a better characterization of clinical syndromes and have given new insights into their pathogenesis. The most convincing evidence for a causal relationship can be drawn from IgM monoclonal gammopathies with specificities directed against carbohydrate determinants of the myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG). There remain, however, many unresolved questions such as how monoclonal anti-MAG IgM antibodies cross the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> and trigger a chronic demyelinating polyneuropathy while the central nervous system is essentially spared. Current immune therapies for neuropathy associated with IgM paraproteins are temporarily effective in half of patients and are often associated with considerable side effects which limit their prolonged use and efficacy. The availability of safer therapies such as humanized monoclonal antibodies that eliminate specifically B-cell and B-cell precursors may open a new avenue for the management of these patients...|$|E
40|$|In Drosophila subperineurial glia (SPG) ensheath and {{insulate}} the nerve. SPG {{is under}} strict cell cycle and survival control because cell division or death {{of such a}} cell type would compromise {{the integrity of the}} <b>blood–nerve</b> <b>barrier.</b> The mechanisms underlying the survival of SPG remain unknown. Here, we show that the embryonic peripheral glia expresses the Zfh 1 transcription factor, and in zfh 1 mutants a particular SPG subtype, ePG 10, undergoes apoptosis. Our findings show that in ePG 10, Zfh 1 represses the pro-apoptotic RHG-motif gene reaper in a cell-autonomous manner. Zfh 1 also blocks the activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, and reducing or enhancing JNK signalling in zfh 1 mutants prevents or promotes ePG 10 apoptosis. Our study shows a novel function for Zfh 1 as an anti-apoptotic molecule and uncovers a cryptic JNK-dependent apoptotic programme in ePG 10, which is normally blocked by Zfh 1. We propose that, in cells such as SPG that do not undergo self-renewal and survive long periods, transcriptional control of RHG-motif gene expression together with fine tuning of JNK signalling is crucial for cell survival...|$|E
40|$|Whether the {{conduction}} abnormalities and lesions underlying {{them are}} randomly {{distributed throughout the}} peripheral nervous system (PNS) or certain regions are selectively more vulnerable to attack is an unresolved question in Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). To examine this question, 15 cases of GBS were comprehensively examined using electrophysiological techniques which allowed close examination, quantitation and comparison of conduction abnormalities in motor and sensory fibres of the upper limb between the spinal cord and the distal extremities of the nerve fibres. Comparison of these studies with results expected in a model where the chances of conduction failure were uniformly distributed led {{to the conclusion that}} conduction slowing and block were not uniformly distributed in most cases. Conduction block was maximal in the terminal segment distal to the wrist {{and to a lesser extent}} both conduction block and conduction slowing were disproportionately greater across the elbow and in the axillary to spinal root segments in over one half of the cases. These findings support the hypothesis that certain regions, perhaps because of relative deficiencies of the <b>blood-nerve</b> <b>barrier,</b> may be more vulnerable in GBS than other regions...|$|E
40|$|The endoneurial microenvironment, {{delimited by}} the {{endothelium}} of endoneurial vessels and a multi-layered ensheathing perineurium, is a specialized milieu intérieur within which axons, associated Schwann cells and other resident cells of peripheral nerves function. The endothelium and perineurium restricts {{as well as}} regulates exchange of material between the endoneurial microenvironment and the surrounding extracellular space and thus is more appropriately described as a blood–nerve interface (BNI) rather than a <b>blood–nerve</b> <b>barrier</b> (BNB). Input to and output from the endoneurial microenvironment occurs via blood–nerve exchange and convective endoneurial fluid flow driven by a proximo-distal hydrostatic pressure gradient. The independent regulation of the endothelial and perineurial components of the BNI during development, aging {{and in response to}} trauma is consistent with homeostatic regulation of the endoneurial microenvironment. Pathophysiological alterations of the endoneurium in experimental allergic neuritis (EAN), and diabetic and lead neuropathy are considered to be perturbations of endoneurial homeostasis. The interactions of Schwann cells, axons, macrophages, and mast cells via cell–cell and cell–matrix signaling regulate the permeability of this interface. A greater knowledge of the dynamic nature of tight junctions and the factors that induce and/or modulate these key elements of the BNI will increase our understanding of peripheral nerve disorders as well as stimulate the development of therapeutic strategies to treat these disorders...|$|E
