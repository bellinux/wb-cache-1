However, the island of Gozo does maintain a form of regional educational administration through the Ministry for Gozo. Although the Ministry for Education manages education throughout Malta, the Ministry for Gozo is responsible for the remuneration of the island's teaching staff. Local authorities such as Malta's numerous Local Councils have no official ties to Malta's educational system but often donate to local schools and maintain preschool <b>building</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ahead of Sina {{affecting}} the Fijian islands, from November 27 until November 29, with wind gusts {{of up to}} , hundreds of people were evacuated from Fiji's outer island resorts to hotels on the mainland. As the cyclone affected Fiji high winds and heavy rain forced the closure of several local airports and the Nadi International Airport for around 20 hours. As the cyclone moved towards the east-southeast between November 27–28, it passed near to or over the south-western coast of Viti Levu, Vatulele, Bequa, Northern Kadavu and various islands within the Moala and Southern Lau island groups and caused some coastal erosion. As it moved through the archipelago, the system destroyed or damaged houses and other <b>building</b> <b>structures,</b> while bringing down electric and telephone lines and uprooting trees. The system also severely affected crops and vegetation including sugar cane and pine forests, however {{the extent of the}} damage was limited by {{the fact that many of}} the crops had already been harvested.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat {{required}} considerable restoration in the 20th century, {{mainly the}} removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Khmer Rouge {{control of the country}} during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the <b>building</b> <b>structures</b> for firewood, a pavilion was ruined by a stray American shell, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few bullet holes in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by art thieves working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.|$|E

5|$|Gaudí's {{professional}} life was distinctive {{in that he}} never ceased to investigate mechanical <b>building</b> <b>structures.</b> Early on, Gaudí was inspired by oriental arts (India, Persia, Japan) through {{the study of the}} historicist architectural theoreticians, such as Walter Pater, John Ruskin and William Morris. The influence of the Oriental movement can be seen in works like the Capricho, the Güell Palace, the Güell Pavilions and the Casa Vicens. Later on, he adhered to the neo-Gothic movement that was in fashion at the time, following the ideas of the French architect Viollet-le-Duc. This influence is reflected in the Teresian College, the Episcopal Palace in Astorga, the Casa Botines and the Bellesguard house {{as well as in the}} crypt and the apse of the Sagrada Família. Eventually, Gaudí embarked on a more personal phase, with the organic style inspired by nature in which he would build his major works.|$|E

40|$|When a <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> {{requires}} both {{health monitoring}} system and vibration control system, integrating {{the two systems}} together will be cost-effective and beneficial for creating a smart <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> with its own sensors (nervous system), processors (brain system), and actuators (muscular system). This paper presents a real-time integrated procedure to demonstrate how health monitoring and vibration control can be integrated in real time to accurately identify time-varying structural parameters and unknown excitations on one hand, and to optimally mitigate excessive vibration of the <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> on the other hand. The basic equations for the identification of time-varying structural parameters and unknown excitations of a semi-active damper-controlled <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> are first presented. The basic equations for semi-active vibration control of the <b>building</b> <b>structure</b> with time-varying structural parameters and unknown excitations are then put forward. The numerical algorithm is finally followed {{to show how the}} identification and the control can be performed simultaneously. The results from the numerical investigation of an example building demonstrate that the proposed method is feasible and accurate. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

25|$|By 1834, an {{imperial}} townscape with broad and long roads had {{emerged as a}} result of a generous development plan, which divided Chișinău roughly into two areas: the old part of the town, with its irregular <b>building</b> <b>structures,</b> and a newer city center and station. Between 26 May 1830 and 13 October 1836 the architect Avraam Melnikov established the Catedrala Nașterea Domnului with a magnificent bell tower. In 1840 the building of the Triumphal arch, planned by the architect Luca Zaushkevich, was completed. Following this the construction of numerous buildings and landmarks began.|$|E

25|$|François Coignet was a French {{industrialist}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, {{a pioneer in the}} development of structural, prefabricated and reinforced concrete. Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete as a technique for constructing <b>building</b> <b>structures.</b> In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four story house at 72 rue Charles Michels in the suburbs of Paris. Coignet's descriptions of reinforcing concrete suggests that he did not do it for means of adding strength to the concrete but for keeping walls in monolithic construction from overturning. In 1854, English builder William B. Wilkinson reinforced the concrete roof and floors in the two-storey house he was constructing. His positioning of the reinforcement demonstrated that, unlike his predecessors, he had knowledge of tensile stresses.|$|E
25|$|Inner space {{divisions}} are fluid, and room size {{can be modified}} {{through the use of}} screens or movable paper walls. The large, single space offered by the main hall can therefore be divided according to the need. For example, some walls can be removed and different rooms joined temporarily to make space for some more guests. The separation between inside and outside is itself in some measure not absolute as entire walls can be removed, opening a residence or temple to visitors. Verandas appear {{to be part of the}} building to an outsider, but part of the external world to those in the <b>building.</b> <b>Structures</b> are therefore made to a certain extent part of their environment.
