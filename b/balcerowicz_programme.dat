40|$|The {{collapse}} of socialism in Poland means {{that our country}} returns to positions of peripheral dependence within the world economy system, which is perhaps even worse than {{at the time the}} socialist experiment began. In such situation, the main challenge or goal before Poland continues to be the overcoming of civilizational backwarndness. In Poland and in the other countries of Eastern Europe, there can be distinguished the following stages in the socio-economic transformation process. They are: stabilization, recession, and expansion. The first stage (called the <b>Balcerowicz</b> <b>Programme</b> in Poland) aimed at restoring economic equilibrium, curbing inflation and entering the path of market economy. Deflation caused recession, in which practical activity of economic units was and is verified. At the present time, Poland begins to enter the third stage, i. e. the stage of economic growth. The implementation of the transformation process, and particularly its last stage - expansion creates the only guarantee that Poland join the worldwide trend of civilizational development.

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{the most important}} phenomena and processes occurring in the Polish labour market during {{the first years of}} the systemic transformation in Poland. The analysis with the presentation of selected aspects of systemic transformation processes taking place in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The authors present the main problems (effects) and achievements of the period, when economic transformation was initiated and implemented, and show the common and individual characteristics of the situation in particular in this region. Namely, all these countries witnessed: (1) much smaller cuts in employment than in production; (2) significant drop in economic activity rates; (3) growth of long-term unemployment; and (4) increasing number of population living in poverty. Most attention, which is naturally a result of the analyzed subject, was devoted to the headway made in systemic transformation processes in Poland and their implications for the domestic labour market. Moreover, there are discussed the determinants of transformations including: a deep economic crisis, new institutional and instrumental solutions, current economic policy, external determinants and, in particular, the collapse o f trade contacts with the post-socialist countries and economic consequences of political and social factors of the real socialism period. The programme of changes commonly known as the <b>Balcerowicz</b> <b>Programme</b> was oriented at systemic changes (deregularion, liberalization and privatization) and at stabilization of the economy (fight against inflation). Its implementation was based on the set of goals, among which the following sub-sets can be distinguished: (1) strategic goals; (2) operational goals, and (3) structural goals.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} shock therapy on the Polish economy, and within it, on the motor vehicle industry. It is argued that shock therapy has not proved satisfactory as a theory of economic transformation. The following reasons are provided:- ● Shock therapy fails to provide an adequate explanation {{of the collapse of}} the command economy. Its emphasis on problems being largely monetary, rather than structural, is misguided, as this leads to the erroneous conclusion that with a strong monetary and fiscal shock, increases in utility will ensue, despite a fall in real income. ● The above may partially explain why shock therapy has failed to satisfactorily predict the outcome of the reform programmes. The assumption of post-reform growth rates following the path of a "J-Curve" has not been borne in reality. The forecasts of various improvements after {{the first year of the}} <b>Balcerowicz</b> <b>Programme</b> in Poland were, with the exception of exports, highly inaccurate. By the end of 1993 (after four years of reforms), only one indicator (inflation) registered an improvement over the respective pre-reform level. There was, therefore, no "delayed positive response". It is argued that the major reason for the failure of shock therapy reforms is that the theory largely neglects the significance of market failures. In particular, sufficient consideration has not been given to the problems of information gaps, absence of capital markets, structural rigidities, investment coordination and high levels of risk and uncertainty, all of which constrain the ability of agents to effectively respond to a liberalised economic regime. The role of careful government intervention - to attempt to remedy market failures - has been undervalued. Failure to take appropriate measures with respect to market failures most important in transforming economies has led to unnecessary costs. The case study on the motor vehicle industry provided evidence that shock therapy's policy for microeconomic restructuring - trade liberalisation in conjunction with privatisation and FBI - has not proved successful, with the notable, but unusual exception of FSM. The severe recession, in combination with strong important competition, led to a slump in sales, output, and underutilisation of capacity; leading productivity to decline from already very low levels. With respect to enterprise restructuring, it was found that this was either slow, or largely neglected in all the main determinants of plant productivity considered, i. e., work organisation, high tech capabilities, supplier network, and the Just-in-time system. In regard to management-labour relations, it was found that both parties viewed these as having improved. However, severe "macro" problems frequently override the purportedly better relations at the micro level, so that considerable friction remains - which occasionally spill over into major disputes that act against the restructuring process. The industry has experienced a severe contraction in capacity utilisation and employment - a fact that is very much at odds with the government's wish to preserve the bulk of the industry. It is concluded that an industrial policy for the motor sector would have been more appropriate than the policy that has hitherto been used. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the paper is a {{qualitative}} analysis and an attempt to evaluate the level of transformation of the Polish economy {{five years after the}} government stabilisation programme' was implemented at the end of 1989. The programme was also known as Leszek <b>Balcerowicz's</b> <b>programme,</b> who was deputy Prime Minister at the time. The essential question to be answered now is: to what extent have the basic pi-inciples of market economy (stable, convertible currency, market mechanisms as the main form of the functioning of the economy, and privatisation of the economy being the condition of a microeconomic rationality) have been implemented. The fact is that the private sector has gained a dominant position and therefore {{it can be said that}} the threshold towards market economy has been passed. And yet, the overall level of transformations is not satisfactory. A strong 'non-market' sector related to the state industiy, closed to market economy principles and demanding central planning is still there. It is also feared that this 'duality of systems' in which the state assumes the role of 'director' of an economic system based on two sets of principles, which obviously has a negative influence on the efficiency of any economic activity, will get even better established. High inflation and consequently expensive credit facilities discourage from investing; public finances deteriorate, public debt is increasing. The State has limited possibilities of action. What is more, there is a strong opposition to the privatisation of large state owned enterprises which continue to be centrally financed, regardless of their performance and results. All this clearly shows that the conditions of a successful completion of the transformation process in Poland are as follows: 1) the duality of systems has to be overcome, and the State must assume a role of a sovereign; 2) inflation must be combatted more efficiently and budgetaiy spending must be further reduced; 3) privatisation must be accelerated, and microeconomic rationality must be consistently implemented in the State sector. These are the necessary conditions for investment expansion and the economy being able to regain its capabilities of producing economic surplus.
