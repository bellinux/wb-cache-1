500|$|Wonderland was {{released}} for the Christmas market, and was labelled {{as a potential}} Christmas number one. Smith embarked on a promotional tour, beginning {{at the end of}} October, with magazine, television and radio appearances. Appearances included Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, Sky News Sunrise, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The Paul O'Grady Show. Speaking about the album's promotion, Smith said [...] "t is always a struggle when a second album comes out <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> how it is going to do but fingers crossed people will enjoy it. I am very proud of it. ... I am excited about going on all the shows too – especially Ready Steady Cook because I can't cook and I think it will be fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Forrest Wickman of Slate {{magazine}} defended Beyoncé's {{choice to}} use the sample, and criticized the media reports for their [...] "dismissive" [...] interpretation of the song's [...] "vague" [...] lyrics as being about [...] "a girl in a relationship". According to Wickman, the lyrics of the song refer to mortality and [...] "the urgency of spending time with the ones you love before you lose them, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> when that could be"; this {{is shown in the}} hook lines, [...] "Baby kiss me / Before they turn the lights out / You better kiss me / Before our time has run out." [...] A similar interpretation was voiced by Douglas Wolk of Wired, who challenged the notion of the sample being simply a [...] "trivialization", instead describing it as [...] "a swift, understated and brutal reminder that everything can go horribly wrong before anyone understands what's happening, and that the light could be extinguished at any moment". Wickman concluded, [...] "If there's anything anyone should know by now about Beyoncé Knowles, it's that there's nothing in her self-presentation that isn't carefully chosen." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, {{at the age}} of 26 {{and eight}} months after being married, Blumenherst {{announced}} that she would take a leave from professional golf {{to spend more time with}} her husband. She said: [...] "I don’t want to say I’m retiring, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> what will happen. Maybe I’ll decide in a couple years to come back, and this will just be a little break, you never know." [...] The couple has two sons, William David, born in November 2014, and Charles Alexander, born in December 2016.|$|E

5000|$|Blackmore {{was unhappy}} about {{carrying}} the Elf line-up along for live performances, {{and so he}} fired everybody except Dio shortly after the album was recorded, due to Driscoll's style of drumming and the funky bass playing of Gruber. Blackmore would continue to dictate personnel {{for the remainder of}} the band's lifetime, with drummer and former bandmate Ricky Munro remarking [...] "he was very difficult to get on with <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> when he would turn around and say 'You're sacked'." [...] Blackmore recruited bassist Jimmy Bain, American keyboard player Tony Carey and drummer Cozy Powell, who had previously worked with Jeff Beck and had some solo success. Powell also greatly appealed to Blackmore in their mutual fondness for practical jokes.|$|R
5000|$|Among the {{different}} costume sets and themes for Charmin Chatty were [...] "Lets Play Together", [...] "Lets Go Shopping", [...] "Lets Play Nurse", [...] "Lets Play Cinderella", [...] "Lets Play Birthday Party", [...] "Lets Play Pajama Party", and [...] "Lets Play Tea Party". One outfit called [...] "Lets Talk n Travel in Foreign Lands" [...] came with 4 double-sided records {{and allowed the}} doll to speak in English and 6 other languages. Sometimes referred to as Charmin Chattys travel set, {{this is the most}} sought-after outfit by collectors. It included a navy blue coat, red straw hat, and blue shoes for the doll, plus a flight bag and stewardess hat for the child to wear (the idea being Charmin Chatty was going on an around-the-world airplane trip and the child was the stewardess). Phrases included on the travel set records were, [...] "The Queen lives in Buckingham Palace", [...] "Garçon means boy in French", and [...] "In German, Shule means school". Included in each set were props for the child to wear or use. One of the phrases on the record accompanying Charmin Chattys shopping outfit was, [...] "Shall we buy a Barbie doll?" [...] There were also four [...] "Chatty Games" [...] available, packaged in sets of two games each, which came with a record that allowed the doll to call out game moves when its string was pulled. <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>knew</b> what phrase the doll would say, Charmin Chatty could call out a move, and using the specially designed game board... she could win the game herself! The game titles were, [...] "Chatty at the Fair/Chatty Skate N Slide" [...] and [...] "Chatty Animal Round-up/Chatty Animal Friends".|$|R
2500|$|In 2013, Clarkson {{released}} her first Christmas album, Wrapped in Red, which to her represented a beginning {{for a second}} phase for her career. In the midst of recording it, she also collaborated with recording artists Robbie Williams, Martina McBride and Trisha Yearwood in their respective albums Swings Both Ways (2013), Everlasting (2014) and [...] (2014). In an interview with Billboard magazine, she announced intentions to release a set of pop and country records, {{as well as a}} potential Broadway album, as a follow-up to Wrapped in Red. RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge also revealed in their 2014 mid-year assessment that they were in a process of finding new music and directions for some of their established acts — primarily with Clarkson. Early stages of development for a follow-up studio album began as early as June 2012, with Clarkson commissioning Rodney Jerkins in recording a potential track. She remarked: [...] "We're already working. I'm constantly like that <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> when you're going to find a song and so we're always working on the next thing." [...] The follow-up album would complete the terms of her recording contract with RCA Records and 19 Recordings, which was signed following her win on the first season of the television competition American Idol in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur {{became one}} of EastEnders best loved characters, and his {{reputation}} as an eternal loser endeared him to viewers. In 1995 audiences were shocked and horrified when Arthur was framed for the embezzlement of the Flowering Wilderness Campaign funds and wrongfully imprisoned. There was a public outcry and a nationwide Free Arthur Fowler campaign was launched. 'Arthur Fowler Is Innocent' T-shirts were produced and a single was even released in the UK singles chart promoting the campaign. [...] Eventually the truth came out and Arthur was released. However, a gash to the head he had sustained in prison led to a brain haemorrhage and Arthur died suddenly in 1996 shortly after his release. Off-screen Bill Treacher had asked to be written out of the series after eleven years playing Arthur, saying: [...] "By the time I finished, even {{the sound of the}} theme music was making me feel ill. I felt depressed." [...] Although it was his decision to leave the soap, Treacher was shocked that the show’s bosses chose to kill Arthur off. He has said: [...] "I certainly didn’t ask them to kill him. Oh no, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know,</b> you might need to come back and earn a few grand." [...] Treacher also stated in a 2003 interview that he was forced to resign from the show in the end due to the negative effect it was having on his health.|$|E

2500|$|The {{approval}} {{came after}} nearly two years of lobbying governments in both the United States and Canada. In October 2010, Wallenda was approached by Roger Trevino, the {{executive vice president of}} Niagara Falls Redevelopment, at an amusement trade show. [...] Trevino later recalled: [...] "I went up to Wallenda and said ‘Have you ever thought about walking across the falls?’ and he said, ‘ever since I was a little kid,’ and then he asked about the steps involved." [...] Wallenda later remarked [...] "I believe people are brought into my life for a reason... I take everyone seriously <b>because</b> <b>you</b> just <b>never</b> <b>know</b> [...] ". [...] Trevino next contacted New York State Senator George Maziarz. [...] After Maziarz met Wallenda, he went to work at drafting a bill granting Wallenda a one-time exemption to the state's anti-stunting laws. [...] Dennis H. Gabryszak co-sponsored the bill, and it passed the State Senate and Assembly nearly unanimously. [...] The bill was signed into law by governor Andrew Cuomo on September 23, 2011.|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, {{frontman}} Josh Homme {{was hospitalized}} for thirteen days, and subsequently bedridden for four months, following complications during a routine surgical procedure on his knee. Homme noted, [...] "I {{woke up and}} there was a doctor going, ‘Shit, we lost you.' I couldn’t get up for four months. When I did, I hadn’t got a clue what was going on." [...] During this time, Homme sank into a deep depression, noting [...] "I would never say, 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' But back then, I would definitely think it." [...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album. Homme noted, [...] "I had to ask them 'If {{you want to make a}} record with me right now, in the state I’m in, come into the fog. It's the only chance you got.' It brought us much closer, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> really <b>know</b> someone till everything goes wrong." ...|$|R

We in revolt talk all kind of {{nonsense}} doubtless about this crime or that crime of the Government. It is all folly! The only crime of the Government is that it governs. The unpardonable sin of the supreme power {{is that it is}} supreme. I do not curse you for being cruel. I do not curse you (though I might) for being kind. I curse you for being safe! You sit in your chairs of stone, and have never come down from them. You are the seven angels of heaven, and you have had no troubles. Oh, I could forgive you everything, you that rule all mankind, if I could feel for once that you had suffered for one hour a real agony such as I--" ...|$|R
60|$|Unaware of {{the tragedy}} being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a little time after the {{children}} left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself {{that he did not}} care. Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked them inside it, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know</b> that you may not grow chilly {{at the turn of the}} night. Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it.|$|E

Call to the {{hospital}} to see. Hope she's over. Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan's. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But Dignam's put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so depressing <b>because</b> <b>you</b> <b>never</b> <b>know.</b> Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we're going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer's that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium. Her widow's mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O'Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron. Ladies' grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does? Would I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti's gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes's. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in them. What's that? Might be money.|$|E
