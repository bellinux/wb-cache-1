These evolution functions are the forward local variance rate and a new concept called the forward local default arrival rate.

This is a standard assumption when valuing an option written on a stock which can default. We discuss novel strategies for calibrating to a term and strike structure of European options prices. In particular using a few calendar dates, we derive closed form expressions for both the local variance and the local default arrival rate.

The average price for transferring a unit of expected default risk, paid in a transaction, is inversely related to the default probability of the underlying asset pool.

The main concerns are the low-rate environment {{and exposure to}} negative interest rates in these models. We begin by introducing financial markets and the mathematical models explaining them. Further we discuss {{the problem with the}} current low-rate environment and the historical market practice. The focuses are implementations of two multi-factor interest rate models and the presence of negative interest rates. The historical data is provided by DNB and consists of zero coupon swap rates for several maturities in the period 2000 - 2012. The volatility factors are derived from historical data using principal component analysis and covariance matrices. With today?s yield curve the probability of negative rates is highly significant in the HJM model, whereas it is zero in LMM because of lognormality. Monte Carlo is used on the models to compare prices of caps and floors. We show that the models do not produce the same price especially around strikes near the current 3 -month rates.

40|$|Abstract—In Grid environments, where virtual {{organization}} resources are allocated to users using mechanisms analogue to market economies, strong price fluctuations {{can have an}} impact on the nontrivial quality-of-service expected by end users. In this paper, we investigate the effects of the use of option contracts on the quality of service offered by a broker-based Grid resource allocation model. Option contracts offer users the possibility to buy or sell Grid resources in the future for a strike price specified in a contract. By buying, borrowing and selling option contracts using a hedge strategy users can benefit from expected price changes. In this paper, we consider three hedge strategies: the <b>butterfly</b> <b>spread</b> which profits from small changes, the straddle which benefits from large price changes, and the call strategy which benefits from soaring prices. Using our model based on an abstract Grid architecture, we find that the use of hedge strategies augment the ratio of successfully finished jobs to failed jobs. We show that the degree of successfulness from hedge strategies changes when the number of contributed resources changes. By means of a model, we also show that the effects of the <b>butterfly</b> <b>spread</b> is mainly explained by the amount of contributed resources. The dynamics of the two other hedge strategies are best explained by observing the price behavior. We also find that by using hedge strategies the users can increase the probability that a job will finish before the deadline. We conclude that hedging using options is a promising approach to improve resource allocation in environments where resources are allocated by using a commodity market mechanism.

40|$|Options {{constitute}} {{integral part}} of modern financial trades, and are priced according to the risk associated with buying or selling certain asset in future. Financial literature mostly concentrates on risk-neutral methods of pricing options such as Black- Scholes model. However, using trading agents with utility function to determine the option’s potential payoff is an emerging field in option pricing theory. In this paper, we use one of such methodologies developed by Othman and Sandholm to design portfolioholding agents that are endowed with popular option portfolios such as bullish spread, bearish spread, <b>butterfly</b> <b>spread,</b> straddle, etc to price options. Agents use their portfolios to evaluate how buying or selling certain option would change their current payoff structure. We also develop a multi-unit direct double auction which preserves the atomicity of orders {{at the expense of}} budget balance. Agents are simulated in this mechanism and the emerging prices are compared to risk-neutral prices under different market conditions. Through an appropriate allocation of option portfolios to trading agents, we can simulate market conditions where the population of agents are bearish, bullish, neutral or non-neutral in their beliefs...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} out-of-time ordered thermal {{correlation}} functions (OTOC) in holographic systems and in solvable models {{such as the}} Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model have yielded new insights into manifestations of many-body chaos. So far the chaotic behavior has been obtained through explicit calculations in specific models. In this {{paper we propose a}} unified description of the exponential growth and ballistic <b>butterfly</b> <b>spreading</b> of OTOCs across different systems using a newly formulated "quantum hydrodynamics," which is valid at finite ħ and to all orders in derivatives. The scrambling of a generic few-body operator in a chaotic system is described as building up a "hydrodynamic cloud," and the exponential growth of the cloud arises from a shift symmetry of the hydrodynamic action. The shift symmetry also shields correlation functions of the energy density and flux, and time ordered correlation functions of generic operators from exponential growth, while leads to chaotic behavior in OTOCs. The theory also predicts an interesting phenomenon of the skipping of a pole at special values of complex frequency and momentum in two-point functions of energy density and flux. This pole-skipping phenomenon may be considered as a "smoking gun" for the hydrodynamic origin of the chaotic mode. Comment: 48 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

In terms of total volume, the four most heavily traded combinations are (in order) : straddles, ratio spreads, vertical spreads, and strangles.

40|$|Boyle and Vorst {{work in the}} {{framework}} of the binomial model and derive self-financing strategies perfectly replicating the final payoffs to long and short positions in call and put options, assuming proportional transactions costs on trades in the stock and no transactions costs on trades in the bond. Even when the market is arbitrage-free and a given contingent claim has a unique replicating portfolio, there may exist super replicating portfolios of lower cost. Bensaid et al. gave conditions under which the cost of the replicating portfolio does not exceed the cost of any super replicating portfolio. These results were generalized by Stettner, Rutkowski and Palmer to the case of asymmetric transaction costs. In this paper, we first determine the number of replicating portfolios and then compute the least cost super replicating portfolio for any contingent claim in a one-period binomial model. By using the fundamental theorem of linear programming, we show that there are only finitely many possibilities for a least cost super replicating portfolio for any contingent claim in a two-period binomial model. As an application of our results, we give an example in which we compute the least cost super replicating portfolio for a <b>butterfly</b> <b>spread</b> in a two-period model.

40|$|The two-price market {{theory is}} based on a new {{performance}} measure - acceptability indices, and provides a new way to describe incomplete markets. Unlike the classical option pricing theory, in which the risk-neutral measure is unique and derivatives are bought or sold at the same prices, in two-price markets - the uniqueness of risk-neutral measure is not guaranteed, and derivative prices are determined by the direction of the trade. Based on the two-price market theory, this dissertation presents an argument for the advantages of trading options spreads and exotic options from investors' point of view. It is shown that from the investors' perspective, the price of buying these products is always lower than the price of trading their-component options separately, and the price of selling these options is always higher than the price of trading their-component options separately. The trading advantages of bull, bear, strangle and <b>butterfly</b> <b>spreads,</b> as well as cliquet options, reverse cliquet options and spread options, are illustrated with mathematical proofs and numerical work. We also investigated the role of volatility, maturity, stress level and market skewness in the trading benefits of these products. It is observed that the greater the complexity of structured products, the greater packaging benefits of trading them. Moreover, an investigation of liquidity risk implied by market option bid and ask prices was conducted. The liquidity risk parameter included in option bid and ask prices is modeled as a nonlinear function of strike prices and a linear function of maturities. The Variance Gamma Scaled Self-Decomposable process is used to model the risk-neutral process of the underlying asset. Calibration using market option bid and ask prices could help to reveal the model parameters. The analysis is performed on quarterly SPX, NDX and DJX options for the years 2007 - 2010. A detailed structure of the implied liquidity parameter suggests that call options are more liquid than put options.

40|$|AALTO UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS ABSTRACT Department of Economics December 2012 Henna Karhapää IMPLIED CRASH RISK IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTIONS - ANALYSIS OF EUR-USD VOLATILITY CURVES Objective of {{the study}} Objective {{of the study}} is to examine foreign {{exchange}} options and market expectations embedded in option prices about the possibility of currency crashes. The thesis describes a procedure for estimating the market assessment of currency crash risk from option implied volatility curves with jump-diffusion option pricing model for exchange rates. This method is used to construct time series of option-implied crash risk measures. Additionally, the study examines economic determinants of implied crash risk over the period from January 5, 2006 to December 30, 2011. Data Data set consists of dollar-euro foreign exchange option daily quotes of 1 month, 3 month, 6 month and 1 year at-the-money volatilities, 25 -delta and 10 -delta risk reversals and 25 -delta and 10 -delta <b>butterfly</b> <b>spreads</b> from January 5, 2006 to December 30, 2011. Each series contain 1562 observations for a total of 31 240 observations. Results Results show that shorter maturity options are pricing in higher frequency of jumps but lower magnitude jumps, and the longer maturity options are pricing less frequent, higher magnitude jumps. Jump volatility is increasing with maturity and jumps are found to contribute the most to the prices of the longer options. The implied parameters are used to construct time-series of three crash risk measures: expected jumps per year, risk-neutral skewness and crash probability. Expected jumps per year, that indicates the frequency and the magnitude of jumps, is highest for the shortest options and decreases as the time to maturity increases. During the sample period this crash risk measure ranges from 9 percent to - 27 percent. The risk-neutral skewness measure indicates asymmetry of the left and right tails of the risk-neutral distribution. The yearly skewness estimations range from 0, 14 to - 1, 0. Crash probability indicates the option-implied probability that the exchange rate would depreciate more than a certain level during a time interval. Probability estimates are calculated for three crash levels: - 15 %, - 20 % and - 25 %. The empirical section of this thesis shows that sovereign long-term bond yield, stock market and the spot exchange rate are the best performing determinants of option implied crash risk. Crash risk increases when the spread between US sovereign bond yields and euro area sovereign bond yields increases. Higher crash risk is associated with relative underperformance of European stock market compared to the US stock market. Weekly changes of the spot exchange rate are the best variable explaining weekly changes of crash risk.
