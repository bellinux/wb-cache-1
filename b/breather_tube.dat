50|$|Even though Kristar {{uses the}} same engine as Kriss, Modenas claimed that Kristar {{achieved}} better fuel economy of 46.95 km/L @ 90 km/h, compared with Kriss with the fuel economy of 44 km/L @ 90 km/h. The increase of fuel economy {{is due to the}} installation of the fuel tank <b>breather</b> <b>tube</b> connected to the inlet manifold for better fuel emission and better fuel economy.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines is {{conducting}} research on cable bolt ground supports to assess their material and support properties, to provide design criteria for using cable bolt supports as roof control systems under various types of underground mining conditions, {{and to provide a}} mathematical model of cable bolt support systems. Part 1 describes laboratory studies of the support properties of cable bolts made of conventional steel cables and provides recommendations on such topics as the use of thick grouts, selection of <b>breather</b> <b>tubes,</b> and reduction of water bleeding in cement-based grouts. The studies evaluated both single and double cables; effects of different embedment lengths, water-cement ratios, and grout curing temperatures on support strength; effects of use or nonuse of breather tubes; pumpability and water-bleeding properties of grouts; and the strength properties of sand-cement grouts. Part 2 will cover the strength characteristics of birdcage cable bolt supports, epoxy-coated cables, and cables with steel buttons attached...|$|R
