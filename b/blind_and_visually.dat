40|$|In {{the late}} 90 s {{different}} options {{has been established}} for media supported learning, so-called e-learning. The underlying mechanisms provide an appropriate platform for a novel learning environment that might help the <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> severely <b>visually</b> impaired. The options represent visual information provided by tactile analogies. A haptic device is used, i. e., a hardware device that helps present tactile information. The haptic device can generate a tactile representation of geometric objects and physical bodies. This can be provided with or without visual information and/or a teacher’s instructions. Respective requirements have been met by developing the prototypical software make 2 Dhaptic. In this paper applications of the haptic device and make 2 Dhaptic in combination with histological slides are discussed. The results of initial tests are promising...|$|R
40|$|The <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> the <b>visually</b> {{impaired}} are in {{a unique}} position to appreciate and make functional use of haptic devices. Designing devices for the blind is, however, more arduous than many researchers and inventors expect. It is thus important to fully understand the needs and requirements of that community before attempting to create devices for them. It is also important to learn from past research and development in the application of technology for the blind. This survey provides an overview of current knowledge on blindness and rehabilitation technology relevant for the design of aids for the <b>blind,</b> <b>and</b> more particularly for the use of haptics with the blind. The survey begins with a demystification of blindness and a discussion of the differences between <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> sighted.

40|$|Imaging, {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation, and psychophysiological {{recordings of}} the congenitally blind have confirmed functional activation of the visual cortex but have not extensively explained the functional significance of these activation patterns in detail. This review systematically examines research {{on the role of}} the visual cortex in processing spatial and non-visual information, highlighting research on individuals with early and late onset blindness. Here, we concentrate on the methods utilized in studying visual cortical activation in early blind participants, including positron emissions tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and electrophysiological data, specifically event-related potentials (ERPs). This paper summarizes and discusses findings of these studies.

40|$|The Braille {{system is}} a tactile {{language}} where each element is represented by a cell with six dot positions, arranged in three rows and two columns. Each dot position can be raised or otherwise allowing different configurations which can be felt by trained fingers. For caregivers with normal sights, training their fingers is not naturally easy. This paper presents an image processing approach to Braille dots recognition with alphanumeric conversion, whereby a person with normal eyesight is able to translate a raw Braille image captured by a mobile camera into the corresponding alphanumeric texts. Image pre-processing relies heavily on various segmentation algorithms in the MATLAB image processing Toolbox. This application is hoped to help the <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> the <b>visually</b> impaired {{community as well as}} their caregivers to translate Braille texts digitally, hence enhancing the communication and collaboration possibilities. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{designed}} and built a haptically enhanced mouse for <b>blind</b> <b>and</b> severely <b>visually</b> impaired computer users. A haptic mouse uses tactile feedback to convey information about the cursor position on the screen. A basic trackball mouse was modified to include a brake to indicate when the pointer reaches {{the edge of the}} screen and a vibrating motor that alerts the user when the pointer passes over an icon or the edge of a window. In addition, an audio feedback feature was developed that provides information about what the pointer is over. The mouse connects through the USB port to a computer running Linux. A GUI in Java was developed to test the functionality of the mouse. Although there was a large variation in the performance of our test subjects, the results indicated that users who are unable to read the screen can locate and identify objects faster with haptic and speech feedback than with only speech feedback. They also demonstrated that users can determine basic spatial relationships between objects on a screen through exploration using the haptic mouse...|$|R
