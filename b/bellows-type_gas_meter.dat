40|$|Two {{different}} methods for measuring biogas production were used, <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> and gasbags. The <b>gas</b> <b>meters</b> were electronic and counted {{each time a}} certain gasvolume passed through them. The gasbags collected the gas that hade passed through the <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> until a manual measuring could be done. The two {{different methods}} gave the same result for a volume at three liters but for a volume around 0, 2 liters they did not. Accuracy and precision for the gasbags was more exact than for the <b>gas</b> <b>meters</b> even if the method was difficult {{with a lot of}} different elements that could affect the result. The gasbag method was more complicated and took longer time than the <b>gas</b> <b>meter,</b> which was an easy working technic that wasn´t time consuming. But both of the methods gave a fall off. For the gasbags the values falled off because of leakage and for the <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> it falled off because of dubble counting and that the meters stopped count for a while. The advantage of the gasbags is that you can measure the gas total compound. The benefit of the <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> is that you can measure changes in the gas flow over time...|$|R

This {{project is}} focused on the {{performance}} curve of <b>gas</b> <b>metering</b> calibration system for low pressure low flow rate domestic <b>gas</b> <b>meter.</b> Visual Basic 6. 0 has been employed to carry out comparison of the calibration performance curve. Data gathered from previous work will be used to enable performance comparison. Wet type <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> will be used as the reference meter in order to calibrate domestic <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> due to its high accuracy and suitable operating condition at low pressure and low flow rate. Diaphragm <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> has been selected as predominant domestic <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> that normally represents common domestic <b>gas</b> <b>meter</b> application as a gas-measuring device. From the experiment, several operating condition will be carried out to obtain high accuracy measurement to calibrate the diaphragm meter with flow capacity up to 1. 20 m 3 /hr at an operating pressure of 35 milibar (14 inches water column), with setting temperature of 19 °C to 23 °C. The operation of calibration process incorporates the use of three types of test fluid namely; compressed air, nitrogen and liquefied petroleum gas. Results obtained show that pressure drop increases when flow rate increases and error of new meters increases with the increasing of flow rate until a maximum point reached at less than 2. 0 %.
