5|$|As can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> diagram, {{the unusual}} {{shape of the}} Paragon made it very {{complicated}} to build. Engineering and factory translated the design into one executable on the shop floor. After overcoming the manufacturing challenges posed by the curved refractor panels and the cabinet legs, the speaker entered production in late 1957.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1088 and {{the early}} 15th century, the unusual {{features}} of Chichester Cathedral are a Transitional retro choir, a pair of early Norman relief carvings and its freestanding belfry of the 15th century.

5|$|Discovered by Dick McCloskey and Annette Posen of the Harvard Meteor Program in 1959, the Leonis Minorid {{meteor shower}} peaks between October18 and October29.

5|$|Nairobi National Park is a {{national}} park in Kenya. Established in 1946, the national park was Kenya's first. It is located approximately 7 kilometres (4mi) south of the centre of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, with an electric fence separating the park's wildlife from the metropolis. Nairobi's skyscrapers can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> park. The proximity of urban and natural environments has caused conflicts between the animals and local people and threatens animals' migration routes.|$|E

5|$|The {{industry}} is {{celebrated in the}} form of the Willow Man (sometimes known as the Angel of the South), a willow sculpture, 40feet (12.2m) tall, produced by artist Serena de la Hey in September 2000 that can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> railway and the M5 motorway to the north of Bridgwater. At Stoke St Gregory there is also a Willows and Wetlands Visitor Centre.|$|E

5|$|Troglita's {{success in}} {{restoring}} peace to Africa can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that in}} late 551, when Totila, king of the Ostrogoths, captured Sardinia and Corsica, Troglita was able to spare enough forces and send a fleet to reclaim them, albeit without success. The exact date of Troglita's death is unknown, but it is most likely that he died in 552 or soon after.|$|E
5|$|According to De ponderibus et mensuris, {{a famous}} 13th century text {{that exists in}} {{numerous}} variations and is often ascribed to Dino di Garbo, the system of weights used in Salerno {{was different from the}} systems used in Padua and Bologna. As can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> table, it was also different from the Roman weight system used by Galenus and Dioscorides and from all modern apothecaries' systems: The ounce was divided into 9drachms, rather than 8drachms.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.|$|E

5|$|Image Lake is a tarn in Glacier Peak Wilderness, in the North Cascades of Washington, United States. The lake is {{surrounded}} by Plummer Peak to the east, a lookout point to the west, the Miners Creek drainage and Glacier Peak to the south, and Canyon Lake to the north. The course of the popular Miners Ridge Trail skirts the lake. Glacier Peak can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outlet of the lake, and the peak reflected in the lake is a popular photographic subject.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in the distance that can <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tops of the hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of}} the Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac.|$|E
