25|$|At the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>year</b> 1918–19, Slovakia had 3,642 {{elementary}} schools. Only 141 schools {{taught in}} the Slovak language, 186 in Slovak and Hungarian and 3,298 in Hungarian. This large deformation was {{a direct result of}} previous magyarization activities of the Hungarian government. After system reform, Czechoslovakia provided an educational network for the Hungarian minority which was several times larger than the Kingdom of Hungary had for the whole Slovak nation before 1918. Due to the lack of qualified personnel among Slovaks – a lack of schools above elementary level, banned grammar schools and no Slovak teacher institutes – Hungarian teachers were replaced in large numbers by Czechs. Some Hungarian teachers resolved their existential question by moving to Hungary. According to government regulation from 28 August 1919, Hungarian teachers were permitted to teach only if they took an oath of allegiance to Czechoslovakia.|$|E
