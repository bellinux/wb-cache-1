25|$|<b>Bloodborne</b> was {{announced}} at Sony Computer Entertainment's 2014 Electronic Entertainment Expo media briefing on June 9, 2014. A trailer was shown. In January 2015, <b>Bloodborne</b> became Game Informers readers' most anticipated game of 2015. The game was originally {{planned to be}} released on February 6, 2015, but it was delayed to March 2015. <b>Bloodborne</b> was released on March 24, 2015 in North America, March 25, 2015 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, March 26, 2015 in Japan, and March 27, 2015 in the United Kingdom and Ireland.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bloodborne</b> {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon release. It holds an aggregated score of 92/100 on Metacritic based on 100 reviews.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bloodbornes</b> soundtrack was {{composed}} by {{a mix of}} Japanese and Western composers. The soundtrack contains over 80 minutes of original music by Tsukasa Saitoh, Yuka Kitamura, Nobuyoshi Suzuki, Ryan Amon, Cris Velasco and Michael Wandmacher and features performances by a 65-piece orchestra and a 32-member choir. The development of the soundtrack lasted for around {{two and a half}} years.|$|R
25|$|<b>Bloodbornes</b> {{world of}} Yharnam {{is a large}} map full of areas that are {{connected}}. Some areas of Yharnam are not connected to the main locations and require the player to teleport there via the gravestones in the Hunter's Dream. Players are usually presented with multiple options when progressing through locations; usually there is a main path that the player uses to progress through the story. When traversing the main path, the player will encounter paths that lead to completely different locations that are optional. Each path also eventually leads back to the central area the player started in. This provides players with shortcuts, useful for when they die or need to backtrack.|$|R
25|$|Combat is fast-paced and {{requires}} an offensive approach {{in order for}} players to combat dense hordes of enemies. The player character is agile {{and is able to}} dodge attacks by strafing around enemies while locked on. The new risk-and-reward style of gameplay is emphasized through <b>Bloodbornes</b> Rally system, which allows the player to, within a small window of time, recover portions of lost health by striking an enemy. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki explained that this is representative of the player's increased will to continue after successfully striking an enemy. A New Game Plus mode is also present; after the player has finished the game, a new game will immediately be started. New Game Plus is optional, players retain all their equipment, and the game is harder than the previous play through.|$|R

25|$|The game sold 152,567 {{physical}} retail copies {{within the}} first week of release in Japan, ranking first place within the Japanese software sales charts for that particular week. <b>Bloodborne</b> debuted at number two in the UK software retail chart, behind Battlefield Hardline by 22,500 units. In North America, <b>Bloodborne</b> was the second best selling software in March, despite being released {{at the end of the}} month. By April 2015, the game had sold over one million copies, and by September 2015, the game had over two million copies sold. Soon after release, Sony stated that the game's sales exceeded their expectations.|$|E
25|$|Sony Denmark {{teamed up}} with Danish {{organization}} GivBlod {{in order to encourage}} blood donations through a program where donators who donated on March 23, 2015, would receive a chance to win <b>Bloodborne</b> as a gift.|$|E

Some areas of Yharnam are not connected to the main locations and require the player to teleport there via the gravestones in the Hunter's Dream. Players are usually presented with multiple options when progressing through locations; usually there is a main path that the player uses to progress through the story. When traversing the main path, the player will encounter paths that lead to completely different locations that are optional. Each path also eventually leads back to the central area the player started in. This provides the player with shortcuts, useful for when they die. There are many locations in the game; Forsaken Castle Cainhurst, a large, intricate castle situated away from Yharnam in a snowy environment; Upper Cathedral Ward, a cathedral {{that is home to}} one of the game's Covenants, The Choir; Abandoned Old Workshop, the 'real' location of the Hunter's Dream; Yahar'gul, Unseen Village, a location the Hunter may be forcibly taken to that features some of the most dangerous enemies in the game; and Hemwick Charnel Lane, a forest clearing full of the game's witch enemies, are some of the game's locations.|$|R
25|$|At the SCEJA Press Conference for the 2015 Tokyo Game Show, an {{expansion}} pack for <b>Bloodborne</b> was announced, titled The Old Hunters. Released on November 24, 2015, the expansion takes place within {{a world where}} hunters of the past are trapped, and features new weapons, outfits and arcane items.|$|E
25|$|Screenshots and a {{gameplay}} trailer of {{the game}} were leaked on the Internet weeks before the official reveal, under the title of Project Beast. Many believed {{at the time that}} the leak could be connected to Demon's Souls. However, Miyazaki later stated that <b>Bloodborne</b> was never considered to be Demon's Souls II, due to Sony Computer Entertainment wanting a new intellectual property (IP) for the PlayStation 4.|$|E
25|$|Etiology, {{the modern}} branch of science {{that deals with}} the causes of {{infectious}} disease, recognizes five major modes of disease transmission: airborne, waterborne, <b>bloodborne,</b> by direct contact, and through vector (insects or other creatures that carry germs from one species to another). As humans began traveling over seas and across lands which were previously isolated, research suggests that diseases have been spread by all five transmission modes.|$|E
25|$|An early theory {{asserted}} that {{a series of}} inoculations against hepatitis B that were performed in the gay community of San Francisco were tainted with HIV. Although there was a high correlation between recipients of that vaccination and initial cases of AIDS, this theory has long been discredited. HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are <b>bloodborne</b> diseases with very similar modes of transmission, and those at risk for one {{are at risk for}} the others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bloodborne</b> is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game played from a third-person perspective and features elements {{similar to those}} found in the Souls series of games, particularly Demon's Souls and Dark Souls. Players make their way through different locations within the decrepit Gothic world of Yharnam, while battling varied enemies, including bosses, collecting different types of useful items that have many uses, interacting with the strange non-player characters, opening up shortcuts, and continuing through the main story.|$|E
25|$|Soulslike {{games are}} a {{relatively}} new genre born due to popularity of the Souls series. Those games generally have common elements like high difficulty, high-risk combat with hard-hitting enemies, sparse checkpoints, and enemies dropping souls (or some other resource used for upgrading stats and/or weapons that is lost upon death), but the player has one chance to regain the dropped souls if they can reach the place of their death without dying again. Examples {{of this type of}} game are: Dragon's Dogma, Lords of the Fallen, Bound by Flame, <b>Bloodborne,</b> DarkMaus, Nioh, The Surge, Ashen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bloodborne</b> {{takes place}} in Yharnam, a {{decrepit}} Gothic city known for its medical advances using blood as a primary tool. Over the years, many travelers journey to the city seeking the remedy to cure their afflictions; the player's character journeys to Yharnam seeking something known as Paleblood for reasons unknown. Upon arriving in the city, however, it is discovered that Yharnam is plagued with an endemic illness that has transformed most of its citizens into bestial creatures. The player must navigate the streets of Yharnam during the night of The Hunt, and overcome its violently deranged inhabitants and horrifying monsters {{in order to stop}} the source of the plague and escape the nightmare.|$|E
25|$|Multiplayer {{is present}} in <b>Bloodborne</b> as well, though it {{functions}} differently from its counterparts in the Souls series. By activating a non-consumable item {{at the cost of}} one Insight point, players can summon other players into their world to help with boss battles or large groups of enemies, and progress through areas of the game cooperatively. This leaves the player vulnerable to invasions, in which another player may invade the victim's game world and attempt to kill them, unless the player can find and defeat a specific enemy before an enemy player invades. Multiplayer summons are limited by proximity; players can only be summoned within a specific distance of each other to prevent players being summoned too far away to be of any assistance. Players can only summon other players that are around the same level as them to prevent the game from being too difficult, or too easy, for one of the players. What Covenant a player is a part of affects multiplayer as well. Players can summon an NPC to help them in addition to getting help from other players. The NPC serves as an AI companion to the player, that helps defeat enemies. Players can only summon specific NPCs that they have met throughout their journey. Another way players may interact with each other is by leaving notes. A player may leave a tip for defeating a boss, tell the reader where to go, fool the reader by purposely providing incorrect information, or just leave a meaningless message to others. Players may rate a message as 'Fine' or 'Foul', which will indicate to future readers whether the note is useful or untrustworthy.|$|E

[...] The individual subject to the exposure incident may have or have not contracted <b>bloodborne</b> diseases while removing the Taser dart or while having the Taser dart removed. [...] Extensive testing {{is the next step}} in the process. [...] This can be an expensive and stressful event. [...] Possible <b>bloodborne</b> diseases that may be contracted include HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and other <b>bloodborne</b> pathogens". [...] Methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is also a <b>bloodborne</b> pathogen.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bloodborne</b> {{was awarded}} the 2015 Game of the Year by several video game review sites, {{including}} GameTrailers, Eurogamer, Destructoid, and Edge, along with being awarded the [...] "2015 PlayStation 4 Game of the Year" [...] by IGN. <b>Bloodborne</b> was nominated for eight Golden Joystick Awards, including Game of the Year, PlayStation Game of the Year, Best Original Game, Best Multiplayer Game, Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, Best Audio, and Best Gaming Moment. In 2017, Game Informer ranked <b>Bloodborne</b> #11 on their Top 100 RPGs of all-time list.|$|E
2500|$|Development of <b>Bloodborne</b> {{began as}} {{development}} was being completed on the Prepare to Die edition of Dark Souls, released in August 2012. Sony Computer Entertainment approached FromSoftware concerning cooperative development on a title, and director Hidetaka Miyazaki {{asked about the}} possibility of developing a game for eighth-generation consoles. The concept of <b>Bloodborne</b> developed from there. There were no connections to FromSoftware's previous titles, even though Miyazaki conceded that it [...] "carries the DNA of Demon's Souls and its very specific level design". Development ran parallel to that of Dark Souls II.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bloodborne</b> is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by FromSoftware {{and published by}} Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 4. Officially announced at Sony's Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 conference, the game was released worldwide in March 2015. <b>Bloodborne</b> follows the player character, the Hunter, through the decrepit Gothic, Victorian era inspired city of Yharnam, whose inhabitants have been afflicted with an abnormal blood-borne disease. Upon mysteriously awakening in Yharnam during the night of [...] "The Hunt", the Hunter seeks out something known only as [...] "Paleblood" [...] for reasons unknown. The Hunter begins to unravel Yharnam's intriguing mysteries while hunting down its many terrifying beasts. Eventually, the Hunter's objective is to locate and terminate {{the source of the}} plague, and escape the nightmare.|$|E
2500|$|A song {{to promote}} <b>Bloodborne</b> was {{recorded}} by the Hit House featuring Ruby Friedman for a trailer and TV spot of the game, titled [...] "Hunt You Down", written by Scott Miller and William Hunt, and recorded by Wyn Davis in Los Angeles and at Word of Mouth Recording Studios in New Orleans.|$|E
2500|$|With {{more than}} sixteen billion {{injections}} administered annually worldwide, [...] {{they are the}} largest contributor to sharps waste. For this reason many new technologies surrounding injections have been developed, mostly related to safety mechanisms. As these technologies have been developed governments have attempted to make them commonplace to ensure sharps waste safety. [...] In 2000, the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act was passed, along with the 2001 <b>Bloodborne</b> Pathogens Standard.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{is played}} from a third-person perspective, players control a {{customizable}} protagonist, and gameplay is focused on weapons-based combat and exploration. Players battle varied enemies, including bosses, using items such as swords and firearms, and journey through the story, exploring the game's different locations, interacting with non-player characters, collecting key items involved in the story, and discovering and unraveling the world's many mysteries. <b>Bloodborne</b> began development in 2012 under the working title of Project Beast. Bearing many similarities to the Souls series of games by the same company, <b>Bloodborne</b> was partially inspired by the literary works of authors H. P. Lovecraft and Bram Stoker, and the architectural design of certain real world locations {{in places such as}} Romania and the Czech Republic. The decision by game director Hidetaka Miyazaki to create a new intellectual property (IP) and not another Souls game was made because Miyazaki wanted to create something [...] "different"; at the same time, Sony wanted a new IP to be made exclusively for the PlayStation 4.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} medical issues {{can result from}} tattooing. [...] Because it {{requires}} breaking the skin barrier, tattooing may carry health risks, including infection and allergic reactions. Modern tattooists reduce such risks by following universal precautions, working with single-use items, and sterilising their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have <b>bloodborne</b> pathogen training, such as is provided through the Red Cross and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.|$|E
2500|$|Edge scored it a full 10 out of 10, {{stating that}} it was a [...] "dazzling work of dank, abject horror that cements Miyazaki as one of the all-time greats." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly scored it 9.5 out of 10, stating [...] "Though built on the same core as the Souls games, <b>Bloodborne</b> marks the largest {{departure}} from the status quo to date. The numerous changes, many in service of a faster and more aggressive playstyle, might not be for everyone, but if you embrace that shift, you might well have a new favorite in the From Software canon." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} {{positively}} reviewed {{outside of the}} traditional gaming media. New York Daily News gave it a full five-star rating, stating that it is [...] "the perfect marriage, blending mechanics that seem easy to learn with gameplay and challenge that demands mastery and ingenuity." [...] The Guardian also gave it a full five-star rating, stating that [...] "elegance, precision, humour, and challenge make <b>Bloodborne</b> irresistible." [...] The Telegraph also awarded it a full five-star rating, concluding that [...] "it's the digital edition of a round-the-world trip to foreign continents, each turning of a corner providing equal helpings of excitement and trepidation." ...|$|E
2500|$|HIV {{originated}} in Africa, and {{spread to the}} United States via Haiti between 1966 and 1972. AIDS is currently a pandemic, with infection rates as high as 25% in southern and eastern Africa. In 2006, the HIV prevalence rate among pregnant women in South Africa was 29.1%. Effective education about safer sexual practices and <b>bloodborne</b> infection precautions training have helped to slow down infection rates in several African countries sponsoring national education programs. Infection rates are rising again in Asia and the Americas. [...] The AIDS death toll in Africa may reach 90–100 million by 2025.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{been highly}} anticipated, <b>Bloodborne</b> {{was met with}} {{critical}} acclaim upon release, with praise being directed at the game's gameplay, audio design, atmospheric environments, inter-connected world design, and plot. Another of the game's praised traits is its difficulty, which some gaming publications called [...] "brutal", and others considered [...] "difficult, but fair". Some criticism, however, was directed at the game's technical performance at launch, which post-release updates later helped alleviate. An expansion for the game, titled The Old Hunters, was released in November 2015. By the end of 2015, the game had sold over two million copies worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{video game}} {{developed}} by Artdink and titled [...] {{was released in}} Japan on March 26, 2015 on the PlayStation 3 and Vita platforms, with an English version being released in Asia. The game's producer revealed in October 2014 that the game is an open-world action RPG featuring an original storyline, set within Alfheim Online, where characters are able to fly. The game sold 139,298 physical retail copies on the PlayStation Vita in addition to another 55,090 units on the PlayStation 3 within its first week of release in Japan, ranking second and sixth place respectively within the Japanese software sales charts for that particular week, narrowly behind <b>Bloodborne</b> taking the top spot.|$|E
2500|$|Destructoid's Chris Carter {{gave the}} game a 9/10. While calling the game [...] "the most stable Souls game to date", he praised the game's {{emphasis}} on melee combat and raw skill, {{as well as}} the game's interesting NPCs, sidequests and interactions. He criticized the game's less-inspiring setting and environment design, limited competitive multiplayer, low replay value, {{as well as the}} occasional blocked area in the game, which he stated [...] "feel less sprawling and less replayable" [...] than previous FromSoftware games. He summarized the review by saying that [...] "Bloodborne is an interesting mix of everything FromSoftware has learned throughout its storied developmental career. FromSoftware {{is still one of the}} only developers left that makes you work for your satisfaction, and <b>Bloodborne</b> is damn satisfying." ...|$|E
