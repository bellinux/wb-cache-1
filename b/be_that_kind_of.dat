2500|$|After leaving Congress, Chenoweth-Hage {{continued}} to make headlines. In 2003 at the Boise Airport she was selected by the Transportation Security Administration for a hand search before they would permit her to board a plane for her Nevada home. Chenoweth-Hage requested to see {{a copy of the}} regulation granting United States Department of Homeland Security the authority to search her without cause. When the request was denied, she refused to submit to the search and elected to make the [...] trip by rental car. [...] "Our borders are wide open and yet they're shaking down a 66-year-old white grandmother they greeted by name," [...] she said of the incident. [...] "It's time the American people say no to this kind of invasion. It's a question of personal privacy.

2500|$|On September 17, 2008, Agricultural Minister Gerry Ritz made {{national}} news when comments he made on an August 30, 2008 {{conference call with}} government officials were made public. Ritz was quoted as saying, [...] "This is like a death by a thousand cuts. Or should I say cold cuts." [...] Then, when told of a death in Prince Edward Island, Ritz said, [...] "Please tell me it's (Liberal MP) Wayne Easter." [...] Ritz apologized for his remarks, but various groups called for his resignation. New Democratic Party Leader Jack Layton responded by saying, [...] "Canadians are dying because of the mismanagement of our government... there should absolutely never <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> humour.... It illustrates {{the government is not}} taking this matter as seriously as they should." [...] A spokesman for Prime Minister Harper released a statement saying Ritz's comments were tasteless and completely inappropriate. Stephen Harper refused to seek Ritz's resignation.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] said Croyden, [...] "only it doesn't {{happen to}} <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> key. It's a West Indian island all right, but there's a summer {{hotel on the}} other end of it not two miles away." ...|$|E
6000|$|She sighed, [...] "That's what I'll {{do after}} college! I'll {{get my hands}} on one of these prairie towns and make it beautiful. Be an inspiration. I suppose I'd better become a teacher then, but--I won't <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a teacher. I won't drone. Why should they have all the garden suburbs on Long Island? Nobody has done {{anything}} with the ugly towns here in the Northwest except hold revivals and build libraries to contain the Elsie books. I'll make 'em put in a village green, and darling cottages, and a quaint Main Street!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Me? Of course not. Why---er---if I knew he <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a man-----" [...] Andrew Felps {{broke off}} short. [...] "Were you {{listening}} to our talk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, and I {{would like}} to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> youth!" [...] I cried. [...] "I have seen {{too much of the}} other party in these young advocates that fawn upon your lordship, and are even at the pains to fawn on me. And I have seen it in the old ones also. They are all for by-ends, the whole clan of them! It's this that makes me seem to misdoubt your lordship's liking. Why would I think that you would like me? But ye told me {{yourself}} ye had an interest!" ...|$|E
60|$|Whether {{he should}} {{complete}} the parallel, and skip, too, {{was a point}} which {{he had not yet}} acknowledged to himself that he had decided. He never had believed that it need come to that; but, for an instant, when the president said he could wish him nothing better on his way home than a good railroad accident, it flashed upon him that one of the three alternatives before him was to skip. He had the choice to kill himself, which {{was supposed to be the}} gentlemanly way out of his difficulties, and would leave his family unstained by his crime; that matter had sometimes been discussed in his presence, and every one had agreed that it was the only thing for a gentleman to do after he had pilfered people of money he could not pay back. There was something else that a man of other instincts and weaker fibre might do, and that was to stand his trial for embezzlement, and take his punishment. Or a man, if he was that kind of a man, could skip. The question with Northwick was whether he was that kind of man, or whether, if he skipped, he would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> man; whether the skipping would make him that kind of man.|$|E
5000|$|The house's {{architecture}} is referenced in Henry James' novel, The Spoils of Poynton: ...out of a Philistine, a tasteless, a hideous house; {{the kind of}} house the very walls and furniture of which constitute a kind of anguish for such a woman as I suppose the mother to <b>be.</b> <b>That</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> anguish occurred to me, precisely, as a subject, during the two days I spent at Fox Warren...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I expect Jim has {{had other}} accidents; as you remarked, he <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> man. Did he get hurt {{when you were}} {{with him in the}} woods?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing!' said she, in {{an altered}} tone, her cheeks glowing; 'it is very silly {{of him to}} get himself talked about; {{but of course it}} is all nothing.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Many {{individuals}} seek broader {{definitions of}} Indian for personal reasons. Some people whose careers involve {{the fact that}} they emphasize Native American heritage and self-identify as Native American face difficulties if their appearance, behavior, or tribal membership status does not conform to legal and social definitions. Some have a longing for recognition. Cynthia Hunt, who self-identifies {{as a member of the}} state-recognized Lumbee tribe, says: [...] "I feel as if I'm not a real Indian until I've got that BIA stamp of approval .... You're told all your life that you're Indian, but sometimes you want to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Indian that everybody else accepts as Indian." ...|$|E
5000|$|Flynn {{requested}} that the Holy See assign a coadjutor archbishop, and on April 24, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI appointed John Clayton Nienstedt, Bishop of the Diocese of New Ulm, Minnesota, as Flynn's coadjutor. In January 2008, Flynn, citing a Vatican instruction from 2004, ordered {{an end to the}} practice of lay preaching at Mass, sending as the end date for the practice his final day as Archbishop. He said: [...] "There has to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> training and theological background that even a person with a master's degree in theology would not have. The church does not want people just standing up there and giving opinions or even things they've read in books." ...|$|E
5000|$|Louis Ozawa Changchien as Hanzo, a Yakuza Inagawa-kai {{enforcer}} {{who rarely}} speaks and reveals {{late in the}} film that he is missing his leftmost two fingers, having performed yubitsume. [...] "I guess {{he used to be}} a guy who can murder someone without a qualm," [...] said Changchien of the character, [...] "but by the time he arrives the alien planet, he'll no longer <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> person. Those things aren't explained in the script, but you'll get it when you see the movie." [...] Changchien used his kendo training for a scene in which his character uses a katana in a duel against a Predator. Antal, a kendo fan, insisted that the sword fight looks authentic.|$|E
60|$|ARISTOCRACY, n. Government by {{the best}} men. (In this sense the word is obsolete; so <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> government.) Fellows <b>that</b> wear downy hats and clean shirts--guilty of {{education}} and suspected of bank accounts.|$|R
5000|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> {{a moment}} <b>of</b> epiphany. It <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{questioning}} <b>that</b> made {{us want to}} read the Quran with a new lens. It was a liberating process understanding that the Quran speaks to women and is lifting and empowering.|$|R
6000|$|In her {{limitless}} gratitude {{the happy}} mother waived rank {{and hugged him}} too, calling him [...] "the angel of God in disguise." [...] And he probably was in disguise if he <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> an official. He was dressed for the character.|$|R
5000|$|Steve Javie's father, Stan Javie, {{was also}} a sports official. Stan Javie worked in the National Football League from 1951 to 1980 as a field judgeand back judge, and was {{assigned}} to officiate four Super Bowls. [...] In an interview with Referee magazine, Steve Javie described his father as [...] "a guyyou'd go to war with. He had a passion. He was probably the official that everyone strives to be, but can't, {{because you have to}} be yourself. I can't be a Stan Javie and you can't be, but ifyou took all the characteristics and makeup, you'd want to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> official."

50|$|The {{way you can}} {{struggle}} with {{this is to be}} supported by something, something you don't know. As we are human beings, there must <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> feeling. You must feel it in this city or building or community. So whatever community it may be, it is necessary for it to have this kind of spiritual support.That is why I respect Trungpa Rinpoche. He is supporting us. You may criticize him because he drinks alcohol like I drink water, but that is a minor problem. He trusts you completely. He knows that if he is always supporting you in a true sense you will not criticize him, whatever he does. And he doesn't mind whatever you say. That is not the point, you know. This kind of big spirit, without clinging to some special religion or form of practice, is necessary for human beings.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Sewell, with {{a little}} gesture of comprehension. [...] "Since he has made his mind up, he will, I fancy, manage <b>that,</b> too.

6000|$|<b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> a for <b>Kind</b> <b>of.</b> [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a man." [...] Say <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> man. Man here is generic, and a genus {{comprises}} many kinds. But there {{cannot be}} more than one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> one thing. <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> followed by an adjective, as, [...] "kind of good," [...] is almost too gross for censure.|$|R
5000|$|The EP's {{sound was}} {{influenced}} by the various hardcore artists Ryan Adams grew up listening to.

[...] Regarding its overall aesthetic, Adams stated: [...] "It’s my Hüsker Dü <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> vibe." ...|$|R
5000|$|Slatest, {{also known}} as The Slatest, is a news blog that has been {{published}} by Slate since 2009, when it was launched to replace their 12-years-old [...] "Today's Papers" [...] feature. It also replaced Slate's magazine aggregator feature [...] "In Other Magazines". In 2011, the website was redesigned; the effects included making its homepage more closely resemble the Huffington Post and creating a home for Slate's [...] "Trending News Channel" [...] video project. In 2012, it was redesigned again, this time {{to focus more on}} the writing and editorial decisions of Josh Voorhees, who was then the blog's editor. This redesign also gave the blog a new slogan: [...] "Your news companion." [...] After this redesign was announced, Voorhees said, “The average Slate writer takes a little bit longer to craft a really definitive or provocative piece. The Slatest will always <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ‘first responder’ for the site." ...|$|E
