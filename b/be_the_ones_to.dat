5|$|McCauley was {{an active}} member of the Edmonton community. He served as a {{director}} of the Edmonton Agricultural Association for 16 years. The association brought the Edmonton Exhibition to Edmonton, one of the prominent fairs of the west at the time. As telephone service was brought to Edmonton, McCauley was one of the first to receive one installed. His telephone number was #1. When John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair would visit Edmonton for business, McCauley and his wife would usually <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> entertain him. Also an avid curler, McCauley was a founder of the Royal Curling Club in Edmonton and led his curling team where he served as a skip. He also enjoyed other sports, including horse carriage racing.|$|E
5|$|Despite Leopold not {{formally}} excluding Barbarigo, a rumour spread {{that he had}} been excluded, and despite the protests of the zelanti faction of cardinals, enough members of the College of Cardinals recognized the Emperor's ability to exclude a candidate that it prevented his election. Leopold had sent an envoy with two letters for his cardinals: the first public letter declared that he did not wish to see Barbarigo excluded, while the second letter, which was private, expressed his desire that Barbarigo not be elected, but {{that he did not want}} to take the blame for the exclusion, but rather wished for the Spanish to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> do so. Additionally, some of the more materialistic cardinals feared that Barbarigo would be similarly strict as Pope Innocent XI, and this factored into his failure to win election.|$|E

5|$|TSR {{decided to}} create a franchise, {{including}} modules, board games, lead figures, andfor the first timenovels. Weis had been hired as an editor; with Hickman, she began working with the author hired to write the novels. They weren't satisfied with the author, and decided they should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> write the books. They collaborated over a weekend, writing the prologue {{for the first five}} chapters of the first novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, based on the module Dragons of Despair. TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment, firing the author. After two years of development, TSR released Dragons of Autumn Twilight as a supplement to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. TSR had doubts about the finished novel's sales potential, and attempted to order thirty thousand copies, ultimately ordering the minimum print run of fifty thousand. The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand. Dragonlance eventually received ancillary products such as novels, calendars, computer games, and books of artwork.|$|E

While things were going in Mintz's favor, animators Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising asked Universal head Carl Laemmle to remove Mintz, suggesting they would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> continue the Oswald series.

25|$|If a {{constitution}} {{is to be}} interpreted {{in light of the}} evolving standards of decency, why, in most democratic countries, should the highest authority of judicial branch (e.g., the Supreme Court in U.S.) <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> have the final say over its interpretation? Is not the legislative branch which is elected, thereby more likely {{to be in touch with}} the current standards of decency, and therefore better placed to make such judgments? If originalism is wrong, then Marbury v. Madison—which holding underpins judicial review of constitutionality, that is, the meaning of the constitution—was wrongly decided, and two centuries of jurisprudence relying on it is thereby on shaky ground.|$|E
25|$|Any bishop ordinarily has the {{authority}} to hear confessions worldwide, unless the local bishop where the confession takes place or the penitent's own bishop has made an objection. The Pope, as the supreme earthly Catholic judge, and all cardinals have the right to hear confessions of any Catholic anywhere in the world by virtue of canon law. A Catholic of one rite may have a confessor of another rite in communion with Rome. Major superiors, rectors of seminaries and heads of houses of formation, and heads of novitiates should not ordinarily <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> hear the confessions of those they supervise unless the person freely requests it of them (they may not make use of any information learned in confession when they are disciplining their charges because of the seal of confession).|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>to</b> give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of}} it all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

Miller also included three songs that were written by Fred Juhos, and later defended the decision to record Juhos's songs as a Beatles-like [...] "relief from seriousness," [...] though only one was included in the Distortion of Glory compilation. Juhos's contributions were criticized as failing to mesh with Miller's, and Miller later mused, [...] "It's funny that his stuff wasn't popular.
