5|$|Although the {{measures}} taken in storage facilities do not decrease {{the proportion of}} damaged seeds, they limit the densities of emerging insects and therefore the pressure for the coming year. Such measures will <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> efficient in storage as most B. rufimanus have then not yet emerged and are still developing in the seeds. Early harvest could therefore be recommended for best control measures in storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Stream downcutting {{continued}} {{along with}} canyon-forming {{processes such as}} mass wasting; sediment-rich and abrasive flood stage waters would undermine cliffs until vertical slabs of rock sheared away.

5|$|The {{extent of}} the solar wind's {{influence}} on the dynamics of Jupiter's magnetosphere is currently unknown; however, it could <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> strong at times of elevated solar activity. The auroral radio, optical and X-ray emissions, as well as synchrotron emissions from the radiation belts all show correlations with solar wind pressure, indicating that the solar wind may drive plasma circulation or modulate internal processes in the magnetosphere.|$|E

5|$|Weiquan lawyers tend to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> {{critical}} {{of the lack of}} judicial independence in China. Rather than challenging particular laws, they frame their work as being in keeping with Chinese laws, and describe their activities as a means of defending and upholding the Constitution against abuses. As such, Weiquan lawyering {{has been described as a}} form of Rightful resistance.|$|E
5|$|While {{the moment}} from {{gyroscopic}} forces is only 12% of this, it {{can play a}} significant part because it begins to act {{as soon as the}} rider applies the torque, instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out-tracks. This can <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> helpful in motorcycle racing.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{power in}} an open air stream is thus {{proportional}} to the third power of the wind speed; the available power increases eightfold when the wind speed doubles. Wind turbines for grid electric power therefore need to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> efficient at greater wind speeds.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{unstable}} −1 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> stable {{because of the}} destabilization of the three outermost 7p3/2 electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; astatine shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p1/2 electrons are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown—even computationally—to be achievable. Because the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{a design}} flaw, ships of this class have {{inherent}} lists to starboard when under combat loads that exceed {{the capability of}} their list control systems. The problem appears to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> prevalent {{on some of the}} more modern vessels. This problem has been previously rectified by using damage control voids for ballast, but a solution using solid ballast which does not affect the ship's survivability has been proposed.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E

30|$|For {{participation}} focused research problems, criterion 5 <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important {{together with}} the open discussion about various possibilities (criterion 1). The analytic approach {{is based on the}} evidence base (criterion 3 and 4). <b>Especially</b> the focus <b>is</b> on criterion 4, on most effective explanations. When the theme is general, the rich view of the theme area <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important (criteria 1 and 3). In wicked problems, in which very different kinds of stakeholders are involved, it <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important to find a shared conceptual frame for communication and cooperation (criterion 5). In specific problems, the relevancy of the choices {{from the perspective of the}} key customers (criteria 2 and 6) and the search for best explanations based on data (criterion 4) <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> important.|$|R
5|$|In July 2009, {{the policy}} of {{time-based}} development freezes on a two-year cycle was announced. Time-based freezes are intended to blend the predictability of time based releases with Debian's policy of feature based releases, and to reduce overall freeze time. The Squeeze cycle was going to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> short; however, this initial schedule was abandoned. In September 2010, the backports service became official, providing more recent versions of some software for the stable release.|$|E

They were immediately {{put to good use}} and eased the work of the already overstretched ZNDH. The Dornier Do 17s of the ZNDH proved to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> well suited for such tasks. June also saw Kren returned to his previous position as head of the ZNDH.|$|E
5|$|In Roanoke, Virginia, Wayne Weinsider (Bruce Campbell) and his {{pregnant}} wife Laura (Lisa Jane Persky) learn via an ultrasound scan that their unborn child has bizarre physical abnormalities, such as horn-like protrusions. Weinsider appears to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> distraught after hearing the news. That night, Laura has a terrifying dream in which a demon-like figure snatches the baby from her womb. When she wakes up, the couple discover that Laura has seemingly miscarried. Laura's brother, local deputy sheriff Arky Stevens, reports her story to the X-Files section at the FBI. Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) discards the report, but Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) salvages the case and travels to Virginia, along with Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to interview the Weinsiders.|$|E

5|$|Other recent {{developments}} in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron beam welding, making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following {{the invention of the}} laser in 1960, laser beam welding debuted several decades later, and has proved to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.|$|E
5|$|Regionally {{developed}} ecotypes can {{be threatened}} with extinction when new alleles or genes are introduced that alter that ecotype. This {{is sometimes called}} genetic mixing. Hybridization and introgression, which can happen in natural and hybrid populations, of new genetic material {{can lead to the}} replacement of local genotypes if the hybrids are more fit and have breeding advantages over the indigenous ecotype or species. These hybridization events can result from the introduction of non-native genotypes by humans or through habitat modification, bringing previously isolated species into contact. Genetic mixing can <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> detrimental for rare species in isolated habitats, ultimately affecting the population {{to such a degree that}} none of the originally genetically distinct population remains.|$|E
5|$|Shown {{right is}} an X-ray {{structure}} showing a complex between a diaminocarbene and potassium HMDS. This complex was formed when excess KHMDS {{was used as}} a strong base to deprotonate the formamidinium salt. Removing lithium ions resulting from deprotonation with reagents such as LDA can <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> problematic. Potassium and sodium salt by-products tend to precipitate from solution and can be removed. Lithium ions may be chemically removed by binding to species such as cryptands or crown ethers.|$|E

In the Dresden Codex, a solar eclipse is represented by a serpent devouring the k'in ("day") hieroglyph. Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya {{might be able to}} predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{techniques have}} traditionally been applied exclusively to proteins, as the primary biological macromolecules that assume characteristic three-dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which are mediated primarily by hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA {{as well as in}} proteins, and the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau and tilting of the Markagunt Plateau started 13million years ago. This steepened {{the stream}} {{gradient}} of the ancestral Virgin River (Zion Canyon {{section of the}} park), and Taylor and La Verkin creeks (Kolob Canyons section of the park), causing them to flow and downcut faster into the underlying Markagunt Plateau. Downcutting continues to <b>be</b> <b>especially</b> rapid after heavy rainstorms and winter runoff when the water contains large amounts of suspended and abrasive sand grains. Uplift and downcutting are so fast that slot canyons (very narrow river-cut features with vertical walls), such as the Zion Narrows, formed.|$|E
