25|$|There are {{two main}} types of <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> designs: tension joints and shear joints.|$|E
25|$|The {{second type}} of <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> {{transfers}} the applied load in shear of the bolt shank and relies on the shear strength of the bolt. Tension loads on such a joint are only incidental. A preload is still applied but consideration of joint flexibility is not as critical {{as in the case}} where loads are transmitted through the joint in tension. Other such shear joints do not employ a preload on the bolt as they are designed to allow rotation of the joint about the bolt, but use other methods of maintaining bolt/joint integrity. Joints that allow rotation include clevis linkages, and rely on a locking mechanism (like lock washers, thread adhesives, and lock nuts).|$|E

500|$|The Big Four Bridge {{had one of}} {{the biggest}} bridge {{disasters}} in the United States, occurring on December 15, 1893 when a construction crane was dislodged by a severe wind, causing the falsework support of a truss to be damaged and the truss—with forty-one workers on it—to fall into the Ohio River. Twenty of the workers survived, but twenty-one died. The accident almost cost more lives, as a ferry crossing the Ohio River just barely missed being hit by the truss. Hours later, a span next to the damaged span also fell into the river, but was unoccupied at the time, causing no injuries. As a result, falsework was longitudely reinforced to prevent further occurrences, and also to prevent strong winds from causing similar damage by using special bracing on the bottom frame of the truss. Also, a new rule was enforced: [...] "never trust a <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> any longer than is necessary to put a riveted one in place".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Bolt</b> <b>joint</b> has an {{important}} influence on the dynamic characteristic of guide rail. Linear rolling guide is chosen as the research object in this paper. Firstly, the dynamic model of the linear rolling guide joint surface is established and its natural frequency is figured out.

By comparing {{the results of the}} two kinds of finite element analysis with the theoretical result, we can conclude that the finite element model considering the <b>bolts</b> <b>joint</b> is closer to the theoretical result.

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} investigates damage mechanisms {{which is}} closely related with the bearing failure in <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> of CFRP laminates and proposes a finite element model to reproduce those damage mechanisms. First, the damage was observed in the bearing failure of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints,</b> and the main factor of the large stiffness degradation in bearing failure is the fiber kinking damage. In addition, the fiber kinking is suppressed by the bolt clamping, which increases the bearing strength of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints.</b> Then, three-dimensional finite element model was developed for addressing the bearing failure in <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> based on the experimental observation. In this model, the initiation and the propagation of the fiber kinking damage which {{plays an important role}} in the bearing failure of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> were reproduced and the stress failure criteria were investigated. The variation of the load at the kinking onset due to the bolt clamping was simulated and consequently the load history during the evolution of the fiber kinking damage was simulated...|$|R

40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} (SHM) is {{the set of}} non-intrusive techniques used for early damage detection and recognition in structures. Using advances from communication and sensing technology {{in the past two}} decades, various SHM systems have been developed to ensure infrastructure safety. <b>Bolted</b> <b>joints</b> in most aerospace structures are useful components that enable easy assembly and disassembly for maintenance purposes. However, human workmanship engaged in the process of assembly makes an integrity check of the <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> a necessary process. Robust monitoring of such <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> is a critical task for increasing reliability in aerospace structures. This dissertation investigates methods for SHM of L-shape <b>bolted</b> <b>joints.</b> These methods include using ultrasonic signals and thermal contact resistance metrics correlated to contact pressure to assess the joint’s integrity. Moreover, contact pressure distribution at the joint surface was examined using pressure sensitive films. Experimental measurements showed that there were areas on the joint interface with very low to no contact pressure. Such low pressure can result in local shear slip. Furthermore, it is experimentally and numerically demonstrated that thermal contact resistance across <b>bolted</b> <b>joints,</b> although difficult to measure, has the ability to monitor joint integrity. It is also demonstrated that ultrasonic signals are a sensitive, yet easy to use, technology for monitoring the integrity of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints.</b> The proposed ultrasonic based feature proved capable of describing the integrity of <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> at the time of assembly. Time-dependent effects of ultrasonic transmitted signals and the SHM feature were studied on the L-shape <b>bolted</b> <b>joints.</b> Experiments showed that time has a significant effect on the ultrasonic signals transmitted through the joint interface.

50|$|A Screw joint is {{sometimes}} {{considered as a}} separate type but it is actually a variation of <b>bolted</b> <b>joint.</b> The difference is that a screw is used rather that bolt, thus requiring an internal thread {{in one of the}} jointed parts.

50|$|Due to dynamic loads, {{bolted joints}} have a {{tendency}} to loosen.

MJTs also reduce the likelihood the <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> will fail, which reduces downtime caused by needing to replace damaged components.|$|E

40|$|This {{project was}} {{performed}} together with ÅF Industry AB in Trollhättan, Sweden. ÅF’s expertise in Trollhättan is oriented towards the automotive industry. It was conducted within {{the section of}} CAE and safety where they, for instance, dimension <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> in the cars. <b>Bolt</b> <b>joints</b> {{play an important role}} in the automotive industry. Slip critical <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> are used widely throughout the vehicles. With lack of good test data, the <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> need to be dimensioned conservatively. This may lead to that <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> are over-dimensioned, adding more mass to the car. On the contrary, the availability of reliable test data enables designers to optimize joint dimensions to achieve a safe design with minimized mass. A mechanical testing configuration has been designed as well as a testing procedure for a test to determine the static friction value between mating surfaces in <b>bolt</b> <b>joints.</b> The testing configuration has been used to perform tests to find the static friction coefficient in different materials. The study contains varied combinations of steel, aluminium and ED-Coated steel. The study resulted in tables with levels of probability. The developed test configuration is robust and relatively simple to use and is recommended for further use. For improved statistical significance, it was noted that more samples should be used than was used in this study. The aluminium has a smoother surface finish and that could be the reason why its coefficient of friction is lower than steel. It is therefore considered important to also include surface roughness when presenting coefficient of friction results...|$|R
