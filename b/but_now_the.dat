5|$|Initially, it was {{suggested}} that tolling would cease once the original cost of construction plus accrued interest was repaid – this was done in 1993 and it was planned that tolls would not be levied after May 1995. Instead legislation enabling the continued levying of tolls was renewed by Parliament (originally that of the UK <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> Scottish Parliament) in 1998, 2003 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|From 1958, the Danish {{championship}} {{was arranged}} through one calendar year, and the 1956–57 season lasted 18 months with the teams playing each other thrice for a 27 games total. From 1958 to 1974, the tournament was expanded to 12 teams, playing each other twice for 22 games per season each, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> bottom two teams faced relegation. The number of teams was increased to 16 for the 1975 season, {{which resulted in}} 30 games per season. In 1986, {{the number of participants}} was altered once more, this time decreasing the number of teams to 14, and the number of games to 26.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} the island entered a long, {{stagnant}} period. Many businesses relocated off of the island. By 1959, the city of Houston had long out-paced Galveston in population and economic growth. Recognizing this, the Reverend Wendelin J. Nold, fifth bishop of the Galveston Diocese, was permitted by the Vatican to erect a Cathedral of convenience in Houston, naming Sacred Heart Church as co-cathedral. The diocese was then re-designated the Diocese of Galveston-Houston. Galveston and St. Mary's Cathedral Basilica still remained {{the home of the}} diocese, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> bishop could more easily access the rapidly growing Roman Catholic population in Houston.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Savenko {{stated that}} the passed law on the state expert {{activity}} {{and the introduction of}} the profession of forensic expert psychiatrist actually destroyed adversary-based examinations and that the Serbsky Center turned into the complete monopolist of forensic examination, which it had never been under Soviet rule. Formerly, the court could include any psychiatrist in a commission of experts, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> court only chooses an expert institution. The expert has the right to participate only in commissions that he is included in by the head of his expert institution, and can receive the certificate of qualification as an expert only after having worked in a state expert institution for three years. The Director of the Serbsky Center Dmitrieva was, at the same time, the head of the forensic psychiatry department which is {{the only one in the}} country and is located in her Center. No one had ever had such a monopoly.|$|E
5|$|Nichols and Cooper {{came to an}} {{agreement}} about the Solway Bridge. Although it was in Knox County, Anderson County had contributed $27,000 towards its construction. It was still paying off the bonds, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> bridge was usable only by CEW workers. Nichols negotiated a deal in which Knox County was paid $25,000 annually for the bridge, of which $6,000 was {{to be used to}} maintain the access road. Judge Thomas L. Seeber then threatened to close the Edgemoor Bridge unless Anderson County was similarly compensated. An agreement was reached under which Anderson County received $10,000 for the bridge and $200 per month. Knox County did not keep its side of the bargain to maintain the road, which was damaged by heavy traffic and became impassable after torrential rains in 1944. The Army was forced to spend $5,000 per month on road works in Knox County.|$|E
