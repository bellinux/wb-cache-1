40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{colonisation}} of dwarf hops (Humulus lupulus) by damson-hop aphid (Phorodon humuli (Schrank)) migrating from Prunus spp. was investigated at six plant spacings and {{where some of}} the hops were replaced by oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.), a non-host of the aphid. The number of migrant aphids that accumulated on hop stems (<b>bines)</b> increased with increasing <b>bine</b> size and density. The numbers of aphids that colonised hops interplanted with oilseed rape reflected the density of the hop plants only and not the overall plant density. As the physical size of the wind shadow within which flying aphids can manoeuvre and land was unimportant unless provided by a host plant, the finding supports the theory that flying aphids respond to olfactory stimuli associated with their hosts. Variation in <b>bine</b> height (as a measure of plant size) explained 29 – 93 % of the variance in aphid counts during the 3 years' study and <b>bine</b> density 1 – 14 %. Standardising the data as the numbers of aphids per metre of <b>bine</b> and taking a square-root transformation of these standardised counts improved the precision of the analyses and, by stabilising variances, facilitated comparisons between years as growth became more vigorous as the plants matured. Each year, the rate of increase in numbers of aphids settling on plots of hops declined curvilinearly with increasing <b>bine</b> density. Maximum colonisation by P. humuli occurred at a <b>bine</b> density of five per metre row, a density similar to that used commercially by growers of dwarf hops...|$|R

40|$|This {{exploratory}} village-level {{case study}} sought to gain in-depth insights and a holistic understanding into the livelihood system of the rural <b>Bine</b> community in Papua New Guinea. This involved {{the identification of the}} components and mechanics of the livelihood system unique to the case study area, their interconnectedness and the contexts in which they exist, to discover, describe and explain changes to the livelihood system and reasons why, how villagers live, what enables them to survive daily amidst adversity, how they respond to pressures on their livelihoods, and what drives their livelihoods decisions and choices. This study is predominantly qualitative, using primary data collected from three remote villages during two field visits in 2007 and 2008 aimed at capturing diversity. Secondary data sources were also utilized. Whilst the constructivist-interpretivist research paradigm that is amenable to soft systems thinking was the overarching research paradigm, elements of grounded theory and phenomenology formed the methodological basis of this study. A plethora of sustainable livelihoods frameworks and a composite of complementary research frameworks, multi-disciplinary schools of thought, theories, models and an assortment of data collection and analyses methods were employed. The livelihood system of the <b>Bine</b> comprises of livelihood strategies, assets and resources; the decision environment; aspirations; structures, processes, policies, institutions, organizations; and the vulnerability context. Of these, livelihood strategies are the main determinant of <b>Bine</b> survival. Semi-subsistence agriculture, in the form of extensive polycultural forest cultivation and intensive savannah monoculture, was and is the dominant livelihood strategy of the <b>Bine.</b> The other livelihood strategies undertaken by the <b>Bine</b> are foraging; hunting; fishing; exploitation of sago and coconuts; mat and basket weaving, broom making, marijuana cultivation, sale of labour, prostitution, marketing activities and trade with Torres Strait Islanders of Australia. The asset and resource base of the <b>Bine</b> livelihood system comprises the natural environment (i. e. land, forests, savannah grasslands, rivers, creeks, swamps, and the sea); physical assets; and human, social, financial, political and cultural assets and resources. The <b>Bine</b> make decisions regarding livelihood strategies {{in the context of the}} nuclear household. The primary aim for the <b>Bine</b> engaging in livelihood strategies is survival followed by cash. Both internal and external structures, processes, institutions and organizations influence decisions regarding livelihood strategies. The impact of policies alien to the <b>Bine</b> is also evident. The vulnerability context of the <b>Bine</b> is mainly natural and human. The natural include floods, droughts, change in climate and weather patterns, seasons, the natural resource base, and lack of physical infrastructure while the human include sorcery, acculturation and daily stress situations such as social obligations. The livelihood system of the <b>Bine</b> and the village economy has been in transition. The reasons and factors responsible for the transition and their influences are varied and manifest in various forms. They include the introduction of money and the overarching and dominant external economic, political and social systems, structures, institutions, processes and policies that have been beyond the control of the villagers. Internal systems, structures, institutions, and processes have also induced change. Deliberate and conscious action on the part of villagers in response to challenges, opportunities, changes and necessity have also contributed to changes in the livelihood system. Although in transition, the basis for <b>Bine</b> social existence over generations has been the traditional social structures, processes, relationships, and networks centred on a totemic clan system. The system is bound and cemented by kinship and founded on the principles of trust, reciprocity, distribution and exchange relations within and between families. The livelihood system of the <b>Bine</b> has been a continuous process of adaptation to environmental and material conditions as evidenced by the <b>Bine</b> undertaking a range of livelihood strategies. The study findings both confirm and contradict the various schools of thought, theories and models. There is no one school of thought, theory or model that explains all aspects of the livelihood system of the <b>Bine.</b> The <b>Bine,</b> let alone their livelihood system, have never been subject to empirical investigation so this study fills this void. This study is also the first of its kind to conduct a meticulous review of the plethora of sustainable livelihood frameworks. Moreover, this study was also an opportunity to gain in-depth insights and understanding into changes to rural livelihood systems in a specific context to allow spatial comparisons with similar studies elsewhere...|$|R
