50|$|<b>Bullion</b> <b>coins</b> {{describe}} contemporary {{precious metal}} coins minted by official agencies for investment purposes. Historically, most currency {{were in the}} form of <b>bullion</b> <b>coins,</b> silver and gold being the most common metals. Some <b>bullion</b> <b>coins</b> have been used as currency throughout the 20th century, like the Maria Theresa thaler and the Krugerrand. However, modern <b>bullion</b> <b>coins</b> generally do not enter common circulation despite having legal tender status and a nominal face value. Some modern <b>bullion</b> <b>coins,</b> such as the gold and silver American eagle, are produced as both business strike and collectible proof and uncirculated versions. Business strikes typically are sold at prices commensurate with their precious metal content, whereas collectible versions are sold at a significant premium over their actual bullion value. In some cases the grade and mintages of business strike coins can affect their value, so that they are considered numismatic rather than bullion items.|$|R

25|$|The Australian Gold Nugget is a gold <b>bullion</b> <b>coin</b> minted by the Perth Mint. The coins {{have been}} minted in {{denominations}} of 1/20 oz, 1/10 oz, 1/4 oz, 1/2 oz, 1 oz, 2 oz, 10 oz, and 1 kg of 24 carat gold. They have {{legal tender status}} in Australia and are one of few legal tender bullion gold coins to change their design every year, another being the Chinese Gold Panda. This and their limited annual mintage may, unlike for many other bullion coins, raise their numismatic value over the value of gold used.|$|E
25|$|The American Platinum Eagle is the {{official}} platinum <b>bullion</b> <b>coin</b> of the United States. These coins are made of 0.9995 pure platinum with face values of 10, 25, 50 and 100 dollars and were first released by the United States Mint in 1997. The design of coins of different values is almost the same, except for some numerical values. The 2009 minting of Platinum Eagles was uncertain due to rising metal prices; however, the issue of 8,000 one-ounce coins was announced in October. The price was set at $1,792, and the entire edition was sold out within a week.|$|E
25|$|The American Buffalo, {{also known}} as a gold buffalo, is a 24-karat <b>bullion</b> <b>coin</b> first offered for sale by the United States Mint on June 22, 2006, and {{available}} for shipment beginning on July 13. The coin follows the design of the Indian Head nickel and has gained its nickname from the American Bison on the reverse side of the design. This was the first time ever that the United States Government has minted pure (.9999) 24-karat gold coins for the public. The coin has a legal tender (face) value of US$50. Due to a combination of the coin's popularity and the tremendous increase in the price of gold since its creation the coin's value has increased considerably in a short time of just a few years. The initial 2006 U.S. Mint price of the proof coin was $800. In 2007 the Mint proof coin was $899.95, $1,410.00 in 2009, and $2,010.00 in 2011.|$|E

500|$|The {{design for}} the Buffalo nickel is well {{regarded}} today, and has appeared both on a commemorative silver dollar and a <b>bullion</b> <b>coin.</b> [...] However, during {{the time it was}} struck (1913–1938), it was less well liked, especially by Mint authorities, whose attempts to bring out the full design increased an already high rate of die breakage. [...] By 1938, it had been struck for 25years, thus becoming eligible to be replaced by action of the Secretary of the Treasury [...] rather than by Congress. [...] The Mint, {{which is part of the}} Department of the Treasury, [...] moved quickly and without public protest to replace the coin.|$|E

[...] Mercanti noted that Weinman's original plaster was only [...] in diameter, and was softly modelled. [...] Mercanti increased the detail so that the design, struck on a larger coin, would be bolder and would have a more even metal flow when struck than Weinman's original coin. [...] Treasury Secretary James Baker chose a heraldic eagle design, by Mercanti, as the reverse of the American Silver Eagle.|$|E
500|$|Following the Union of South Africa under Botha in 1910, Kruger {{remained}} [...] "a vital {{force in}} South African politics and Afrikaner culture". The government wildlife reserve he had proclaimed in 1898 was expanded and dubbed Kruger National Park in 1926. In 1954, {{over half a}} century after its construction by Anton van Wouw, a bronze statue of Kruger in his characteristic Dopper suit and top hat was erected in Church Square, Pretoria; Kruger stands atop a plinth surrounded by four crouching Boers from different time periods. Thirteen years later the South African Mint put his likeness on the Krugerrand, a gold <b>bullion</b> <b>coin</b> still produced and exported in the 21st century. His home in Pretoria and farm at Boekenhoutfontein are provincial heritage sites, the former of which is preserved to appear as in his time.|$|E

500|$|On February 12, 1982, {{following}} the poor {{sales of the}} medallions, the United States Gold Commission recommended the minting of a gold coin. Donald Regan, Secretary of the Treasury {{and chairman of the}} commission, later told reporters that a gold coin could be easier to sell than medallions, because the suggested coins [...] "could be redeemable in dollars". [...] The Mint issued gold coins for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty in 1986. [...] Both issues were successful, and the Liberty piece sold out on advance sales. [...] As the public was receptive to the gold coins, and President Ronald Reagan had banned the importation of Krugerrands in 1985 over South Africa's apartheid policy, Congress authorized the American Gold Eagle gold <b>bullion</b> <b>coin,</b> which entered production as legal tender in 1986.|$|E
