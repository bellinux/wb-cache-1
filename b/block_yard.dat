In addition to the storyline missions, there were side missions and bonus activities such as survival and foot races. Players with memberships saw this as the first zone to see tamable pets in. The Maelstrom minions here are easy, such as the Stromling, Stromling Mech, and the Dark Spiderling, born from the Block Yard's boss, the Spider Queen. The mini-game here is Avant Garden Survival. Here you must survive against Stromlings, Dark Spiderlings, Stromling Mechs, and other enemies more difficult to destroy. Avant Gardens is where you can tame the pets such as Doberman, Triceratops, and Buffalo. The two properties where you can build your creations in Avant Gardens are <b>Block</b> <b>Yard</b> and Avant Grove.|$|E
50|$|Aside {{from the}} normal {{membership}} packages the game also offered a free to play option with certain limitations, such as there being only two worlds available for free play, one being Venture Explorer — a tutorial world — and the other Avant Gardens. You could {{take part in the}} fight against the Spider Queen and have temporary gear which involves armour and weapons for each Faction. There was a button that asked players if they wanted to become a full member, where they would get access to everywhere in the Universe and get to do more missions & achievements. Free to play required the user to enter a Lego ID & password and create a character with certain names, whereas members could have their own made-up names. They were also limited on having a maximum 10,000 coins to buy items and food. They did have access to <b>Block</b> <b>Yard</b> where they could build their own creations. They were not allowed to trade with other minifigures, or have more than five friends on their friends list.|$|E

50|$|Lego Universe {{took place}} in an {{alternate}} universe populated by LEGO minifigures. The premise is that years ago, a team of four minifigures went on a great journey to seek the last essence of pure Imagination: Doctor Overbuild, Duke Exeter, Hael Storm, and Baron Typhonus. After having found it on the mysterious planet Crux, the greedy tycoon of the expedition, Baron Typhonus, was pulled into the source, fusing with it to create a maelstrom of chaotic dark energy. However, even though Doctor Overbuild plugged the hole, the stress caused Crux to explode into thousands of other worlds. After the incident, the explorers decided to form their own factions, Doctor Overbuild creating the Assembly, Duke Exeter forming the Sentinels, Hael Storm leading the Venture League, and the Baron's protégé Vanda Darkflame creating the Paradox. The factions worked together to create the Nexus Force in order to destroy the Maelstrom and its minions. The Venture Explorer, a ship carrying new recruits is being attacked by the Maelstrom. The player, aboard the ship, escapes to Avant Gardens {{with the aid of}} Sky Lane. Here, a disaster involving Paradox has infected Avant Gardens with Maelstrom and released a beast called the Spider Queen. After travelling through the world and discovering the Spider Queen's location, the player destroys the Spider Queen at the <b>Block</b> <b>Yard</b> and claims their first Property, where they could place collected models and bricks. Now, members (not free to play) can travel to Nimbus Station, where they choose which faction to join. From there, the player could travel to other worlds like Forbidden Valley or Gnarled Forest.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the allocation of}} <b>yard</b> cranes and <b>blocks</b> for <b>yard</b> activities in container terminals. In this paper, the yard cranes are confined to rail mounted gantry cranes (RMGC), which are characterized by the restricted traveling range {{on a pair of}} rails. Since RMGCs and <b>yard</b> <b>blocks</b> are tightly bound to each other, when allocating them, we should make sure that the RMGCs allocated for a yard activity are able to together cover the blocks allocated for the corresponding yard activity. In addition, considering that there are four basic activities occurring in the yard which compete with each other for the scarce resources and have different requirements and priorities in the allocation of <b>blocks</b> and <b>yard</b> cranes, we treat them in a single model rather than in multiple independent models as were generally done in literature. A mixed integer programming model is constructed, and an iterative decomposition solution procedure is proposed for the problem. Based on the solution procedure, a decision support system is developed and implemented for a terminal in Tianjin seaport. Using the actual data, the numerical experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of the decision support system.

40|$|In {{cities where}} their scarce land {{supplies}} have {{to accommodate the}} gigantic capacities of port container terminals, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, the containers to be loaded onto the same vessel are usually stacked together to form tall stacked blocks. In most container yards, only one working lane adjacent to each <b>yard</b> <b>block</b> is available for the empty trucks to queue up to receive the export containers. When loading activities start, {{a large number of}} trucks flock to the loading <b>yard</b> <b>blocks</b> containing a huge number of export containers, thus jamming the working lane. This paper considers the problem of determining the sequence of trucks entering the working lane that minimizes the total time required to serve all the empty trucks dispatching to a loading <b>yard</b> <b>block.</b> An algorithm with easy implementation is developed to find the optimal sequence easily. © INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{efficiency}} of yard operations {{is critical to}} the overall productivity of a container terminal because the yard serves as the interface between the landside and waterside operations. Most container terminals use yard cranes to transfer containers between the yard and trucks (both external and internal). To facilitate vessel operations, an efficient work schedule for the yard cranes is necessary given varying work volumes among <b>yard</b> <b>blocks</b> with different planning periods. This paper investigated an agent-based approach to assign and relocate yard cranes among <b>yard</b> <b>blocks</b> based on the forecasted work volumes. The goal of our study is to reduce the work volume that remains incomplete {{at the end of a}} planning period. We offered several preference functions for <b>yard</b> cranes and <b>blocks</b> which are modeled as agents. These preference functions are designed to find effective schedules for yard cranes. In addition, we examined various rules for the initial assignment of <b>yard</b> cranes to <b>blocks.</b> Our analysis demonstrated that our model can effectively and efficiently reduce the percentage of incomplete work volume for any real-world sized problem...|$|R
