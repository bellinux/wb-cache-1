40|$|The paper {{presents}} a {{finite element model}} of dual-rotor system with pedestal looseness stemming from loosened bolts. Dynamic model including <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> looseness is established based on the dual-rotor test rig. Three-degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar rigid motion of loose <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> is fully considered and collision recovery coefficient is also introduced in the model. Based on the Timoshenko beam elements, using the finite element method, rigid body kinematics, and the Newmark-β algorithm for numerical simulation, dynamic characteristics of {{the inner and outer}} rotors and the <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> plane rigid body motion under <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> looseness condition are studied. Meanwhile, the looseness experiments under two different speed combinations are carried out, and the experimental results are basically the same. The simulation results are compared with the experimental results, indicating that vibration displacement waveforms of loosened rotor have “clipping” phenomenon. When the <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> looseness fault occurs, the inner and outer rotors vibration spectrum not only contains the difference and sum frequency of the two rotors’ fundamental frequency but also contains 2 X and 3 X component of rotor with loosened support, and so forth; low frequency spectrum is more, containing dividing component, and so forth; the rotor displacement spectrums also contain fewer combination frequency components, and so forth; when one side of the inner rotor <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> is loosened, the inner rotor axis trajectory is drawn into similar-ellipse shape...|$|R

40|$|The {{approximation}} previously {{proposed by}} the authors is applied {{to an analysis of}} unstable vibrations of a rotating asymmetrical shaft supported by asymmetrically flexible <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestals.</b> A frequency equation is represented by the determinant of the 4 th order, 8 th order, or 12 th order, according as a directional inequality of <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> stiffness is negligibly small, small but considerable, or not small. Instability regions are obtained by solving each frequency equation. No matter what the directional inequality of stiffness of <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> may be, the position, width and number of instability regions can be sufficiently determined by use of the determinant of the 8 th order. Instability regions derived from approximation are found to agree well with those obtained by an analog computer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In the {{acoustic}} emission fault diagnosis, {{the acoustic}} emission sensors was {{installed on the}} <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> where near from the fault source so that can collected stronger fault AE signal, however,sometimes, it is inconvenience for AE sensor installation. This paper proposed that install the AE sensor on the base for collect the fault AE signal, but the signal was weak, so carried on EMD first, and selected the former 8 IMF to construct the original feature, than carried on KPCA for dimensionality reduction and get the optimized feature. In this paper, taking bearing acoustic emission test for example, by compared the base fault feature with the <b>bearing</b> <b>pedestal</b> fault feature, verified that the method that the AE sensor install on the base is feasible...|$|R
