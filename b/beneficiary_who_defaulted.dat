50|$|The Office of the Inspector General in the United States of (North) America issued {{report that}} {{outlines}} nine characteristics of questionable billing in PHPs based on past {{input from the}} Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) staff. Data was used from Medicare claims between 2009 to 2010 and were from the National Claims History File. The first sentence {{of each of the}} nine characteristics:1. <b>Beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> received only group psychotherapy during theirPHP participation. 2. <b>Beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> were not referred to PHPs by health care facilities.3. <b>Beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> were not evaluated by physicians during their PHPparticipation. 4.

Beneficiaries with cognitive disorders who participated in PHPs.8. Beneficiaries with long durations of PHP participation.9. <b>Beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> were readmitted to inpatient treatment. The report that authored these nine characteristics also determined if the percentage of Community Mental Health Centers with questionable billing changed based on whether states had 'license or certification requirements'.|$|R

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had a long-standing policy that <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> regularly attend adult day care were not considered homebound, particularly if the purpose of attending was to receive nonmedical or custodial care. In 2000, Congress indicated that Medicare <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> attended adult day care could still be considered homebound if they still met the other homebound requirements.

50|$|Work Incentives {{are special}} rules {{that make it}} {{possible}} for a beneficiary to attempt work while still receiving health care and cash benefits. For <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> receive SSDI, cash benefits continue for a defined time period and are eliminated only when the beneficiary reaches a level of earnings, known as Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA), through his or her job. SSDI <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> receive Medicare may be able to keep the coverage for at least eight-and-a-half years after returning to work. A Social Security provision known as 1619(b) allows SSI and concurrent SSDI/SSI <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> receive Medicaid coverage and depend on it in order to work to keep that coverage if their annual earnings from work are below State specific thresholds and they have limited resources. If a beneficiary’s earned income is high enough to disqualify him or her from coverage under 1619(b), many states enable <b>beneficiaries</b> <b>who</b> have returned to work to purchase Medicaid coverage at affordable rates through State-administered “Buy-In” programs. Social Security’s Red Book provides more information on Medicare and Medicaid continuation. Work Incentives, like these, help beneficiaries stay in control of their finances and healthcare benefits while they re-enter the workforce or often, work for the first time.|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Medicare expenditures for Part B drugs in 2010 were concentrated among relatively few drugs. The 55 highest-expenditure Part B drugs represented $ 16. 9 billion in spending, or about 85 percent of all Medicare spending on Part B drugs, and the 10 highest-expenditure drugs accounted for about 45 percent of all Part B drug spending in 2010.
