25|$|A new safety-oriented {{instrument}} panel featured a steering column designed to collapse under impact, and the gauges and controls were grouped in a hooded <b>binnacle</b> {{front of the}} driver with the dashboard pushed forward {{and away from the}} passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} styling of the X308 {{was similar}} to the X300 with minor refinements such as a change to oval indicator lenses and amber style round fog lights. The interior was also updated to eliminate the instrument <b>binnacle</b> used on the X300; instead, three large gauges were set into recesses in the walnut-faced dashboard in front of the driver.|$|E
25|$|The CB400A has a {{two-speed}} semi-automatic transmission. It has a {{torque converter}} and two forward gears (high and low) {{that have to}} be manually selected by the rider. There is a gear position indicator in lieu of a tachometer in the instrument <b>binnacle.</b> A parking brake replaced the clutch lever. This model has 28mm Keihin carburettors which lower the peak power in exchange for low-down response.|$|E

6000|$|... "DEAR MARTINGALE.--Don't be {{too sure}} of <b>Binnacle's</b> yacht. There are still ten {{days before the}} season is over; and my ponies may lie at Coutts's {{for some time to}} come.|$|R
60|$|A {{shiny black}} steam-yacht, with {{mahogany}} deck-house, nickel-plated <b>binnacles,</b> and pink-and-white-striped awnings, puffed up the harbour, flying the burgee of some New York club. Two young men, {{in what they}} conceived to be sea costumes, were playing cards by the saloon skylight; {{and a couple of}} women with red and blue parasols looked on and laughed noisily.|$|R
25|$|Inside, the NISMO edition {{has special}} seats {{with black and}} red color treatment, made with {{synthetic}} suede. The instrument <b>binnacle</b> and steering wheel are also covered in synthetic suede. The Bose stereo system does not have active noise control. The gauges have some red color treatment as well. NISMO-specific options are low-gloss matte gray paint and a full titanium exhaust with additional heatsinks. These changes in aggregate reduce weight by 38lbs which {{is the reason why}} it accelerates even faster than before.|$|E
25|$|Mariners' {{compasses}} {{can have}} two or more magnets permanently attached to a compass card, which moves freely on a pivot. A lubber line, {{which can be a}} marking on the compass bowl or a small fixed needle, indicates the ship's heading on the compass card. Traditionally the card is divided into thirty-two points (known as rhumbs), although modern compasses are marked in degrees rather than cardinal points. The glass-covered box (or bowl) contains a suspended gimbal within a <b>binnacle.</b> This preserves the horizontal position.|$|E
25|$|An {{anti-aircraft}} gun is at City Park in Parkersburg, West Virginia and the ship's wheel and <b>binnacle</b> {{are on display}} at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum. To honor the sailors who died, the flagstaff that was sunk at Pearl Harbor is in Clarksburg, West Virginia, displayed in front of the Harrison County Courthouse. The mainmast of the ship sits in front of Oglebay Hall at West Virginia University, while the secondary con wheel was sent to Salem International University, Salem, West Virginia, where it is {{on display at the}} school's library.|$|E
5000|$|Displays cover Great Lakes {{shipping}} since 1678; {{artifacts and}} exhibits include ship's models and engines, relics and instruments of lake vessels under both sail and steam, the drydock pumps and engine {{room of the}} original factory, glass and china salvaged from Great Lakes shipwrecks, ship's bells, anchors, <b>binnacles,</b> navigational instruments and equipment, a gallery of artistic paintings about {{the sea and the}} history of the Calvin and Son shipyard which once employed 700 workers on Garden Island.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, the Mountwood was {{withdrawn}} {{and taken to}} Birkenhead's former Cammell Laird shipyard (which became owned by A&P), and then to Clarence graving docks, where she was stripped of her fittings and parts of her superstructure were removed and rebuilt. Unfortunately the ferry remained dormant for some time due to problems at the shipyard. She was then re-engined and rebuilt. Noticeable changes were {{the addition of a}} new, angle fronted, large wheelhouse and bridge deck, plus her funnel, which was reinstated after the refit, was moved further back to fit with the position of the new engines. Her central saloons were also extended to the full width of the ship. She looks quite similar the Woodchurch's refit to Snowdrop. The ferry contained many items that would be classes as nautical antiques and quite valuable, such as engine telegraphs, <b>binnacles</b> and much brassware. The helm and <b>binnacles</b> were reinstated onto the new bridge, some of the items are now in Mersey Ferries’ archives and the others belong to a private collector. In May 2011 the ferry's nameplate was replaced and it now carried the words 'Royal Iris' in Birkenhead Corporation style script font.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what a pony is, Lady Gwinever?" [...] he asked. Her ladyship said yes: she had a cream-colored one at Castle Barbican; and stared when Lord Martingale {{announced}} that he should soon have a thousand ponies, worth five-and-twenty pounds each, which were all now kept at Coutts's. Then he explained the circumstances of the bet with Bagnigge. Parliament was to adjourn in ten days; the season would be over! Bagnigge was lying ill chez lui; and the five-and-twenty thousand were irrecoverably his. And he vowed he would buy Lord <b>Binnacle's</b> yacht--crew, captain, guns and all.|$|R
25|$|The LF-CC concept (2012) is a {{rear-wheel drive}} coupe {{incorporating}} designs from LF-LC concept and Lexus LFA. It included a 2.5-litre 4-cylinder Atkinson cycle petrol engine with D-4S direct injection technology, water-cooled permanent magnet electric motor, 3 LED-projector headlamp design, Daytime Running Lights (DRLs) are {{integrated into the}} upper bumper surface, rear spoiler integrated within the boot lid, L-shaped combination lamps with three-dimensional design, Fluid Titanium body colour, 2-zone dashboard, seats, door panels and instrument <b>binnacle</b> hood upholstered in amber leather. The vehicle was unveiled in 2012 Paris Motor Show, followed by Auto Shanghai 2013.|$|E
25|$|Compared to the {{previous}} generation, more sporting trim highlights {{are used in the}} cabin and the centre dash incorporates real aluminium. The already considerable rear leg-room has been increased over previous models. Tri-zone climate control systems feature {{for the first time that}} can regulate the car's temperature at three separate places inside the cabin. Themes for the specialist interior design team were comfort, sophistication, harmony, luxury and attention to detail. The extroverted instrument pad features a wide <b>binnacle,</b> unique chrome-ringed instrument cluster and integrated centre stack with a high resolution colour screen, zoned audio and climate controls and satin chrome detailing.|$|E
25|$|During the 1880s, Thomson {{worked to}} perfect the {{adjustable}} compass {{in order to}} correct errors arising from magnetic deviation owing to {{the increasing use of}} iron in naval architecture. Thomson's design was a great improvement on the older instruments, being steadier and less hampered by friction, the deviation due to the ship's own magnetism being corrected by movable masses of iron at the <b>binnacle.</b> Thomson's innovations involved much detailed work to develop principles already identified by George Biddell Airy and others but contributed little in terms of novel physical thinking. Thomson's energetic lobbying and networking proved effective in gaining acceptance of his instrument by The Admiralty.|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of the new technologies to the public libraries, opens an ample range of possibilities to create new relations between the public libraries and their customers, {{being able to be}} the blog, a powerful tool that help to change these relations of significant form between and others. It is tried to study the development of the <b>binnacles</b> or weblogs and to show the utility of this publication format Web for the development of services and management the public libraries in a scene marked by the presence of Internet. One is, in addition, like creating, to develop and to maintain a blog {{in the context of a}} public library...|$|R
60|$|Far {{away from}} the greystone wings, the dark cedars, the faultless gravel drives, and the mint-sauce lawns of Holt Hangars runs a river called the Hudson, whose unkempt banks are covered with the palaces of those wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice. Here, where the hoot of the Haverstraw brick-barge-tug answers the howl of the {{locomotive}} on either shore, you shall find, with a complete installation of electric light, nickel-plated <b>binnacles,</b> and a calliope attachment to her steam-whistle, the twelve-hundred-ton ocean-going steam-yacht Columbia, lying at her private pier, to take to his office, at an average speed of seventeen knots an hour,--and the barges can look out for themselves,--Wilton Sargent, American.|$|R
50|$|Barnegat fitted {{out at the}} New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, and was detailed, on 20 November 1917, to {{accompany}} the armed yacht Nokomis (Id. No. 609) to the Azores, towing submarine chasers. Dispatch traffic, however, indicates difficulties in finding certain items of equipment to be installed on board, the Commander, Naval Station, New York, informing the Navy Department that Barnegat and Montauk (Id.No.1213) still needed <b>binnacles</b> and standard compasses as of 11 December, but prognosticated that both ships {{would be ready to}} sail on the 12th. Barnegat ultimately departed New York City for the Philadelphia Navy Yard, there to complete preparations “for distant service” and thence to await onward routing.|$|R
25|$|The LF-CC (Lexus Future-Compact Coupe) is {{a concept}} car {{revealed}} at the October 2012 Paris Motor Show as {{a preview of the}} next generation Lexus IS. The LF-CC concept is a rear-wheel drive coupe incorporating designs from LF-LC concept and Lexus LFA. It includes a 2.5 litre 4-cylinder Atkinson cycle petrol engine with D-4S direct injection technology, water-cooled permanent magnet electric motor, 3 LED-projector headlamp design, daytime running lights integrated into the upper bumper surface, rear spoiler integrated within the boot lid, L-shaped combination lamps with three-dimensional design, Fluid Titanium body colour and a two-zone dashboard. The seats, door panels and instrument <b>binnacle</b> hood are upholstered in amber leather.|$|E
25|$|Also cut was {{the role}} of Miss Persimmon, played by Marjorie Eaton in the film. The bank chairman's father does not make an {{appearance}} like in the film, nor does Mr. <b>Binnacle,</b> Admiral Boom's assistant. New characters were developed {{to create a new}} conflict at the bank, the nice John Northbrook and scheming Herr Von Hussler. The park keeper from the books is in the musical but not the film. Another character from the books that is in the musical is Robertson Ay, the houseboy, who did not appear in the film. In the books, Jane and Michael have twin siblings, John and Barbara, and a baby sister Annabel, that do not appear in the stage or screen versions.|$|E
25|$|After {{passing over}} NY104 westbound, under NY590 and over NY104 eastbound, East Ridge Road becomes a nondescript {{residential}} street as {{it enters the}} Irondequoit neighborhood of Newport. The East Ridge Road name ends at a junction with Bay Shore Boulevard—the only through-traffic road that East Ridge Road intersects east of NY590—however, the street continues eastward as <b>Binnacle</b> Point to a cul-de-sac on a plateau overlooking Irondequoit Bay. Ridge Road itself does not traverse Irondequoit Bay; this task is accomplished by NY404 at {{the southern tip of}} the bay, NY104 via the Irondequoit Bay Bridge, and Culver and Lake Roads {{at the mouth of the}} bay via the Irondequoit Bay Outlet Bridge, a seasonal swing bridge that is open to traffic during the winter months only. This gap in Ridge Road is the only major discontinuity along its length.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} chosen during the 1960s for {{magnetic}} measurement due to Portland Bill's remoteness and magnetic cleanliness. As Portland stone is non-magnetic, {{as well as}} the site's remoteness, the site is free from any magnetic disturbance such as heavy traffic, and as a result, very small magnetic fields from equipment can be measured with a very high degree of accuracy. The site is used to magnetically assess any item, but mainly MCMV and EOD equipment. Magnetic compasses can also be tested. The unique facility is both notified and approved by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and is the only accredited centre for Type Approval of Magnetic Compasses and <b>Binnacles</b> in the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|The design used popular North American cruiser {{styling and}} copied {{features}} found on larger displacement cruisers and factory custom-styling. The CM125 had high handlebars, megaphone silencers, a teardrop-shaped petrol tank and a stepped seat. More chromium-plated and polished alloy parts {{were found on}} this model than on the comparable Superdream and Benly 125 models. The quality of the chrome-plated finish was such that corrosion was a problem. The ignition lock was between the instrumentation, which consisted of two <b>binnacles,</b> one containing a speedometer; the other, a set of three warning lights (neutral, turn, high beam). The ignition key also activated both the steering lock and the lock on the plastic tool box located under the off-side side panel. The drum brakes were actuated by a cable in front and a rod in the rear.|$|R
50|$|The AC45 are {{authorized}} {{to be taken}} out of measurement to serve as a testing platform for the America's Cup. Oracle Racing released photographs of an AC45 hydrofoiling with L-type appendages on June 18, 2012, a premonition of Team New Zealand's larger foiling AC72 Aotearoa test boat first spotted in Auckland on August 29, 2012. In February 2015 Oracle Racing and Artemis Racing tested two AC45s modified by Core Builders; They featured L-type hydrofoils, horizontal rudder stabilizers, lengthened crossbeams (herego wide beam), a shortened jib-only bowsprit extending into a centerline pod under the wing, flaring topsides, closed transoms, opened hulls with deep cockpits for <b>binnacles</b> and wheels, replacing the tiller. The authorization does not permit to lengthen the hulls. All other teams carried out similar experiments with the platform.|$|R
500|$|The {{interior}} {{was designed for}} two passengers and trimmed in leather. Leather trimmed sports seats are fitted together with electric windows and electrically adjustable heated mirrors. [...] The dashboard unusually curves round and carries onto the drivers door, with a secondary instrument <b>binnacle</b> containing four analogue gauges, including a clock and voltmeter fitted {{on the front of}} the drivers door. Air conditioning and green tinted glazing was also fitted.|$|E
500|$|Trapped against Shannon at {{an angle}} in which few of her guns could fire on the British ship, and unable to {{manoeuvre}} away, Chesapeakes stern now became exposed and was swept by raking fire. Earlier in the action Shannons gunnery had devastated Chesapeakes forward gun crews; this destruction was now inflicted on the gun crews in the aft part of the ship. The American ship's situation worsened when a small open cask of musket cartridges abaft the mizzen-mast blew up. When the smoke cleared, Broke judged {{the time was right}} and gave the order to board. Captain Lawrence also gave the order to board, but the frightened bugler aboard Chesapeake, William Brown, failed to sound the call, and only those near Lawrence heard his command. By this time Lawrence was the only officer left on the upper deck, as Lieutenants Ludlow and Ballard had been wounded. Lieutenant Cox, who had brought up men from the lower deck to form a boarding party, reached the quarterdeck only to find that his captain had been badly, indeed mortally, wounded by a musket ball. Lawrence was clinging to the <b>binnacle</b> in order to stay upright; Cox, who had served all his sea life with Lawrence, carried him down to the cockpit with the help of two sailors. As he was being taken down Lawrence called out [...] "Tell the men to fire faster! Don't give up the ship!" ...|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant Ludlow, who {{had been}} {{slightly}} wounded and had gone down to Chesapeakes cockpit for treatment, now returned to the upper decks, rallying some of the American crew as he did so. Lieutenant Budd joined him with a band of men he had led up the fore-hatch. Ludlow led them in a counter-attack which pushed the British {{back as far as}} the <b>binnacle.</b> However, a wave of British reinforcements arrived, Ludlow received a mortal wound from a cutlass, and the Americans were again thrown back. James Bulger, one of Shannons Irishmen, charged into the Americans wielding a boarding pike and shouting Gaelic curses - [...] "And then did I not spit them, beJaysus!" [...] Lacking officers to lead them (Lieutenant Budd had also been wounded by a cutlass) and lacking support from below, the Americans were driven back by the boarders. American resistance then fell apart, {{with the exception of a}} band of men on the forecastle and those in the tops. A number of the Americans driven from the upper decks jostled each other to get down the main hatchway to the comparative safety of the berth deck. Seeing this, Lt. Cox called to them, [...] "You damned cowardly sons of bitches! What are you jumping below for?" [...] When asked by a nearby midshipman if he should stop them by cutting a few down, Cox replied, [...] "No sir, it is of no use." ...|$|E
6000|$|BURGE [suddenly {{bursting}} into energetic action and shaking hands heartily with Conrad] By reputation only, but very well, of course. How I wish I could have devoted myself to biology! I {{have always been}} interested in rocks and strata and volcanoes and so forth: they throw such a light on the age of the earth. [With conviction] There is nothing like biology. 'The cloud-capped towers, the solemn <b>binnacles,</b> the gorgeous temples, the great globe itself: yea, all that it inherit shall dissolve, and, like this influential pageant faded, leave not a rack behind.' Thats biology, you know: good sound biology. [He sits down. So do the others, Franklyn on the stool, and Conrad on his Chippendale]. Well, my dear Barnabas, {{what do you think of}} the situation? Dont you think the time has come for us to make a move? ...|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was also much modified over that of earlier cars. There {{was a new}} dashboard with large speedometer and tachometer instruments in twin <b>binnacles</b> closer to the driver's line of sight. The instruments were mounted at a more conventional angle, avoiding the reflections caused by the upward angled flat dash of earlier cars. Conversely, auxiliary instruments were moved to angled bezels in the centre console, further from the driver's line of sight than before. The new seats introduced adjustable headrests which merged with {{the top of the}} seat when fully down. The window winder levers, the door release levers and the quarterlight vent knobs were also restyled. The remote release for the boot (trunk) lid, located {{on the inside of the}} door opening on the B-post just under the door lock striker, was moved from the right hand side of the car to the left hand side. The location of this item was always independent of whether the car was left hand drive or right hand drive.|$|R
5000|$|The Honda CD125TC Benly is a , air-cooled, four stroke, twin {{cylinder}} [...] "commuter" [...] style motorcycle manufactured by the Honda Motor Company between 1982 and 1985 for the United Kingdom. Its engine size and power output {{were designed to}} conform to provisional licence restrictions {{of the time and}} it was a version of the Honda CD200 Benly introduced in the late 1970s, with the same four speed constant mesh transmission (as the 200) but electric start only. The machine was identical in all other respects apart from the engine barrel size. It was equipped with an enclosed chain and capacitor discharge electronic ignition. Brakes were drum front and rear and it had both centre- and side-stands. Electrics were 12 volt, and the battery was housed in the right-hand, side-panel. The left-hand panel contained a small toolkit. Instrumentation was by way of two handlebar-mounted <b>binnacles.</b> One contained a speedometer, with odometer and trip meter and was in miles per hour with markings for kilometres and maximum speeds in gears. The other contained warning lights for main beam, ignition/neutral and indicators.|$|R
500|$|Dei Gratia {{had reached}} a {{position}} of 38°20'N, 17°15'W, midway between the Azores and the coast of Portugal at about 1 pm on Wednesday, December 4, 1872, land time (Thursday, December 5, sea time). As Captain Morehouse came on deck, the helmsman reported a vessel about [...] distant, heading unsteadily towards Dei Gratia. The ship's erratic movements and the odd set of her sails led Morehouse to suspect that something was wrong. As the vessels drew close, he could see nobody on deck, and he received no reply to his signals, so he sent Deveau and second mate John Wright in a ship's boat to investigate. From the name on her stern the pair established {{that this was the}} Mary Celeste; they then climbed aboard, where they found the ship deserted. The sails, partly set, were in a poor condition, some missing altogether, and much of the rigging was damaged, with ropes hanging loosely over the sides. The main hatch cover was secure, but the fore and lazarette hatches were open, their covers beside them on the deck. The ship's single lifeboat, a small yawl that had apparently been stowed across the main hatch, was missing, while the <b>binnacle</b> housing the ship's compass had shifted from its place, its glass cover broken. There was about [...] of water in the hold, a significant but not alarming amount for a ship this size. A makeshift sounding rod (a device for measuring the amount of water in the hold) was found abandoned on the deck.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dashboard}} of the SD1 {{features an}} air vent, unusually, directly facing the passenger. The display <b>binnacle</b> sits {{on top of}} the dashboard in front of the driver to aid production in left-hand drive markets, since it avoided the expense of producing two different dashboard mouldings for LHD and RHD versions. The air vent doubles as a passage for the steering-wheel column, and the [...] "podular" [...] display <b>binnacle</b> can be easily fitted {{on top of the}} dashboard on either the left or right-hand side of the car. This concept was not entirely new; it had also been used on the Range Rover and was used again on the Mk.1 Austin Metro, both of which were also designed by David Bache.|$|E
2500|$|Under the body, {{the car has}} shed [...] {{and reduced}} its dry weight to [...] The engine remains in {{relatively}} stock specification but now produces [...] and [...] at 1.75bar (175kPa) boost. Inside, the car is stripped out with only the essential functions being available, controlled from a carbon fibre <b>binnacle.</b> New carbon fibre door panels and full roll cage complete the transformation.|$|E
60|$|But if the {{appearance}} of this lacustrine and amphibious dwelling was striking, and not without a certain rude and massive grandeur, its grounds and possessions, through which the brother and sister were still picking their way, were even more grotesque and remarkable. Over a space {{of half a dozen}} acres the flotsam and jetsam of years of tidal offerings were collected, and even guarded with a certain care. The blackened hulks of huge uprooted trees, scarcely distinguishable from the fragments of genuine wrecks beside them, were securely fastened by chains to stakes and piles driven in the marsh, while heaps of broken and disjointed bamboo orange crates, held together by ropes of fibre, glistened like ligamented bones heaped in the dead valley. Masts, spars, fragments of shell-encrusted boats, <b>binnacles,</b> round-houses and galleys, and part of the after-deck of a coasting schooner, had ceased their wanderings and found rest in this vast cemetery of the sea. The legend on a wheel-house, the lettering on a stern or bow, served for mortuary inscription. Wailed over by the trade winds, mourned by lamenting sea-birds, once every year the tide visited its lost dead and left them wet with its tears.|$|R
50|$|The Overchurch {{was given}} her major refit in 1998 at Lengthline Ship Repairers in Manchester, which {{resulted}} in a major rebuilding of all decks and fitting of new engines and navigation equipment. She was renamed Royal Daffodil and returned to service in 1999. Mountwood and Woodchurch were also refitted and renamed Royal Iris of the Mersey and Snowdrop, respectively in 2002 and 2004. The ferries were re-designed by their original architects - Graham and Woolnough. When all three vessels were refitted, the previously used helms and <b>binnacles</b> with compasses were placed back on the refurbished bridges. Other equipment, such as the telegraphs, were put in storage in the Mersey Ferries' archives. The fleet of three have served the river for nearly five decades and 2009 saw the 50th birthdays of the Royal Iris of the Mersey and the Snowdrop. This is remarkable for a ship to be in service for nearly 50 years and shows the dedication and care taken by the ferries' staff over the years to keep the boats in the conditions they can be found today. The refitting of the ferries has extended their working lives by approximately thirty years, and this is steadily increasing with additional repairs that are carried out on the boats on a regular basis.|$|R
500|$|The shipwrecks continued, nonetheless, {{with one}} of the most {{profitable}} of all being the 1931 wreck of the 6,000-ton Danish freighter Pennsylvania on the neighbouring island of Swona. The vessel was plundered by the inhabitants of Stroma, Swona and South Ronaldsay. Much of her cargo of slot machines, spark plugs, clothing, tobacco, watches and car parts was looted and concealed in haystacks, oatfields, lochs and caves. David Stogdon, a lifeboatman, recalled seeing what the islanders did with their illicit salvage: [...] "Every house was stuffed with wreck ... clocks, telescopes, <b>binnacles...</b> I seem to remember enormous dining-room tables in small cottages. And then of course from time to time they'd have cargo parts of lorries or something like that which could be put together to make a lorry and taken ashore on two or three fishing boats in calm weather. They'd land it quietly somewhere, drive it along and sell it." [...] Customs officers, policemen, coastguards and Receivers of Wreck were not generally welcome – the island had no police force – and the islanders let it be understood that unfortunate things could happen to the boats of unwanted visitors: [...] "Police boats could go missing, develop an unexpected leak or spontaneously combust." [...] The area still presents hazards to passing ships; in January 1993, the Danish coaster Bettina Danica ran aground off the southern end of Stroma. The wreck was broken apart by the action of the sea in 1997 and only her stern section is still visible.|$|R
