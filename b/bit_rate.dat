5|$|DAB {{technically}} provides low {{audio quality}} in the UK due to 98% of stereo stations using a <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> level of 128 kbit/s. with the MP2 audio codec, which provides poorer sound quality than FM-quality (assuming good reception on both DAB and FM). In addition, DAB+ stations broadcast in the UK use a bitrate between 24 and 48kbit/s. A <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of 256 kbit/s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal. Also, a large and growing number of music stations are only transmitting in mono. Indeed, the bit rates used by the radio stations on other digital platforms, such as cable, terrestrial and satellite are usually higher than on DAB, so the audio quality is also higher. For example, all of the BBC stations use higher bit rates on the digital TV platforms than on DAB apart from the BBC World Service on Freeview. On the other hand, an Ofcom survey, which was undertaken due to many consultation responses citing poor DAB quality, found that 94% of DAB listeners thought DAB was at least as good as FM.|$|E

The ground station communicated with the satellites in the 136–137MHz band. This was optimal for low-orbit satellites, allowed for a small antenna dish but gave a low <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> The various satellites using the facility conducted measurements of solar radiation, cosmic radiation, the polar ionosphere, and ionizing and dynamic effects regarding electric currents and magnetic disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Assisting {{communication}} {{across many}} modern optic fibre networks is a protocol known as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). The ATM protocol {{allows for the}} side-by-side data transmission mentioned in the second paragraph. It is suitable for public telephone networks because it establishes a pathway for data through the network and associates a traffic contract with that pathway. The traffic contract is essentially an agreement between the client and the network about how the network is to handle the data; if the network cannot meet {{the conditions of the}} traffic contract it does not accept the connection. This is important because telephone calls can negotiate a contract so as to guarantee themselves a constant <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> something that will ensure a caller's voice is not delayed in parts or cut off completely. There are competitors to ATM, such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), that perform a similar task and are expected to supplant ATM in the future.|$|E

25|$|In {{communications}} technologies without forward {{error correction}} and other physical layer protocol overhead, there is no distinction between gross <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and physical layer net <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> For example, the net as well as gross <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of Ethernet 10Base-T is 10Mbit/s. Due to the Manchester line code, each bit is represented by two pulses, resulting in a pulse rate of 20megabaud.|$|E
25|$|The net <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the Ethernet 100Base-TX {{physical}} layer standard is 100Mbit/s, while the gross bitrate is 125Mbit/second, {{due to the}} 4B5B (four bit over five bit) encoding. In this case, the gross <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{is equal to the}} symbol rate or pulse rate of 125megabaud, due to the NRZI line code.|$|E

30|$|Due to the object’s shape, motion characteristics, {{prediction}} accuracy, and {{ratio of}} foreground and background in an MB, a certain mode might {{not always have}} a specific ratio-distortion (R-D) characteristics; however, it is a general trend that when the Lagrangian multiplier is relatively high (at low <b>bit</b> <b>rates),</b> more emphasis {{is given to the}} <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> compared to the distortion; on the other hand, when the Lagrangian multiplier is relatively low (at high <b>bit</b> <b>rates),</b> more emphasis is given to the distortion compared to the <b>bit</b> <b>rates.</b> Thus, for a given block (16 [*]×[*] 16), larger modes (such as 16 [*]×[*] 16, 16 [*]×[*] 8, and 8 [*]×[*] 16) might be chosen at low <b>bit</b> <b>rates,</b> whereas smaller modes (8 [*]×[*] 8, 8 [*]×[*] 4, 4 [*]×[*] 8, and 4 [*]×[*] 4) might be chosen at high <b>bit</b> <b>rates.</b> The general tendency of the pattern mode is that it provides less bits and high mean square error (MSE) compared to the other modes because we only consider pattern-covered areas for bits but overall areas for calculating MSE (non-pattern-matched area contributing in higher MSE). Figure  3 also shows the same tendency as the number of MBs encoded as the pattern mode is decreasing with the <b>bit</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R

25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 data stream, {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> which specifies how many kilobits per second of audio are desired. The higher the <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original recording. With too low a <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E
