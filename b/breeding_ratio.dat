50|$|Deuterium can be {{obtained}} by the separation of hydrogen isotopes in sea water (see heavy water production). Tritium has a short half life of just over a decade, so only trace amounts are found in nature. To fuel the reactor, the neutrons from the reaction are used to breed more tritium through a reaction in a blanket of lithium surrounding the reaction chamber. Tritium breeding is key to the success of a fusion cycle, and to date this technique has not been demonstrated.

40|$|Isotopic {{tailoring}} of the deuterium and tritium density {{profiles in}} fusion reactors {{can lead to}} reduced tritium inventory in plasma facing components and, therefore, improved safety considerations. The isotopic tailoring concept consists of utilizing a tritium-rich pellet source for core fueling and a deuteriumrich gas source for edge fueling. Because of the improved particle confinement associated with the deeper tritium core fueling component, comparable core densities of deuterium and tritium can be maintained even when the edge deuterium fuel source is {{much larger than the}} core tritium fuel source. The fuel composition of the edge and scrape-off plasmas as well as the isotope fractions in plasma facing components reflect the total throughput of all makeup fuel and are therefore deuterium-rich.

40|$|The first {{fast breeder}} reactors, {{constructed}} in the 1945 - 1960 time period, used metallic fuels composed of uranium, plutonium, or their alloys.

40|$|In the {{laboratory}} simulation of D-T fusion breeder blankets 14 MeV neutrons {{are produced by}} the bombardment of a titanium-tritide target with deuterium ions using accelerating voltages up to 500 keV and beam currents ranging from micro to milliamperes.

50|$|While the lark {{buntings}} {{are socially}} monogamous, there is extensive extra-pair mating, observed through extra-pair paternity. In songbirds, {{it is suggested}} that social monogamy exists because of limited opportunities for polygyny. As expected, there is considerable aggression between males and between females, competing for mates. Many males are unable to find a social mate, which can be attributed to male-biased <b>breeding</b> sex <b>ratio,</b> social monogamy, and the frequency of extra-pair paternity. Acquisition of a social mate is an essential element of a male’s fitness, thus social mating success plays a significant role in variable selection of male traits.|$|R
50|$|To {{solve the}} waste {{disposal}} problem, the IFR had an on-site electrowinning fuel reprocessing unit that recycled the uranium {{and all the}} transuranics (not just plutonium) via electroplating, leaving just short half-life fission products in the waste. Some of these fission products could later be separated for industrial or medical uses and the rest sent to a waste repository (where {{they would not have}} to be stored for anywhere near as long as wastes containing long half-life transuranics). The IFR pyroprocessing system uses molten cadmium cathodes and electrorefiners to reprocess metallic fuel directly on-site at the reactor. Such systems not only commingle all the minor actinides with both uranium and plutonium, they are compact and self-contained, so that no plutonium-containing material ever needs to be transported away from the site of the breeder reactor. Breeder reactors incorporating such technology would most likely be designed with <b>breeding</b> <b>ratios</b> very close to 1.00, so that after an initial loading of enriched uranium and/or plutonium fuel, the reactor would then be refueled only with small deliveries of natural uranium metal. A quantity of natural uranium metal equivalent to a block {{about the size of a}} milk crate delivered once per month would be all the fuel such a 1 gigawatt reactor would need. Such self-contained breeders are currently envisioned as the final self-contained and self-supporting ultimate goal of nuclear reactor designers.

40|$|Neutronics {{performances}} of advanced self-cooled liquid blanket {{systems have been}} investigated in design activity of the helical-type reactor FFHR 2. In the present study, a new three-dimensional (3 -D) neutronics calculation system has been developed for the helical-type reactor to enhance quick feedback between neutronics evaluation and design modification. Using this new calculation system, advanced Flibe-cooled and Li-cooled liquid blanket systems proposed for FFHR 2 have been evaluated to make clear design issues to enhance neutronics performance. Based on calculated results, modification of the blanket dimensions and configuration have been attempted to achieve the adequate tritium breeding ability and neutron shielding performance in the helical reactor. The total tritium <b>breeding</b> <b>ratios</b> (TBRs) obtained after modifying the blanket dimensions indicated that all the advanced blanket systems proposed for FFHR 2 would achieve adequate tritium self-sufficiency by dimension adjustment and optimization of structures in the breeder layers. Issues in neutron shielding performance have been investigated quantitatively using 3 -D geometry of the helical blanket system, support structures, poroidal coils etc. Shielding performance of the helical coils against direct neutrons from core plasma would achieve design target by further optimization of shielding materials. However, suppression of the neutron streaming and reflection through the divertor pumping areas in the original design is important issue to protect the poroidal coils and helical coils, respectively. Investigation of the neutron wall loading indicated that the peaking factor of the neutron wall load distribution would be moderated by the toroidal and helical effect of the plasma distribution in the helical reactor. ...|$|R
40|$|For {{vertebrates}} with temperature-dependent sex determination, primary (or hatchling) sex ratios {{are often}} skewed, {{an issue of}} particular relevance to concerns over {{effects of climate change}} on populations. However, the <b>ratio</b> of <b>breeding</b> males to females, or the operational sex ratio (OSR), is important to understand because it has consequences for population demographics and determines the capacity of a species to persist. The OSR also affects mating behaviors and mate choice, depending on the more abundant sex. For sea turtles, hatchling and juvenile sex ratios are generally female-biased, and with warming nesting beach temperatures, there is concern that populations may become feminized. Our purpose was to evaluate the <b>breeding</b> sex <b>ratio</b> for leatherback turtles at a nesting beach in St. Croix, USVI. In 2010, we sampled nesting females and later sampled their hatchlings as they emerged from nests. Total genomic DNA was extracted and all individuals were genotyped using 6 polymorphic microsatellite markers. We genotyped 662 hatchlings from 58 females, matching 55 females conclusively to their nests. Of the 55, 42 females mated with one male each, 9 mated with 2 males each and 4 mated with at least 3 males each, for a multiple paternity rate of 23. 6 %. Using GERUD 1. 0, we reconstructed parental genotypes, identifying 47 different males and 46 females for an estimated <b>breeding</b> sex <b>ratio</b> of 1. 02 males for every female.

40|$|SUMMARY Both CLN 1 and CLN 5 {{deficiencies}} lead {{to severe}} neurodegenerative diseases of childhood, known as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). The broadly similar phenotypes of NCL mouse models, {{and the potential}} for interactions between NCL proteins, raise the possibility of shared or convergent disease mechanisms. To begin addressing these issues, we have developed a new mouse model lacking both Cln 1 and Cln 5 genes. These double-knockout (Cln 1 / 5 dko) mice were fertile, showing a slight decrease in expected Mendelian <b>breeding</b> <b>ratios,</b> as well as impaired embryoid body formation by induced pluripotent stem cells derived from Cln 1 / 5 dko fibroblasts. Typical disease manifestations of the NCLs, i. e. seizures and motor dysfunction, were detected at the age of 3 months, earlier than in either single knockout mouse. Pathological analyses revealed a similar exacerbation and earlier onset of disease in Cln 1 / 5 dko mice, which exhibited a pronounced accumulation of autofluorescent storage material. Cortical demyelination and more pronounced glial activation in cortical and thalamic regions was followed by cortical neuron loss. Alterations in lipid metabolism in Cln 1 / 5 dko showed a specific increase in plasma phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activity. Finally, gene expression profiling of Cln 1 / 5 dko cortex revealed defects in myelination and immune response pathways, with a prominent downregulation of α-synuclein in Cln 1 / 5 dko mouse brains. The simultaneous loss of both Cln 1 and Cln 5 genes might enhance the typical pathological phenotypes of these mice by disrupting or downregulating shared or convergent pathogenic pathways, which could potentially include interactions of CLN 1 and CLN 5...|$|R

50|$|This {{not only}} greatly reduces {{the size of}} the reactor, but the fast {{neutrons}} from a single reaction are capable of causing several breeding reactions.

50|$|After {{starting}} the reactor with existing U-233 {{or some other}} fissile material such as U-235 or Pu-239, a breeding cycle similar to but more efficient than that with U-238 and plutonium can be created.

In some molten salt reactor designs, the Pa-233 is extracted and protected from neutrons (which could transform it to Pa-234 and then to U-234), until it has decayed to U-233.

During this time there were dissertations written on neutronic analysis systems and the results of neutronic analysis on several blanket and shield designs. The results were presented in the literature. Now in the fifth decade of fusion research, investigators often return to the earlier analyses for the neutronic results that are applicable to current blanket and shield designs, with the idea of using the older work as a basis for the new.

In addition, approximations were often made to the cross sections used because more exact data were not available.
