60|$|I arrived {{yesterday}} at this point, and have given my proxy to Joel <b>Briller,</b> Esq., my wife's cousin, and a staunch Republican, who will worthily represent Posey County in field and forum. He points with pride to a stainless {{record in the}} halls of legislation, which have often echoed to his soul-stirring eloquence on questions which lie at the very foundation of popular government. He has been called the Patrick Henry of Hardpan, where he has done yeoman's service in the cause of civil and religious liberty. Mr. <b>Briller</b> left for Distilleryville last evening, and the standard bearer of the Democratic host confronting that stronghold of freedom will find him a lion in his path. I have been asked to remain here and deliver some addresses to the people in a local contest involving issues of paramount importance. That duty being performed, I shall in person enter the arena of armed debate and move {{in the direction of the}} heaviest firing, burning my ships behind me. I forward by this mail to his Excellency the President a request for the appointment of my son, Jabez Leonidas Doke, as postmaster at Hardpan. I would take it, sir, as a great favor if you would give the application a strong oral indorsement, as the appointment is in the line of reform. Be kind enough to inform me what are the emoluments of the office I hold in the military arm, and if they are by salary or fees. Are there any perquisites? My mileage account will be transmitted monthly.|$|E
60|$|I {{arrived on}} the tented field {{yesterday}} by steamboat, the recent storms having inundated the landscape, covering, I understand, {{the greater part of}} a congressional district. I am pained to find that Joel <b>Briller,</b> Esq., a prominent citizen of Posey County, Illinois, and a far-seeing statesman who held my proxy, and who a month ago should have been thundering at the gates of Disunion, has not been heard from, and has doubtless been sacrificed upon the altar of his country. In him the American people lose a bulwark of freedom. I would respectfully move that you designate a committee to draw up resolutions of respect to his memory, and that the office holders and men under your command wear the usual badge of mourning for thirty days. I shall at once place myself at the head of affairs here, and am now ready to entertain any suggestions which you may make, looking to the better enforcement of the laws in this commonwealth. The militant Democrats {{on the other side of}} the river appear to be contemplating extreme measures. They have two large cannons facing this way, and yesterday morning, I am told, some of them came down to the water's edge and remained in session for some time, making infamous allegations.|$|E

6000|$|Our artist {{loves to}} joke at a soldier; in whose livery {{there appears to}} him to be {{something}} almost as ridiculous as in the uniform of the gentleman of the shoulder-knot. Tall life-guardsmen and fierce grenadiers figure in many of his designs, and almost always in a ridiculous way. Here again we have the honest popular English feeling which jeers at pomp or pretension of all kinds, and is especially jealous of all display of military authority. [...] "Raw Recruit," [...] "ditto dressed," [...] ditto [...] "served up," [...] as we {{see them in the}} [...] "Sketch-Book," [...] are so many satires upon the army: Hodge with his ribbons flaunting in his hat, or with red coat and musket, drilled stiff and pompous, or at last, minus leg and arm, tottering about on crutches, does not fill our English artist with the enthusiasm that follows the soldier in every other part of Europe. Jeanjean, the conscript in France, is laughed at to be sure, but then it is because he is a bad soldier: when he comes to have a huge pair of mustachios and the croix-d'honneur to <b>briller</b> on his poitrine cicatrisee, Jeanjean becomes a member of a class that is more respected than any other in the French nation. The veteran soldier inspires our people with no such awe--we hold that democratic weapon the fist in much more honor than the sabre and bayonet, and laugh at a man tricked out in scarlet and pipe-clay.|$|E

40|$|MANY STUDIES have rather clearly dem-onstrated the {{inadequacy}} of the simple dipolar concept {{to account for the}} total elec-trocardiographic information available on the body surface. '- 6 For example, Okada, Langner, and <b>Briller</b> have attempted extraction of the dipolar component from the precordial leads by cancellation with synthetic dipolar leads derived from vectorcardiograms. An unac-counted-for residual was found. 3 By means of closely spaced multiple lead recordings, subsequent workers have constructed isopo-tential maps demonstrating, not only dipolar pattern, but islands of apparent multipolar activity as well. 1 2, 4, 5 Factor analysis provides still another means by which multipolar contribution may be de-tected. 5, 7 8 Mathematically, factor analysis compares each of a population of waveforms with every other waveform in the group, retains the several bits of unique information, and casts out the redundant information as it reappears in lead after lead. Previously, when this process of factor analysis was applied to total-surface electrocardiograms recorded from 153 to 160 closely spaced sites completely encompassing the thorax, at least seven or eight unique waveforms or princi-pal factors were found. In brief, all of the nonredundant information present in the many QRS complexes could be expressed concisel...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{existing}} {{title of}} the Ditié, written by Christine de Pizan just after the coronation in Reims, concentrates all the action and the attention towards Joan of Arc, but is this due to the historic influence of a rather recent focus on the Pucelle ? A more well-balanced and respectful reading of the context could restore the king, Charles, the sun who had returned to shine on the kingdom of France, as the real hero of the poem. Jeanne, whose role is obviously fundamental, is God’s instrument by which to assert the king’s power and to allow a return to peace, including for the contrite rebels. Le titre actuel du Ditié, écrit par Christine de Pizan juste après le sacre de Reims, concentre toute l’action et l’attention vers Jeanne d’Arc : est-il le résultat historique d’une assez récente focalisation sur la Pucelle ?

40|$|In middle school, {{one of my}} {{teachers}} said about me “pourrait <b>briller,</b> mais se contente de luire ” (“he could shine, but is satisfied by glowing”). Fortunately for me, I have met during my education numerous people that have encouraged me to go further than I would have on my own, allowing me to shine. By {{the end of my}} undergraduate studies in Grenoble, I was still undecided about my future, and Henriette Lapierre encouraged me to broaden my horizons, and she pushed me to find what my true motivation was. Her passion and enthusiasm convinced me to apply for a Master at the University of Lausanne. Though she never saw me graduate, I am grateful for her swift kick in the butt that led me to where I am today. Once in Lausanne, I had to find a master’s research project and an advisor. Christian Teyssier opened his door for me (literally since I shared his office for two years!). After our initial talk, I did not completely understand the project, all I remembered was that it was in the USA, in a remote mountains range, and that was enough to convince me!

40|$|The {{age of the}} Milne Land Stade (MLS) moraines in the Scoresby Sund {{region of}} East Greenland is key for testing the {{hypothesis}} that strong seasonality marked abrupt cooling events, such as the Younger Dryas, registered in Greenland ice cores. The relevant chronology is based on 69 radiocarbon dates of shells from raised beaches and deltas related to marine inundation and isostatic rebound that accompanied glacier retreat from the moraines. Taken together, these dates {{form the basis for}} a relative sea-level curve that shows very high rates of emergence typical of recently deglaciated regions. Upward extrapolation of this curve suggests that the marine limit (134 m a. s. l.) dates to about 12, 400 cal yr B. P. The shorelines that mark the marine limit lie within areas that were ice-covered when the glaciers were at the outer limit of the MLS advance; hence, the moraines that form the outer limit must antedate 12, 400 cal yr B. P. and probably are from earliest Younger Dryas or Allerød time. At Holger Danskes <b>Briller,</b> an inner moraine grades to a massive ice-contact delta, now at 101 m a. s. l., which is dated to 11, 000 – 11, 300 cal yr B. P. The age of the outer MLS moraines, along with constraints on the maximum possible Younger Dryas ice extent and snowline lowering are consistent with the idea that East Greenland climate experienced strong seasonality during Younger Dryas time...|$|E
