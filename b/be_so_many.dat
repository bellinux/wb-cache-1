5|$|In 1975, Peter Dodson, {{examining}} {{why there}} should <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> species and genera of lambeosaurine duckbills within {{such a short}} geological time frame and small area, published {{the results of a}} morphometric study in which he measured dozens of skulls. He found that many of the species had been based on remains that were better interpreted as juveniles or different sexes. For Lambeosaurus, he found that L. clavinitialis was probably the female of L. lambei, and Corythosaurus frontalis and Procheneosaurus praeceps were probably its juveniles. L. magnicristatus was different enough to warrant its own species. He interpreted Procheneosaurus cranibrevis and P. erectofrons as juvenile corythosaurs. However, restudy of the Procheneosaurus/Tetragonosaurus remains indicates that within species, assignments had become confused, and the type specimen of P. cranibrevis was a Lambeosaurus juvenile, whereas others were Corythosaurus, based on the distinctive form of the contact of the nasal bone with the premaxilla.|$|E

The only exception was that he split off Liolytopelte as a subgenus because of its distinctive hard plate within the penis; all other species were included in the subgenus Deroceras.|$|E

In the 16th century, Juan González de Mendoza wrote that [...] "it is plainly seene, that [...] did come with shipping into the Indies, having conquered al that is from China, unto the farthest part thereof[...] [...] [...] So that at this day there is great memory of them [...] [...] [...] {{in the kingdom of}} Calicut, where <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> trees and fruits [...] [...] [...] were brought thither by the Chinos when that they were lords and governours of that countrie." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} 1860s, skirts had reached their {{ultimate}} width. After about 1862 {{the silhouette of}} the crinoline changed and rather than being bell-shaped it was now flatter at the front and projected out more behind. [...] This large area was largely occupied by all manner of decoration. Puffs and strips could cover much of the skirt. There could <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> flounces that the material of the skirt itself was hardly visible. Lace again became popular and was used all over the dress. Any part of the dress could also be embroidered in silver or gold. This massive construct of a dress required gauze lining to stiffen it, as well as multiple starched petticoats. Even the clothes women would ride horses in received these sorts of embellishments.|$|E
2500|$|Laird {{recalled}} that {{the publication of}} the first issue of his and Eastman's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic came about thanks to a loan the two secured from Quentin Eastman, Kevin's uncle. Although the two were able to pay him back swiftly, it led Laird to speculate about what could have been: [...] "if we hadn't gotten that loan from him at that point in our lives, it might have taken us a couple more months to raise that money from other sources, and who knows what might have happened differently {{as a result of that}} delay?" [...] It occurred to him that [...] "there must <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> times where a self-publishing venture can sink or float on the strength of" [...] a relatively small amount of money, so he felt a desire to use some of his [...] "good fortune, in the financial sense, to help people out" [...] (and, in addition to the creators, the Foundation also aids those [...] "involved in charitable organizations").|$|E
2500|$|His lectures {{frequently}} {{lasted for}} three or four hours. [...] His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the [...] "Woodward", after which his other lectures were deemed to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> [...] "milli-Woodwards" [...] long. In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue. In one of his laboratories, his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling, complete with a large blue [...] "tie" [...] appended. There it hung for some years (early 1970s), until scorched in a minor laboratory fire. He detested exercise, could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night, was a heavy smoker, and enjoyed Scotch whisky and martinis.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Flickering Myth critiqued that [...] "Some stories just don’t need telling, and Leatherface {{is one of}} them. It's not that it retcons elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre mythology, or that it's a 'pointless prequel' – it's just an empty movie. You'll have forgotten you've seen {{it as soon as}} the credits roll. Prequels, sequels and remakes can all enrich a story and tell it from a new perspective, but Leatherface just doesn’t do that."Screen International called the film [...] "a production line effort with an eye on cashflow rather than the demented work of art Hooper loosed on the world", stating [...] "this eighth entry is above average for its attenuated series. Gore levels are as high as expected and, naturally, the finale leaves things open for further installments." [...] Regarding the film's viewer appeal, HeyUGuys theorised, [...] "Not only is this prequel attempting to deliver something fans of the series don't necessarily want, it doesn't really do what it promises particularly well either. One for completists for sure, but on the whole Leatherface is too detached for TCM fans, and too extreme for the wider public." [...] William Bibbiani of IGN ranked it as the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre film because [...] "it adds nothing new or interesting to the series. The problem is not just that this film is a prequel, so we know exactly where it’s going, but that the road to the inevitable takes us through almost unbearably familiar territory. It honestly looks as though the filmmakers who made Leatherface didn't watch the original films, but watched all of the films that ripped off The Texas Chain Saw Massacre instead." [...] Film critic Rob Gonsalves reviewed that [...] "Hooper's Chainsaw is often imitated, never duplicated (or bested, say I), a sui generis sweatbox odyssey that seems to owe nothing to any other film before it. Leatherface feels properly respectful, made by filmmakers who idolize the original, and that’s also its weakness: it's a jumped-up fan film, and because it's meant to be a prequel to Hooper's movie it's locked into whatever happens in that movie. It can't deviate from what we know, and can't truly surprise us." [...] Heather Wixson of Daily Dead went into Leatherface [...] "primed to love it", but felt that the final product [...] "never quite makes up its mind about just what kind of movie it wants to be, and suffers for its indecision. But as a whole, Leatherface is such a disappointing entry because it spends so much time trying to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> other things than just a straight-up Texas Chainsaw movie, and I couldn't help but wonder why." [...] Wixson commended the cinematography, practical effects, and Lili Taylor's acting, but slammed the third act.|$|E
