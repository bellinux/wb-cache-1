25|$|For {{corporate}} or enterprise use, {{a private}} telephone exchange {{is often referred}} to as a private <b>branch</b> <b>exchange</b> (PBX), when it has connections to the public switched telephone network. A PBX is installed in enterprise facilities, typically collocated with large office spaces or within an organizational campus to serve the local private telephone system and any private leased line circuits. Smaller installations might deploy a PBX or key telephone system in the office of a receptionist.|$|E

2500|$|Reconfiguration, by exchanging the {{functional}} {{links between the}} elements of the system, represents {{one of the most important}} measures which can improve the operational performance of a distribution system. The problem of optimization through the reconfiguration of a power distribution system, in terms of its definition, is a historical single objective problem with constraints. Since 1975, when Merlin and Back [...] introduced the idea of distribution system reconfiguration for active power loss reduction, until nowadays, a lot of researchers have proposed diverse methods and algorithms to solve the reconfiguration problem as a single objective problem. Some authors have proposed Pareto optimality based approaches (including active power losses and reliability indices as objectives). For this purpose, different artificial intelligence based methods have been used: microgenetic, <b>branch</b> <b>exchange,</b> particle swarm optimization [...] and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to the problem of logical topology reconfiguration in congested WDM networks using simulation-based multi-time scale Markov Decision Processes (MDP). Previous work considered total reconfiguration of the network, <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> or addition and deletion of lightpaths when the traffic pattern changes. However, the special case when {{all or part of the}} network is congested has not been studied in detail before. We demonstrate that our approach performs well in both uncongested and congested regimes. We restrict the actions taken in reconfiguring the network to <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> to limit the effect of reconfigurations on the number of dropped calls. At each time step a list of possible <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> is formed, and using a heuristic algorithm this (usually long) list is trimmed down to a more manageable list. We use the MDP model to predict the traffic, and then a simulation based online algorithm is used to select one of the <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> as the next action. We apply a policy improvement method to the heuristic policy to obtain a better policy than the heuristic policy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} novel and {{efficient}} heuristic algorithm for solving the distribution network reconfiguration problem for loss reduction. We formulate {{the problem of}} finding incremental <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> as a minimum cost maximum flow (MCMF) problem. This novel approach finds the best set of concurrent <b>branch</b> <b>exchanges</b> during each iteration of the algorithm and leads to larger loss reductions and a reduced number of iter-ations, hence significantly reducing the computational runtime. Experiments using distribution systems with sizes of up to 10476 buses demonstrate that the proposed technique leads to an average speed-up of 2. 3 × with similar or better solution quality compared to the Baran’s reconfiguration technique [32].
