40|$|Prediction {{of river}} flow {{is one of}} the main issues in the field of water {{resources}} management. Because of the complexity of the rainfall-runoff process, data-driven methods have gained increased importance. In the current study, two newly developed models called Least Square Support Vector Regression (LSSVR) and Regression Tree (RT) are used. The LSSVR model is based on the constrained optimization method and applies structural risk minimization in order to yield a general optimized result. Also in the RT, data movement is based on laws discovered in the tree. <b>Both</b> <b>models</b> <b>have</b> been applied to the data in the Kashkan watershed. Variables include (a) recorded precipitation values in the Kashkan watershed stations, and (b) outlet discharge values of one and two previous days. Present discharge is considered as output of the two models. Following that, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out on the input features and less important features has been diminished so that <b>both</b> <b>models</b> <b>have</b> provided better prediction on the data. The final results of <b>both</b> <b>models</b> <b>have</b> been compared. It was found that the LSSVR <b>model</b> <b>has</b> better performance.

40|$|Calibration and {{validation}} of hydrological models for simulating stream flow {{can usually be}} a promising procedure for future sustainable watershed development. Therefore, development of hydrological models with attributed capabilities is vital to explore the models. Recently, arid climate regions are facing critical water resource problems due to elevated water scarcity. The main objective {{of this research is}} to compare the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a knowledge driven by semi-distributed hydrological model, with the Modular Neural Network (MNN), a data driven technique, in predicting the daily flow in arid and large scale. Development of SWAT required digital elevation map, hydro-meteorological data, land use map, and soil maps; whilst, the MNN only needed hydro-meteorological data. For <b>both</b> <b>models,</b> a sensitivity analysis that included both calibration {{and validation}} with individual uncertainty evaluation methods was carried out. Generally, results for relative errors such as Nash-Sutcliffe, coefficient of determination and percent of bias favored the SWAT for the validation period. Not only that, the absolute error criteria such as root mean square error, mean square error and mean relative error obtained were close to zero for the SWAT as well within the same period. The mean absolute error for <b>both</b> <b>models</b> was similar during the validation period. Results of the uncertainty evaluation were in satisfactory range. <b>Both</b> <b>models</b> <b>had</b> given similar trend for flow prediction during the validation period. Results of box plot, according to 50 % (median) of daily flow, showed that <b>both</b> <b>models</b> <b>had</b> respectively overestimated (MNN) and underestimated (SWAT) the daily flow during validation period. Evaluation on runoff volume for each year showed that <b>both</b> <b>models</b> <b>had</b> a one-year underestimation and three-year overestimation in the same period. However, the overestimation of MNN was more obvious. As a conclusion, this study showed that <b>both</b> <b>models</b> <b>have</b> promising prediction performance for daily flow in a large scale watershed with arid climat...|$|R

We also find there exist nonalternant systems which have ground states with different irreducible representations. In these latter systems neither the Hückel nor the Heisenberg–Dirac model is sufficient to give a qualitative picture of the molecule. Instead a combined Hückel–Heisenberg–Dirac model (the Hubbard model) must be used.
