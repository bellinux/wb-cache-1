5|$|The north west {{tower is}} also of Norman construction. It {{serves as the}} baptistry and houses a black marble font, {{consisting}} of a bowl on a large <b>baluster</b> dating from 1697. The {{lower part of the}} north wall of the nave is also from the Norman building, but can only be viewed from the cloister because the interior has been decorated with mosaic.|$|E
5|$|Early Medieval architecture's secular {{buildings}} were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture {{ranged from a}} synthesis of Hiberno—Saxon monasticism, to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, <b>baluster</b> shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|The Studio {{series was}} {{inspired}} by Matisse paintings, and Diane Waldman claims that this particular effort was modelled upon Matisse's L'Atelier Rouge (The Red Studio), although the Lichtenstein Foundation website credits two other Matisse works as inspiration as well as Fernand Léger's The <b>Baluster,</b> 1925, which is represented in the far right corner. Léger was one of Lichtenstein's closest friends. By incorporating Matisse in his own studio setting, Lichtenstein is perceived as presenting himself as Matisse's peer {{and in so doing}} repositions pop art as a historical style rather than a contemporary one.|$|E

This solution allows {{to reduce the cost}} of manufacturingcarved <b>balusters,</b> without resorting to a woodcarver and using expensive equipment. Throughfurther improvements, such as painting, patina, it turns out a product that is difficult todistinguish from solid carved <b>balusters...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Banister, Railing or Handrail : The angled {{member for}} handholding, as {{distinguished}} from the vertical <b>balusters</b> which hold it up for stairs that are open on one side; {{there is often a}} railing on both sides, sometimes only on one side or not at all, on wide staircases there is sometimes also one in the middle, or even more. The term [...] "banister" [...] is sometimes used to mean just the handrail, or sometimes the handrail and the <b>balusters</b> or sometimes just the <b>balusters.</b>|$|R
25|$|The only {{written record}} of the {{interior}} is from 1746 in which the wives of justices and vestrymen were assigned a box pew in the northern corner of the chancel and young women of the parish were assigned their former pews. There is one original <b>baluster</b> (the second from the left end on the altar rail). The rood screen is based on footings discovered in the 1950s while the sounding board, that is 17th-century in origin, was found in 1894 in a barn at Macclesfield, a nearby plantation. The single <b>baluster</b> and sounding board are the only original interior appointments.|$|E
25|$|A five-bay {{pavilion}} projects {{from the}} east, with a veranda running its full length.

50|$|<b>Balusters</b> are {{normally}} separated {{by at least}} the same measurement as {{the size of the}} square bottom section. Placing <b>balusters</b> too far apart (to save money) diminishes their aesthetic appeal. Balustrades normally terminate in columns, building walls or more properly in heavy newel posts because otherwise they will not be structurally strong enough.|$|R
25|$|In {{the churchyard}} is a <b>baluster</b> sundial, and a South African War Memorial {{from the early}} 1900s, which is {{probably}} by Douglas and Minshull. The south gates to the churchyard, dating from 1877, were by Douglas. To the northwest {{of the church is}} a lychgate designed by Sir Herbert Baker in 1929, consisting of a pyramidal roof on ogee timber framing.|$|E
25|$|All {{openings}} {{other than}} the main entrance and the second and fourth bays at ground level are articulated with full-height, wooden, double doors with louvre panels. The central entrance houses decorative, wrought-iron railings and its flanking windows begin at a height of approximately four feet. At the upper level bays, <b>baluster</b> rails create balconettes. Planar surrounds frame the window openings, extending above to incorporate separate architrave moldings.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} is a 18m high regular structure with dimensions of 35m by 45m, reminding willingly {{the features of the}} Warsaw Phiharmonic building rebuilt at the same period (1955). The main elevation is mounted on a pedestal. The central part of the frontage displays a two-storey high colonnade, joined at its bottom by <b>baluster</b> railings. Facades are topped with attic style cornices with wire mesh walls. Terraces are available between each facade colonnades.|$|E

25|$|The single {{chamfered}} bay {{is particularly}} ornate, as it recesses slightly and then curves outward in a baroque fashion. At the ground floor, a wide, segmental arch opening with a hood-mould accesses secondary office space. At the upper level, a rectangular doorway is crowned by an intricate cameo with angel figures {{on either side}} of it. The upper level bay is framed by Tuscan columns which spring from a string-course at the <b>baluster</b> level and support a projection of the building cornice.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{steps with}} {{decorative}} wooden railings of solid wood panels pierced by saw-cut quatrefoils {{climb to the}} hip-roofed porch which runs {{the length of the}} first story on the south (front) facade. Immediately east of them another set of steps leads down to the English basement, currently occupied by a small clothing store. The porch roof is supported by square pillars with knee braces at the top and a molded cornice. At the deck, a <b>baluster</b> similar to those on the steps up to the porch connects the pillars.|$|E
25|$|The structure, {{located in}} the northwestern corner of Dewan-e-Aam quadrangle, is typical of Mughal {{architecture}} of Shah Jahan's times. It is completely built of white marble that was brought from Makrana The façade is composed of cusped arches and engaged <b>baluster</b> columns with smooth and fine contours. The mosque has three superimposed domes, two aisles of five bays, and a slightly raised central pishtaq, or portal with a rectangular frame. This five-arched facade distinguishes it from other mosques of the similar class with three-arched facades. The interior is simple and plain {{with the exception of}} ceilings that are decorated and designed in four different orders, two arcuate, and two trabeated.|$|E
25|$|The Deoxidized Metal Co. of Bridgeport in 1885 {{secured a}} {{contract}} for the bronze <b>balusters</b> required for the wew Treasury building in Washington, D.C. These <b>balusters</b> were an elaborate design incorporating leaves, beads and moulding, all intended to have a bright finish, which required {{a great deal of}} hand work. Deoxidized could make, but not burnish, the <b>balusters</b> and sought to subcontract this work, but no one took them up on their offer. At that time there was no machinery for polishing metals, the usual procedure was to immerse in acid, and hand work was too costly. The contract from Washington definitely stated that acid was not to be used.|$|R

Supported on shallow twin brackets, the parapet consists of masonry <b>balusters</b> and pillars at the junction of each bay topped by urns. A projecting pediment in the Brunswick Street facade which breaks {{the line of the}} parapet is flanked by interlocking circles, instead of <b>balusters.</b>|$|R
25|$|In France this {{flat and}} simple {{treatment}} {{was to a}} certain extent used. Doors were most suitably adorned in this way, and the split <b>baluster</b> so characteristic of Jacobean work is often to be met with. There are some very good cabinets in the museum at Lyngby, Denmark, illustrating these two methods of treatment in combination. But the Swiss and Austrians elaborated this style, greatly improving the effect by the addition of color. However, the best Continental designs adopted the typical acanthus foliage of Italy, while still retaining a certain amount of Gothic feeling in the strength of the lines and the cut of the detail. Panelling often long and narrow was commonly used for all sorts of domestic purposes, a feature being a medallion in the center with a simple arrangement of vase, dolphins, dragons, or birds and foliage filling in the spaces above and below.|$|E
25|$|Many ancient {{standing}} stone monuments were erected {{during the}} prehistoric period, amongst {{the best known}} are Stonehenge, Devil's Arrows, Rudston Monolith and Castlerigg. With the introduction of Ancient Roman architecture there was a development of basilicas, baths, amphitheatres, triumphal arches, villas, Roman temples, Roman roads, Roman forts, stockades and aqueducts. It was the Romans who founded the first cities and towns such as London, Bath, York, Chester and St Albans. Perhaps the best known example is Hadrian's Wall stretching right across northern England. Another well-preserved example is the Roman Baths at Bath, Somerset. Early Medieval architecture's secular buildings were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture ranged from a synthesis of Hiberno—Saxon monasticism, to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, <b>baluster</b> shafts and triangular headed openings.

500|$|A {{circular}} wall, with a six-panel {{wooden door}} rounded {{to mimic the}} wall's curvature, was located between the building's entrance hall and its stair hall. The stairway's balustrade in the stair hall featured turned <b>baluster</b> shafts and a newel crafted from maple. The stairs themselves featured scrolled step ends.

500|$|In {{the garden}} {{to the south of}} the main block is a {{monument}} {{in the form of a}} marble Tuscan column on a stone plinth. [...] It carries an eagle, and dates from the early 19thcentury. [...] To the southwest of the hall is a sundial dated 1741. [...] This consists of a stone <b>baluster,</b> and its metal plate is missing. [...] Further to the southwest is an octagonal structure built into the wall of the kitchen garden. [...] It is in stuccoed brick with a slate roof, and has a round-headed entrance and a keystone decorated with an acanthus. [...] This flanked by recesses, and there are more recesses inside. [...] Also within the grounds of the hall is the base of a medieval wayside cross, which is a scheduled monument.|$|E
500|$|To the {{southeast}} of the hall is the stable block which partly surrounds a courtyard. [...] It has a south front of nine bays, the middle three of which project forwards and have a pediment carried on four large Doric pilasters. [...] The block originally had a cupola, but this has been removed. [...] A formal garden has been built between the east wing and the stable block. [...] Standing in this garden is a lead statue of a reclining, naked male figure, said to be Father Tiber, the river god. [...] This formerly stood in the Wilderness garden. [...] On {{the wall behind the}} statue are two carved unicorn heads, the emblem of the Legh family. [...] These formerly stood on pillars at the eastern entrance to the grounds. [...] The statues have been designated as a GradeII listed building. [...] A GradeII building is one that is [...] "nationally important and of special interest". [...] To the south of the formal garden is a stone statue of Napoleon carved by George Turner and dated 1837. [...] To the west of the hall is a ha-ha in rubble sandstone dating from the 18thcentury. It was built to act as a barrier between {{the west side of the}} garden and the deer park beyond it, and is listed GradeII. [...] Immediately to the south of the hall is a circular lawn, in the centre of which is a sundial that probably dates from about 1825. [...] Constructed in ashlar buff sandstone and standing on a pair of circular steps, it consists of an octagonal base with a partly fluted <b>baluster</b> supporting an octagonal moulded capstone. The capstone carries a copper plate inscribed with Roman numerals and the initials [...] "TL", and has a simple triangular gnomon. [...] The sundial is also listed GradeII. [...] Leading south from the lawn is a walk known as the Lime Avenue, which is entered through gates dated 1688. [...] The gates are in wrought iron and the piers in ashlar buff gritstone; these are again listed GradeII. [...] The avenue leads to another GradeII listed building, a structure known as the Shell House, so-called because its interior is decorated with shells and coloured mirrors. [...] It is a single-storey cottage constructed in red brick with buff sandstone dressings. [...] The roof is in stone-slate and the chimney is brick. [...] The wall is in brick with a stone coping. [...] In front of Shell Cottage another sundial, also listed GradeII. [...] This was probably built in the early 18thcentury for John Legh, and moved to its present position in the middle of that century. [...] It is thought that the pillar on which it stands was originally a Saxon cross base. [...] The octagonal copper plate is inscribed with Roman numerals, the longitude of Adlington, and John Legh's initials. [...] To the front of the Shell House is another walk, known as the Yew Walk. [...] At the back and side of the house is a rockery. [...] To the south and west of the Shell House is a wooded area known as the Wilderness, through which runs the River Dean (or Dene). [...] Many of the winding paths created by Charles Legh in the Wilderness are now overgrown, and some of the buildings are in a poor condition, or have collapsed into ruin. [...] One building still in good condition is the Tig House, a small square pavilion overlooking the river, an early example of a building in the Chinoiserie style. [...] It is constructed in red brick and partly clad in black and white timber framing. [...] It has a stone-slate pyramidal roof with a wooden finial, and is listed GradeII. [...] Near to this is the a bridge known as the Chinese Bridge crossing the river, but the summerhouse which once stood on the bridge is no longer present. [...] Another structure in the Wilderness is the Temple of Diana. [...] This is a circular temple with a dome constructed in ashlar buff sandstone. [...] It stands on a stylobate which supports six Doric columns and an entablature. [...] The structure is listed GradeII. [...] This appears to be in good condition, but in the early 2000s was said to be suffering from damp. [...] Other buildings known as the Rathouse and the Hermitage, have been damaged by falling trees. [...] At the north entrance to the grounds is a pair of gate piers that are listed GradeII. [...] The piers are in rusticated ashlar sandstone and are surmounted by ball finials. The gates are iron and are similar to those at the end of the lime avenue. [...] At the other end of the grounds, at the site of the former south approach, is a pair of sandstone gate piers dating from the middle of the 18th century. [...] They originally carried the carved unicorn heads that are now in the formal garden, and were left isolated when the route of the turnpike road was moved. [...] They are listed GradeII.|$|E
