5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then <b>be</b> <b>traced,</b> and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

This is in contrast to the DNA of northern European cattle, which suggests that wild Eurasian aurochs were at one time mated to domesticated cows, and of southern European cattle, which indicates that wild Eurasian aurochs cows were mated to domesticated bulls.|$|E
50|$|There <b>are</b> <b>traces</b> {{of human}} {{settlement}} {{in this area}} from paleolithic and neolithic times. Remains from two types of neolithic cultures have been discovered in the area: an older one, known as the Starčevo culture, and a newer one, known as the Vinča culture. From the Bronze Age, there <b>are</b> <b>traces</b> of the Vatin culture and Vršac culture, while from the Iron Age, there <b>are</b> <b>traces</b> of the Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture (which is largely associated with the Celts).|$|R

5|$|During the Zheng and Qing eras, Han {{immigrants}} brought Confucianized {{beliefs of}} Taoism and Buddhism to Taiwan's indigenous people. Many Plains Aborigines adopted Han religious practices, {{though there is}} evidence that many aboriginal customs were transformed into local Taiwanese Han beliefs. In some parts of Taiwan the Siraya spirit of fertility, Ali-zu (A-li-tsu) has become assimilated into the Han pantheon. The use of female spirit mediums (tongji) can also <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> to the earlier matrilineal Inibs.|$|E

5|$|Euler's {{interest}} in number theory can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> {{to the influence}} of Christian Goldbach, his friend in the St. Petersburg Academy. A lot of Euler's early work on number theory was based on the works of Pierre de Fermat. Euler developed some of Fermat's ideas and disproved some of his conjectures.|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} we collect several {{characterizations}} of unitary representations (π, H) of a finite dimensional Lie group G which <b>are</b> <b>trace</b> class, i. e., for each compactly supported smooth function f on G, the operator π(f) <b>is</b> <b>trace</b> class. In particular we derive the new result that, for some m ∈N, all operators π(f), f ∈ C^m_c(G), <b>are</b> <b>trace</b> class. As a consequence the corresponding distribution character θ_π is of finite order. We further show π <b>is</b> <b>trace</b> class if {{and only if}} every operator A, which is smoothing in the sense that AH⊆H^∞, <b>is</b> <b>trace</b> class and that this in turn is equivalent to the Fréchet space H^∞ being nuclear, which in turn is equivalent to the realizability of the Gaussian measure of H on the space H^-∞ of distribution vectors. Finally we show that, even for infinite dimensional Fréchet-Lie groups, A and A^* are smoothing {{if and only if}} A is a Schwartz operator, i. e., all products of A with operators from the derived representation are bounded...|$|R

Thus this definition allows us to use the notion of trace in larger (not necessarily traced) categories containing known traced categories as symmetric monoidal subcategories.|$|R

The following year, Nothingface toured with Mudvayne and talks to form the supergroup continued, although were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. At this time, Gray and Maxwell had brainstormed five band names.|$|E
5|$|Higher {{education}} in the city can <b>be</b> <b>traced</b> back to {{the second half of}} the eighteenth century, when the ownership of the city was inherited by Field Crown Hetman Jan Klemens Branicki.

In 1745 Branicki established Poland's first military college, the School of Civil and Military Engineering, in the city.|$|E

The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by Giuseppe Peano in 1888, encompasses more general objects than Euclidean space, but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like lines, planes and their higher-dimensional analogs.|$|E
