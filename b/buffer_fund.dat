40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare pension schemes with respect to their intergenerational redistributive effects caused by {{economic}} and demographic changes. It is shown how these effects depend on the specific design of the pension scheme, with special attention devoted to the indexation problem. There is a potential trade-off between financial stability of the pension system and a “desired” distribution between generations. A <b>buffer</b> <b>fund</b> is often seen as the remedy to demographic strain and potential conflict. Therefore, the possibility of accumulating (and de-cumulating) a <b>buffer</b> <b>fund</b> is included. A lifecycle perspective is applied and the risk-sharing is measured by different generations’ rate of return. The analysis is carried out within the framework of an over-lapping generation model in the setting of a stylised economy.

We use the basic monopoly union approach of wage and employment determination and assume that unemployment benefits are financed by employees’ UI contributions to the union’s UI fund and by the government’s tax revenue. The main focus of this paper is on the effects of UI <b>buffer</b> <b>funding</b> on employment fluctuations. We show that, compared with the pay- as-you-go financing system, <b>buffer</b> <b>funding</b> stabilises the economy by decreasing employment fluctuations where wages are flexible.

40|$|Public {{health and}} {{long-term}} care services are predominantly used by old people and financed by taxes paid by working-age people. Fluctuating sizes of generations create variations in tax rates, {{similar to what}} occurs in pension contribution rates. Pre-funding is a commonly suggested cure for this variation in pension systems: could and should expenditure on health and long-term care also be pre-funded, and if so to what degree? To address this question, we examine several pre-funding rules using Finland as an example. If {{the focus is on}} tax smoothing during the next few decades, an effective rule is a <b>buffer</b> <b>fund</b> whose construction is based on the current population forecast. But if we lengthen the time horizon, the benefits of using rules conditional on new demographic information become evident, even though they may result in higher tax-rate variation during the first few decades. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{implications}} of {{alternative ways of}} financing unemployment benefits on wage formation and employment is an important, though relatively little researched topic. Marja-Liisa Halko’s doctoral dissertation deals with several issues in this area. The first essay uses the ”right-to-manage ” framework to {{study the effects of}} alternative un-employment benefit financing systems on wages and employment. The author shows that, under certain conditions about the wage elasticity of labour demand, a rise in the trade union’s share of the unemployment expenses has a wage moderating and thereby employment enhancing effect. In the second essay the author uses a slightly different model to examine the use of unemployment insurance contributions as pol-icy instruments. Halko shows that the impacts of alternative contribution policies on wages and employment depend on the size of elasticity of substitution between labour and capital. In the third essay Halko provides a first analysis of the effects of buffer funding on wage and employment formation in a simple two-period monopoly union model. She shows that the effects of the <b>buffer</b> <b>fund</b> depend on whether wages are flexible or rigid over time. To conclude, this thesis contributes to the emerg...|$|E

40|$|In 1995, 57 {{countries}} {{depended on}} three commodities {{for more than}} half their exports, reports UNCTAD. And commodities, fuels, grains, and oilseeds are important imports for several countries. The notorious volatility of commodity prices is a major source of instability and uncertainty in commodity-dependent countries, affecting governments, producers (farmers), traders, processors, and financial institutions. Further, commodity price instability has a negative impact on economic growth, income distribution, and poverty alleviation. Early attempts to deal with commodity price volatility relied on <b>buffer</b> stocks, <b>buffer</b> <b>funds,</b> government intervention in commodity markets, and international commodity agreements to stabilize prices. These were largely unsuccessful [...] sometimes spectacularly so. <b>Buffer</b> <b>funds</b> went bankrupt, commodity agreements were suspended, buffer stocks proved ineffective, and government intervention was both costlyand ineffective. As the poor performance of such stabilization schemes became more evident, academics and policymakers began distinguishing between programs that tried to alter price distribution (domestically or internationally) and programs that used market-based approaches for dealing with market uncertainty. This change in approach coincided with a significant rise in the use of market-based commodity risk management instruments [...] aided by the liberalization of markets, the lowering of trade and capital control barriers, and the globalization of commodity markets. by the mid- 1990 s, several governments, state companies, and private sector participants began using commodity derivatives markets to hedge their commodity price risks. Participation in those markets is growing, but important barriers to access remain including counterparty risk, problems small groups (such as farmers) have aggregating risks, basis risks (no correlation of local and international prices), no local reference prices, low liquidity, no derivatives markets for certain products, and low levels of know-how. International institutions, local governments, and the private sector could facilitate developing countries access to derivatives markets and the use of risk management tools to solve public sector problems.

40|$|During the 1970 's the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board {{introduced}} a <b>buffer</b> <b>fund</b> price stabilisation scheme, and the Government implemented a pastoral sector Supplementary Minimum Prices scheme. The schemes were jointly expected {{to reduce the}} variability in pastoral sector farm prices and incomes, reduce the cyclical impact of farm sector income on the New Zealand economy, expand output and export revenue, and maintain an adequate income level for agricultural producers. Considerable debate ensued as to whether these schemes achieved their stated objectives {{during the period of}} operation, and whether this was done in a cost effective manner. The SMP scheme was introduced to ensure adequate incomes to pastoral sector producers and to encourage greater output and export revenue. It is acknowledged that the scheme suffered severe problems. First, it was not clear that a strong link existed between farm income and agricultural investment, so the objectives may not have been compatible. Second, the operation of the scheme was altered many times as the Government's perception of a desired adequate income changed. Rather than introducing a more stable planning and investment environment in agriculture, these changes may have induced the opposite effect. Third, some substantial problems existed with the scheme, including an obvious inconsistency in New Zealand's trade policy stance and a pattern of prices distorted significantly from market levels which impeded desirable production adjustments. For the price stabilisation scheme, many of the same problems existed. Also the overall objective of price stability may not have been appropriate, and there existed the problem of accurately forecasting the long run average price to set the price bands. A natural tendency to set wide bands made the stabilisation scheme less effective and perhaps encouraged the institution of the SMP scheme. Perhaps the major criticism of this decade of price intervention though is the belief of Governments that income objectives may be achieved through the price system. The large financial losses of the New Zealand Meat Producers Board during 1981 / 82 - 1984 / 85 may not have occurred if there had not been the obsession with income adequacy through price supplementation. In the New Zealand pig industry some pressure exists to look closely at alternative marketing structures including price stabilisation and/or support schemes. The experience of a decade or more in the pastoral industries, plus a brief and ill fated encounter with price stabilisation in 1977 / 78, would suggest this should be very carefully done. With current Government attitudes the industry should examine in detail the sources of instability and whether the advantages of greater stability are worth fighting for...|$|E

Many models of price stabilization had been developed by employing several approaches such as floor-ceiling prices, <b>buffer</b> <b>funds,</b> export or import taxes, and subsidies. In the previous researches, the models were expanded to increase the purchasing price for producer and decrease the selling price for consumer. Therefore, the policy can influence the losses for non-speculative wholesaler that is reflected by the descending of selling quantity and ascending of the stocks.

40|$|Notional defined {{contribution}} (NDC) {{systems have}} strongly been being debated in the worldwide pension {{literature in the}} past years. This paper deals with the feasibility of such NDC systems. The {{focus is on the}} German case, where the recent 2004 pension reform introduced a so-called sustainability factor, that de facto incorporates some crucial characteristics of an NDC system into the public pension system, but maintains the traditional benefit indexation formula approach. The paper analyzes the effects a hypothetical introduction of an NDC system would have on the financial situation of the German PAYG system. It is found that a genuine NDC system would be feasible {{in the sense that it}} would be financially possible and would achieve gross pension levels above, equal or only slightly below those that can be forecasted for the standard pensioner under the present German pension system. However, it is shown that an NDC system would require large <b>buffer</b> <b>funds</b> which are currently not available. Furthermore, the distribution of pension income among cohorts and across time would be very different and may be hard to motivate from a political perspective. Altogether, it becomes clear that an NDC system cannot solve the demographic problems but simply copes with them in a different way than conventional PAYG systems. Thus, it does not replace the necessity to supplement the public pension system by a funded second and third private pillar in order to prepare for the future demographic changes. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{global demand}} for artemisinin-based {{combination}} therapy (ACT) has grown sharply since its recommendation by the World Health Organization in 2002. However, {{a combination of}} financing and programmatic uncertainties, limited suppliers of finished products, information opacity across the different tiers in the supply chain, and widespread fluctuations in raw material prices have together contributed to a market fraught with demand and supply uncertainties and price volatility. Various short-term solutions have been deployed to alleviate supply shortages caused by these challenges; however, new mechanisms are required to build resilience into the supply chain. This review concludes that a mix of strategies is required to stabilize the artemisinin and ACT market. First, better and more effective pooling of demand and supply risks and better contracting to allow risk sharing among the stakeholders are needed. Physical and financial buffer stocks will enable better matching of demand and supply in the short and medium term. Secondly, physical buffers will allow stable supplies when there are procurement and supply management challenges while financial <b>buffer</b> <b>funds</b> will address issues around funding disruptions. Finally, in the medium to long term, significant investments in country level system strengthening {{will be required to}} minimize national level demand uncertainties. In addition a voluntary standard for extractors to ensure appropriate purchasing and sales practices as well as minimum quality and ethical standards could help stabilize the artemisinin market in the long term. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a framework for appraising new financial instruments and evaluating {{the extent to which}} they can help alleviate problems of incomplete credit markets and contingent claims markets in developing countries. Although the issues involved apply to any new financial instrument, we give particular attention to commodity-linked securities because many developing countries specialize in producing a handful of primary commodities and are therefore exposed to subst-antial commodity price risks. The article looks at the supply of, demand for, and pricing of commodity-linked securities and discuss-es some issues that affect their use by developing countries: their special legal status as sovereign debt; their feasibility (since to become truly effective they will require liquid secondary markets); and the construction of an optimal portfolio of external debt obligations. It also discusses the potential for new financial instruments-particularly commodity-linked securities-as a tool for risk management in developing countries. O ver the years economists and policymakers have suggested a number of ways to reduce and manage the commodity price risks facing developing countries. Schemes to stabilize commodity prices-buffer stocks, <b>buffer</b> <b>funds,</b> quotas, and variable export taxes-have been the most common remedy because when credit and contingent claims markets are in-complete, stabilization schemes can reduce and redistribute risks and thereby increase economic efficiency (Newbery and Stiglitz 1981).

40|$|Background: In 1999 the Swedish {{pension system}} was {{reformed}} with an aim {{to create a}} stable and high return on pension assets. First, Second, Third and Fourth general pension funds, hereby referred to as AP 1 -AP 4, had {{an important part in}} the reform. AP 1 -AP 4, also called the <b>buffer</b> <b>funds,</b> was assigned to secure long-term, big parts of the pension capital. The funds objective is by law, to manage the fund's assets in a manner that provides maximum benefit for the state pension. The funds will also invest pension assets with an overall low level of risk while achieving a sustainable high return. Aim: The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate whether the First-Fourth AP-Funds is meeting its objectives regarding risk and return according to Swedish law. The aim is also to see how AP 1 -AP 4 risk-adjusted returns compare to the four Sweden funds risk-adjusted returns according to modern portfolio theory. Theory: Morningstar Rating, Treynor ratio, Sharpe ratio, Jensen's Alpha, Standard Deviation, Beta. Conclusion: The risk-adjusted performance measures used in this study shows that there are clear differences between the two fund groups, where the AP-funds performed worse than the Sweden funds in every measurement. The study shows that the pension funds do not reach their goals over the five-year period, in four of the five time intervals listed in the study. In summary, the study shows that pension funds have a lower risk-adjusted return than the four bank Sweden funds and that the pension funds have not achieved their goals...|$|R

40|$|Char {{produced}} from the pyrolysis of biomass and applied into soils (biochar) can, under some conditions, improve soil functions and sequester carbon (C) over millennia. In New Zealand, if 80 % {{of the available}} biomass residues were converted into biochar, about 1. 7 Mt CO 2 could be sequestered annually. This represents ~ 2. 4 % of NZ’s total annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the trade-offs associated with alternative uses of biomass need to be assessed from a life cycle perspective, particularly when considering policymaking. The biomass feedstocks evaluated using Life Cycle Assessment were orchard prunings, logging residues, and wheat straw. The goals were i) to compare alternative management scenarios and ii) to determine the use of biomass that can achieve the largest amount of carbon credits {{in order to support}} policymaking. The biomass for heat-only (HO) scenario could mitigate 276 – 1, 064 kg CO 2 -eq per t biomass; the combined heat and power (CHP) scenario could reduce 410 – 1, 608 kg CO 2 -eq per t biomass; and the biochar scenario could abate 271 – 792 kg CO 2 -eq per t biomass. Ranges vary according to the type of feedstock assessed and the type of fossil fuel (coal or natural gas) displaced. The assessment of the HO and CHP systems giving greater GHG emission reductions than the biochar system can be misleading as these only involve fossil-fuel offsetting whereas the biochar system would sequester some carbon irrespective of the other activities assumed to be displaced. The biochar carbon stability factor is the key component that affects its capacity to mitigate climate change. A distinctive C accounting, reporting and crediting approach should be developed for biochar to have high economic potential in carbon-pricing mechanisms. Several approaches for incentivising biochar carbon sequestration were explored. These include using conservative carbon-accounting estimates, issuing temporary credits, establishing <b>buffer</b> <b>funds,</b> creating carbon credit multipliers, and inventing a new unit such as ppm CO 2 reductions for recognising atmospheric CO 2 removals as opposed to avoiding GHG emissions. While biochar technology is currently facing numerous barriers for acceptance in carbon markets, its future is promising since biochar production also offers potential in the agriculture, energy and waste management sectors...|$|R

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) initiated {{the first phase of}} the bank consolidation in 2005, to provide a strong and reliable banking sector that would guarantee the safety of depositor’s money. The consolidated banks were expected to play a very active role in the economic growth and development of Nigeria.

Unfortunately, the current global financial crisis, which has it roots in the United State of America and Europe, has spread to other part of the world.

The experimental {{results show that}} Na prefers to adsorb on the graphene layer after deposition at room temperature. Nonetheless, part of the Na atoms are able to intercalate in between the graphene and the buffer layer and some go even further into the substrate interface {{as indicated by the}} shift of the bulk SiC component in the C 1 s and Si 2 p core level spectra. The ARPES spectrum exhibits a lowering of the Dirac point indicating increased n-type doping of the monolayer graphene induced by the deposited Na atoms. Upon subsequently heating the sample, we found that a slightly elevated temperature is essential in order to promote Na intercalation. A fully Na intercalation at the graphene-SiC interface is obtained after heating at a temperature of about 75 degrees C. The intercalated Na decouples the buffer layer and transforms it into a second graphene layer so two pi-bands are observed in the ARPES spectra. Interestingly, the two bands show different locations of the Dirac point but both exhibit linear dispersion {{in the vicinity of the}} (K) over bar point and not the hyperbolic dispersion observed for AB stacked bi-layer graphene.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} approaches towards {{improving the}} predictability {{of aid to}} low income countries, with a special focus on budget support. In order to accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, the donor community is increasing aid flows while pushing for more coordination and tighter performance-based selectivity. However, these factors may increase the unpredictability of aid from current levels, which are already high enough to impose significant costs. Predictability is a particular challenge {{in the area of}} budget support, which will continue to increase in importance as aid is sought to underpin longer-term recurrent spending commitments. Budget support reduces transactions costs and drains on capacity, but it tends to be more vulnerable to fluctuations than multi-year project support. Poor predictability raises the threat of a low-level equilibrium: countries, budgeting prudently within a medium-term fiscal framework, will discount commitments; donors will see few funding gaps, so pledges will fall. With some countries discounting aid commitments in formulating budgets, some already see signs of this happening. To improve predictability, donors must extend their funding horizons. However, even if this can be done, several major issues will remainat country level. First, how can countries deal with residual short-run volatility of disbursements relative to commitments? Second, can donors lengthen commitment horizons to individual developing countries without excessive risk of misallocating aid? Third, within a country's overall aid envelope, how should donors set the shares of project aid and budget support? Finally, the paper considers the other main approach to budget support, the output or outcome-driven approach of the European Union. The paper concludes that many of these issues can be addressed. Simple spending and savings rules built around a <b>buffer</b> reserve <b>fund</b> of 2 - 4 months of imports can help smooth public spending.

Using data on all federal contracts from 2004 through 2009, we document that spending spikes in all major federal agencies during the 52 nd week of the year as the agencies rush to exhaust expiring budget authority. Spending in the last week of the year is 4. 9 times higher than the rest-of-the-year weekly average. We examine the relative quality of year-end spending using a newly available dataset that tracks the quality of $ 130 billion in information technology (I. T.) projects made by federal agencies. Consistent with the model, average project quality falls at the end of the year. Quality scores in the last week of the year are 2. 2 to 5. 6 times more likely to be below the central value. To explore the impact of allowing agencies to roll unused spending over into subsequent fiscal years, we study the I. T. contracts of an agency with special authority to roll over unused funding. We show that there is only a small end-of-year I. T. spending spike in this agency and that the one major I. T. contract this agency issued in the 52 nd week of the year has a quality rating that is well above average. ∗ We are grateful to Steven Kelman and Shelley Metzenbaum for conversations that stimulated our interest in this topic.
