5|$|For VTOL {{operations}} {{the aircraft}} {{was expected to}} sit pointed up, supported by long landing legs that extended out of the spine. Landing would be accomplished {{at a very high}} angle, making visibility during the approach very difficult. A number of other VTOL experiments of the era attempted various solutions to this problem, including rotating pilots seats and cockpits, but none proved very effective. Another problem with various VTOL experiments was that stability in a hover was difficult to arrange, although not entirely unexpected. A solution to this problem would require the thrust to be directed downward from a larger area, as it is in a helicopter, where the lift is supplied over the entire area of the rotor disk. Most designers turned to <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> air from the engine's compressor, and directing that through pipes arranged around the aircraft. Frost's engine design used such a large number of nozzles that such an arrangement would not be to easy to build.|$|E
2500|$|As an {{aircraft}} changes speed or altitude, {{the pressure of}} the air at the inlet to the compressor will vary. In order to [...] "tune" [...] the compressor for these changing conditions, designs starting in the 1950s would [...] "bleed" [...] air out of the middle of the compressor in order to avoid trying to compress too much air in the final stages. This was also used to help start the engine, allowing it to be spun up without compressing much air by <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> as much as possible. Bleed systems were already commonly used anyway, to provide airflow into the turbine stage where it was used to cool the turbine blades, as well as provide pressurized air for the air conditioning systems inside the aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|Essentially, these rockets {{would place}} the vehicle onto an [...] {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile-like trajectory and then fall away.

40|$|This project {{developed}} the inlet metering system. An inlet metering system represents a new option in hydraulic pump design. Traditional pressure controlled hydraulic pumps rely on either swashplate displacement (for variable displacement pumps) or <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> valves (for fixed displacement pumps). Variable displacement pumps require mechanically complex parts which are expensive to machine {{and prone to}} break down. <b>Bleed</b> <b>off</b> valves represent a significant loss in system efficiency. In contrast, the inlet metering system is able {{to make use of}} a fixed displacement pump (which is relatively inexpensive and mechanically robust) and a two-way spool valve. This dissertation goes through the process of designing the valve and pump dimensions, presents a theoretical dynamic analysis, studies the control law associated with this pump, and examines the energy requirements associated with inlet metering system operation. A prototype of the design was constructed and experimental data was used to validate the efficiency analysis. The major finding associated with this work was that the inlet metering system can be designed to display a first order pressure response. This means that when the inlet metering system is operated, the actual pressure in the system will never exceed the desired pressure. In contrast, traditional hydraulic systems will display up to 60 % pressure overshoot, meaning the systems must be designed to handle pressures significantly greater than operating pressures. Additionally {{it was found that the}} inlet metering system is more efficient than using a <b>bleed</b> <b>off</b> valve, but less efficient than using a variable displacement pump...|$|R

50|$|This {{operational}} cycle is {{a modification of}} the traditional expander cycle.

50|$|Missiles {{typically}} {{have a very}} high chance of hitting a target in a tail-chase engagement because of the much reduced closure rate. If the missile is travelling at Mach 2.5 and the aircraft at Mach 1, the combined overtake rate of Mach 1.5 means that the missile should be easily able to respond to any evasive maneuvers the aircraft might perform. Missiles can typically maneuver faster than aircraft and in a tail-chase engagement the target has no real advantage over the missile. Its only real hope is to fly away from the missile fast enough that the overtake rate is reduced to virtually nil, and then force the missile to follow it through several turns, <b>bleeding</b> <b>off</b> its residual energy and causing it to fall away.|$|E
