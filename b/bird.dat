5|$|Also <b>bird</b> banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} <b>bird</b> to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the <b>bird</b> and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the <b>bird</b> can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. <b>Bird</b> ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term <b>bird</b> banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E

Furthermore, logit regression is used to analyze and to identify factors that increase the likelihood of a visitor saying that <b>birds</b> are an important attraction. In addition, the relative importance to visitors of various attributes of <b>birds</b> at this site is established. These attributes include hearing <b>birds,</b> diversity of <b>birds,</b> seeing lots of <b>birds,</b> presence of rare <b>birds,</b> presence of brightly colored <b>birds</b> and physical contact with <b>birds.</b> Logit regression analysis is used to isolate independent variables that increase or decrease the likelihood that visitors find diversity of <b>birds,</b> brightly colored <b>birds</b> or physical contact with <b>birds</b> at this site to be important.
