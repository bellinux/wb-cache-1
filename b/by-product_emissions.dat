So lower energy consumption, lower CO 2 emission and waste recycling are driving the {{iron and steel industry}} to develop alternative, or coke-free, ironmaking process. Midrex and HYL Energiron are the leading technologies in shaft furnace direct reduction, and they account for about 76 % of worldwide production. They are the most competitive ways to obtain high quality direct reduced iron (DRI) for steelmaking. Therefore, in the present paper, some detailed information about these two processes are given. Much attention has been paid on process scheme, the feedstock, DRI product, heat recovery, reforming gas, hot discharge and transportation, and <b>by-product</b> <b>emission.</b> It’s very important for direct reduction development in both natural gas-rich counties and natural gas-poor counties...|$|R

The simulator captures essential time-dependent behaviors of gas flow, heat transfer, reaction chemistry, and sensor and control systems, and is validated by our experimental data. Significant improvements in SiH 4 utilization (up to 7 x) and process cycle time (up to 3 x) can be achieved by changes in (i) timing for initiating wafer heating relative to starting process gas flow; (ii) process temperature (650 - 750 oC); and (iii) gas flow rate (100 - 1000 sccm). Enhanced gas utilization efficiency and reduced process cycle time provide benefits for both environmental considerations and manufacturing productivity (throughput). Dynamic simulation proves to be a versatile and powerful technique for identifying optimal process parameters and for assessing tradeoffs between various manufacturing and environmental metrics...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} an environmental production {{process in which}} firms intend to produce outputs (which we label as desirable/good) but the production process is such that it automatically produces some other unintentional but inevitable undesirable (bad) outputs as <b>by-products</b> (<b>emission</b> of pollutants). Like stochastic production frontier, by-production technology specifies {{that there is a}} minimal amount of the by-product that is produced, given the quantities of inputs and desirable outputs. The presence of (environmental) inefficiency in by-production therefore means that more than this minimal amount of the undesirable output is produced. Similarly, the presence of technical inefficiency implies that, given inputs, less than the maximal possible amount of desirable outputs is produced. Alternatively, it means that more than the minimal amounts of inputs are used to produce a given level of desirable output. We use the “by-production technology” approach which is a composition of production technology of desirable outputs and the technology of by-products, and estimate both technical and environmental efficiency. Given that electricity, the good output in our application, is demand determined, we treat it as exogenous and address the endogeneity of inputs by using the first-order conditions of cost minimization. Some of our models automatically take endogeneity of bad outputs into account. We use an efficient Bayesian MCMC technique to estimate both good and bad output technologies and both types of inefficiency. We also compare results with some alternative models with and without endogeneity corrections...|$|R

40|$|AbstractClimate {{change has}} been {{identified}} as a key challenge for our modern society. Economic growth and societal welfare has always been associated with increasing energy consumption and environmental pollution. However, the key question to be answered is how much of our money we would like to invest in a better environment. The most cost-effective solution to combat climate change would be to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases where this could be done at lowest cost. However there is no real driver to reduce emissions for an individual, unless there is a legal requirement or a cost associated to the release of CO 2. Neither option will work if it is applied only at national or regional scale. At a European and Member State level, numerous policies are in place designed to incentivise carbon reductions to facilitate the introduction of low carbon technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). In Europe, the financial support for CCS demonstration via the EEPR and the NER- 300 initiatives gave an expectation of the construction of 10 - 12 demonstration plants in Europe. The hope that these projects can be successfully deployed has been significantly declining in line with falling CO 2 certificate prices. Near term stalling of CCS deployment in Europe, including technology readiness (e. g. up-scaling, <b>by-products,</b> <b>emissions,</b> aquifer storage); economics (CAPEX, OPEX), liabilities (e. g. probability, value, guarantees); and public and political acceptance is a likely future development. Different support mechanisms need to be applied for technology development, technology introduction and technology deployment, taking into account local conditions and interactions between different instruments. In particular all measures for technology deployment should enable a level playing field for CCS and other carbon reduction options...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Geography and Environmental Studies)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Rapid {{population}} growth and urbanisation {{has resulted in a}} drastic increase in the volume of waste produced by the World populace. The resulting pressure on the country’s somewhat underdeveloped waste management infrastructure emphasizes the need for waste management solutions which balance environmental protection with economic sustainability. Waste is seen as an unwanted or surplus <b>by-product,</b> <b>emission</b> or residue of any process or activity which has been discarded, accumulated or stored for the purpose of discarding or future processing. Hazardous waste is waste that may, by circumstance of use, quantity, concentration or inherent physical, chemical or infectious characteristics, cause ill-health or an increased mortality rate in humans, fauna and/or flora. General waste on the other hand, is waste that does not pose an immediate threat to human health or the environment. Currently household waste is considered general waste even though it may contain hazardous components such as fluorescent tubes and/or other household chemicals. Promulgation of NEM: WA (no 59 of 2008) provides instruments for the implementation of the steps taken by the Department of Environmental Affairs to improve waste management in South Africa. Successful implementation and enforcement of the act will place the country at the forefront of progressive international standards in waste management. One of South Africa’s largest environmental and waste management challenges remains the presence of historical, hazardous waste landfill sites. Characterisation of the dangers that these sites pose to the environment is providing extremely difficult and expensive, as is the ongoing maintenance and management of these facilities – placing economic strain on national municipalities. This study was done in two phases. The first related to the hazardous waste components of household waste that is being dumped at landfill site and the methods of classification, handling and dumping of hazardous waste have been investigated. All the legislation was taken into consideration to see if the landfill sites comply with the latest legislation. The second phase was a comparison between three landfill sites. The management, work activities and general appearance of the sites have been compared internally. Then a comparison have been done between the following landfill sites Kwaggasrand landfill site in Tshwane, Weltevreden landfill site in Brakpan and an ideal landfill site developed in accordance with the Minimum Requirements documents published by of DEAT in 1998.

30|$|Breweries are a {{widespread}} industry with an important economic {{value in the}} agro-food sector and brewing is intrinsically a water intensive industry (Alayu and Yirgu 2017). Brewery industry {{is one of the}} important industries that cause water pollution. In Ethiopia, water consumption by breweries reportedly ranges from 9 to 22  m 3 water/m 3 beer, which is far above the accepted international best practice benchmark of 6.5  m 3 water/m 3 beer (Joshua and Kehinde 2014). This accounts for at least 1.5 % of the national consumption of water, impacting on local water services (UNEP 2008). Due to rapid growth of beer consumption in Ethiopia (24 % per year) (Nebyou 2011) and the discharge of 70 % of the water used by the brewing industry as effluent, the projected expansion of the brewery sector will significantly increase the pressure on the water supply (Olajire 2012; Joshua and Kehinde 2014). Hence, breweries produce a substantial effluent stream, rich in organic matter and nutrients originating from the brewing process (Simate 2015). In spite of significant technological improvements, water consumption, wastewater, solid waste, and <b>by-products</b> and <b>emissions</b> to air remain major environmental challenges for the brewing industry (Fillaudeau et al. 2006; Pettigrew et al. 2015; Alayu and Yirgu 2017).|$|R

To answer this question, we explore a model where plants are heterogeneous in productivity and monopolistically competitive {{in the production of}} a set of varieties of (dirty-) goods whose <b>by-product</b> is <b>emission.</b> We establish three main results. First, if the technology on emission abatement is not available, then an emission tax unambiguously generates higher welfare than an emission standard. Second, if the plants can use the abatement technology and if there is no dispersion in productivity, then a standard induces higher output of the dirty goods than the tax. In this case, a standard is better than a tax if the monopoly power in the dirty-goods sector is sufficiently strong. Third, if the abatement technology and productivity dispersion are both present, a tax is better than a standard if either productivity dispersion is sufficiently wide or the monopoly power in the dirty-goods sector is weak. These results illustrate the importance of productivity dispersion in designing environmental policies. They contribute to the debate on whether a non-market instrument such as the regulatory standard can be better than a market-based instrument, such as a tax, for achieving an emission target...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Public Management and Administration)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010. Waste, that is any {{matter whether}} gaseous, liquid or solid or any {{combination}} thereof, originating from any residential, commercial or industrial area identified as undesirable or superfluous <b>by-product,</b> <b>emission,</b> residue or remainder of any process or activity {{tends to be}} a hazard to the environment. Waste is generated in all processes which transform materials from one state, form or medium to another. The management of waste in the Sedibeng District Municipality is a very complex problem. There are many reasons for this and these include: the diverse and voluminous waste stream; progressive accumulation of waste in the environment; large numbers of unpermitted waste disposal sites; the severe shortage of hazardous waste disposal sites and shortage of personnel in local municipalities qualified to implement existing legislation. The accumulation of waste in the district not only poses a serious and growing threat to health and quality of life, but also causes infrastructural damage such as the blocking of storm water drains and sewer by litter which ultimately leads to costly road and pavement destruction and increase in maintenance costs. The objective {{of the study was to}} investigate waste management activities in the Sedibeng District Municipality and to explore best practices as strategies for recommendations. The Sedibeng District Municipality comprises three local municipalities namely the Emfuleni, Lesedi and Midvaal Local Municipalities. Due to the fact that the Municipality forms part of the industrial hub of the Gauteng Province, there has been an excessive influx of the people into the district and, as a result, more houses had to be built and more normal urban services such as electricity, sanitation, water and waste, had to be provided. The study intended to investigate different waste management strategies that are employed by the three local municipalities that could help reduce the impacts and volumes of waste that are generated by residents before such waste could pollute the environment. A further objective was to explore possible waste reduction mechanisms such as recycling that can help reduce waste volumes before they reach the disposal site. Arising from the problem statement on waste management for this study, it is important that the locus of this study be directed towards the solution of the problem on waste management activities in the Sedibeng District Municipality The following hypothesis was accordingly formulated: Waste management strategies and practices as currently practised in the Sedibeng District Municipality are obsolete, outdated and inadequate to attain a cleaner environment and as a result, there is a need to explore the development of more cost effective strategies in waste management. Comparative study of the different strategies that are employed in the three local municipalities as well as the challenges they face when providing the required service, were made. Similar study was applied to the achievements that are recorded as findings of the study. The challenges and success stories highlighted in the study were found through the use of questionnaires that were distributed to respondents in the three local municipalities. Questionnaires for the study were compiled for both councilors and municipal officials. The research instruments for the study included questionnaires, interviews and consultations with members of the community. Further technique was participant observation, the researcher being responsible for the provision of refuse removal services to the Evaton and Sebokeng communities. Amongst others, it was found that: discrepancies existed in the waste management processes and these include the following: • There was a serious problem of personnel shortage in municipalities as a result of financial constraints that led to nonreplacement of personnel who went on retirement, resigned or died; • Existing equipment do not compliment the growing population figures as well as the sizes of the municipality and as a result, residents opted to dump waste at their backyards as an alternative procedure for disposal of waste from their homes, and • Problems attributed to illegal dumping increase each day and their resolution will be a function of implementation of compliance with legislation. • Community awareness of refuse collection schedule is at minimum, a situation which leads to illegal dumping of waste, and • Tariff on refuse removal is deemed to be prohibitive to African residential areas. The study ends with recommendations for management action on waste, and for further research. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|The {{global demand}} for {{aluminium}} and aluminium products is progressively increasing. However, {{the production of}} primary aluminium is an energy intensive process and emits at the world average ~ 12 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CDE) per tonne metal. However, aluminium recycling is attractive because one can save up to 90 % of the energy, as well as 95 % of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The aluminium recycling industry is facing several challenges, such as treatment and disposal of <b>by-products,</b> <b>emissions</b> control and requirements related to energy efficiency. A {{state of the art}} remelting furnace requires 2. 5 GJ/tonne metal, which is more than twice the theoretical energy consumption. Also, remelting of fine scrap, such as turnings and chips leads to significant metal loss. However, solid state recycling methods not involving remelting might offer higher metal yield and lower energy consumption than conventional recycling based on remelting. In the present study, solid state recycling of aluminium turnings and sawing scrap was investigated by cold compaction and subsequent hot extrusion and Cyclic Extrusion and Compression (CEC), respectively. Degreasing of aluminium scrap by thermal treatment or acetone treatment was compared with respect to the recycled metal products. In addition, ECAP of hot extruded materials was used for evaluating the internal bonding and deformation behaviour during severe plastic deformation. Mechanical properties and microstructures of the extruded and ECAPed materials were carefully investigated. Also, characterization of aluminium scraps, e. g. automotive aluminium scrap and aluminium primary dross was performed using state of the art techniques, such as EPMA and XRD with Rietveld refinement. Finally, the energy requirement for solid state recycling processing was calculated and discussed. Characterization of aluminium scraps revealed that impurities were quite common in industry scraps. Also contaminations, e. g. metallic iron and its oxides, lead and TiO 2 were observed in the automotive scrap collected from a commercial shredder. Aluminium dross has a complicated composition, containing metallic aluminium particles, corundum, spinel etc. The EPMA results showed that iron and manganese and their oxides were widely distributed in the dross fines. Metallic aluminium in dross tended to solidify as large size particles. The leachate from aluminium dross water leaching exhibited a high content of fluoride and H 2 gas bubbles after leaching for 72 hours. The results from the TG/DTA-MS analysis indicated an optimal thermal degreasing temperature, e. g. ~ 428 C. High temperature thermal treatment of turnings resulted in a significant increase of scrap surface oxide films. However, the combustion peak for the lubricants was ~ 374 C, corresponding to the second DTG peak at ~ 350 C. In addition, the thermal treatment time should be optimized so as to complete the decomposition and combustion of the lubricants. CEC processed aluminium sawing scrap turned out to be fully dense. However, room temperature tensile properties after CEC revealed high variability, indicating the presence of material inhomogeneity. Besides, microstructure observations showed that the scrap from sawing contained a mixture of different aluminium alloys. This could be part of the explanation versus the inhomogeneity. Also, a fully dense material was obtained for the aluminium turnings processed by hot extrusion at 500 C at an extrusion ratio of 15 : 1. The corresponding hardness and room temperature tensile strength values constituted 95 - 98 % of the properties of conventional reference material. To be noticed, the thermal treatment of feedstock turnings at 350 C for 30 minutes did not introduce obvious differences in mechanical properties of the recycled extruded materials as compared to acetone treated feedstock. Post extrusion ECAP showed improved mechanical properties and enhanced internal interface bonding. Oxides produced at the feedstock surfaces could be broken and redistributed upon hot extrusion and especially after ECAP applying a high number of passes at elevated temperatures, e. g. 8 passes at 100 C or 200 C. As a consequence, the key mechanical properties, such as the fracture elongation and the UTS, could be nearly as good as the conventional material counterparts. Energy requirement estimations for solid state recycling revealed that the precompaction process uses less than 7 % of the energy required for the world’s best practice conventional remelting, and resulted in a 93 % carbon dioxide equivalent emission reduction.

The way the environment is managed can affect not only firm competitiveness but also firm environmental performance both in the short and long-term.

40|$|Atomic layer {{deposition}} (ALD) is {{a deposition}} technique {{that is considered}} as primary candidate to fulfill the stringent requirements for ultrathin film growth in applications such as solar cells, displays, and semiconductors. Developing and optimizing ALD processes and improving material properties require a fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, which can be obtained through studying ALD processes in situ. Transmission infrared spectroscopy {{can be used to}} study multiple aspects of atomic layer deposition processes. In this thesis, the merits of this technique have been demonstrated by investigating the surface reactions of Al 2 O 3 and Er 2 O 3, i. e., detection of surface groups and volatile reaction by-products during ALD, and by investigating the film composition. Thermal ALD of Al 2 O 3, which has application potential for film growth at temperature sensitive substrates, is hampered at deposition temperatures below 150 °C due to the reduced thermal energy. To investigate the reaction mechanisms for deposition temperatures between 25 - 150 °C, the formation of the reaction by-product CH 4 during both ALD half reactions has been measured by means of transmission infrared spectroscopy. It has been demonstrated that quantitative information on the formation of reaction by-products during ALD can be deduced by calibrating the absorbance from volatile CH 4. A decreasing formation of CH 4 per cycle revealed a lower growth rate with decreasing deposition temperatures. A direct comparison with plasma-assisted ALD of Al 2 O 3 showed that more CH 4 was produced during precursor adsorption of thermal ALD and saturation of the surface reactions progresses slower. In this respect, residual water is expected to play an important role, especially during thermal ALD at these low deposition temperatures. Furthermore, the amount of CH 4 created during precursor adsorption relative to the amount in a full cycle indicates the precursor molecules adsorb bi-functionally at deposition temperatures below 150 °C. Plasma-assisted ALD of Er 2 O 3 has been characterized and the reaction mechanism has been studied to develop Er-doping of Al 2 O 3 by means of plasma-assisted ALD. To this end, several diagnostics have been used in situ: transmission infrared spectroscopy to detect surface groups and reaction <b>by-products,</b> optical <b>emission</b> spectroscopy to detect reaction by-products during plasma exposure, and spectroscopic ellipsometry to determine the film thickness. Differential infrared spectra of the surface groups show precursor adsorption, and removal of the precursor ligands upon plasma exposure. No reaction by-products were detected during precursor adsorption and it is therefore suggested that the Er(thd) 3 adsorbs non-dissociatively. Furthermore, it is concluded that the O 2 plasma reacts with the surface groups in a combustion-like reaction. In addition, Er-doping of Al 2 O 3 has been achieved by alternation of Al 2 O 3 and Er 2 O 3 ALD cycles. The doping process has been actively monitored by measuring the film thickness in situ using spectroscopic ellipsometry. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a deposition technique that is considered as primary candidate to fulfill the stringent requirements for ultrathin film growth in applications such as solar cells, displays, and semiconductors. Developing and optimizing ALD processes and improving material properties require a fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, which can be obtained through studying ALD processes in situ. Transmission infrared spectroscopy can be used to study multiple aspects of atomic layer deposition processes. In this thesis, the merits of this technique have been demonstrated by investigating the surface reactions of Al 2 O 3 and Er 2 O 3, i. e., detection of surface groups and volatile reaction by-products during ALD, and by investigating the film composition. Thermal ALD of Al 2 O 3, which has application potential for film growth at temperature sensitive substrates, is hampered at deposition temperatures below 150 °C due to the reduced thermal energy. To investigate the reaction mechanisms for deposition temperatures between 25 - 150 °C, the formation of the reaction by-product CH 4 during both ALD half reactions has been measured by means of transmission infrared spectroscopy. It has been demonstrated that quantitative information on the formation of reaction by-products during ALD can be deduced by calibrating the absorbance from volatile CH 4. A decreasing formation of CH 4 per cycle revealed a lower growth rate with decreasing deposition temperatures. A direct comparison with plasma-assisted ALD of Al 2 O 3 showed that more CH 4 was produced during precursor adsorption of thermal ALD and saturation of the surface reactions progresses slower. In this respect, residual water is expected to play an important role, especially during thermal ALD at these low deposition temperatures.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{introduce}} a cost-effective and environmentally friendly production process of open-cell metal foams with a view to manufacture porous materials exhibiting good morphological and structural homogeneity. The work also focuses on optimizing the production process control to produce higher quality materials and to achieve a better reproducibility and predictability of their properties. A space-holder method using crystalline raw cane sugar, as a novel leachable pattern for manufacturing open-cell metal foams is described. The mechanical behavior of the produced Al-foams as well as the deformation mechanisms developed during mechanical testing are investigated experimentally and analytically through a developed Finite Element Method simulation of compression tests using the real porous geometry, obtained via computed tomography. Additionally, the feasibility for carburized foam production in an one step-process using crystalline raw cane sugar and employing the proposed porous production methodology is investigated, whilst the effect of carburisation on the mechanical and anti-corrosive properties of the produced carburized foams is assessed. A low-vacuum furnace was used for the production process of the porous metals. In order to evaluate the effect of sintering atmosphere on the produced foams and to achieve an effective carburization process a high-vacuum apparatus was constructed. The micro and macro-structure of the produced foams are examined through optical and scanning electron microscopy whereas XRD measurements were used to evaluate the crystal structures and phases produced. Static-compression tests were conducted to assess the influence of morphological and production parameters on the mechanical behaviour of the produced foams. A X-ray tomography apparatus with a 5 μm focal spot reflection target X-ray tube source working in the absorption mode, was used to acquire the 3 D images of the foam samples necessary for the creation of the FEM-based foam model and for the 3 D characterization of the porous products. The thermal analysis via ΤG-DTA measurements was applied on the raw cane sugar to deduce its decomposition temperature. The electrochemical behavior of the Al-foam and carburized Al-foam was monitored by polarization measurements. The proposed method is attractive and environmentally friendly, given that it does not lead to any dangerous <b>by-products</b> or <b>emissions</b> and does not employ any toxic, flammable or explosive material. As an additional benefit, the proposed method is capable of producing low-cost, net-shape metal foams with tailored distribution of pore size or relative density presenting excellent reproducibility and predictability of their properties. The advantages of crystalline raw cane sugar as a novel space-holder are that is chemically stable in contact with the parent metal material and can be easily removed from the green product prior to sintering, Also it is cheap, easy to purchase in the market and does not corrode the foam material. The FEM modeling of the compressive properties of the real foam geometry leads not only to an in-depth understanding of the deformation mechanisms developed but also gives insight to the structure-properties correlation, facilitating thus the final design of the foam material. The feasibility for carburized foam production in an one step-process using crystalline raw cane sugar is among the important advantages of the proposed porous production methodology. The considerable control of carburization process conducted at relatively low temperature (400 oC) leads to an homogeneous distributed carbon layer around each pore enhancing thus the corrosion behaviour of the carburized porous materials. ...|$|R
40|$|Heavy metals {{are present}} {{naturally}} in relatively low amounts in the earth’s crust. Through food, {{drinking water and}} the air, humans absorb trace amounts of these elements. Trace amounts of some heavy metals, such as selenium, zinc, and copper, are key to maintaining the metabolism of the human body. At high concentrations usually found in contaminated environments, such as and contaminated water, heavy metals can cause poisonings resulting in impaired mental and central nervous function, as well as damage to vital organs. Long-term exposure may result in slowly progressing physical, muscular, and neurological degenerative conditions including cancer. Arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead and inorganic tin account {{for a majority of}} heavy metal poisoning cases involving food products. Levels of arsenic are naturally high in fish and seafood. Found in soil due to the presence of insecticides, fungicides, sludge and commercial fertilizers, cadmium can contaminate agricultural food products. Mercury is an industrial pollutant as well as a <b>by-product</b> of volcanic <b>emission.</b> In recent years, a number of products, ranging from protein shakes to baby formula to fresh produce, have been linked to heavy metal contamination. Spurred by consumer calls for safer products, regulatory agencies around the globe are taking steps to detect and minimize the presence of hazardous heavy metals in food. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforces action levels for poisonous or deleterious substances in human food and animal feed, including cadmium, lead, mercury, and others. For most people, diet is the main route of exposure to trace metals, so the assessment risks of these elements to human via dietary intake is important. Cooking jams using fruits, sugar, pectin and edible acids {{is one of the oldest}} food preserving processes known to mankind and presents a way of making food stable by increasing the content in soluble solids. In the recent times lots of research findings revealed the presence of deleterious artificial colorants above the permissible levels as well as the heavy metals in sweets, cakes, ice creams etc. Hence Spurred and encouraged by the above reports we authors in our studies analyzed 5 different mixed fruit jam samples of 5 different brands collected from 5 different areas of Bangalore city for some of the heavy metals like Cadmium, Lead, Chromium and Mercury. Our preliminary analysis revealed the minimal permissible levels of all the above mentioned heavy metals in all the 5 different brands which clearly confirms the very presence of the heavy metals at first and secondly also incites a doubt of their usage for human consumption especially for young children who like the very taste of it as to how safe are these Food stuffs contaminated with heavy metals and with carcinogenic artificial food colorants and hence we strongly recommend the Scientific Community to hold a detailed research of these Fruit Jam samples in the near future...|$|R
