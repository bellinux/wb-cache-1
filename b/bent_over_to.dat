Less than a week after this incident, in nearby Kosse, Texas, Hardin was accompanying a saloon girl home when they were accosted by her pimp, who demanded money. Hardin threw money on the ground and shot the would-be thief when he <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> pick it up.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle of Stalingrad, some units {{within the}} {{division}} were seen to construct caves which {{would later be}} transformed into a field hospital and an equipment storage room. The division fought in the ruined city until Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus' surrender in January 1943, with the 297th division's and IV Army Corps mutual commander, General Pfeffer, following suit into Soviet captivity on the 16th. With the airfield lost to the Red Army, the division was so badly-beaten it could hardly be considered a proper fighting force. Pfeffer's successor as division commander, Major General Moritz von Drebber, finally surrendered to the Red Army a mere nine days later. A photograph of Drebber and several other Axis commanders was taken; one of the men photographed was Dr. Otto Renoldi, the chief surgeon for the 6th Army. A chaplain for the division was executed by a Soviet officer when he <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> treat a wounded man.|$|E

Naughright settled with the university for $300,000 for its alleged failure in four incidents, and resigned from the school. [...] She had initially made a list of 33 complaints about the school. Naughright filed a defamation lawsuit against Peyton Manning and three other parties in 2002. She claimed Peyton Manning disparaged her in a book he wrote with his father and author John Underwood. The lawsuit was settled after the court ruled there was sufficient evidence for it to be heard by a jury. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed due to confidentiality terms.|$|E
500|$|Washbrook then {{attempted}} another hook from Johnston towards deep square leg. Connecting {{with the}} middle of the bat, he imparted much power on the ball, which flew flat and never went more than six metres above the ground. Harvey quickly moved in across the outfield from the square leg fence and <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> catch the ball at his ankles while still on the run. Fingleton called it [...] "the catch of the seasonor, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ". O'Reilly doubted [...] "whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it". He further said the [...] "hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic".|$|E

500|$|England then {{progressed to}} 0/129 {{in their second}} innings before Harvey intervened. On 65, Cyril Washbrook {{attempted}} a hook from Bill Johnston. Connecting with {{the middle of the}} bat, he imparted much power on the ball, which flew flat and never went more than six metres above the ground, but Harvey quickly ran across the ground and <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> catch the ball at ankle height while still on the run. Jack Fingleton said that it [...] "was the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ". O’Reilly doubted [...] "whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it". He added that the [...] "hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic". Later in the day, captain Yardley was caught by a leaping Harvey while attempting a lofted shot from Johnston.|$|E
500|$|After lunch, Harvey {{accelerated}} {{after the}} second new ball was taken, and 80 minutes into the middle session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. Harvey's knock had taken 177 minutes and included 14 fours. The partnership yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was eventually out for 112 from 183 balls, bowled by Laker while playing a cross-batted sweep. His shot selection prompted Bradman to throw his head back in disappointment. Harvey ended as the first Australian left-hander to score a century on his Ashes debut, in an innings noted for powerful driving {{on both sides of}} the wicket. The innings and the high rate of scoring helped to swing the match into a balanced position when Australia were finally dismissed for 458. In the second innings, Harvey took two noted catches, including one where he <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> catch the ball at ankle height while running. Fingleton said that it [...] "was the catch of the season—or, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Australia {{lost the}} {{services}} of Toshack after he broke down {{with a knee injury}} in the first innings, increasing the burden on the remaining bowlers as England sought to extend their lead on the fourth day. For the second time in the match, Washbrook and Hutton put on a century opening partnership. After reaching 50, Washbrook hooked a short ball from Johnston and top edged it, but Bradman failed to take the catch. However, Washbrook soon repeated the shot from the bowling of Johnston with fatal results. The ball again went in the air, and Neil Harvey quickly ran across the ground and <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> catch it at feet height while on the run, removing the opener for 65. Fingleton said that Harvey’s effort [...] "was the catch of the seasonor, indeed, would have been had Harvey not turned on several magnificent aerial performances down at The Oval [...] ". O’Reilly doubted [...] "whether any other player on either side could have made the distance to get to the ball, let alone make a neat catch of it". He further said the [...] "hook was a beauty and the catch was a classic".|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{chiropractic}} began in 1895 when Daniel David Palmer of Iowa performed the first chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard. While Lillard was working without his shirt on in Palmers office, Lillard <b>bent</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> empty the trash can. Palmer noticed that Lillard had a vertebra out of position. He asked Lillard what happened, and Lillard replied, [...] "I moved the wrong way, and I heard a 'pop' in my back, and that's when I lost my hearing." [...] Palmer, {{who was also}} involved in many other natural healing philosophies, had Lillard lie {{face down on the}} floor and proceeded with the adjustment. The next day, Lillard told Palmer, [...] "I can hear that rackets on the streets." [...] This experience led Palmer to open a school of chiropractic two years later. Rev. Samel Weed coined the word [...] "chiropractic" [...] from Greek roots. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in vitalism, naturalism, magnetism, spiritualism and other constructs that are not amenable to the scientific method, although Palmer tried to merge science and metaphysics. In 1896, Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic echoed Andrew Still's principles of osteopathy established a decade earlier. Both described the body as a [...] "machine" [...] whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction/subluxation to improve health. Palmer distinguished his work by noting that he was the first to use short-lever HVLA manipulative techniques using the spinous process and transverse processes as mechanical levers. He described the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by the nervous system.|$|E
