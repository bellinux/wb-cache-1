5000|$|Steven Conway, {{writing for}} Gamasutra, {{suggests}} that in video games, many purported examples of breaking the fourth wall are actually better understood as relocations of the fourth wall or expansions of the [...] "magic circle" [...] (the fictional game world) to encompass the player. This {{is in contrast to}} traditional fourth wall breaks, which break the audience's illusion, or suspension of disbelief, by acknowledging them directly. Conway argues that this expansion of the magic circle in video games actually serves to more fully immerse a player into the fictional world rather than take the viewer out of the fictional world, as is more common in traditional fourth wall breaks. An example of this expansion of the magic circle {{can be found in the}} game Evidence: The Last Ritual, in which the player receives an in-game email at their real life email address and must visit out-of-game websites to solve some of the puzzles in the game. Other games may expand the magic circle to include the game's hardware. For example, X-Men for the Mega Drive/Genesis required players to reset their game console at a certain point to reset the X-Men's in-game Hazard Room, while Metal Gear Solid asked the player to put the DualShock controller on their neck to simulate a <b>back</b> <b>massage</b> being given in-game.|$|E

Tango tells Whiteboy he wants to settle this outside the van, to which Whiteboy stands outside, while the rest of the guys hold back Tango. Tired of waiting for Tango, Whiteboy goes into the other van. Back at the mansion, the results of the challenge were announced: T-Weed was the supposed winner by promising that he had a net worth of $100 million. Sister Patterson forced T-Weed to sign a sheet that would allow her to do a background check. T-Weed drove New York in a Benz to their solo date and Pootie got a date with New Yorks mom; she noticed Pooties unstable behavior and later, with the help of Tango, was convinced to willingly leave the competition. The next day, the contestants threw a barbecue for New York and impressed her with massages and lap dances. New York was pleasantly surprised by Mr. Bostons lap dance and Tangos <b>back</b> <b>massage.</b> During elimination, Tango was given his chain first. Before giving out her last chain, Sister Patterson announced T-Weeds financial information. T-Weed was in financial debt rather than his claims of having over $100 million in assets. In the end, Heat received the last chain and therefore, Bonez and T-Weed were sent home. Bonez was eliminated because New York said she didnt want to corrupt him. However, T-Weed was eliminated for not being honest with New York. This was the first (and only) episode in which someone had left the competition before elimination.|$|E
