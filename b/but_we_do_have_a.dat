Talabani, a member of Jay Garner's staff in Kuwait before the war, was consulted on several occasions to help the U.S. select a liberal Iraqi government; {{this would be the}} first liberal government to exist in Iraq. In an interview with Time magazine, Garner stated that [...] "as in any totalitarian regime, there were many people who needed to join the Baath Party in order to get ahead in their careers. We don't have a problem with most of them. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem with those who were part of the thug mechanism under Saddam. Once the U.S. identifies those in the second group, we will get rid of them." [...] On April 15, 2003, General Garner called a conference in the city of Nasiriyah, where Garner, along with 100 Iraqis, discussed the future of Iraq. Garner called a follow-up meeting on April 28, 2003. 250 Iraqis attended this meeting, and five of these Iraqis were selected by Garner's administration as the core leaders of the new Iraqi government: Masood Barzani was appointed as head of the Kudistan Democratic Party, Jalal Talbani as head of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Abdul Aziz Al Hakim was appointed {{as the leader of the}} Supreme Assembly for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, Ahmad Chalabi was chosen to represent the Iraqi National Congress and Iyad Allawi was appointed as the leader of the Iraqi National Accord. Garner's selection caused quite a stir amongst many Iraqis. Although many Iraqis were open to the change that Garner and the U.S. were bringing to Iraq, others were resentful. Iraqis with a Shi'a background felt underrepresented in Garner's selection for government. Three of the five officials appointed as key members in Iraq's new government were of Sunni background, one official was from a mixed Sunni-Shi'a background, and only one of the officials was of pure Shi'a background. The Shi'a felt left out and underrepresented, considering they comprise over 60% of the Iraqi population. Therefore, this caused a great deal of controversy. Furthermore, many Iraqis felt this new government was not selected in a democratic manner as the U.S had promised.|$|E

40|$|We outline {{a path to}} {{sustainable}} development that would give future generations {{the chance to be}} as well-off as their predecessors without running out of natural resources, especially metals. To this end, we have to consider three key resources: (1) the geosphere or primary resources, (2) the technosphere or secondary resources, which can be recycled and (3) human ingenuity and creativity. We have two resource extremes: natural resources which are completely consumed (fossil fuels) versus natural resources (metals) which are wholly recyclable and can be used again. Metals survive use and are merely transferred from the geosphere to the technosphere. There will, however, always be a need for contributions from the geosphere to offset inevitable metal losses in the technosphere. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> choice. We do not need raw materials as such, only the intrinsic property of a material that enables it to fulfil a function. At the time when consumption starts to level off, chances improve of obtaining most of the material for our industrial requirements from the technosphere. Then a favorable supply equilibrium can emerge. Essential conditions for taking advantage of this opportunity: affordable energy and ingenuity to find new solutions for functions, to optimize processes and to minimize losses in the technosphere. non-renewable resources; metals; fulfillment of functions; technosphere; geosphere; ingenuity; renewable energy...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} to construct a fair sample of simulated galaxy clusters, and build such a sample for a specific cosmological structure formation scenario. Conventionally one extracts such a sample from a single low-resolution large-scale simulation. Here we simulate the clusters individually at high resolution. We construct a model catalogue selected on expected final cluster mass. Such a catalogue {{will not have a}} well-defined richness limit, because the relation between richness and mass is fairly broad. However, by applying the appropriate completeness corrections, the results for the mass-selected catalogue can be compared with observations for richness-selected cluster catalogues. We build a model cluster catalogue for the Omega_ 0 = 1 CDM scenario that is designed to mimic the ENACS sample of rich Abell clusters. We use the distribution of richness, corrected for incompleteness, to fix the present epoch. We find sigma_ 8 = 0. 4 - 0. 5, which is consistent with other determinations. The catalogue is 70 per cent complete for a richness larger than 50, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> complete subsample for a richness limit of 75. As a first test we compare the cumulative distribution of line-of-sight velocity dispersions to those found for several observational samples, and find that they match best for a value of around 0. 4 for sigma_ 8. This means that we find consistent values for sigma_ 8 for the CDM Omega_ 0 = 1 scenario on cluster scales.

40|$|This {{report is}} a {{synthesis}} of ideas about what this new economy-in-society-innature could look like and how we might get there. Most of the ideas presented here are not new. The coauthors of this report have published them in various forms {{over the last several}} decades, and many others have expressed similar ideas in venues too numerous to mention. What is new is the timing and the situation. The time has come when we must make a transition. We have no choice. Our present path is clearly unsustainable. As Paul Raskin has said, 2 ̆ 2 Contrary to the conventional wisdom, it is business as usual that is the utopian fantasy; forging a new vision is the pragmatic necessity 2 ̆ 2 [10]. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> choice about how to make the transition and what the new state of the world will be. We can engage in a global dialogue to envision 2 ̆ 2 the future we want, 2 ̆ 2 the theme of Rio+ 20, and then devise an adaptive strategy to get us there, or we can allow the current system to collapse and rebuild from a much worse starting point. We obviously argue for the former strategy. In this report, we discuss the need to focus more directly on the goal of sustainable human well-being rather than merely GDP growth. This includes protecting and restoring nature, achieving social and intergenerational fairness (including poverty alleviation), stabilizing population, and recognizing the significant nonmarket contributions to human well-being from natural and social capital. To do this, we need to develop better measures of progress that go well beyond GDP and begin to measure human well-being and its sustainability more directly...|$|E
40|$|The factor {{complexity}} function Cw(n) of {{a finite}} or infinite word w associates to each integer n ≥ 0 {{the number of}} distinct factors (i. e., blocks of consecutive letters) in w of length n. A finite word w of length │w│ {{is said to be}} trapezoidal if the graph of its factor complexity Cw(n) as a function of n (for 0 6 n 6 │w│) is that of a regular trapezoid (or possibly an isosceles triangle); that is, Cw(n) increases by 1 with each n on some interval of length r, then Cw(n) is constant on some interval of length s, and finally Cw(n) decreases by 1 with each n on an interval of the same length r. Necessarily Cw(1) = 2 (since there is one factor of length 0, namely the empty word), so any trapezoidal word is on a binary alphabet. Trapezoidal words were first introduced by A. de Luca (1999) when studying the behaviour of the factor complexity of finite Sturmian words, i. e., factors of infinite “cutting sequences", obtained by coding the sequence of cuts in an integer lattice over the positive quadrant of R 2 made by a line of irrational slope. Every finite Sturmian word is trapezoidal, but not conversely. However, both families of words (trapezoidal and Sturmian) are special classes of so-called rich words - a new (wider) class of finite and infinite words characterised by containing the maximal number of palindromes recently introduced by the speaker, together with J. Justin, S. Widmer, and L. Q. Zamboni (2009). In this talk, I will introduce a natural generalisation of trapezoidal words over an arbitrary finite alphabet A consisting of at least two distinct letters, called generalised trapezoidal words (or GT-words for short). In particular, I will discuss some combinatorial properties of this new class of words when │A│ ≥ 3 and I will show that, unlike in the binary case (│A│ = 2), not all GT-words are rich in palindromes, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> neat characterisation of those that are.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{good things in}} the Constitution, but the vice-presidency isn 2 ̆ 7 t one of them. In Part I of this essay, I will argue {{that there are three}} basic {{problems}} with the vice-presidency: the method of nomination, the method of election, and the office itself. That just about covers the waterfront. 2 ̆ 7 If we had {{to do it all over}} again, we almost certainly would not 2 ̆ 2 create the system we currently have. We cannot undo history, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very strong incentive to develop a better system of succession to the presidency. Whom we choose as vice-president is a matter of great national importance. Nine men have succeeded to the presidency from the second spot, five of them since 1900. 2 In this century, we have fared reasonably well with vice-presidents who have succeeded to the White House. In various surveys, Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman have consistently been ranked as among our best presidents. 3 But the vice-presidents of the last century who succeeded to the White House, and a substantial number of those in either century who did not, were mediocrities or worse. 4 Spiro T. Agnew is the most recent example of a narrowly averted disaster, but there have been others. For example, suppose that Franklin Roosevelt had died in his first or second term instead of his fourth. The man to guide us through the Depression would have been John Nance Garner. No doubt Cactus Jack was an able legislative tactician, and perhaps he did not fully merit John L. Lewis 2 ̆ 7 s classic description of him as 2 ̆ 2 a whiskey-drinking, poker-playing, evil old man. 2 ̆ 2 5 But he was hardly the inspirational and forward-thinking leader that the people sought and got in Roosevelt. Or suppose that Roosevelt had died during his third term. Our wartime leader would have been Henry Agard Wallace - a brilliant agronomist, and a person of good will and sometimes sound vision, but plagued with a muddle-headedness best summarized by Dashiell Hammett 2 ̆ 7 s comment that 2 ̆ 2 he 2 ̆ 7 d be better off leaving things alone and cross-breeding himself. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 76 We may not always be so lucky. If I am correct, as I argue in Part I, that the vice-presidency is fundamentally flawed, then we should think seriously about how to improve it. And there is no better time than now, as we approach a presidential election. In Part II, therefore, I offer three simple but far-reaching proposals. Each addresses one of the problems that I have identified. The first proposal is that the vice-presidency not be considered a disqualification from holding another office, at least one in the federal executive branch. This proposal is 2 ̆ 2 serious 2 ̆ 2 in the sense that the next president can and should seriously consider implementing it immediately. No obstacles preclude the core application of this proposal, and it requires no constitutional or other legal change. (It would help to have a constitutional amendment eliminating the vice-president 2 ̆ 7 s role as president of the Senate and clearly obviating any constitutional problems; so far as this proposal concerns appointment of the vice-president to a federal executive position, however, I do not believe that such an amendment is necessary. 7) The other two proposals, that the vice-president should be separately nominated and separately elected, are more speculative. The three proposals are modular - they can be adopted independently or in any combination...|$|E
