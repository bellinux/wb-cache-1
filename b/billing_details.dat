A mix of different telephone exchange equipment was selected for trial within Scotland, comprising Strowger pre-2000, 2000 and 4000 type switches located in Director telephone systems and non-Director areas. The call logging trial proved successful and while it was initially designed to gather phone call data and cost of <b>billing</b> <b>details</b> specific to the customers' calls, a hidden benefit emerged such that local management were also able to see a pattern of the types of calls being generated, i.e. calls to and from certain businesses in addition to billing information, which was used to ease flow of traffic during peak times in the exchange and to plan for future customer provision within a catchment area. The concept of this call logging equipment was also deployed in UXD exchanges for remote areas where a System X exchange was not considered feasible.|$|E
