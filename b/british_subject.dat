The {{death certificate}} also indicates {{that he was a}} <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> and a bachelor. It is likely that early in his life Beato and his family moved to Corfu, at the time part of the British protectorate of the Ionian Islands, and so Beato was a <b>British</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|E

5|$|The King's prestige, {{which was}} based {{in large part on}} his support by the {{combined}} Great Powers, but mostly the support of the British, suffered in the Pacifico incident of 1850, when British Foreign Secretary Palmerston sent the British fleet to blockade the port of Piraeus with warships, to exact reparation for injustice done to a <b>British</b> <b>subject.</b>|$|E

In 1977 California schoolchildren selected it for the inaugural California Young Reader Medal in the Young Adult category, which annually honours one book from the last four years. In The Big Read, a 2003 survey of the British public, it was voted the forty-second greatest book of all time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the start}} of the World War I, he became the subject of anti-German attacks in the Press. In 1915, Speyer offered to resign from the Privy Council and to {{relinquish}} his baronetcy, but the Prime Minister turned down the offer. He resigned as chairman of the UERL and went to the United States. In 1921, the British government investigated accusations that Speyer had traded with the enemy during the war, and had participated in other wartime conduct incompatible with his status as a <b>British</b> <b>subject.</b> Speyer denied the charges, but his naturalisation was revoked and he was struck off the list of members of the Privy Council.|$|E

5|$|Although as a <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> Singh's primary {{interest}} was women's rights in England, {{she and her}} fellow suffragettes also promoted similar activities in the colonies. She valued her Indian heritage, but was not bound by allegiance to a single nation and supported the women's cause {{in a number of}} countries. Her title, Princess, was useful. Singh sold a suffragette newspaper outside Hampton Court Palace, where Queen Victoria had allowed her family to live. According to a letter from Lord Crewe, King George V was within his rights to have her evicted.|$|E
5|$|Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied {{briefly with}} other artists before {{striking}} {{out on his}} own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, he moved to Britain, where he would live for {{most of the rest of}} his life. His talent brought him to the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> could hold it. This slight became a long-term grievance for Pistrucci.|$|E
5|$|George Washington {{was born}} in Kortrijk, Belgium to Jean Guillaume Washington (John William Washington) of England and Marie Louise Tant of Belgium, on May 20, 1871.Following then-current {{nationality}} law, which considered fatherhood primary, Washington was a <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> until he was naturalized as an American in May 1918.

5|$|Jørgen Christian Jensen {{was born}} on 15 January 1891 in Løgstør, Denmark, the son of Jørgen Christian Jensen and Christiane, known as Jensen. His early life is {{otherwise}} unrecorded. In 1908 {{at the age of}} 17, he travelled to the United Kingdom, before emigrating to Australia the following March. He sailed to Melbourne, but then moved to Morgan, South Australia and then Port Pirie, working as a sailor on river steamers on the Murray River, and as a labourer. He was naturalised as a <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> in Adelaide on 7 September 1914.|$|E
5|$|Maltese courts became <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> on 5 October 1813, {{months before}} the Treaty of Paris of 1814, when Malta became a Crown colony.

Crown Advocate Adrian Dingli was trusted {{with the task of}} reforms. These reforms remain the basic of Maltes law today. By 1814 all forms of torture were abolished, however any freedom possibly leading to a revolt could be suppressed with physical force.|$|E

He said later that he could not continue to live in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric Research Unit in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council. He became a <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> by naturalization on 4 August 1966.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold {{was born}} a <b>British</b> <b>subject,</b> the second of six {{children}} to Benedict Arnold (1683–1761) and Hannah Waterman King in Norwich, Connecticut Colony on January 14, 1741. He was named after his great-grandfather Benedict Arnold, an early governor of the Colony of Rhode Island—as were his father and grandfather, {{as well as an}} older brother who died in infancy. Only Benedict and his sister Hannah survived to adulthood; his other siblings succumbed to yellow fever in childhood. His siblings were, in order of birth: Benedict (August 15, 1738April 30, 1739), Hannah (December 9, 1742August 11, 1803), Mary (June 4, 1745September 10, 1753), Absolom (April 4, 1747July 22, 1750), and Elizabeth (November 19, 1749September 29, 1755). Arnold was a descendant of John Lothropp through his maternal grandmother, an ancestor of at least six U.S. presidents.|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{was born}} in London and began acting on stage {{at the age of}} nine. In 1913, while on tour in the United States with Fred Karno's comedy group, he {{accepted}} a contract to work for Mack Sennett's Keystone film company. During his time at Keystone, he began writing and directing some of the films in which he starred. Chaplin signed with the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company in 1915, and the year after with the Mutual Film Corporation. In 1918, Chaplin began producing his own films, initially releasing them through First National and then through United Artists, a corporation he co-founded with Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and D. W. Griffith. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Chaplin was accused of being a Communist sympathiser, which he denied. He remained a <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> and, while travelling to England in 1952 to attend the premiere of his film Limelight, his American re-entry permit was rescinded. Chaplin eventually settled in Switzerland, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life. He made his last two films in England.|$|E

5|$|Early English composers in {{classical}} music include Renaissance artists Thomas Tallis and William Byrd, followed up by Henry Purcell from the Baroque period. German-born George Frideric Handel became a <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> and {{spent most of}} his composing life in London, creating some of the most well-known works of classical music, The Messiah, Water Music, and Music for the Royal Fireworks. One of his four Coronation Anthems, Zadok the Priest, composed for the coronation of George II, has been performed at every subsequent British coronation, traditionally during the sovereign's anointing. There was a revival in the profile of composers from England in the 20th century led by Edward Elgar, Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Gustav Holst, Ralph Vaughan Williams and others. Present-day composers from England include Michael Nyman, best known for The Piano, and Andrew Lloyd Webber, whose musicals have achieved enormous success in the West End and worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{emerged as}} a leading {{political}} figure in Boston just as tensions with Great Britain were increasing. In March 1765, he was elected as one of Boston's five selectmen, an office previously held by his uncle for many years. Soon after, Parliament passed the 1765 Stamp Act, a tax on legal documents, such as wills, that had been levied in Britain for many years but which was wildly unpopular in the colonies, producing riots and organized resistance. Hancock initially took a moderate position: as a loyal <b>British</b> <b>subject,</b> {{he thought that the}} colonists should submit to the act, even though he believed that Parliament was misguided. Within a few months, Hancock had changed his mind, although he continued to disapprove of violence and the intimidation of royal officials by mobs. Hancock joined the resistance to the Stamp Act by participating in a boycott of British goods, which made him popular in Boston. After Bostonians learned of the impending repeal of the Stamp Act, Hancock was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in May 1766.|$|E
5|$|In Edinburgh, Born {{promoted}} {{the teaching of}} mathematical physics. He had two German assistants, E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, and together they continued to investigate the mysterious behaviour of electrons. Born became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1937, and of the Royal Society of London in March 1939. During 1939, he got as many of his remaining friends and relatives still in Germany as he could out of the country, including his sister Käthe, in-laws Kurt and Marga, and the daughters of his friend Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg. Hedi ran a domestic bureau, placing young Jewish women in jobs. Born received his certificate of naturalisation as a <b>British</b> <b>subject</b> on 31 August 1939, one day before the Second World War broke out in Europe.|$|E
50|$|By the Naturalisation Act 1870, it {{was made}} {{possible}} for <b>British</b> <b>subjects</b> to renounce their nationality and allegiance, {{and the ways in}} which that nationality is lost are defined. So <b>British</b> <b>subjects</b> voluntarily naturalized in a foreign state are deemed aliens from the time of such naturalization, unless, in the case of persons naturalized before the passing of the act, they have declared their desire to remain <b>British</b> <b>subjects</b> within two years from the passing of the act. Persons who from having been born within British territory are <b>British</b> <b>subjects,</b> but who at birth became under the law of any foreign state subjects of such state, and also persons who though born abroad are <b>British</b> <b>subjects</b> by reason of parentage, may by declarations of alienage get rid of British nationality. Emigration to an uncivilized country leaves British nationality unaffected: indeed the right claimed by all states to follow with their authority their subjects so emigrating is one of the usual and recognized means of colonial expansion.|$|R
