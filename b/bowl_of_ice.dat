40|$|Tackling {{a buffet}} at your Super Bowl gathering? Practice these game rules {{and keep the}} runs on the field. Keep it clean. Before you eat or handle food, {{thoroughly}} wash your hands, food prep tools and surfaces, and all fruits and veggies. Cook it well. Measure minimum internal temperatures with a food thermometer. For party faves, like chicken wings and ground beef sliders, {{make sure that they}} reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit and 160 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively. Be a winner. Invest in a good food thermometer for you or someone you love. Watch the clock. Follow recommended microwave cooking and standing times (the extra minutes needed for food to cook completely). Track how long foods have been on the buffet. Discard after two hours. Keep it safe. Use chafing dishes, slow cookers, and warming trays to keep hot food at 140 degrees Fahrenheit or more. Keep cold foods, like salsa and dips, at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or colder. Next serving dishes in <b>bowls</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> or use small trays. Replace ice often. Be aware of the "danger zone" between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit where harmful bacteria grows. Play it safe and refrigerate food within two hours. Protect all "to-gos. " Discard foods that have been on the buffet more than two hours. Divide leftovers into smaller portions, place in shallow containers, and refrigerate. Intercept mix-ups. Separate raw meats from read-to-eat foods, like veggies. Provide serving utensils and small plates to discourage eating directly from bowls with dips and salsa. If you see "double-dippers" (folks who repeatedly eat or dip from a shared food dish), throw the penalty flag before someone is down on the field.

He meets famous Western movie actor [...] "Wyoming Bill" [...] Kelso (Denny Miller), who gives Bakshi an autograph. Bakshi later accidentally shoots Kelso with a toy gun, but Kelso does not see who did it. Bakshi feeds a caged macaw bird food from a container marked [...] "Birdie Num Num" [...] and accidentally drops the food on the floor. Bakshi at various times during the film activates a panel of electronics that control the intercom, a fountain replica of the Manneken Pis (soaking a guest), and a retractable bar (while Clutterbuck is sitting at it). After Kelso hurts Bakshi's hand while shaking it, Bakshi sticks his hand into a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> crushed <b>ice</b> containing caviar.

50|$|The video {{begins as}} a 1920s period short film, with Keys' narrating: 'It was an amazing time. An amazing {{time to be in}} New Orleans. The heat, the French Quarter, and him. And we fell in love.' Wearing a long cream-coloured dress, Keys races downstairs to the {{reception}} of Battiers Boarding House, where she works, to welcome Maxwell, a guest who shows up and asks if there is a room available. After he checks in, she lets him into his room before retreating to her own. The narrative unfolds as the pair, from separate rooms, each sing their verses. Breaking a sweat beside a heater, Keys cools herself down with small fan and a <b>bowl</b> full <b>of</b> <b>ice,</b> while Maxwell unpacks his case. As the bridge begins, both are shown in a smoke-filled New Orleans live music venue where Maxwell, dressed in a red suit and dark glasses, sings on stage while Keys leans against the wall {{on the other side of}} the room. The song ends with the pair reuniting at the top of the stairs of the grand old hotel.|$|R

50|$|The {{status bar}} {{running along the}} top of the playing screen gives the player's score, the high score, the level number, and the number of lives remaining. Points are awarded for {{trapping}} aliens behind doors (with extra points going to players who corral multiple aliens behind one door) and collecting confectionery that intermittently appear and disappear on the playing screen, which include a striped piece of candy, an ice pop, a lollipop, a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> cream, a slice of cake, and a Mahjong tile. Players begin with three lives. Scoring 10,000 points awards the player an extra life; scoring intervals of 20,000 points thereafter awards the player more lives. If the player loses all lives, the game is over, forcing the player to restart from the first level.|$|E

40|$|A {{generation}} {{has passed since}} a physician first noticed that women who drank heavily while pregnant gave birth to underweight infants with disturbing tell-tale characteristics. Women whose own mothers enjoyed martinis while pregnant now lost sleep over a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> rum raisin <b>ice</b> cream. In Message in a Bottle, Janet Golden charts the course of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) through the courts, media, medical establishment, and public imagination. Long considered harmless during pregnancy (doctors even administered it intravenously during labor), alcohol, when consumed by pregnant women, increasingly {{appeared to be a}} potent teratogen and a pressing public health concern. Some clinicians recommended that women simply moderate alcohol consumption; others, however, claimed that there was no demonstrably safe level for a developing fetus, and called for complete abstinence. Even as the diagnosis gained acceptance and labels appeared on alcoholic beverages warning pregnant women of the danger, FAS began to be de-medicalized in some settings. More and more, FAS emerged in court cases as a viable defense for people charged with serious, even capital, crimes and their claims were rejected. Golden argues that the reaction to FAS was shaped by the struggle over women's relatively new abortion rights and the escalating media frenzy over "crack" babies. It was increasingly used as evidence of the moral decay found within marginalized communities [...] from inner-city neighborhoods to Indian reservations. With each reframing, FAS became a currency traded by politicians and political commentators, lawyers, public health professionals, and advocates for underrepresented minorities, each pursuing separate aims...|$|R

50|$|The Hotel’s dining room, which {{included}} a split log mantled fireplace, became renowned for excellent food in an extraordinary setting. Up to the day it closed, it was known for serving {{some of the best}} home cooked meals in or near the park. It was decorated in a country style with ruffled curtains, red and white checkerboard tablecloths and split bottomed chairs. After dinner, many guests and visitors enjoyed a <b>bowl</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> cream or home made cobbler on the porch for dessert. In {{the early days of the}} hotel, meals were included with your room which could be rented by the day, week, month, or 3-month season at a price of seventy-five cents per meal for adults or fifty cents for children. Three meals were offered per day, served family style. A number of the area residents would from time to time provide local wild game meat they would catch themselves to the hotel for meals. This included deer, bear, rabbit, wild turkey, quail, ruffled grouse and rattlesnake. Fresh fish caught from the river was found on the menu quite often.|$|E

She spends the class period identifying Jack's co-conspirators (Farina, Chubby, and Buddy), and suspends the foursome for the day just as some delivery boys (Baldwin Cooke and Gordon Douglas) bring in a wealth of cake and ice cream as a first-day treat for the class. After being shooed outside, the kids all turn on Jack, with an angry Farina remarking [...] "yeah, my pal," [...] making a throat-cutting gesture to accent his anger.

40|$|Results of {{theoretical}} and experimental studies on failure <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> during short-time creep {{are reported in}} this work. Deformation and failure <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under applied load are treated as a stochastic process composed of discrete events of the occurrence and development of microdefects in the crystal structure <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> Models <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> deformation have been developed in which the magnitude and duration of stresses and the dependence on temperature have been taken into account. The functional relation between the microprocess of the accumulation of brittle structural defects and the macroprocess <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> deformation has been confirmed. The possibility of monitoring and predicting the stress strain state <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> masses {{with the help of}} acoustic emission records has been demonstrated. It has been established that the fundamental theoretical propositions are applicable to vibrocreep and to failure <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under cyclic loads. The results of dynamic loading experiments confirm that the processes <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> failure during static and dynamic loading are essentially similar, and that the maximum number of structural defects is the proper criterion <b>of</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> This monograph is intended for specialists dealing with physico-mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> under failure loads.
