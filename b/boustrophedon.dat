5|$|In early Asomtavruli, {{the letters}} are of equal height. Georgian {{historian}} and philologist Pavle Ingorokva {{believes that the}} direction of Asomtavruli, like that of Greek, was initially <b>boustrophedon,</b> though {{the direction of the}} earliest surviving texts is from left to the right.|$|E
5|$|Rongorongo glyphs {{were written}} in reverse <b>boustrophedon,</b> left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line. When reading one line, the lines above and below it would appear upside down, {{as can be seen}} in the image at left.|$|E
5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being <b>boustrophedon,</b> but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E

25|$|Old Hungarian {{letters were}} usually written {{from right to}} left on sticks. Later, in Transylvania, they {{appeared}} on several media. Writings on walls also were right to left and not <b>boustrophedon</b> style (alternating direction right to left and then left to right).|$|E
25|$|Ancient Greek was firstly {{written in}} Linear B, but {{afterwards}} {{it was written}} in the Greek alphabet, with some variation among dialects. Early texts are written in <b>boustrophedon</b> style, but left-to-right became standard during the classic period. Modern editions of Ancient Greek texts are usually written with accents and breathing marks, interword spacing, modern punctuation, and sometimes mixed case, but they all were introduced later.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} known form of Latin is Old Latin, {{which was}} spoken from the Roman Kingdom {{to the middle}} of the Roman Republic period. It is attested both in inscriptions and in some of the earliest extant Latin literary works, such as the comedies of Plautus and Terence. The Latin alphabet was devised from the Etruscan alphabet. The writing later changed from what was initially either a right-to-left or a <b>boustrophedon</b> script to what ultimately became a strictly left-to-right script.|$|E
25|$|Writing {{was from}} right to left except in archaic inscriptions, which {{occasionally}} used <b>boustrophedon.</b> An example found at Cerveteri used left to right. In the earliest inscriptions, the words are continuous. From the sixth century BC, they are separated by a dot or a colon, which symbol might also be used to separate syllables. Writing was phonetic; the letters represented the sounds and not conventional spellings. On the other hand, many inscriptions are highly abbreviated and often casually formed, so the identification of individual letters is sometimes difficult. Spelling might vary from city to city, probably reflecting differences of pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|David Freidel and F. Kent Reilly III proposed, in 2010, that, {{rather than}} a unique script, the Cascajal Block in fact {{represents}} a special arrangement of sacred objects used in ancient times for magical purposes. They propose that the incised symbols on the block represent the contents of three sacred bundles arranged in three separate registers {{from top to bottom}}. These sacred bundles include well known objects used in magic and divination rituals. Many of these objects/signs, arranged horizontally within the registers, are present in all three registers. The whole block is to be read in <b>boustrophedon</b> fashion from top to bottom and alternatively left to right and right to left. Freidel and Reilly argue {{that the majority of the}} symbols on the block are found in the established corpus of Middle Formative art and many are otherwise part of iconographically comprehensible compositions that are designed to be read pictographically and not as script encoding spoken language. Rather than to regard the Cascajal Block as an epistemological dead-end—the conclusion if it is identified as a unique script—they identify the block as a key to understanding a special arrangement of sacred objects presented in the course of a religious ritual. The purpose of this may have been to memorialize the acts of divination or other magical rituals. This was a pervasive ritual practice well attested in the archaeology of Formative period Mesoamerica.|$|E
500|$|Authentic rongorongo {{texts are}} written in {{alternating}} directions, a system called reverse <b>boustrophedon.</b> In {{a third of the}} tablets, the lines of text are inscribed in shallow fluting carved into the wood. The glyphs themselves are outlines of human, animal, plant, artifact and geometric forms. Many of the human and animal figures, such as glyphs [...] and [...] have characteristic protuberances {{on each side of the}} head, possibly representing eyes.|$|E

2500|$|One likely {{translation}} is [...] "The farmer Arepo has [...] works wheels [...] "; that is, the farmer uses his plough as his form of work. Though {{not a significant}} sentence, it is grammatical; it can be read up and down, backwards and forwards. C. W. Ceram also reads the square <b>boustrophedon</b> (in alternating directions). But since word order is very free in Latin, the {{translation is}} the same. If the Sator Square is read <b>boustrophedon,</b> in reverse direction, the words become SATOR OPERA TENET, with the sequence reversed.|$|E
2500|$|If [...] "arepo" [...] {{is taken}} {{to be in the}} second declension, the [...] "-o" [...] ending could put the word in the {{ablative}} case, giving it a meaning of [...] "by means of [...]" [...] Using this definition of [...] "arepo" [...] and the <b>boustrophedon</b> reading order produces the text [...] "The sower works for mastery by turning the wheel." ...|$|E
2500|$|Greek was {{originally}} written predominantly {{from right to}} left, just like Phoenician, but scribes could freely alternate between directions. For a time, a writing style with alternating right-to-left and left-to-right lines (called <b>boustrophedon,</b> literally [...] "ox-turning", after the manner of an ox ploughing a field) was common, until in the classical period the left-to-right writing direction became the norm. Individual letter shapes were mirrored depending on the writing direction of the current line.|$|E
2500|$|The Middle Bronze Age Indus script, {{which dates}} back to the early Harappan phase of around 3000 BC in ancient north western India and what is now Pakistan, has not yet been deciphered. It is unclear whether it should be {{considered}} an example of proto-writing or whether it is actual writing of the logographic-syllabic type of the other Bronze Age writing systems. Mortimer Wheeler recognises the style of writing as <b>boustrophedon,</b> where [...] "this stability suggests a precarious maturity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{varieties}} of the Greek alphabet developed. One, known as Western Greek or Chalcidian, was used west of Athens and in southern Italy. The other variation, known as Eastern Greek, {{was used in}} Asia Minor (also called Asian Greece i.e. present-day aegean Turkey). The Athenians (c. 400 BCE) adopted that latter variation and eventually {{the rest of the}} Greek-speaking world followed. After first writing right to left, the Greeks eventually chose to write from left to right, unlike the Phoenicians who wrote from right to left. [...] Many Greek letters are similar to Phoenician, except the letter direction is reversed or changed, which can be the result of historical changes from right-to-left writing to <b>boustrophedon</b> to left-to-right writing.|$|E
2500|$|A {{specific}} and terse location descriptor is always used, {{in which the}} townships and sections are indexed based on (1) the township's position relative to the initial point, (2) the section's location within the designated township, and (3) the principal meridian reference. [...] Township, range, and section are abbreviated as T, R, and S, respectively, and cardinal bearings from the initial point by N, S, E, and W; each principal meridian also has its established abbreviation. [...] Thus, for example, the description [...] "T1SR20E S13 MDM" [...] reads as follows: Township 1 South, Range 20 East, Section 13, Mount Diablo Meridian. [...] That is, the 13th section in the first township south of the baseline (in this case, the Mount Diablo Baseline) and the 20th township east of the principal meridian (the Mount Diablo Meridian). [...] Since township and range lines are six miles apart, the [...] "T1SR20E" [...] part of the designation instantly places the location somewhere between zero and six {{miles south of the}} baseline, and 114 and 120 miles east of the principal meridian. [...] Knowing how sections are numbered within townships, we identify section 13 as therefore occupying the one square mile located 2 to 3 miles south, and 119 to 120 miles east, of the Mount Diablo initial point (in central California). [...] Note that the sections within a township are numbered in an unconventional, <b>Boustrophedon</b> pattern (Fig. 2), in which alternating rows are numbered in opposite directions, starting from section 1 in the northeast corner and ending with section 36 in the southeast corner, as per Figure 2. Therefore, section 13 is adjacent to the eastern range line of the designated township. [...] Numbering in this pattern ensures that numerically sequential sections within the same township are physically adjacent, and share colinear boundaries.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} inscriptions of Semitic {{languages in}} Eritrea and Ethiopia {{date to the}} 9th century BC in Epigraphic South Arabian (ESA), an abjad shared with contemporary kingdoms in South Arabia. After the 7th and 6th centuries BC, however, variants of the script arose, evolving {{in the direction of}} the Ge'ez abugida (a writing system that is also called an alphasyllabary). This evolution can be seen most clearly in evidence from inscriptions (mainly graffiti on rocks and caves) in Tigray region in northern Ethiopia and the former province of Akkele Guzay in Eritrea. By the first centuries AD, what is called [...] "Old Ethiopic" [...] or the [...] "Old Ge'ez alphabet" [...] arose, an abjad written left-to-right (as opposed to <b>boustrophedon</b> like ESA) with letters basically identical to the first-order forms of the modern vocalized alphabet (e.g. [...] "k" [...] in the form of [...] "kä"). There were also minor differences such as the letter [...] "g" [...] facing to the right, instead of to the left as in vocalized Ge'ez, and a shorter left leg of [...] "l", as in ESA, instead of equally-long legs in vocalized Ge'ez (somewhat resembling the Greek letter lambda). Vocalization of Ge'ez occurred in the 4th century, and though the first completely vocalized texts known are inscriptions by Ezana, vocalized letters predate him by some years, as an individual vocalized letter exists in a coin of his predecessor Wazeba. Linguist Roger Schneider has also pointed out (in an early 1990s unpublished paper) anomalies in the known inscriptions of Ezana that imply that he was consciously employing an archaic style during his reign, indicating that vocalization could have occurred much earlier. As a result, some [...] believe that the vocalization may have been adopted to preserve the pronunciation of Ge'ez texts due to the already moribund or extinct status of Ge'ez, and that, by that time, the common language of the people were already later Ethio-Semitic languages. At least one of Wazeba's coins from the late 3rd or early 4th century contains a vocalized letter, some 30 or so years before Ezana. Kobishchanov, Daniels, and others have suggested possible influence from the Brahmic family of alphabets in vocalization, as they are also abugidas, and Aksum was an important part of major trade routes involving India and the Greco-Roman world throughout the common era of antiquity.|$|E
60|$|I {{never can}} think of Onomacritus without a certain respect: he began the forging {{business}} so very early, and was (apart from this failing) such an imposing and magnificently respectable character. The scene of the error and the detection of Onomacritus presents itself always {{to me in a}} kind of pictorial vision. It is night, the clear, windless night of Athens; not of the Athens whose ruins remain, but of the ancient city that sank in ashes during the invasion of Xerxes. The time is the time of Pisistratus the successful tyrant; the scene is the ancient temple, the stately house of Athene, the fane where the sacred serpent was fed on cakes, and the primeval olive-tree grew beside the well of Posidon. The darkness of the temple's inmost shrine is lit by the ray of one earthen lamp. You dimly discern the majestic form of a venerable man stooping above a coffer of cedar and ivory, carved with the exploits of the goddess, and with <b>boustrophedon</b> inscriptions. In his hair this archaic Athenian wears the badge of the golden grasshopper. He is Onomacritus, the famous poet, and the trusted guardian of the ancient oracles of Musaeus and Bacis.|$|E
