5000|$|Lease {{and release}} was:"a species of conveyance, invented by Serjeant Moore, {{soon after the}} {{enactment}} of the statute of uses. It is thus contrived; a lease, in fact being a bargain and sale upon some pecuniary consideration for one year, is made by a tenant of the whole freehold no fetter on alienation to the lessee who is in fact the <b>bargainee</b> (buyer). This, without any enrollment, makes the bargainor stand seised {{to the use of the}} <b>bargainee,</b> and vests in the <b>bargainee</b> the use of the term for one year, and then the statute immediately annexes the possession. Being thus in possession, he is capable of receiving a release of the freehold and reversion, made to this tenant (<b>bargainee)</b> in possession; and, accordingly, the next day a release is granted to him." [...] This cites the New York common law treatise that [...] "lease and release was the usual mode of conveyance in England (until) 1841 ... and in New York until 1788...." [...] The original benefactor was Lord Norris, [...] "to avoid the unpleasant notoriety of a livery or attornment." ...|$|E
