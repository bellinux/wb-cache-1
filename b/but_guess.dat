500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun. You think you're going to ruin my life and you think that it's over for me, <b>but</b> <b>guess</b> what? It's not. Life goes on." [...] While commenting to Billboard over the usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] numerous times in two songs from the album, Madonna explained: ...|$|E
500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much <b>but</b> <b>guess</b> what, I don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E

2500|$|British prime {{minister}} Theresa May {{said that the}} foreign minister's comments did not represent the government's view. Other Conservatives however defended Johnson. Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson said: [...] "I think Boris Johnson was absolutely right about {{what he said about}} proxy wars and about Iran. And I agree with his analysis. Now, that might not be the position of the UK Government <b>but</b> <b>guess</b> what - I am not in the UK Government and I think he was right." [...] Later that month, Johnson visited Bahrain, met Saudi leaders and praised Saudi Arabia, saying it was [...] "securing itself from bombardment by the Hootis" [...] in Yemen.|$|E
2500|$|Committee on Infractions {{head for}} the NCAA, Greg Sankey, stated [...] "While student-athletes likely benefited from the {{so-called}} ‘paper courses’ offered by North Carolina, the information available in the record did not establish that the courses were solely created, offered and maintained as an orchestrated effort to benefit student-athletes." [...] North Carolina chancellor Carol Folt commented on {{the resolution of the}} case when she said [...] "I believe we have done everything possible to correct and move beyond the past academic irregularities and have established very robust processes to prevent them from recurring." [...] Tyrone P. Thomas, a lawyer for Mintz Levin and does work with colleges and universities, felt the ruling was [...] "... a massive loophole, and from the P.R. side it looks horrible — these athletes can do what they do, and it looks horrible. <b>But</b> <b>guess</b> what? Maybe that’s not the N.C.A.A.’s job. This is something the schools have always self-regulated." ...|$|E

2500|$|It survives in one {{manuscript}} only, British Museum Harley 2252, {{a collection}} of texts compiled in the early 16th century by a London bookseller called John Colyns. [...] Close study {{has shown that the}} section containing the Stanzaic Morte was originally a separate commercially produced booklet. [...] One leaf, dealing with the burial of the Maid of Astolat, is now missing. [...] By 1570 the manuscript had passed into the possession of one Robert Farrers. [...] The manuscript was studied by Humfrey Wanley, keeper of the Harleian Library, who in 1759 catalogued it with the notation, [...] "This I take to be translated from the French Romance of K. Arthur"; also [...] "I know not who this Poet was, <b>but</b> <b>guess</b> that he lived about the time of K. Henry VII, and that he might have been a Northern man. [...] He useth many Saxon or obsolete Words, and very often delighted himself (as did the Author of 'Piers Plowman') in the Chime of words beginning with the same letter." [...] In 1765 Thomas Percy, mentioning the Stanzaic Morte in his widely influential Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, suggested that it could be older than Wanley thought, since the first line was, he believed, quoted in the Middle English romance of Beves of Hamtoun. [...] Thomas Warton's History of English Poetry (1774–81) includes a short extract from the Morte, and dates it to the early 14th century. [...] In Observations on the Three First Volumes of The History of English Poetry (1782), and again in Ancient Engleish Metrical Romanceës (1802), the antiquary Joseph Ritson ridiculed Warton's and Percy's views of the poem's date, and asserted that Wanley was correct in assigning it to the reign of Henry VII. [...] He noticed the similarities with Malory's Morte d'Arthur, but believed that the poem was based on Malory rather than vice versa. [...] A lengthy but rather facetious synopsis of the Morte, with quotations, figured in the Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances (1805) by George Ellis. [...] Ritson's late date for the poem was there rejected. [...] A complete edition of the Morte by Thomas Ponton was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1819.|$|E

60|$|Charlotte {{looked at}} Paula uneasily when the latter joined {{her in the}} drawing-room.

60|$|Did {{the first}} thought of fear, or misgiving cross her mind at this moment? It were {{impossible}} to say.

6000|$|Outside {{the room}} Barney turned {{for a last}} look at the princess as he was being led in one {{direction}} and she in another.
