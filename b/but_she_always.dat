25|$|On tests between November 1971 and May 1972 Curtiss {{determined}} that Genie viewed non-specific adjectives describing size, such {{as little as}} absolute rather than relative values without superlative or comparative markers. Between January and May 1972 her comprehension of noun-modifier sentences significantly increased and starting in May 1972, after Curtiss replaced the word little with tiny, Genie showed clear comprehension of them. Genie clearly understood both the word more and the suffix -er as comparatives by January 1972, but never used them in her own speech. Prior to 1972 Genie responded to the conjunctions and and or as if they both meant and, but even after recognizing {{there was a difference}} never fully grasped the meaning of or. On tests she showed perfect comprehension of and while correctly responding to the word or fewer than 10% of the time, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> understood disjunction marked by the word or in everyday conversation. She never attempted to use any other conjunctions, and with one possible highly ungrammatical exception never tried to connect two sentences.|$|E
25|$|The film flashes back to 21 {{years earlier}} during {{military}} era as Tamuno narrates their ordeal {{to the public}} via Kristy's camera. Ebiere (Mbong Amata) is born in Warri during the Military era; she concludes high school and is offered scholarship by Western Oil to study oversea. A few years later, an oil pipe in the Niger Delta bursts {{and the people of}} the community go to fetch petrol from the pipe, Dede (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a fisherman discovers that fishes in the river have been killed by the oil spillage. The police arrive at the spillage site and demand that the Villagers vacate the area, but no one listens to them. Ebiere arrives in the village — her home, and is told her mother and siblings are getting fuel from a spillage site. On her way to the site, the site explodes killing her mother and siblings. The explosion appears to have been an accident, caused after one of the police officers sent to disperse the oil collectors lights a cigarette after having failed to do so. He is killed as well. Ebiere speaks up at a consolation visit of Western Oil staff (An oil rig American company based in Warri) and is applauded by members of the Community. This establishes her as one of the speakers for the Niger Delta Community, she is approached by Kate Summers (Sarah Wayne Callies), a reporter who likes her speech and says Ebiere is {{different from the rest of}} the community people, Kate becomes one of Ebiere's friends and supporters. Ebiere starts to organize peaceful protests and mass rallies for their voice to be heard, fighting for the Niger Delta to be cleaned up and well maintained — they are sometimes beaten, killed and/or arrested by the Military in the process. Ebiere is offered bribes severally by Western Oil representatives to stop her from instigating the people, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> declines.|$|E

500|$|Cogman noted, {{about the}} Arya storyline {{in the same}} interview, that {{he comes from a}} theater background, and that [...] "being able to comment on the show and the {{reactions}} to the show through the players were so much fun. The show is often accused of being gratuitous in all kinds of way – the violence and the bigness of the characters. It's a huge operatic story. We're able to lovingly spoof ourselves but also play with ideas about how audiences view the show, good and bad, and how a perspective of a story changes. Plus there’s the dramatic deliciousness of Arya watching her own life play out on stage." [...] Weiss also spoke about Arya, saying [...] "We were excited to do the play within the play, and it's a distorted fun house mirror representation of things we've already seen." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Part of Arya's amusement is just that she knows that they're getting so many details wrong, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> regretted that she didn't have a chance to watch Joffrey die, and now she gets to. It's obviously a comic version of it, but that gives her great pleasure." [...] Weiss also noted, [...] "Arya is slowly getting seduced by these performances, and Lady Crane, the actress that she's charged with killing, this is somebody who like her has taken as her life's work the job of becoming other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{romance of}} his life was his {{connection}} with Léonie Léon, the full details of which were not known to the public till her death in 1906. She {{was the daughter of}} a creole French artillery officer. Gambetta {{fell in love with her}} in 1871. [...] She became his mistress, and the liaison lasted until he died. Gambetta constantly urged her to marry him during this period, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> refused, fearing to compromise his career; she remained, however, his confidante and intimate adviser in all his political plans. It seems she had just consented to become his wife, and the date of the marriage had been fixed, when the accident which caused his death occurred in her presence. Contradictory accounts of this fatal episode exist, but it was certainly accidental, and not suicide. Her influence on Gambetta was absorbing, both as lover and as politician, and the correspondence which has been published shows how much he depended upon her.|$|E
2500|$|Alexandra “Alex” Young is an American pop singer-songwriter, actress, philanthropist {{and fashion}} {{designer}} born in New York City on August 29, 1989. She entered {{the entertainment industry}} {{at a very young}} age. She spent two seasons in the cast of Sesame Street <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> wanted to become a singer. At the age of 13, she released her first studio recording, prompted by the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center, where her father worked.

2500|$|The series {{began at}} a time when {{violence}} on television was under intense scrutiny. As a result, Wonder Woman was less frequently seen punching or kicking people the way she did in the early episodes. She would usually be shown pushing and throwing enemies or using creativity to get them to somehow knock themselves out (such as jumping high into the air to cause pursuers to collide). Despite the wartime setting, she almost never resorted to deadly force. The only exception occurs in the pilot episode when she sinks a German U-boat by crashing an airplane into it, presumably killing everyone aboard. [...] Wonder Woman herself was occasionally overpowered by chloroform and poison gas, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> came {{back in the second half}} of the show to save the day. In some episodes, her enemies learn the secret of her superhuman strength – her magic belt – and temporarily steal it, leaving her with average human strength. Her indestructible lasso and bracelets were stolen or taken away in one episode (leaving her defenseless against gunfire), but Wonder Woman recovered them by the end of the episode. (In the comics, Wonder Woman's bracelets were welded onto her forearms, and she would lose most of her strength if men were to join them forcibly with metal.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Adele later {{collaborated with}} famed {{musician}} and producer Dan Wilson to write [...] "Someone like You" [...] {{which was one}} of the final songs composed for the album. Prior to meeting with Wilson, Adele said she wrote some of the lyrics using her acoustic guitar. The two sat around the piano for two days and brainstormed various melodies and lyrics, and ultimately decided to keep the musical production sparse: [...] "We just wrote it on the piano and then we recorded it when it was written. It wasn't sort of like recording it and listening to it thinking 'where can we go next?' It was really old school." [...] During an interview with Billboard, Wilson stated that while writing the song, they wanted to make it as personal as possible. He added [...] "We didn't try to make it open-ended so it could apply to 'anybody.' We tried to make it as personal as possible. She may not have had a melodic hook or a specific lyrical idea, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>always</b> knew what she wanted to say. She definitely had a master plan." [...] The song was recorded at Harmony Studios in West Hollywood, California with Wilson playing piano. Philip Allen engineered in the studio. The mixing was done by Tom Elmhirst and Dan Parry while the mastering was finished by Tom Coyne.|$|E
