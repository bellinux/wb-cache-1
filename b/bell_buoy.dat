50|$|Upon commissioning, Tringa was {{assigned}} to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 8 and operated out of the submarine base at New London, Connecticut. During her first six years of active service, she remained close to the eastern seaboard. Fortunately, her services as a submarine rescue vessel were not required. On the other hand, Tringa remained busy practicing simulated submarine rescues and serving as target ship and recovery ship for submarines in torpedo-firing drills. In addition, she participated {{in a number of}} rescue experiments for the Bureau of Ships, testing diving <b>bells,</b> submarine <b>buoys,</b> ground tackle, mooring gear, and related equipment.|$|R
50|$|Since the {{decommissioning}} of the lighthouse, smaller automated lighthouses (two located at Humber Bay Park {{in the west}} and Bluffer's Park to the east), Toronto Harbour Light, as well as floating <b>bell</b> or light <b>buoys,</b> navigational masts have been used to replace the lighthouse to provide navigational aid along Toronto's waterfront and Toronto Harbour.|$|R

This is a very close and complicated piece of navigation, I should think, this running up the Mersey, for every moment we are passing {{some kind of a}} signal token, which warns off from some shoal. Here is a <b>bell</b> <b>buoy,</b> where the waves keep the bell always tolling; here, a buoyant lighthouse; and [...] "See there, those shoals, how pokerish they look!" [...] says one of the passengers, pointing to the foam on our starboard bow. All is bustle, animation, exultation. Now float out the American stars and stripes on our bow.|$|E
60|$|The sea {{would have}} been far heavier than it now was in another two hours' time, but the water was still very shallow on the sands, and this broke the force of the waves. The boat was now running along the narrow channel of deep water leading between the Spitway Buoy and the <b>Bell</b> <b>Buoy,</b> and almost at right angles to the course they had before been following. The wind was almost on their beam, and even under the reduced canvas the Bessy was lying far over, the water {{covering}} three planks of her deck on the starboard side. They could see the buoy, and presently could hear its deep tolling as the hammers struck the bell with every motion of the buoy.|$|E
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{was made}} without incident until {{the morning of}} 1 August 1917, when fog appeared {{off the coast of}} Nova Scotia. The visibility was reduced to near zero, but Captain William McNeil continued on his course and posted several crew members to listen for the various whistles like <b>buoy</b> <b>bells</b> or foghorn blasts, which warns ships of the dangerous shoals that threaten the entrance to Halifax Harbour.|$|R
50|$|WJIB is an {{indirect}} successor to a previous Boston FM station {{with the same}} call sign (now WBQT/96.9, owned by Greater Media) which in turn descended from WXHR, {{one of the first}} FM stations in the Boston area. Coincidentally, what is now WJIB was once owned by Harvey Radio Laboratories, the same company that owned WXHR/WJIB-FM. The AM station was first known as WTAO, then WXHR, and later as WCAS. In 1967, a year after they were sold to a joint venture of Kaiser Broadcasting and the Boston Globe, WXHR became WCAS while WXHR-FM changed to WJIB, featured the beautiful music format, and became well known for a nautical-themed station identification featuring a <b>buoy</b> <b>bell</b> and a seagull (now used in modified form by WOCN-FM on Cape Cod). WJIB-FM became WCDJ, a smooth jazz station, in 1990, and the call sign WJIB lapsed.|$|R
50|$|Edward Neale of Burford cast St. James' sanctus bell in 1649 and {{the tenor}} and treble bells in 1662. Henry III Bagley, who had bell-foundries at Chacombe in Northamptonshire and Witney in Oxfordshire, cast an {{additional}} bell for St James' in 1732. In 2004 the original bells were removed {{and a new}} frame was installed. The Neale sanctus bell was retained, {{the largest of the}} Neale bells was re-hung as the tenor and the Bagley bell was also re-hung. A new treble bell and two other new bells, all cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 2003 and 2004, were added. A former <b>buoy</b> <b>bell</b> that John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast in 1968 for Trinity House was restored and added to the tower to complete the present ring of six bells. The original Neale treble bell was removed to Burford where it is now displayed in St. John the Baptist parish church, Burford.|$|R

50|$|An {{assistant}} keeper's {{house was}} added in 1908, {{and the light}} was upgraded to an incandescent vapor lamp in 1914. The change increased the lights range to 18 mi over the lake, and further protection was added in 1918 {{with the addition of}} a lighted, <b>bell</b> <b>buoy</b> some two and a quarter miles off shore at the end of the point.|$|E
50|$|Harding's Ledge, {{also known}} as Harding Ledge, is a shoal in the Atlantic Ocean located on the {{approach}} to Boston Harbor, 1.5 miles east of Point Allerton, and near Hingham, Massachusetts, United States.

50|$|Mile Rocks Lighthouse {{is located}} on a rock about 1 mi {{southwest}} of the Golden Gate Bridge, off of Lands End in San Francisco, California. It was completed in 1906, replacing a nearby <b>bell</b> <b>buoy.</b> The tower of the lighthouse was removed in 1966, the top converted into a landing pad for helicopters, and the light automated. The lighthouse was at one time painted with alternating red and white rings, but as of 2017, the lighthouse is painted plain white.|$|E

There is a lighted <b>bell</b> <b>buoy</b> about 1 km west of Noonday Rock. Noonday Rock derives its name {{from that of the}} clipper ship that struck it on January 1, 1863 and sank within one hour.|$|E
50|$|In 1889, the United States Lighthouse Service {{placed a}} <b>bell</b> <b>buoy</b> near the rocks. However, the strong {{currents}} {{in the area}} would pull the buoy {{beneath the surface of}} the water and set it adrift. The lighthouse was completed in 1906 after considerable difficulty caused by the heavy seas and strong currents occurring at this point. The rock upon which the lighthouse is built measured only 40 by 30 ft at high water. The base of the tower is a large block of concrete protected by steel plating. Steel and concrete in the foundation alone weighed 1,500 tons. The superstructure is of steel, and houses the fog signal apparatus and the quarters for the keepers, with the lantern above.|$|E
50|$|In thick fog on 10 September 1951 the Scillonian was on {{her usual}} journey to St Mary’s. Visibility that day was {{described}} by the lifeboat secretary, Trevellick Moyle as “I don’t think I have ever seen it thicker”. The ship did not have radar and the captain, in poor visibility, often found his bearings by listening for the <b>bell</b> <b>buoy</b> of the Spanish Ledge, or the bugle of Vic Trenwith who would play on Peninnis Head. The captain heard neither and the Scillonian continued westward and hit the Great Wingletang Ledge on St Agnes. The fog lifted later that day to find the ship between two rocks and her bow in the air. Nine hours later, at 11 pm, she was refloated by the tide together with her own engines and {{a line from the}} lifeboat, and {{made her way to the}} harbour. The next day patched with cement and acetylene welding she was cleared by the Board of Trade as seaworthy to make the return journey to the mainland.|$|E
