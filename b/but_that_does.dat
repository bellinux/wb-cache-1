They announce that the Star Trek series has been cancelled. Captain Kirk orders the crew to fire their hand phasers at the aliens but nothing happens. Mr. Spock assumes that the aliens have a type of weapons de-activator and tries to employ his famous Vulcan nerve pinch on him, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not work either. The executive confiscates Mr. Spock's pointed ears. Spock then mind-melds with Goodman only to discover that, as he describes it, his brain is devoid of substance and contains only a few rodents.|$|E

The subjects are less popular after about 1660, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not match any recorded reduction in severity of winters and may reflect only changes in taste or fashion. In the later period between the 1780s and 1810s, snowy subjects again became popular.|$|E

However, Easterly and Levine's findings most support the view that long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.|$|E

25|$|The forint (sign: Ft; code: HUF) is the {{currency}} of Hungary. It was formerly divided into 100 fillér, but fillér coins {{are no longer in}} circulation. The introduction of the forint on 1 August 1946 was a crucial step in the post-World War II stabilization of the Hungarian economy, and {{the currency}} remained relatively stable until the 1980s. Transition to a market economy in the early 1990s adversely affected the value of the forint; inflation peaked at 35% in 1991. Since 2001, inflation is in single digits, and the forint has been declared fully convertible. As a member of the European Union, the long -term aim of the Hungarian government may be to replace the forint with the euro, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not appear to be likely until some time during the 2020s.|$|E
25|$|In Bengal, some Muslims {{refer to}} the social {{stratification}} within their society as qaum (or Quoms), a term that is found among Muslims elsewhere in India, {{as well as in}} Pakistan and Afghanistan. Qaums have patrilineal hereditary, with ranked occupations and endogamy. Membership in a qaum is inherited by birth. Barth identifies the origin of the stratification from the historical segregation between pak (pure) and paleed (impure) - - defined by the family's social or religious status, occupation and involvement in sexual crimes. Originally, Paleed/Paleet qaum included people running or working at brothels, prostitution service providers or professional courtesan/dancers (Tawaif) and musicians. There is history of skin color defining Pak/Paleed, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not have historical roots, and was adopted by outsiders using analogy from Hindu Caste system.|$|E
25|$|Held {{that the}} Constitution of India which is {{essentially}} a social rather than a political document, is founded on a social philosophy and as such has two main features basic and circumstantial. The basic constituent remained constant, the circumstantial was subject to change. According to the learned Judges, the broad contours of the basic elements and the fundamental features of the Constitution are delineated in the preamble and the Parliament has no power to abolish or emasculate those basic elements of fundamental features. The building of a welfare State is {{the ultimate goal of}} every Government <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not mean that in order to build a welfare State, human freedoms have to suffer a total destruction. Applying these tests, the learned Judges invalidated Article 31C even in its un-amended form.|$|E

25|$|In Morocco, where king Mohammed VI is also Amir al-Muminin (Commander of the Faithful), the {{authorities}} {{have tried to}} organize the field by creating a scholars' council (conseil des oulémas) composed of Muslim scholars (ulama), {{which is the only}} one allowed to issue fatāwā. In this case, a national theocracy could in fact compel intra-national compliance with the fatwā, since a central authority is the source. Even then, however, the issue would not necessarily be religiously binding for the residents of that nation. For, the state may have the power to put a fatwā in effect, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not mean that the fatwā is to be religiously accepted by all. For instance, if a state fatwā council made abortion acceptable in the first trimester without any medical reason, that would have direct impact on official procedures in hospitals and courts in that country. Yet, this would not mean that the Muslims in that nation has to agree with that fatwā, or that the fatwā is religiously binding for them.|$|E
25|$|Around 2 A.M. on April 15, 1865, {{members of}} the District of Columbia police visited the Surratt {{boarding}} house, seeking John Wilkes Booth and John Surratt. Why the police {{came to the house}} is not entirely clear. Most historians conclude that Weichmann's friend, Department of War employee Daniel Gleason, had alerted federal authorities to Confederate activity centered on the Surratt house, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> not explain why police rather than federal agents appeared there. (Historian Roy Chamlee, however, says that there is evidence that Gleason did not tell police about his suspicions of Weichmann for several days.) Within 45 minutes of the attack on Lincoln, John Surratt's name had become associated with the attack on Secretary of State William H. Seward. The police as well as the Provost Marshal's office both had files on John Surratt, Jr., and knew he was a close friend of Booth. (It is possible that either James L. Maddox, property supervisor at Ford's Theatre and a friend of Booth's, or actor John Matthews, both of whom may have known about the plot to attack government officials, mentioned Surratt's name.) Historian Otto Eisenschiml has argued that David Herold's attempt to steal a horse from John Fletcher may have led them to the Surratt boarding house, but at least one other scholar has called the link uncertain. Other sources claim that eyewitnesses had identified Booth as Lincoln's attacker, and the detectives had information (a tip from an unnamed actor and a bartender) linking John, Jr., to Booth. Mary lied to the detectives that her son had been in Canada for two weeks. She also did not reveal that she had delivered a package to the tavern on Booth's behalf, only hours earlier.|$|E
