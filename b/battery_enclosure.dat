50|$|When Malta {{fell under}} British rule permanently, they {{substantially}} extended the fort {{and the original}} tower now forms {{the core of a}} Victorian era fortress. Between 1872 and 1878, the <b>battery,</b> <b>enclosure</b> and the flight of steps leading to the tower were dismantled, and a new polygonal fort was built instead, with the entire installation being renamed Fort Saint Lucian. The fort has caponiers, a sunken gate, and a curved entrance ramp. On the seaward side the tower has been extended to form a low battery, with three large casemates facing out across Marsaxlokk Bay towards Fort Delimara. The fort was equipped with RML 10 inch 18 ton guns. St Lucian formed part of a ring of Victorian fortresses that protected Marsaxlokk Bay which also included Fort Delimara, Fort Tas-Silġ and Fort Benghisa.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{traction}} <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} significant parts of an electric vehicle. Better structural performance and lightweight design of <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> are extremely important in current situation. This paper introduces a multi-objective topology optimization design method for the traction <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure,</b> in which both the static stiffness and dynamic frequencies are taken into consideration. The optimization is utilized to achieve a new <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> structure with better static and dynamic performances. The results illustrate that the structural topology optimization approach can be a feasible and efficient design methodology for the traction <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> structural design and can provide the designer with detailed guidance in conceptual design phase...|$|E

It is critical that tools and resources are implemented that gauge manufacturing performance and identify root cause issues. This project focuses on the design and manufacturing process of an electric vehicle aluminum <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> and {{the implementation of a}} production measurement system. The current problem is a lack of process control communication and out of control alarms when uncontrolled events occur for manufacturing associates at the <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> manufacturing work station.

50|$|A {{fortification}} {{known as}} the Market Battery, was located on the waterfront {{directly in front of}} City Hall where Confederation Park is located. It was completed in 1848 because of tension between the United States and Great Britain during Oregon Crisis. The Market Battery was one of several Kingston fortifications constructed during this period. A thick outer wall, or sea wall, in the harbour extended 20 feet above the water and included embrasures for cannons, while an inner wall, which included an entrance, completed the <b>battery's</b> <b>enclosure</b> to the west. In the 1870s, after Imperial troops withdrew from Kingston, the inner wall was removed and the location became a park. The large outer wall was removed in 1885 and the land was leased to the K&P railroad. A wall of the battery has been restored to illustrate the site's history.|$|R

40|$|The {{technology}} of multifunctional structures, {{when applied to}} spacecraft batteries, allows mass and volume to be saved through the removal of parasitic components of the battery. Electrochemical cells, in this case commercially available cells of the plastic lithium-ion type, may be incorporated directly into structural sandwich panels, removing {{the need for a}} secondary structure (i. e. the <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> and its interface) to mount the cells. Placing the cells within the structure also removes them from the bus, reducing its volume and thus further reducing overall mass. Notwithstanding the relatively low mechanical properties exhibited by the batteries that have been investigated during our work, this paper shall demonstrate how, by optimizing the layout of the cells within a panel, adequate structural performance may be maintained.

40|$|A multi-functional {{structure}} saves mass from {{a spacecraft}} by incorporating other functional subsystems into the structure. By using the structural properties of a non-structural element, inert structure may be eliminated, and {{the requirement to}} allot internal volume to the subsystem in question is removed. The current paper describes a multi-functional structure based on the secondary power system. By using commercially available plastic lithium-ion cells to form {{the core of a}} sandwich panel, inert mass is eliminated from both the structure and from the <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure.</b> The feasibility of the proposed multi-functional structure is demonstrated though vibration testing on a single cell, and the successful manufacture of a test panel. The work goes on to quantify the potential mass savings that may be achieved by using a multi-functional structure of this type. By varying a set of spacecraft attributes, the study identifies that small spacecraft with high power requirements have the potential to gain the most benefit from using a multi-functional structure of this type. © IMechE 2008...|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} [10] is disclosed for {{a lightweight}} bipolar battery of the end-plate cell stack design. Current flow through a bipolar cell stack [12] is collected {{by a pair}} of copper end-plates [16 a, 16 b] and transferred edgewise out of the battery {{by a pair of}} lightweight, low resistance copper terminals [28 a, 28 b]. The copper terminals parallel the surface of a corresponding copper end-plate [16 a, 16 b] to maximize battery throughput. The bipolar cell stack [12], copper end-plates [16 a, 16 b] and copper terminals [28 a, 28 b] are rigidly sandwiched between a pair of nonconductive rigid end-plates [20] having a lightweight fiber honeycomb core which eliminates distortion of individual plates within the bipolar cell stack due to internal pressures. Insulating foam [30] is injected into the fiber honeycomb core to reduce heat transfer {{into and out of the}} bipolar cell stack and to maintain uniform cell performance.

40|$|The {{stationary}} power market, particularly telecommunications back-up (telecom) applications, {{is dominated}} by lead-acid batteries. A large percentage of telecom powerplants are housed in outdoor enclosures where valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) batteries are commonly used because of their low-maintenance design. <b>Batteries</b> in these <b>enclosures</b> can be exposed to temperatures which can exceed 70 °C, significantly reducing battery life. Nickel–cadmium (Ni–Cd) batteries have traditionally been deployed in hotter locations as a high-temperature alternative to VRLA. This paper compares the performances of nickel/metal hydride (Ni/MH), Ni–Cd, and VRLA batteries in a simulated telecom environment according to published testing standards. Among these three choices, Ni/MH batteries showed the best overall performance, suggesting substantially longer operating life in high temperature stationary use...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the design and}} analysis of the enclosure for the high voltage battery pack which powers the Model Year 2017 MIT Formula SAE racecar. The battery pack is custom designed and built with six modules of 144 Samsung INR 18650 - 25 R lithium-ion cells each. Each component of the enclosure is analyzed to ensure structural integrity and optimized to reduce mass of the <b>battery</b> pack. The <b>enclosure</b> is able to secure the modules during sudden accelerations or decelerations from crash scenarios, allows for air flow to cool the cells, and allows for convenient serviceability of the modules. The final mass of the enclosure, at 8. 5 kg, results in an overall battery pack mass of 59. 5 kg, 76 % of the mass of the Model Year 2016 battery pack. All components of the enclosure have been manufactured, and the assembly process with the modules and high voltage electronics has been tested and verified. by Henry Merrow. Thesis: S.

40|$|This report {{describes}} the overall accomplishments {{and benefits of}} Solar Electric Specialties Co. (SES) under this Photovoltaic Manufacturing Technology (PVMaT) subcontract. SES addressed design issues related to their modular autonomous PV power supply (MAPPS) and a mobile photogenset. MAPPS investigations included gel-cell batteries mounted horizontally; redesign of the SES power supply; modified <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> for increased safety and reduced cost; programmable, interactive battery charge controllers; and UL and FM listings. The photogenset systems incorporate generators, battery storage, and PV panels for a mobile power supply. The unit includes automatic oil-change systems for the propane generators, collapsible array mounts for the PV enclosure, and internal stowage of the arrays. Standardizing the products resulted in product lines of MAPPS and Photogensets that can be produced more economically and with shorter lead times, while increasing product quality and reliability. Product assembly and quality control have also been improved and streamlined {{with the development of}} standardized assembly processes and QC testing procedures.

40|$|This project {{entails the}} design and {{assembly}} of the photovoltaic system, switchboard panel enclosure, and <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> for the DC House’s main electrical system. The intended purpose of this project is to provide the electrical framework necessary for future students to easily modify and add to this rendition of the DC House. The principle design implements a variety of renewable energy sources, however this senior project only uses solar power {{in order to maintain}} a manageable scope. Each of these renewable energy sources are stepped down to a voltage of 24 V and input to a Multi Input Single Output DC to DC converter (MISO) located within the switchboard panel enclosure. The MISO then connects to a set of batteries which power the loads of the DC House operating at 48 V. The finished assembly of the photovoltaic array and panel enclosure will then be retrofitted to a small house located at the Student Experimental Farm (SEF). After the retrofit, the electrical system will be tested at the source and load sides to ensure proper system functionality...|$|E
40|$|Zomeworks, a small-sized designer-manufacturer {{of passive}} solar energy products, is {{considering}} launching a new freeze-tolerant passive thermosiphon solar water heater. The firm’s target market analysis is based only on consumer economics. How can the firm design the product and select a target market in ways that implement a corporate strategy and a branding strategy? Should the product be targeted only at consumers living off the natural gas line in the United States, or should it also target green/“ethical” consumers, industrial users and emerging markets? Is Zomeworks the best firm to commercialize the product, or should it license out or spin off the product? The firm also has a successful <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure</b> product. Should it spin it off in order to mass produce it?Learning Objective: This case illustrates some of the difficulties encountered by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the renewable energy industry as it seeks to commercialize a new technology, such as product design, target markets and “The Innovator’s Dilemma. ” It also illustrates the tendency of many SMEs to compete on quality rather than on brand. The case {{can be used in}} entrepreneurship courses focusing on technology; in marketing courses focusing on branding; and in public policy courses covering tax credits and subsidies in the cleantech or green industry. The case is most effective after reading the “Technology Epiphanies” chapter in Verganti’s book Design Driven Innovation (2009), as well as the Bower & Christensen (1995) and Holt (2003) articles listed in the teaching note. The “Technology Epiphanies” chapter covers the technology epiphany, a form of design-driven innovation that entails both radically new technology and radically new meaning (i. e., a new consumer value proposition). The Bower & Christensen article was the precursor to Christensen’s book The Innovator’s Dilemma. The Holt article covers the idea of a “brand icon” and the role of mythmaking in brands...|$|E
40|$|This NASA {{grant was}} funded {{as a result}} of an {{unsolicited}} proposal submission to Kennedy Space Center. The proposal proposed the development and testing of a shallow water optical water quality buoy. The buoy is meant to work in shallow aquatic systems (ponds, rivers, lagoons, and semi-enclosed water areas where strong wind wave action is not a major environmental During the project period of three years, a demonstration of the buoy was conducted. The last demonstration during the project period was held in November, 1996 when the buoy was demonstrated as being totally operational with no tethered communications line. During the last year of the project the buoy was made to be solar operated by large gel cell batteries. Fund limitations did not permit the <b>batteries</b> in metal <b>enclosures</b> as hoped for higher wind conditions, however the system used to date has worked continuously for in- situ operation of over 18 months continuous deployment. The system needs to have maintenance and somewhat continuous operational attention since various components have limited lifetime ages. For example, within the last six months the onboard computer has had to be repaired as it did approximately 6 months after deployment. The spectrograph had to be repaired and costs for repairs was covered by KB Science since no ftmds were available for this purpose after the grant expired. Most recently the computer web page server failed and it is currently being repaired by KB Science. In addition, the cell phone operation is currently being ftmded by Dr. Bostater in order to maintain the system's operation. The above points need to be made to allow NASA to understand that like any sophisticated measuring system in a lab or in the field, necessary funding and maintenance is needed to insure the system's operational state and to obtain quality factor. The proposal stated that the project was based upon the integration of a proprietary and confidential sensor and probe design that was developed by KB Science and Engineering and is currently patented by KB Science. The buoy's purpose was to collected hyperspectral optical signatures for analysis and resulting estimation of water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a, seston and dissolved organic matter (DOC). The ultimate goal of the project was to develop a buoy that would integrate a probe to measure upwelling light from a source and thus relate this backscattered light to water quality parameters...|$|R
40|$|Proper thermal {{management}} {{is important for}} optimum performance and durability of most electric-vehicle batteries. For high-temperature cells such as sodium/sulphur, a very efficient and responsive thermal control system is essential. Heat must be removed during exothermic periods and retained when the batteries are not in use. Current {{thermal management}} approaches rely on passive insulation enclosures with active cooling loops that penetrate the enclosure. This paper presents the design, analysis, and testing of an enclosure with variable conductance insulation (VCI). VCI uses a hydride with an integral electric resistance heater to expel and retrieve {{a small amount of}} hydrogen gas into a vacuum space. By controlling the amount of hydrogen gas, the thermal conductance can be varied by more than 100 : 1, enabling the cooling loop (cold plate) to be mounted on the enclosure exterior. By not penetrating the <b>battery</b> <b>enclosure,</b> the cooling system is simpler and more reliable. Also, heat can be retained more effectively when desired. For high temperatures, radiation shields within the vacuum space are required. Ceramic spacers are used to maintain separation of the steel enclosure materials against atmospheric loading. Ceramic-to-ceramic thermal contact resistance within the spacer assembly minimizes thermal conductance. Two full-scale (0. 8 -m {times} 0. 9 -m {times} 0. 3 -m) prototypes were designed, built, and tested under high-temperature 200 {degrees}- 350 {degrees}C battery conditions. With an internal temperature of 330 {degrees}C (and 20 {degrees}C ambient), the measured total-enclosure minimum heat loss was 80 watts (excluding wire pass-through losses). The maximum heat rejection was 4100 watts. The insulation can be switched from minimum to maximum conductance (hydrogen pressure from 2. 0 {times} 10 {sup - 3 } to 8 torr) in 3 minutes. Switching from maximum to minimum conductance was longer (16 minutes), but still satisfactory because of the large thermal mass of the battery...|$|E
