50|$|In {{the example}} above, two data sets with a panel {{structure}} are shown. Individual characteristics (income, age, sex) are collected for different persons and different years. In the left data set two persons (1, 2) are observed {{over three years}} (2001, 2002, 2003). Because each person is observed every year, the left-hand data set is called a <b>balanced</b> <b>panel,</b> whereas the data set on the right hand is called an unbalanced panel, since person 1 is not observed in year 2003 and person 3 is not observed in 2003 or 2001. This specific structure these data sets are in is called long format where one row holds one observation per time. Another way to structure panel data would be the wide format where one row represents one observational unit for all points in time (for the example, the wide format would have only two (left example) or three (right example) rows of data with additional columns for each time-varying variable (income, age). Representing panel data in long format is much more common than using the wide format because it saves storage space. This {{is due to the}} fact that wide format will have lots of sparse cells wasting storage space.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  2, the <b>balance</b> <b>panel</b> size is about 10, 000 individuals, i.e. 64.7  % {{of the initial}} sample, with some small {{differences}} by panel.

For this reason, the EU-SILC user database provides longitudinal weights that in principle correct for potential bias introduced by the sample selection (Eurostat 2010). In Italy, longitudinal weights are provided at individual level and are adjusted for non-response, controlling for some characteristics (territorial domain, demographic size of the municipalities, number of household members, nationality, sex, age, education, and professional condition) (see Istat 2013 b, for {{a detailed description of}} individual longitudinal weights).|$|R

Considering the current data problems and missing key variable data, cleaned and <b>balanced</b> <b>panel</b> datasets are constructed for only four periods: 1990 – 1995, 1998 – 2000, 2003 – 2006, and 2008 – 2010. The four periods of cleaned and <b>balanced</b> <b>panel</b> datasets enable {{an evaluation of the}} impact of implemented policies or economic circumstances during each period. An assumption is made that undesirable outputs are weakly disposable because Indonesia has not implemented carbon regulations. The Malmquist productivity index is employed to estimate TFP without CO 2 emissions over time, and the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index is applied to estimate TFP with CO 2 emissions over time. The influence of energy factors on environmental productivity changes over time is also investigated.|$|E

40|$|A re-thinking {{and clear}} {{understanding}} of the factors underlying a country's balance of trade position is needed as the global trade regime becomes more liberalized. The relationship between the overall trade balance and its determinants as propounded in the standard models may not necessarily be the same with the bilateral trade balances. This study has developed a model of bilateral trade balance that captures the effects of all factors influencing trade balance as suggested by elasticity, absorption, and monetary approaches and the popular Gravity Model with some extensions. Specifically, the present paper postulates that the relative factors determine the trading pattern, and hence the trade balance of a country in bilateral trade with partners while in the earlier models absolute factors determine the trade <b>balance,.</b> Using standard <b>panel</b> data techniques the model is empirically tested and the results show significant effects of all the relative factors on the bilateral trade balance of Bangladesh in trading with her partners.

30|$|Although TFWs are traced {{for up to}} 5  years {{before their}} {{permanent}} residence transition and followed for up to 5  years after this transition, not all TFWs in the earnings sample can be observed for 11  years. The sample used for earnings analyses is not balanced for the following reasons: (1) TFWs may acquire permanent residence after various lengths of stay in Canada; (2) TFWs land in Canada in different years, but the data track them within a fixed window; and (3) some TFWs may leave the labour market while still residing in the country or return to their home country. The three types of attrition may be correlated with individual-level unobserved heterogeneity that could confound {{the effect of the}} transition to permanent residence on the earnings growth of TFWs. Incorporating longitudinal data could mitigate this endogeneity by controlling for individual-level fixed effects. We also estimated our models for the 11 -year <b>balanced</b> <b>panel</b> data, and the results are presented in Table 8 in the Appendix. Compared with the corresponding results (Model 2 s) in Tables  5 and 6 from the unbalanced panel, the sample size (person-years) is reduced by about 90 % in the <b>balanced</b> <b>panel</b> and becomes too small for two regression models. However, for the models with sufficient sample size, the results from the balanced and unbalanced panel data are broadly similar in the magnitude of the coefficients.

40|$|The {{pervasive}} role {{of information}} and communications technology (ICT) {{in the new economy}} is well documented. There is now considerable agreement among scholars regarding the ICT contribution to national productivity growth. On the other hand, the production spillover and network externality associated with ICT capital draws its contribution beyond the neoclassical baseline. Many researchers have provided empirical evidence for the correlation between ICT spillover and national productivity. Nevertheless, the ICT spillover in international context is still an unexplored area. Inspired by the belief that ICT bears the features of knowledge capital, we conjecture that ICT-related knowledge spillover could happen in today’s open world economy. We conduct empirical tests on a <b>balance</b> <b>panel</b> of annual data series from a sample of 29 countries over period 1993 - 2001. The empirical results confirm the existence of international ICT spillover and the pattern of such spillover for two distinguished economic groups.
