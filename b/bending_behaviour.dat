While flexibility increases with an increase in profile height and a decrease in corrugation spacing, pressure resistance decreases.

Despite its simplicity, the as-cleaved materials demonstrated surprising macro-continuity, high crystalline quality and extraordinary mechanical and electrical properties that triggered global research interest. Here such cleavage processes and associated mechanical behaviours are investigated by a direct in situ transmission electron microscopy probing technique, using atomically thin molybdenum disulphide layers as a model material. Our technique demonstrates layer number selective cleavage, from a monolayer to double layer and up to 23 atomic layers.

40|$|In this study, {{a new and}} {{efficient}} computational approach based on isogeometric analysis (IGA) and refined plate theory (RPT) is proposed for the geometrically nonlinear analysis of functionally graded (FG) microplates. While the microplates’ size-dependent effects are efficiently captured by a simple modified couple stress theory (MCST) with only one length scale parameter, the four-unknown RPT is employed to establish the displacement fields which are eventually used to derive the nonlinear von Kámán strains. The NURBS-based isogeometric analysis is used to construct high-continuity elements, which is essentially required in the modified couple stress and refined plate theories, before the iterative Newton-Raphson algorithm is employed to solve the nonlinear problems. The successful convergence and comparison studies as well as benchmark results of the nonlinear analysis of FG microplates ascertain the validity and reliability of the proposed approach.

40|$|The LiteSteel beam (LSB) is a cold-formed high {{strength}} steel channel section made of two torsionally rigid closed flanges and a slender web. Due to its mono-symmetric characteristics, its centroid and shear centre do not coincide. The LSBs {{can be used in}} floor systems as joists or bearers and in these applications they are often subjected to transverse loads that are applied away from the shear centre. Hence they are often subjected to combined bending and torsion actions. Previous researches on LSBs have concentrated on their <b>bending</b> or shear <b>behaviour</b> and strengths, and only limited research has been undertaken on their combined <b>bending</b> and torsion <b>behaviour.</b> Therefore in this research a series of nine experiments was first conducted on LSBs subject to combined bending and torsion. Three LSB sections were tested to failure under eccentric loading at mid-span, and appropriate results were obtained from seven tests. A special test rig was used to simulate two different eccentricities and to provide accurate simple boundary conditions at the supports. Finite element models of tested LSBs were developed using ANSYS, and the ultimate strengths, failure modes, and load–displacement curves were obtained and compared with corresponding test results. Finite element analyses agreed well with test results and hence the developed models were used in a parametric study to investigate the effects of load locations, eccentricities, and spans on the combined <b>bending</b> and torsion <b>behaviour</b> of LSBs. The interaction between the ultimate bending and torsional moment capacities was studied and a simple design rule was proposed.

Typical experiment involved one row of two bolts pulled out of concrete-filled SHS.

This deformation is recorded as force-displacement relationship which is commonly used to represent the structural behaviour of similar components, and typically defined by initial stiffness, yield force and post yield stiffness. Across the range considered in this investigation, it was found that varying the bolt gauge to SHS width ratio have a significant effect on the concrete-filled SHS face in bending component.

The finite element simulation results appear to give reasonable estimates for encased liner buckling pressure tests. This work shows that further analytical, field, and/or laboratory studies and finite element analyses are required. This work also describes the numerical modeling of the axial compression and <b>bending</b> <b>behaviours</b> of segmented pipe joints using the finite element method. The results of published full-scale tests by others (Bouabid, 1993 and Singhal, 1984) of unrestrained joints for typical rigid pipes {{were used to}} validate and calibrate the finite element models. The research develops a tool to use numerical simulation results of joint behaviour for seismic analysis of buried segmented pipeline networks subjected to axial and transverse permanent ground deformations. These numerical simulation models are verified using the available analytical and numerical models for longitudinal permanent ground deformation (Selventhiran, 2002) and transverse permanent ground deformation (Liu and OÆRourke, 1997). Further, the current study develops a tool to use numerical simulation results of joint behaviour for seismic analysis of buried segmented pipeline networks including axial and transverse permanent ground deformation investigations. Failure analysis of the segmented pipeline is achieved {{in order to determine}} the potential of the pipeline joints for damage and failure under seismic effects. Finally, this work also explores the numerical modeling of delamination of rehabilitated segmented buried pipelines using a cured-in-place technique.

Earth Surface Processes and Landforms, 35 (13), 1601 - 1614. This paper analyses types and rates of change in river meander morphology and the links between mechanisms of change and emergent behaviour of planform morphology. It uses evidence of four dates of aerial photography combined with annual field mapping and ground photography to examine the morphological changes and mechanisms of change {{in a series of}} bends on an active meandering river, the River Dane in NW England, over a 25 year period. This unique data set allows insight into the spatial and temporal variability of bank line movement and component processes. Bank lines were mapped photogrametrically from air photos of 1984, 1996, 2001 and 2007 and the digitised courses compared in ArcGIS to produce calculations of erosional and depositional areas and rates. Most bends exhibit morphological change that largely follows the autogenic sequence, identified in qualitative models of meander development, from low sinuosity curves through simple symmetric and asymmetric bends to compound forms with lobe development in the apex region. Rates of erosion and bankline movement increase through this sequence until the compound phase. Relationships of amounts of movement to various curvature measures of bend morphology are complex. Several new loops, distinct from compound <b>bend</b> <b>behaviour,</b> have developed during the study period in formerly straight sections. Mechanisms of morphological change are illustrated for four types of bends: new, rapid growth bend; sharp-angled bend with mid-channel bar development; symmetric migrating bend; and simple to compound bend development. The changes take place in phases that are not simply related to discharge but to inherent sequences and feedbacks in development of bars and bend morphology and timescales for these are identified. Overall, emergent behaviour of systematic planform change, moderated by channel confinement and boundary features, is produced from spatially and temporally varied channel processes.

The subsea structures, components and pipelines have to stand such high external hydrostatic pressure which becomes in some cases the governing design criteria rather than the well pressure and temperature. This study focuses on pipe induction bends, which is a vital element in any ultra deep water subsea system. Bends are mainly used in the tie-in spools to connect pipeline end structures to manifolds or to well head trees. A significant amount of work has been conducted to study the <b>behaviour</b> of pipe <b>bends</b> under internal pressure in the last 150 years for its widely used applications in power plants, processing facilities and generic industrial use, however, minimal work has been conducted for pipe bends under external pressure for its rare applications.

As a result of the lack of knowledge and experimental work in this area, codes and standards have either considered it as a piping component or recommended quite stringent design criteria that more fits shallow water applications but is almost impossible to comply with deep water applications.
