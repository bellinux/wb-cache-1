5|$|Paralytic {{shellfish}} poisoning (PSP) {{is primarily}} {{caused by the}} consumption of bivalves that have accumulated toxins by feeding on toxic dinoflagellates, single-celled protists found naturally in the sea and inland waters. Saxitoxin is the most virulent of these. In mild cases, PSP causes tingling, numbness, sickness and diarrhoea. In more severe cases, {{the muscles of the}} chest wall may be affected leading to paralysis and even death. In 1937, researchers in California established the connection between blooms of these phytoplankton and PSP. The <b>biotoxin</b> remains potent even when the shellfish are well-cooked. In the United States, there is a regulatory limit of 80µg/g of saxitoxin equivalent in shellfish meat.|$|E

40|$|Marine <b>biotoxins</b> {{are mostly}} {{produced}} by phytoplankton. Proliferation of algae producing marine <b>biotoxins,</b> {{also known as}} harmful algal bloom (HAB), occurs worldwide. Such event depends on environmental conditions, including temperature, water pH/salinity, current patterns and anthropogenic nutrient input. Marine <b>biotoxins</b> can accumulate in seafood products and as such present a threat to consumers. This paper reviews and compiles up-to-date literature on reported human intoxications following exposure to marine <b>biotoxins</b> through seafood consumption. The review includes a discussion about prevention of such outbreaks and surveillance programs to identify possible limitations and approaches for limiting the impact of HABs on human health. It is concluded that marine <b>biotoxins</b> represent a threat to human health as thousands of poisonings following consumption of seafood contaminated with marine <b>biotoxins</b> were reported in the 21 st century, emphasizing the need for carrying on/developing surveillance programs to detect the presence of HABs, and for development, validation and implementation of sensitive high-throughput methods for detecting these <b>biotoxins</b> in seafood to protect consumers.

40|$|Marine <b>biotoxins</b> can {{accumulate}} in fish and shellfish, representing a possible threat for consumers. Many marine <b>biotoxins</b> affect neuronal function essentially through their interaction with ion channels or receptors, leading to different symptoms including paralysis and even death. The detection of marine <b>biotoxins</b> in seafood products {{is therefore a}} priority. Official methods for control are often still using in vivo assays, such as the mouse bioassay. This test is considered unethical {{and the development of}} alternative assays is urgently required. Chemical analyses as well as in vitro assays have been developed to detect marine <b>biotoxins</b> in seafood. However, most of the current in vitro alternatives to animal testing present disadvantages: low throughput and lack of sensitivity resulting in a high number of false-negative results. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new in vitro tests that would allow the detection of marine <b>biotoxins</b> in seafood products at a low cost, with high throughput combined with high sensitivity, reproducibility, and predictivity. Mode of action based in vitro bioassays may provide tools that fulfil these requirements. This review covers {{the current state of the}} art of such mode of action based alternative assays to detect neurotoxic marine <b>biotoxins</b> in seafood...|$|R
2500|$|In early 2009, Elizabeth is {{poisoned}} by a <b>biotoxin</b> and Lucky stays by her bedside. He is upset {{to learn in}} June that Ethan Lovett (Nathan Parsons) is his half brother. When Lucky dates Rebecca Shaw (Natalia Livingston), Nikolas kisses Elizabeth to make them jealous, prompting Lucky and Elizabeth to get back together. Elizabeth is attracted to Nikolas, and sleeps with him the night she accepts Lucky's proposal. Meanwhile, Lucky (reprised by Jackson) works with Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) to investigate Franco (James Franco). In early 2010, Lucky finds Nikolas and Elizabeth having sex and eventually berates them. They learn she is pregnant, and Helena Cassadine changes the DNA test to show Nikolas as the father. In July, Elizabeth gives birth to Aiden, who is kidnapped by Franco until Lucky finds him. Lucky is approached by Interpol to pose as Irish hitman Ronan O'Reilly and identify [...] "The Balkan" [...] (Daniel Benzali). Lucky brings Siobhan McKenna (Erin Chambers) home for safety, and asks {{her to marry him}} so she can get a green card. In March 2011, Elizabeth finds out Lucky is Aiden's father, but keeps it a secret after Jake is killed in a hit-and-run accident. Lucky helps convince Elizabeth to donate Jake's kidney to Josslyn Jacks. He finds out Luke hit Jake and accuses him of drunk driving, staging an unsuccessful intervention. Lucky burns down the old Spencer house, accidentally injuring Siobhan. To stop him from drinking, Elizabeth tells Lucky that Aiden is his son. Nikolas briefly plans to take Aiden out of the country before returning him and leaving town. Lucky volunteers for an undercover drug case during which Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) has him injected with drugs. Elizabeth finds Lucky but gets in a car accident that puts Siobhan in the hospital on her way to get him medication. Anthony kills Siobhan and Lucky uses pills when he finds her dead. He struggles to overcome his addiction. Elizabeth tries to reconcile but Lucky goes to Ireland. He receives a mysterious message that Aiden is hurt just in time to get him to the hospital. Elizabeth fakes a breakdown to get Lucky's attention, and when Lucky finds out the truth he goes back to Ireland. He recognizes someone, later revealed to be his mother Laura.

40|$|Harmful algal blooms {{are natural}} {{phenomena}} {{caused by the}} massive growth of phytoplankton that may contain highly toxic chemicals, the so-called marine <b>biotoxins</b> causing illness and even death to both aquatic organisms and humans. Their occurrence has been increased in frequency and severity, suggesting a worldwide public health risk. Marine <b>biotoxins</b> can accumulate in bivalve molluscs and regulatory limits have been set for some classes according to European Union legislation. These compounds can be distinguished in water- and fat-soluble molecules. The first group involves those of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, whereas the toxins soluble in fat can cause Diarrheic Shellfish Poisoning and Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning. Due {{to the lack of}} long-term toxicity studies, establishing tolerable daily intakes for any of these marine <b>biotoxins</b> was not possible, but an acute reference dose can be considered more appropriate, because these molecules show an acute toxicity. Dietary exposure assessment is linked both to the levels of marine <b>biotoxins</b> present in bivalve molluscs and the portion that could be eaten by consumers. Symptoms may vary from a severe gastrointestinal intoxication with diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps to neurological disorders such as ataxia, dizziness, partial paralysis, and respiratory distress. The official method for the detection of marine <b>biotoxins</b> is the mouse bioassay (MBA) showing some limits due to ethical restrictions and insufficient specificity. For this reason, the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method has replaced MBA as the reference technique. However, the monitoring of algal blooms producing marine <b>biotoxins</b> should be regularly assessed in order to obtain more reliable, accurate estimates of bloom toxicity and their potential impacts...|$|R

Rietjens Marine <b>biotoxins</b> are naturally occurring compounds produced by particular phytoplankton species. These toxins often accumulate in seafood and thereby represent a threat to consumers. Regulatory limits have been set for lipophilic marine <b>biotoxins</b> (diarrhetic shellfish poisons (DSPs) and azaspiracids (AZPs)) and for most marine neurotoxins (amnesic (domoic acid (DA)), neurotoxic (NSPs), and paralytic shellfish poisons (PSPs)) and the detection of these <b>biotoxins</b> in seafood still heavily relies on the mouse bioassay (MBA). However, the MBA is forbidden since the 1 st of January 2015, except for the periodic control of production areas, {{especially with regard to}} the detection of unknown marine <b>biotoxins.</b> Although analytical methods are sensitive to many marine <b>biotoxins</b> and allow for their identification and quantification, their use still presents several major drawbacks (chapter 3). They do not allow the detection of unknown toxins for example and are quite expensive to be used as routine screening methods. Therefore, a screening assay that allows the broad detection of known and unknown marine <b>biotoxins</b> with great sensitivity at affordable costs is highly needed. Mode of action cell-based assays offer these possibilities. This thesis describes a wide variety of innovative {{mode of action}} based assays {{that could be used for}} screening purposes and proposes an integrated testing strategy suitable for the current needs in terms of food safety associated with seafood consumption. In addition, the assays developed are in line with the 3 R paradigm of Russel and Burch and therefore comply with the current European Regulation for the replacement of animal experiments in the field of marine neurotoxins detection in seafood...|$|R
40|$|The aquatic {{world is}} {{renowned for its}} enchanting beauty. In some cases, however, hidden perils may lurk behind the {{alluring}} beauty, and even some mortal dangers. An analysis of {{the map of the}} hydrosphere shows that the central hub for potentially harmful aquatic animals is the great area of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, although aquatic animals and vegetables of less aggressive type are present in all the seas. Of the two types of offense and defense mechanisms possessed by many marine fauna, namely physical and chemical, study of the latter has always been a fascinating sector of marine biology, still to some extent veiled in an aura of mystery. Many animal and vegetable species are equipped with <b>biotoxins,</b> organic products that can be poisonous (harmful when eaten) or venomous (harmful when they enter the bloodstream), and have various different actions and variable pathogenic intensities. These <b>biotoxins</b> can be actively produced, or else derive from the aquatic environment for various reasons.

40|$|A {{multiplex}} surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor {{method for}} the detection of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins, okadaic acid (and analogues) and domoic acid was developed. This method was compared to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Seawater samples (n = 256) from around Europe were collected by the consortia of an EU project MIcroarrays for the Detection of Toxic Algae (MIDTAL) and evaluated using each method. A simple sample preparation procedure was developed which involved lysing and releasing the toxins from the algal cells with glass beads followed by centrifugation and filtering the extract before testing for marine <b>biotoxins</b> by both multi-SPR and ELISA. Method detection limits based on IC 20 values for PSP, okadaic acid and domoic acid toxins were 0. 82, 0. 36 and 1. 66 ng/ml, respectively, for the prototype multiplex SPR biosensor. Evaluation by SPR for seawater samples has shown that 47, 59 and 61 % of total seawater samples tested positive (result greater than the IC 20) for PSP, okadaic acid (and analogues) and domoic acid toxins, respectively. Toxic samples were received mainly from Spain and Ireland. This work has demonstrated the potential of multiplex analysis for marine <b>biotoxins</b> in algal and seawater samples with results available for 24 samples within a 7 h period for three groups of key marine <b>biotoxins.</b> Multiplex immunological methods could therefore be used as early warning monitoring tools for a variety of marine <b>biotoxins</b> in seawater samples...|$|R
