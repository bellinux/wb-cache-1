5|$|By {{the end of}} February, Bothwell was {{generally}} believed to <b>be</b> <b>guilty</b> of Darnley's assassination. Lennox, Darnley's father, demanded that Bothwell be tried before the Estates of Parliament, to which Mary agreed, but Lennox's request for a delay to gather evidence was denied. In the absence of Lennox, and with no evidence presented, Bothwell was acquitted after a seven-hour trial on 12 April. A week later, Bothwell managed to convince {{more than two dozen}} lords and bishops to sign the Ainslie Tavern Bond, in which they agreed to support his aim to marry the queen.|$|E
5|$|Coakley {{summed up}} his {{prosecution}} case on September 22. His {{aim was to}} show the court that a conspiracy had taken placethe mass of accounts from officers and men appeared to support the conclusion that ringleaders and agitators had forced a rebellion against authority. Veltmann pointed out that few of the accused had been ordered to load ammunition, meaning {{that they could not}} all <b>be</b> <b>guilty</b> of the charge of disobeying orders. Veltmann stressed that much of the testimony was hearsay and failed to establish a conspiracy or a mutiny. The court, however, seemed to side with Coakley on all points, settling each objection in favor of the prosecution.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{sentences}} like Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty,</b> if Haldeman <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> too, first discussed by Soames (1982) and Karttunen and Peters (1979), which raise three problems. First, they are felicitous {{and do not}} appear to have presuppositions. However all major theories of presuppositions predict that they should presuppose what the antecedent presupposes (e. g., the sentence above should presuppose that Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty).</b> Second, there <b>is</b> a contrast between these sentences and the corresponding sentence-initial conditionals like if Haldeman <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> too, Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty.</b> Finally, a way to solve the problem would be to locally accommodate the presupposition in the antecedent. However, this wrongly predicts tautological truth-conditions. In the case above, the predicted meaning could be paraphrased as “Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty,</b> if both Haldeman and Nixon <b>are</b> <b>guilty.</b> ” As a solution to these three problems, I propose that the presupposition is nonetheless locally accommodated in the antecedent and furthermore that the sentence is also interpreted exhaustively, which gives rise to a non-presuppositional and non-tautological meaning analogous to Nixon <b>is</b> <b>guilty,</b> only if both Haldeman and Nixon <b>are</b> <b>guilty.</b> Furthermore, I argue that the degraded status of the sentence-initial case is an independent fact rooted in the topic-focus structure of sentence-final conditionals. Finally, the present proposal can also be extended to treat related non-presuppositional cases like I will go, if we go together. 32 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Also {{during the}} first session of the Tenth Congress, Rowan {{proposed}} that a congressional committee be formed to investigate accusations against General James Wilkinson that, in 1788, he took money from the government of Spain in exchange for efforts to separate Kentucky from Virginia and unite it with Spain rather than the United States. Aaron Burr {{had been accused of}} working with Wilkinson in the so-called Spanish Conspiracy, and when Burr had approached Rowan in 1806 to solicit his services in defending Burr against the charges, Rowan had declined because he believed Burr to <b>be</b> <b>guilty.</b> Rowan's proposal to form an investigative committee against Wilkinson failed, but he succeeded in gaining approval for a committee to investigate federal judge Harry Innes' purported role in the Conspiracy. Rowan was appointed to the committee and delivered its report April 19, 1808; the report stated that the committee could find no evidence of wrongdoing by Innes.|$|E
5|$|John Koller {{explains}} {{the role of}} intent in Jainism with {{the example of a}} monk, who unknowingly offered poisoned food to his brethren. According to the Jain view, the monk is guilty of a violent act if the other monks die because they eat the poisoned food; but according to the Buddhist view he would not <b>be</b> <b>guilty.</b> The crucial difference between the two views is that the Buddhist view excuses the act, categorising it as non-intentional, since he was not aware that the food was poisoned; whereas the Jain view holds the monk to have been responsible, due to his ignorance and carelessness. Jains argue that the monk's very ignorance and carelessness constitute an intent to do violence and hence entail his guilt. So the absence of intent does not absolve a person from the karmic consequences of guilt either, according to the Jain analysis.|$|E
5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} {{is the black}} market. FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would <b>be</b> <b>guilty</b> of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E
50|$|The court further distinguishes {{that if a}} {{defendant}} intends to kill a target and also kills others in the kill zone, then they <b>are</b> <b>guilty</b> {{of the murder of}} each person killed, i.e., <b>is</b> <b>guilty</b> of multiple counts of murder. However, if the defendant by the same act fails to kill anyone, defendant <b>is</b> only <b>guilty</b> of a single count of attempted murder by the act.|$|R
50|$|The divorce law is fault-based. The court rules ex-officio {{on who is}} {{at fault}} for the divorce, unless the spouses request otherwise. The court may rule that one spouse <b>is</b> <b>guilty,</b> that both spouses <b>are</b> <b>guilty,</b> or that neither spouse <b>is</b> <b>guilty.</b> <b>Being</b> solely at fault has two ramifications: firstly, the sole <b>guilty</b> party cannot <b>be</b> granted a divorce {{without the consent of}} the {{innocent}} spouse (unless the innocent spouse withholds consent for reasons contrary to social norms); and secondly, the <b>guilty</b> party can <b>be</b> ordered to pay alimony (Article 57 (1) and 57 (2) of the Polish Family and Guardianship Code).|$|R

5|$|These three works {{which we}} have {{composed}} we desire should be put in their hands in royal cities {{as well as in}} the most fair city of Berytus, which may well be styled the nursing mother of law, as indeed previous Emperors have commanded, but in no other places which did not enjoy the same privilege in old times, as we have heard that even in the brilliant city of Alexandria, and in Caesarea and others, there have been ignorant men who, instead of doing their duty, conveyed spurious lessons to their pupils, and such as these we desire to make desist from that attempt by laying down the above limits, so that, if they should hereafter <b>be</b> <b>guilty</b> of such conduct and carry on their duties outside the royal cities and the metropolis Berytus, they may be punished by a fine of ten pounds of gold and be expelled from the city in which instead of teaching the law they transgress the law.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may <b>be</b> <b>guilty</b> if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause the driver to swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E
5|$|To {{cope with}} the ongoing war situation, Charles had {{introduced}} martial law to large swathes of the country; he extended this during 1626 and 1627, as the financial constraints imposed by Parliament began to cut into pay, leading to soldiers rioting. Under {{the law of the}} time, martial law was declared by the local military commander, at which point a group of Commissioners would be empowered to decide on the facts of offences, before passing the case to the commander, who would pass judgment. In practice, things worked completely differently. In Dover, the forces were commanded by Lord Conway, who declared martial law. Not only were commissioners authorised to decide on the facts, they were also permitted to authorise summary judgments, including the execution of people they deemed to <b>be</b> <b>guilty.</b> In addition, the commissioners were given the power not only to resolve billeting disputes between soldiers and civilians, but to order civilians to provide quarters for the troops. A later declaration of martial law in Portsmouth extended the commission's remit yet again, allowing for civilians to be tried under martial law and, if necessary, sentenced to death. Even this did not solve the problems, as soldiers would often wander outside the jurisdiction of the commissioners; to deal with this, February 1627 saw a Provost Marshal introduced to each county, bringing the entire nation under martial law.|$|E
