40|$|Waterfowl (Anseriformes) {{generally}} have high energetic costs for reproduction because they lay large, energy-rich eggs. Consequently, many temperate nesting ducks (Anatinae) occupy seasonally productive environments to meet nutritional requirements for egg production.

This {{study was conducted}} to investigate nutritional aspects of reproduction in female <b>Buffleheads</b> (Bucephala albeola) and Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica) breeding in central British Columbia.;Diet composition of breeding female <b>Buffleheads</b> and Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneyes, which consisted primarily of benthic insects, was similar, providing support for the food defense hypothesis as an explanation for evolution of fixed space territorially in the genus Bucephala.;Mean egg laying interval (dollar±dollarSE) for <b>Buffleheads</b> was 48. 36 dollar±dollar 2. 35 hr. which was similar to that of Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneyes that laid, on average, every 45. 32 dollar±dollar 1. 40 hr.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Although {{numbers of}} <b>buffleheads</b> (Bucephala albeola), common goldeneyes (Bucephala clangula) and long-tailed ducks (Clangula hyemalis) over-wintering on Lake Ontario have {{increased}} sub-stantially {{over the past}} two decades, factors influencing habitat use and the potential for competition have not been investigated. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between prey availability and community structure of diving ducks during winter on northeastern Lake Ontario. Ben-thic and nektonic samples collected during fall, winter, and spring 2002 – 2004 indicated that macroinver-tebrate numbers differed by location but generally did not decline throughout winter. Large accumula-tions of macroinvertebrates, apparently moved by wave action and currents, were documented in nearshore areas. Surveys showed that diving ducks congregated in mixed species flocks within areas of higher food abundance. Mixed species flocks were common in nearshore areas, likely because energy-dense foods (Amphipoda and Chironomidae) were abundant in the narrow zone of shallow water, close to shore. Although macroinvertebrate numbers likely affected habitat use by diving ducks, birds did not greatly reduce abundance of macroinvertebrates. It is unlikely that exploitative competition was occur-ring and interference competition appeared below threshold levels that would cause species to spatially segregate. Overall, our results suggest that food availability is not a limiting factor for <b>buffleheads,</b> com-mon goldeneyes, or long-tailed ducks wintering on northeastern Lake Ontario...|$|R
