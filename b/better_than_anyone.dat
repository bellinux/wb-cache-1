25|$|For {{the first}} time since 1936-37 the Ashes were in dispute in the final Test of a series in Australia. Unfortunately the Fifth Test was to be played on the lifeless wicket at Sydney, though critics later pointed out that Norm O'Neill was able to play strokes, and that Neil Harvey, Ted Dexter and even Ken Barrington were able to play strokes on {{similarly}} lifeless wickets before in the series. Mindful of the Third Test three spinners were selected for the England team for {{the first time}} in an Ashes Test; Fred Titmus, Ray Illingworth and David Allen, along with Ken Barrington as a part-time leg-spinner. However, the opener Geoff Pullar was dropped due to an injured knee and Illingworth was brought in as a batsman more than a spinner and he bowled only 15 overs in the match and opened the second innings. Allen was distrusted by Dexter for all that he had been was England's first choice spinner and would take himself to the top of the England bowling averages as a result of this final Test. In any case it appeared that Dexter intended to catch Australia on a spinning wicket, especially if he batted first and caught them on the last day. Richie Benaud was the New South Wales captain and knew the Sydney Cricket Ground <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone,</b> but his bowling options were limited. Alan Davidson had recovered from his thigh strain and Garth McKenzie was showing great promise, but the medium-fast seam bowler Neil Hawke was brought in to give them support and rest Davidson. Ken Mackay was dropped in his favour, which weakened the Australian batting, but they still had nine first-class centurions. This left Benaud as Australia's sole specialist spinner, with help from Bobby Simpson and perhaps Norm O'Neill. Peter Burge had made 163, 34 not out, 33 and 54 not out for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield and was brought back into the team at the expense of Barry Shepherd. Dexter won the toss for the second time at Sydney, which hadn't helped him in the Third Test, and decided to bat.|$|E

When casting Lilly Kane, who would only appear from time-to-time as [...] "the dead girl", Thomas did not receive the same standard of actors. Thomas said that he had [...] "never had a more cut and dry audition" [...] than he did with Seyfried. He said that she was [...] "about 100 times <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else that we saw, she was just spectacular". He continued by saying that she ended up being so good in the series that he used her three or four more times than he initially planned.|$|E

Rick Millikan, the show's casting director, eventually settled on Scott Wilson {{for the role of}} Orison believing that he could pull off the [...] "dual nature" [...] of the character <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else. The episode featured several complex scenes, most notably the shot at the beginning, where time slows to a stop. Bowman used several different takes, all filmed at different film speeds in order to achieve the right effect. The final fight scene between Scully and Pfaster took {{a day and a half}} to film. Many of the episodes scenes were filmed in Downey, California. Make-up for the episode was done by John Vulich, who sought to [...] "pay homage" [...] to the make-up in the original episode.

Dee Dee would continue, however, to count off each song's tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of [...] "1-2-3-4!" [...] Joey soon similarly realized that he could not sing and play drums simultaneously and left the position of drummer. While auditioning prospective replacements, Erdelyi would often take to the drums and demonstrate how to play the songs.

In December 1982, Griffin named White as Stafford's successor, saying that he felt she was capable of activating the puzzle board letters (which is the primary role of the Wheel hostess) <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else who had auditioned.

500|$|According to {{contemporary}} sportswriter Grantland Rice, only two sports {{figures of the}} 1920s approached Ruth in popularity—boxer Jack Dempsey and racehorse Man o' War. One {{of the factors that}} contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life. Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do something <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> else in the world. Montville noted that [...] "the fog [...] will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility." [...] Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters. Reisler noted that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as Mark McGwire and Barry Bonds, generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch.|$|E

Anders praised Bleach's portrayal of Davros for capturing [...] "the character's mixture of curiosity, manipulativeness and mania <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> since [...] Michael Wisher".

[...] Josh Tyrangiel from Time magazine commented that [...] "In dance music, words exist to be repeated, twisted, obscured and resurrected. How they sound in the moment {{is far more important}} than what they mean, and Madonna knows that <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone.</b> Confessions on a Dance Floor is 56 minutes of energetic moments.

500|$|Most of the {{cartoons}} Barbera and Hanna created revolved around close friendship or partnership; this theme is evident with Fred and Barney, Tom and Jerry, Scooby and Shaggy, The Jetson family and Yogi & Boo-Boo. These {{may have been}} a reflection of the close business friendship and partnership that Barbera and Hanna [...] shared for over 60 years. Professionally, they balanced each other's strengths and weaknesses very well, but Barbera and Hanna travelled in completely different social circles. Hanna's circle of personal friends primarily included other animators; Barbera socialized with Hollywood celebrities—Zsa Zsa Gabor was a frequent visitor to his house. Their division of work roles complemented each other but they rarely talked outside of work since Hanna was interested in the outdoors and Barbera liked beaches and good food and drink. Nevertheless, in their long partnership, in which they worked with over 2000 animated characters, Barbera and Hanna rarely exchanged a cross word. Barbera said: [...] "We understood each other perfectly, and each of us had deep respect for the other's work."

[...] The purpose of the seminars, attended by educational experts and the new show's writers and producers, was to ascertain which school-preparation skills to emphasize. [...] According to writer Michael Davis, Lesser's skills at encouraging collegiality were evident during the seminars. [...] Writer Louise Gikow reported that the real friction occurred between the educators present. [...] As Sesame Street songwriter Christopher Cerf reported, [...] "... ran meetings <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>anyone</b> I've ever seen.

[...] Davis noted that the seminars also served as a [...] "crash course in child development, psychology, and preschool education" [...] for the show's producers and writers. [...] According to researcher Robert W. Morrow, Lesser understood that in order to bring research about child development into the production process of Sesame Street, a close working relationship had to be created between the researchers and the producers. [...] Davis credited Lesser's [...] "informal, unpretentious, and collaborative" [...] manner with the creation of that close relationship.|$|E
