40|$|As die {{sizes are}} shrinking, and circuit {{complexities}} are increasing, the PCB routing problem {{becomes more and}} more challenging. Traditional routing algorithms can not handle these challenges effectively, and many high end designs in the industry require manual routing efforts. In this paper, we propose novel routing algorithms that can handle these new challenges effectively. The first algorithm we propose is a Lagrangian relaxation based length matching algorithm for routing high-speed <b>bus</b> <b>structures.</b> Then, we focus on a more restricted yet common problem: routing highspeed <b>bus</b> <b>structures</b> between two components across a channel. For this problem, we propose an algorithm to route nets on x-y layer pairs. However, for some board designs, buried vias are forbidden due to high manufacturing costs. For these types of designs, we propose a routing algorithm that can route nets within tight minimum and maximum length bounds on a single layer. After that, we propose an escape routing and layer assignment algorithm that finds the routing solution within multiple components simultaneously...|$|R

50|$|The 16-bit ISA bus {{was also}} used with 32-bit {{processors}} for several years. An attempt to extend it to 32 bits, called Extended Industry Standard Architecture (EISA), was not very successful, however. Later buses such as VESA Local Bus and PCI were used instead, often along with ISA slots on the same mainboard. Derivatives of the AT <b>bus</b> <b>structure</b> were and still are used in ATA/IDE, the PCMCIA standard, Compact Flash, the PC/104 bus, and internally within Super I/O chips.|$|E

40|$|Improvement {{of vehicle}} {{stability}} and crashworthiness to reduce rollover {{and to provide}} increased occupant protection {{in the event of}} rollover requires that the effects of design parameters on vehicle rollover propensity are thoroughly understood. Improvement of rollover characteristics of buses currently requires extensive experimentation and considerable resources associated with rollover destruction of experimental <b>bus</b> <b>structures.</b> There is an unmet need for a more efficient developmental process which would incorporate computer modelling and simulation. This article presents an alternative research approach based on experimental and analytical modal analysis of the <b>bus</b> roll-cage <b>structure.</b> Modal analysis is used to identify the dynamic characteristics of the structure and to tailor those characteristics in order to increase the overall rollover stability of the bus and its rollover strength while minimising the deformation of the internal residual space. Full-scale tests have been carried out on a standard roll-cage structure which has been designed and manufactured to suit typical two-axle single-deck bus constructions used for route, school or charter bus services...|$|R
