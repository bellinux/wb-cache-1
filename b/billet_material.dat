40|$|Direct chill (DC) casting of high {{strength}} 7 xxx series aluminium alloys is difficult mainly due to solidification cracking (hot cracks) and solid state cracking (cold cracks). Poor thermal properties along with extreme brittleness in the as-cast condition make DC-casting of such alloys a challenging process. Therefore, a criterion that can predict the catastrophic failure and cold cracking of the ingots {{would be highly}} beneficial to the aluminium industry. The already established criteria {{are dealing with the}} maximum principal stress component in the ingot and the plane strain fracture toughness (KIc) of the alloy under discussion.

40|$|Purpose: Seam welds {{occur during}} the hollow profile extrusion; the <b>billet’s</b> <b>material</b> {{is divided into}} {{separate}} metal streams by the bridges of the die which support a mandrel, and then these metal streams are welded in welding chamber behind the bridges. When the desired conditions have not been provided, the required quality in seam welds may not occur. One of the possible reasons for this situation is a poor metal feed. In this study, an insufficient pressure problem occurring in seam welds on an aluminum extrusion profile section is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The study was realized on a hollow extrusion profile type which has seam weld zones. The experimental profile was produced by a real extrusion press which has a capacity of 1460 tones. Findings: The poor metal feed occurring on specimen is shown by microstructural pictures. Microstructure of the main region has a homogenous appearance. In the microstructure, containing seam weld region, only a slight change was observed in seam weld region. However, {{there was no significant}} change in near of seam weld regions. This points out that there has been no metallurgical problem. Therefore, the problem is an insufficient pressure problem and this caused poor metal feeding. In the other hand, micro hardness tests are realized on seam weld region, main region and defective region’s surround of specimen’s section. After the micro hardness tests important differences are shown among these regions’ strength. Hardness values of seam weld region were lower than the main material’s hardness values, but higher than the defective region’s. Practical implications: In application, seam welds occur on hollow profiles produced by aluminum extrusion.

5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{disadvantages}} to the gas atomisation spray forming process. The most significant disadvantage is the relatively low process yield with typical losses of ~30%. Losses occur because of overspray (droplets missing the emerging <b>billet),</b> splashing of <b>material</b> from the <b>billet</b> surface, and <b>material</b> ‘bouncing’ off the semi-solid top surface. Many operators of the spray forming process now use a particle injector system to re-inject the overspray powder, and thus recycle material {{that would otherwise be}} lost, or sell the overspray powder as a product in its own right. The second major disadvantage is one of process control. As it is essentially a free-forming process with many interdependent variables, it has proved difficult to predict the shape, porosity or deposition rate for a given alloy. Much of the control is based on operator experience and empirical relationships. It is partly the process complexity and lack of robust process control that has prevented the widespread commercialisation of this process. Some developments using feed-back control have proved successful in improving the variations in billet diameter and improving yield in specific systems but these have yet to find widespread implementation.|$|R
