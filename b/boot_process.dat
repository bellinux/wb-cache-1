5|$|In PowerPC-based Macintoshes, the <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> {{starts with}} the {{activation}} of BootROM, the basic Macintosh ROM, which performs a Power On Self Test to test hardware essential to startup. On the passing of this test, the startup chime is played {{and control of the}} computer is passed to OpenFirmware. OpenFirmware initializes the Random Access Memory, Memory Management Unit and hardware necessary for the ROM's operation. The OpenFirmware then checks settings, stored in NVRAM, and builds a list of all devices on a device tree by gathering their stored FCode information.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
25|$|The {{firmware}} {{contributes to}} fast boot time by not probing for hardware, such as floppy disk drives, {{that are no}} longer common on computers, especially netbooks. The firmware also contributes to security by verifying each step in the <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> and incorporating system recovery.|$|E
5000|$|The 1100/60 {{introduced}} a new feature to the line: the CPUs used microcode that was loaded during the <b>booting</b> <b>process.</b> The <b>booting</b> <b>process</b> was controlled by a microcomputer (called the [...] "SSP" [...] - [...] "System Support Processor") that ran from 8-inch floppy disks. The microcode was stored on these disks.|$|R
50|$|LEAF's origins lie in Debian Sarge, {{though many}} <b>boot</b> <b>processes</b> and daemon control {{mechanisms}} have been modified heavily.|$|R

25|$|Windows 9x {{used the}} DOS <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> to launch into {{protected}} mode. Basic features {{related to the}} file system, such as long file names, were only available to DOS when running as a subsystem of Windows. Windows NT runs independently of DOS but includes NTVDM, a component for simulating a DOS environment for legacy applications.|$|E
25|$|A stored-program {{computer}} {{requires an}} initial computer program stored in its read-only memory to boot. The <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> {{is to identify}} and initialize {{all aspects of the}} system, from processor registers to device controllers to memory contents. Following the initialization process, this initial computer program loads the operating system and sets the program counter to begin normal operations.|$|E
25|$|ReadyBoot uses an in-RAM cache to {{optimize}} the <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> if the system has 700MB or more memory. The size of the cache depends on the total RAM available, but {{is large enough to}} create a reasonable cache and yet allow the system the memory it needs to boot smoothly. ReadyBoot uses the same ReadyBoost service.|$|E
50|$|Linux startup {{process is}} the {{multi-stage}} initialization <b>process</b> performed during <b>booting</b> a Linux installation. It {{is in many ways}} similar to the BSD and other Unix-style <b>boot</b> <b>processes,</b> from which it derives.|$|R
50|$|The {{bootstrap}} loader takes the {{control over the}} <b>booting</b> <b>process</b> and loads NTLDR.Ntdetect.com is invoked by NTLDR, and returns the information it gathers to NTLDR when finished, {{so that it can}} then be passed on to ntoskrnl.exe, the Windows NT kernel.|$|R
30|$|The TPM was {{initially}} {{used as the}} static root of trust for measurement (SRTM) (Trusted Computing Group 2003). SRTM utilizes the TPM to verify the integrity of <b>booting</b> <b>processes.</b> If a chain of trust is established during a <b>booting</b> <b>process,</b> the boundary of trust can be extended to include more than one level of software within the system. To set the system into a clean state without rebooting, researchers propose dynamic root of trust for measurement (DRTM). Two DRTM implementations are as follows. Intel develops the Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) (Intel Corporation 2006) to securely launch software (such as the hypervisor and security kernel) at arbitrary time. AMD offers similar capabilities with its Secure Virtual Machine (SVM) extensions.|$|R
25|$|Each Nintendo 64 Game Pak {{contains}} a lockout chip (conceptually {{similar to the}} 10NES) to prevent manufacturers from creating unauthorized copies of games and discourage production of unlicensed games. Unlike previous versions, the N64 lockout chip {{contains a}} seed value {{which is used to}} calculate a checksum of the game's boot code. To discourage playing of copied games by piggybacking on a real Game Pak, Nintendo produced five different versions of the chip. During the <b>boot</b> <b>process,</b> and occasionally while the game is running, the N64 computes the checksum of the boot code and verifies it with the lockout chip in the Game Pak, failing to boot if the check fails.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of computer networks, {{there has been a}} persistent need for client systems which can boot appropriate software images, with appropriate configuration parameters, both retrieved at boot time from one or more network servers. This goal requires a client to use a set of pre-boot services, based on industry standard network protocols. Additionally, the Network Bootstrap Program (NBP) which is initially downloaded and run must be built using a client firmware layer (at the device to be bootstrapped via PXE) providing a hardware independent standardized way to interact with the surrounding network booting environment. In this case the availability and subjection to standards are a key factor required to guarantee the network <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> system interoperability.|$|E
500|$|The <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> starts {{by running}} code stored in secured UEFI Boot ROM (first stage). [...] Boot ROM has two primary {{responsibilities}} performed by its components: to initialize system hardware (POST component) and to select an operating system to run (UEFI component).|$|E
5000|$|The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Forum or UEFI Forum is an {{alliance}} between several leading technology companies {{to modernize the}} <b>booting</b> <b>process.</b> The board of directors includes representatives from twelve [...] "Promoter" [...] companies: AMD, American Megatrends, Apple, Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, HP Inc., IBM, Insyde Software, Intel, Lenovo, Microsoft, and Phoenix Technologies.|$|R

50|$|Most {{computers}} are also capable of booting over a computer network. In this scenario, {{the operating system}} is stored on the disk of a server, and certain parts of it are transferred to the client using a simple protocol such as the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP).

500|$|Microsoft Security Essentials {{does not}} run on Windows 8 and later, {{which has its}} own {{security}} subsystem, Windows Defender. On 13 September 2011, at the Build conference in Anaheim, California, Microsoft unveiled the developer preview of Windows 8, which had a security component capable of preventing an infected USB flash memory from compromising the system during the <b>boot</b> <b>process.</b> On 15 September, Windows 8 developer's blog confirmed that Windows Defender in Windows 8 would take over the role of virus protection. In an included video, Jason Garms of Microsoft showed how Windows Defender is registered with Action Center as an AV and spyware protection tool, and how it blocks drive-by malware. [...] On 3 March 2012, Softpedia reviewed the consumer preview of Windows 8 and noted the similarity in appearance of Windows Defender and Microsoft Security Essentials 4.0 Beta. According to Softpedia, Windows 8 Setup requires Microsoft Security Essentials to be uninstalled before upgrading Windows 7.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Boot</b> <b>process.</b> All Intel-based Macs {{have been}} using some version of EFI as the boot firmware. At the time the {{platform}} debuted in 2006, {{it was in a}} stark contrast to PCs, which almost universally employed legacy BIOS, and Apple's implementation of EFI did not initially implement the Compatibility Support Module that would allow booting contemporary standard PC operating systems. Apple updated the firmware with CSM support with the release of Boot Camp in April 2006, and since the release of Windows 8 in 2012, Microsoft has required its OEM partners to use UEFI <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> on PCs, which made the differences smaller. However, Apple's version of EFI also includes some custom extensions which are utilized during regular macOS <b>boot</b> <b>process,</b> including: ...|$|E

30|$|The PDE {{software}} {{should be}} merged into the code stream {{of the device}} (e.g., part of the Android framework), such that its availability is widespread, and an attacker cannot simply compromise deniability based {{on the availability of}} software support. In addition, PDE requires changing a few system components (e.g., <b>booting</b> <b>process).</b> The adversary who can perform reverse engineering or dynamic analysis over those components will unavoidably compromise deniability. The PDE systems cannot defend against this type of adversary.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} to conventional methods of remote administration (for example in-band Virtual Network Computing or Terminal Services), a KVM switch {{has the advantage}} that it doesn't depend on a software component running on the remote computer, thus allowing remote interaction with base level BIOS settings and monitoring of the entire <b>booting</b> <b>process</b> before, during, and after the operating system loads. Modern KVM over IP appliances or switches typically use at least 128-bit data encryption securing the KVM configuration over a WAN or LAN (using SSL).|$|R
2500|$|On {{a typical}} PowerPC-based Macintosh system, the <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> {{includes}} loading a bootstrap loader from ROM, loading the Process Manager {{stored in the}} boot blocks of the startup device, locating a [...] "blessed" [...] System Folder on the startup device, and then loading Finder. However, because the Pippin platform ran only on non-writable CD-ROM, a modification to the <b>boot</b> <b>process</b> had to be made. For developers who were using standard 7.5.2 system software, a [...] "PippinFinder" [...] was installed into the System Folder, allowing the CD-ROM to be bootable on a Pippin-based system. Once development was finalized, PippinFinder {{was removed from the}} System Folder, and the Pippin-specific system software was placed onto the build. In addition, an alias of the main executable was placed into the Startup Items folder, so that upon bootup, the application will launch automatically. Developers are constrained to the base hardware profile of the Pippin platform, using no hard drive cache for downloaded content, and sharing 128 KB of NVRAM with the system.|$|E
2500|$|Windows 8 {{supports}} {{a feature of}} the UEFI specification known as [...] "Secure boot", which uses a public-key infrastructure to verify the integrity of the operating system and prevent unauthorized programs such as bootkits from infecting the device's <b>boot</b> <b>process.</b> Some pre-built devices may be described as [...] "certified" [...] by Microsoft; these must have secure boot enabled by default, and provide ways for users to disable or re-configure the feature. ARM-based Windows RT devices must have secure boot permanently enabled.|$|E
2500|$|Windows 8 {{introduced}} {{major changes}} to the operating system's platform and user interface to improve its user experience on tablets, where Windows was now competing with mobile operating systems, including Android and iOS. In particular, these changes included a touch-optimized Windows shell based on Microsoft's [...] "Metro" [...] design language, the Start screen (which displays programs and dynamically updated content on a grid of tiles), a new platform for developing [...] "apps" [...] {{with an emphasis on}} touchscreen input, integration with online services (including the ability to synchronize apps and settings between devices), and Windows Store, an online store for downloading and purchasing new software. Windows 8 added support for USB 3.0, Advanced Format hard drives, near field communications, and cloud computing. Additional security features were introduced, such as built-in antivirus software, integration with Microsoft SmartScreen phishing filtering service and support for UEFI Secure Boot on supported devices with UEFI firmware, to prevent malware from infecting the <b>boot</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
40|$|With the {{majority}} of security breaches coming from inside of organizations, and {{with the number of}} public computing sites, where users do not know the system administrators, increasing, it is dangerous to blindly trust system administrators to manage computers appropriately.

50|$|Since {{these two}} methods {{do not offer}} {{a large amount of}} control over the <b>boot</b> <b>process,</b> the BIOS Boot Specification (BBS) was developed.

5000|$|In computing, booting (or booting up) is the {{initialization}} of {{a computerized}} system. The {{system can be}} a computer or a computer appliance. The <b>booting</b> <b>process</b> can be [...] "hard", e.g., after electrical power to the CPU is switched from off to on (in order to diagnose particular hardware errors), or [...] "soft", when those power-on self-tests (POST) can be avoided. On some systems a soft boot may optionally clear RAM to zero. Both hard and soft booting can be initiated by hardware such as a button press, or by software command. Booting is complete when the normal, operative, runtime environment is attained.|$|R
50|$|Kernel Mode-Setting {{provides}} several benefits. The {{most immediate}} {{is of course}} the removal of duplicate mode-setting code, from both the kernel (Linux console, fbdev) and user space (X Server DDX drivers). KMS also allows to write more easily alternative graphics systems, which now don't need to implement its own mode-setting code. By providing a single centralized mode management, it solves the flickering issues while changing between console and X, and also between different instances of X (fast user switching). Being available in the kernel allows to use it {{since the beginning of}} the <b>booting</b> <b>process,</b> saving flickering due to mode changes in these early stages too.|$|R
5000|$|For IBM PC {{compatible}} computers, BIOS ( [...] , {{an acronym}} for Basic Input/Output System and {{also known as the}} System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is non-volatile firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the <b>booting</b> <b>process</b> (power-on startup), and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware comes pre-installed on a personal computer's system board, and it is the first software run when powered on. The name originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems. The interface of that original system serves as a de facto standard.|$|R
