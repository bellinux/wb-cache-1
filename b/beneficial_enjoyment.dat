60|$|There {{are human}} tempers, bland, glowing, and genial, within whose {{influence}} {{it is as}} good for the poor in spirit to live, {{as it is for}} the feeble in frame to bask in the glow of noon. Of the number of these choice natures were certainly both Dr. Bretton's and his mother's. They liked to communicate happiness, as some like to occasion misery: they did it instinctively; without fuss, and apparently with little consciousness; the means to give pleasure rose spontaneously in their minds. Every day while I stayed with them, some little plan was proposed which resulted in <b>beneficial</b> <b>enjoyment.</b> Fully occupied as was Dr. John's time, he still made it in his way to accompany us in each brief excursion. I can hardly tell how he managed his engagements; they were numerous, yet by dint of system, he classed them in an order which left him a daily period of liberty. I often saw him hard-worked, yet seldom over-driven, and never irritated, confused, or oppressed. What he did was accomplished with the ease and grace of all-sufficing strength; with the bountiful cheerfulness of high and unbroken energies. Under his guidance I saw, in that one happy fortnight, more of Villette, its environs, and its inhabitants, than I had seen in the whole eight months of my previous residence. He took me to places of interest in the town, of whose names I had not before so much as heard; with willingness and spirit he communicates much noteworthy information. He never seemed to think it a trouble to talk to me, and, I am sure, it was never a task to me to listen. It was not his way to treat subjects coldly and vaguely; he rarely generalized, never prosed. He seemed to like nice details almost as much as I liked them myself: he seemed observant of character: and not superficially observant, either. These points gave the quality of interest to his discourse; and the fact of his speaking direct from his own resources, and not borrowing or stealing from books--here a dry fact, and there a trite phrase, and elsewhere a hackneyed opinion--ensured a freshness, as welcome as it was rare. Before my eyes, too, his disposition seemed to unfold another phase; to pass to a fresh day: to rise in new and nobler dawn.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} a trust is {{the separation of}} the ownership or control of property from the <b>beneficial</b> <b>enjoyment</b> thereof. The trustee acquires no beneficial interest in the property, acting merely as a conduit pipe in carrying out the dispositions in favour of the beneficiary. The interest of the beneficiary in the property may vest immediately on the death of the testator, or at some later date, depending on the intention of the testator as expressed in the terms of the will. Statutory provision has been made for the protection of trust property which is settled upon a person either inter vivos or by will, to be administered by him or her for the benefit of other persons.|$|E
50|$|The asset-protection {{trust is}} a trust that splits the <b>beneficial</b> <b>enjoyment</b> of trust assets from their legal ownership. The {{beneficiaries}} of a trust are the beneficial owners of equitable {{interests in the}} trust assets, {{but they do not}} hold legal title to the assets. Thus this kind of trust fulfills the goal of asset protection planning, i.e. to insulate assets from claims of creditors without concealment or tax evasion. A creditor’s ability to satisfy a judgment against a beneficiary’s interest in a trust is limited to the beneficiary’s interest in such trust. Consequently, the common goal of asset protection trusts is to limit the interests of beneficiaries in such a way so as to preclude creditors from collecting against trust assets.|$|E
5000|$|A predial {{servitude}} is {{a perpetual}} real {{right in the}} property of another (the servient estate) which confers on {{the owner of the}} dominant estate permanent, specific entitlements of use and <b>enjoyment</b> (<b>beneficial</b> interest) of the servient estate.|$|R
50|$|Due to this {{administration}} process, the estate does not initially vest in the heir. The executor becomes the legal ‘owner’ of the assets. The executor, however, acquires the bare dominium only, {{and not the}} <b>beneficial</b> use and <b>enjoyment</b> of the assets. Similarly, the debts of the deceased are binding on the executor in his representative capacity only.|$|R

However, their relative significance for eliciting feelings of enjoyment and, thus, {{the strength of}} these positive relations may vary between occupational fields and/or types of training. 2 [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{provisions}} of Section 671 to 678 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 prompt a re-examination {{of the tax}} consequences of so-called short term trusts and other trusts. It is believed that heretofore many competent lawyers have shied away from recommending to their clients the creation of short term trusts, {{largely because of the}} wide range of uncertainties surrounding the principles under which the grantors of such trusts have been taxable. To a considerable degree, many of these uncertain elements have been removed, and it behooves lawyers once more to re-examine the possibilities of income tax savings for their clients by the use of the short term trust and other trusts.

40|$|The {{trust of}} the new Civil Code of Quebec of 1994 relies on the {{innovative}} juridical framework of "patrimony by appropriation". The present thesis analyzes the new trust and situates it within a broader perspective through comparisons with the Common law trust and {{an examination of the}} alternative approaches to fiduciary institutions in Civil law jurisdictions. The notion of patrimony by appropriation implies that the corpus of the Quebec trust constitutes ownerless property. Despite its novelty, we find that the concept is compatible with the civilian theories of droit subjectif and patrimony, {{as well as with the}} other parts of the new Code. The Quebec solution is also able to emulate most of the Common law trust's functional advantages, namely its versatility and flexibility, efficient management and protection of the <b>beneficial</b> <b>enjoyment.</b> Close attention is given to the intricate analysis of the beneficiary's legal position. The examination of alternatives to the Quebec approach reveals that several theoratical constructions may be complemented by specific provisions furnishing the necessary functional advantages. It is precisely these accompanying features which will largely determine the success of a general fiduciary institution adopted in Civil law countries. Since the new Quebec trust is endowed with both a satisfactory conceptual framework and an advantageous juridical regime, it should be considered as an interesting model by jurisdictions attempting to introduce a modern trust-like device...|$|E
50|$|A {{general power}} of {{appointment}} is defined for federal estate tax purposes in the Internal Revenue Code §2041. A general {{power of appointment}} is one which allows the holder of the power to appoint to himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors {{of his or her}} estate the right to have the <b>beneficial</b> use and <b>enjoyment</b> of certain property covered by the power of appointment. The holder of a general power of appointment is treated for estate tax purposes as {{if he or she is}} the owner of the property subject to the power, whether or not the power is exercised. Thus, the property which is subject to the power is includable in the power holder's estate for estate tax purposes.|$|R
40|$|Spoken {{dialogue}} {{systems can}} encounter {{different types of}} errors, including non-understanding errors where the system recognises that the user has spoken, but does not understand the utterance. Strate-gies for dealing {{with this kind of}} error have been proposed and tested in the context of goal-driven dialogue systems, for example by Bohus with a system which helps re-serve conference rooms (Bohus and Rud-nicky, 2005). However there has been lit-tle work on possible strategies in more con-versational settings where the dialogue has more open-ended intentions. This paper looks at recovery from non-understanding errors {{in the context of a}} robot tourguide, and tests the strategies in a user trial. The results suggest that it is <b>beneficial</b> for user <b>enjoyment</b> to use strategies which attempt to move the dialogue on, rather than getting caught up in the error by asking users to re-peat themselves. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the NSW Liquor Industry Strategic Plan on Alcohol and Anti-Social Behaviour in late 1994 indicated that, while liquor industry members were aware of their legal obligations in responsible service of alcohol, there was limited understanding and use of responsible liquor serving practices (Nicoll 1994). This paper attempts to {{bridge this gap by}} documenting three case examples from the NSW registered clubs industry on how responsible liquor serving practices have been effectively achieved. The paper identifies the legal responsibilities of club management in responsible service of alcohol, documents current best practice for responsible liquor service and identifies the implications of responsible liquor service strategies for various aspects of club operations and management. The experience of the three clubs selected by the Club Managers 2 ̆ 7 Association of Australia as examples of best practice in responsible liquor service indicates that the flow-on effects from their strategies have been largely <b>beneficial,</b> increasing patron <b>enjoyment,</b> attracting additional markets, boosting trade in other departments and protecting management and staff from legal liabilities. Managers who have not yet adopted responsible liquor serving strategies are reminded that good ethics means good business and that this is necessary to ensure the future growth of the club industry...|$|R
