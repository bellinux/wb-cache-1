50|$|During the Second World War the {{building}} was damaged, including the roof with the spire caving in. After the war, Otto Bernheimer, who had returned from Venezuela in 1946, received Bernheimer-Haus again as Wiedergutmachung. He restored the roof by building it in a simplified form, {{on the main floor}} a movie theater was built, which later became the local dance hall. In 1948 Otto Bernheimer started with art trade. In 1977 Otto Bernheimers grandson, Konrad O. Bernheimer, took over, and the company was specializing in Old Master paintings from the 16th to 19th century, and was then renamed to Bernheimer Fine Old Masters. In 1987 Konrad O. Berheimer sold {{the building}} in order to pay his co-heirs {{and to be able to}} finance his gallery. The building was purchased by real estate broker Jürgen Schneider, who commissioned architect Alexander von Branca, in order to modernize and remodel the inside, as well as, the extremely complicated restoration of the historically protected exterior. In 1993, when Schneiders Real Estate Empire collapsed because of massive fraud, Deutsche Bank took over as the main creditor for the Bernheimer Palace and allowed the completion of the renovations. The cost of reconstruction is estimated at well over DM 100 million, which included DM 32 million unpaid manufacturers’ <b>bills</b> from Jürgen <b>Schneider's</b> bankruptcy. The reconstruction of the roof and spire has been identified as the main cause. It was not until 1999, that the Bank could resell the building to Robert Arnold, the heir and former partner of Arnold & Richter Cine Technik.|$|R
