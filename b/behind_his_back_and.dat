5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a short man who walked with his hands <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.|$|E
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the shooting, Gordon was handcuffed {{and escorted}} by a deputy sheriff from the Berrien County Courthouse to a holding cell {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} a hearing. He was facing a multitude of charges. According to the county sheriff, Gordon had been handcuffed in front rather than <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> the restraint was not linked to a belly chain that would further restrict movement.|$|E

25|$|After Scott {{was shot}} and had dropped to the ground, Slager {{approached}} him, repeatedly instructed him to place his hands <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> handcuffed him, leaving him {{face down on the}} ground. Although police reports stated that officers performed CPR on Scott, no such action is visible on the video. The video shows that Slager ran back toward where the initial scuffle occurred and picked something up off the ground. Moments later, he dropped the object, possibly the Taser, beside Scott's body.|$|E

50|$|The {{character}} of Bruce was written with antagonistic characteristics, with his storylines often focusing on his rivalry with CEO Michael McKenna (Paul Gittins) and his attempts at {{taking over the}} hospital. He would often go <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> families <b>backs</b> <b>and</b> either try buy out the hospital or indulge in numerous affairs. Bruce's wish was finally granted in 1995 when Michael retired, however only after signing the ownership deal of the hospital did Bruce realize Michael had the last laugh as Bruce was shafted from any managerial positions, only being a silent partner.|$|R
25|$|The Cup Final was Syd Owen's last {{match for}} Luton, {{as he was}} chosen to take over as manager for the 1959–60 season. His one season at the helm was a {{catastrophe}} for the club – Owen complained that the club's directors were denying him control over transfers {{while at the same}} time signing players <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> resigned over the matter in April 1960. Meanwhile, Luton Town were relegated back to the Second Division, finishing bottom with just 30 points from 42 games.|$|E
25|$|On 18 February 2013, with Swindon {{riding high}} in League One and in {{contention}} {{for a second}} consecutive promotion, Di Canio announced his resignation, alleging mistreatment {{by the board of}} directors, including the sale of Matt Ritchie <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> the financial instability of the club at the time. In his place came Kevin MacDonald who had previously held caretaker roles at Leicester City and Aston Villa. MacDonald guided Swindon to the League One play-offs; however, they were knocked out after a penalty shoot-out defeat to Brentford. On 13 July 2013, MacDonald left Swindon Town by mutual consent, only three weeks {{before the start of the}} 2013–14 season and only five months after taking the Swindon job.|$|E
25|$|Post {{punishment}} {{would become}} the symbol of this detention. The principle was simple: the prisoner was attached to a post, a tree or against a wall, hands <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> had to remain in this position, which prevented him from moving, for {{a certain amount of}} time, without eating or drinking. Several variations on this punishment were invented, such as one where the prisoner was raised onto bricks while being attached and once he was solidly attached, the bricks were removed, rendering the punishment even more painful. The Hague Convention specified that “Prisoners of war shall be subject to the laws, regulations, and orders in force in the army of the State in whose power they are. Any act of insubordination justifies the adoption towards them of such measures of severity as may be considered necessary”. Post punishment was applied in the German Army until its abolition on 18 May 1917; for prisoners, abolition came at the end of 1916 after a complaint by France.|$|E

Despite {{the end of their}} relationship, however, they can't seem to get away from each other, in part because Sophie's mother is constantly plotting to reunite them. His continued presence in Sophie's life also complicates her efforts to find a new boyfriend: in one episode, he accidentally sees Melissa giving Sophie's current love interest a few pointers on how Sophie likes to be flirted with, mistakes him for someone Melissa is seeing <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> later punches him in the face at a gallery show. In the first season finale, he almost asked Melissa to marry him, but when that failed he saw Sophie crying over being rejected by André and as they were about to go get a drink, he sees André walking towards the two.|$|E
25|$|Toole {{tried to}} {{maintain}} a sense of normalcy and enrolled in Tulane {{in the fall of}} 1968 with the hopes of acquiring a Ph.D. He took a course studying Theodore Dreiser, on whom he had lectured while at Hunter, and was particularly interested in Dreiser's close relationship with his mother and his anti-Catholic beliefs. The assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 added to his feelings of grief and heightened his paranoia. Several of Toole's longtime friends noticed he had an increasing sense of feelings of personal persecution. Toole went to see his friend Bob Byrne at his home in August 1968, where he again expressed sadness and humiliation that his book would not be published. Toole told Byrne that people were passing his home late in the night and honking their car horns at him, that students whispered about him <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> that people were plotting against him. Byrne had a talk with him, which he felt, for the time being, calmed him down.|$|E
25|$|The War Committee met (3 November 1916) without Robertson, so Lloyd George could, in Hankey’s words “air {{his views}} freely unhampered by the {{presence}} of that old dragon Robertson”. He complained that the Allies had not achieved any definite success, that the Germans had recovered the initiative, had conquered most of Romania, had increased her forces in the East (after increased mobilisation the German Army had increased in size from 169 ½ divisions on 1 June to 197 divisions (of which 70 were in the East, up from 47 ½ on 1 June)) and still had 4 million men in reserve. On this occasion Asquith backed him and the committee’s conclusion, which was neither printed nor circulated, was that “The offensive on the Somme, if continued next year, was not likely to lead to decisive results, and that the losses might make too heavy a drain on our resources having regard to the results to be anticipated.” It was agreed to consider offensives in other theatres. The ministers again (7 November) discussed, after Robertson had left the room, the plan to send Robertson to a conference in Russia (all except possibly McKenna were in favour) and a further inter-Allied conference to upstage the forthcoming conference of generals at Chantilly. Robertson rejected the idea as “the Kitchener dodge” and was angry at the discussion <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>and,</b> concerned that Lloyd George wanted to “play hanky panky”, refused to go.|$|E

Mick returns and walks in on Whitney and Woody in bed after having sex. He then punches Woody and throws him out. He later learns that Shirley and Linda sold the freehold of the Vic <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> forged his signature, and turns to alcohol {{to deal with the}} stress. He also learns that Max Branning (Jake Wood) set up the deal, and confronts him, branding him a snake and warning him to stay away from him. He then kisses a vulnerable Whitney who responds. Shirley learns of the kiss and tells Whitney to pack her bags and leave. When Mick learns that Shirley did this, he drunkenly throws a glass at her, but instantly regrets it and cries, saying he no longer knows himself. Mick tells Linda about the kiss on her return but is then left devastated when she tells him they're over. Later, Linda agrees to give it another go but when Mick admits he made a failed attempt to pay Whitney off with £200, it earns him a hard slap across the face from 'L'. Fi Browning (Lisa Faulkner) reveals her mum's suicide to Mick and when she tries to kiss him, he pushes her away. Following a reconciliation and Switzerland holiday, Mick leaves Linda for not revealing her cancer to him first and lying about the length of her mum's illness. Next day they get back together.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{continued}} Edmonton injuries trickle-down effect, the Barons started November with few veterans and nine skaters who had played for the ECHL last season. Oklahoma City suffered their second shutout loss of the season on November 1 with a 6–0 loss to the Chicago Wolves, one of the worst losses in the franchise's four-year history. They responded with a 4–2 victory over Chicago the next day. Goalie Olivier Roy, who was pulled from the net after allowing five goals in the first 21 shots in the first game, made 31 saves in the rematch. Lander was reassigned to the Barons after Ryan Hamilton was reactivated by the Oilers. Oklahoma City struggled with inconsistency problems due to the turnover with Edmonton: they had scored an average of about four goals in their five wins of the season thus far, but only about 1.1 in their seven losses. The Oilers signed a goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov to a $1.7 million contract on November 8, and he began practicing with the Barons. Goalie Tyler Bunz made 34 saves in his first AHL start against San Antonio on November 9, but the team fell 3–2 after the Rampage scored two shootout goals and only Ryan Hamilton scored for Oklahoma City. The Barons defeated San Antonio by the same score on November 12, with Omark getting the game-winner after sliding the pick <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> between his legs before scoring against goalie Jacob Markström. The goal generated a great deal of attention, becoming the most-viewed video on the Oklahoma City Barons website with over 75,000 views in the first 24 hours, and making ESPN SportsCenter's top ten plays, a rarity for the AHL.|$|E
25|$|The film had {{its roots}} in an earlier concept for a new King Kong feature {{developed}} by Willis O'Brien, animator of the original stop-motion Kong. Around 1960, O'Brien {{came up with a}} proposed treatment, King Kong meets Frankenstein, where Kong would fight against a giant version of Frankenstein's monster in San Francisco. O'Brien took the project (which consisted of some concept art and a screenplay treatment) to RKO to secure permission to use the King Kong character. During this time the story was renamed King Kong vs. the Ginko when it was believed that Universal had the rights to the Frankenstein name (it actually only had the rights to the monster's makeup design). O'Brien was introduced to producer John Beck, who promised to find a studio to make the film (at this point in time, RKO was no longer a production company). Beck took the story treatment and had George Worthing Yates flesh it out into a screenplay. The story was slightly altered and the title changed to King Kong vs. Prometheus, returning the name to the original Frankenstein concept (The Modern Prometheus was the alternate name of Frankenstein in the original novel). Unfortunately, the cost of stop-motion animation discouraged potential studios from putting the film into production. After shopping the script around overseas, Beck eventually attracted the interest of the Japanese studio Toho, which had long wanted to make a King Kong film and was also planning for Godzilla to make a comeback around the same time. After purchasing the script, they decided to replace the Frankenstein creature with Godzilla to be King Kong's opponent and would have Shinichi Sekizawa rewrite Yates's script. The studio thought that it would be the perfect way to celebrate its thirtieth year in production. It was one of 5 big banner releases for the company to celebrate the anniversary alongside Sanjuro, , Lonely Lane, and Born in Sin. John Beck's dealings with Willis O'Brien's project were done <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> O'Brien was never credited for his idea. In 1963, Merian C. Cooper attempted to file a lawsuit against John Beck claiming that he outright owned the King Kong character, but the lawsuit never went through as it turned out he was not Kong's sole legal owner as he had previously believed.|$|E

The king went <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> minister's <b>back</b> <b>and</b> dispatched <b>his</b> own secretary, William Knight, to Rome, seeking a direct channel of communication with Clement VII {{in order to secure}} papal permission to marry Anne Boleyn. Wolsey interpreted the king's actions not only as a direct threat to his own connections with the Roman curia as legate a latere, but also as potentially disastrous for the divorce campaign. Knight's ultimate failure enabled Wolsey to regain control of the Great Matter and made abundantly clear to him the fragility of his own position as intermediary between king and pope. © Institute of Historical Research 2010.
