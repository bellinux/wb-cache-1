5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells are surrounded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E
5|$|In the {{geologic}} record, the K–Pg {{event is}} marked <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of sediment called the K–Pg boundary, {{which can be}} found throughout the world in marine and terrestrial rocks. The boundary clay shows high levels of the metal iridium, which is rare in the Earth's crust, but abundant in asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Thorium tetrafluoride {{is used as}} an antireflection {{material}} in multilayered optical coatings. It has an optical transparency {{in the range of}} 0.35–12µm, and its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles, which can be easily stopped <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> cover layer of another material. Replacements for thorium tetrafluoride are being developed as of the 2010s.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} Roman city {{wall was}} over 6½ feet thick with a steep ditch (which was later used {{to divert the}} River Lavant). It survived for over {{one and a half}} thousand years but was then replaced <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thinner</b> Georgian wall.|$|R
5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E
5|$|Niobium {{is used as}} a {{precious}} metal in commemorative coins, often with silver or gold. For example, Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> anodized oxide layer. In 2012, ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin: blue, green, brown, purple, violet, or yellow. Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian €25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin, and the 2006 Austrian €25 European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin.|$|E
5|$|On 16 April 1922, {{a man was}} {{assaulted}} {{while walking}} down Coventry Street around 6.00am. He fell unconscious after the attack, and was rushed to Charing Cross Hospital, where he {{was found to have}} been stabbed in the neck <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> tube. After another man was attacked a few hours later in a similar manner, followed by a third victim in the evening, an urban legend spread that a vampire was stalking Coventry Street. No further incidents occurred and the attacker was never convicted.|$|E

5|$|Species that {{resemble}} A.deserticola include the desert fungi Montagnea arenaria and Podaxis pistillaris. Montagnea arenaria is a whitish stalked puffball with a hollow, woody stalk and a loose sac-like volva {{at the base}} of the stem. It is topped <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> disc-like cap with blackish gill plates suspended around the margin. Podaxis pistillaris has a cylindrical to oval white to brownish cap with a paper-thin wall atop a slender stem. When mature, the cap contains powdery, dark brown spores.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} has a short, sharp tsip call, {{replaced}} on migration <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> high seep, {{similar to the}} redwing's call but shorter. The alarm call is a chook-chook becoming shorter and more strident with increasing danger. The male's song, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches, is a loud clear run of musical phrases, repeated two to four times, filip filip filip codidio codidio quitquiquit tittit tittit tereret tereret tereret, and interspersed with grating notes and mimicry. It is given mainly from February to June by the Outer Hebridean race, but from November to July by the more widespread subspecies. For its weight, this species {{has one of the}} loudest bird calls.|$|E

5|$|At the {{opposite}} side of the planet, the solar wind stretches Jupiter's magnetic field lines into a long, trailing magnetotail, which sometimes extends well beyond the orbit of Saturn. The structure of Jupiter's magnetotail is similar to Earth's. It consists of two lobes (blue areas in the figure), with the magnetic field in the southern lobe pointing toward Jupiter, and that in the northern lobe pointing away from it. The lobes are separated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of plasma called the tail current sheet (orange layer in the middle). Like Earth's, the Jovian tail is a channel through which solar plasma enters the inner regions of the magnetosphere, where it is heated and forms the radiation belts at distances closer than 10RJ from Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Back in the 15th century, German theologian Nicolaus Cusanus {{speculated that}} the Universe lacked a center and a circumference. He {{believed}} that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained. These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican heliocentric cosmology {{to the concept of}} an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called aether, which did not cause resistance to the motions of heavenly bodies. English philosopher William Gilbert arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> aether or a void. This concept of an aether originated with ancient Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies moved.|$|E
5|$|Barbeyella minutissima is a slime mould {{species of}} the order Echinosteliales, and the only {{species of the}} genus Barbeyella. First {{described}} in 1914 from the Jura mountains, its habitat is restricted to montane spruce and spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere, {{where it has been}} recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically colonises slimy, algae-covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially to completely covered by liverworts. The sporangia are roughly spherical, up to 0.2mm in diameter, and supported <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> stalk up to 0.7mm tall. After the spores have developed, the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes. The species is one of the smallest members of the Myxogastria and is considered rare.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> {{observed}} <b>by</b> Lord Rayleigh, <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> film (such as tarnish) on {{the surface}} of glass can reduce the reflectivity. This effect can be explained <b>by</b> envisioning <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of material with refractive index n1 between the air (index n0) and the glass (index nS). The light ray now reflects twice: once from the surface between air and the thin layer, and once from the layer-to-glass interface.|$|R

5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E
5|$|Like all passerines, {{the chicks}} are altricial; {{they are born}} blind and covered only <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of down. By seven days, they are {{stretching}} wings and preening, and at two weeks {{they are able to}} fly. Parents feed young for at least three weeks after leaving the nest, and have been recorded giving them spiders, and insects such as flies and moths. Males take over feeding young when females begin renesting for the next brood. In a field study near Cooma in southern New South Wales, fledglings were observed to disperse from the natal territory after four to six weeks for a single brood year, and {{in less than a week}} on both occasions in a pair which raised two broods in the season. The long breeding season and multiple broods therein are an adaptation to mild climate and high levels of predation. Despite this, on average only two young are successfully fledged per year.|$|E
5|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene {{boundary}} of 66 million years ago, marking the temporal {{border between the}} Cretaceous and Paleogene periods of geological time, was identified <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> stratum of iridium-rich clay. A team led by Luis Alvarez proposed in 1980 an extraterrestrial origin for this iridium, attributing it to an asteroid or comet impact. Their theory, known as the Alvarez hypothesis, is now widely accepted to explain the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. A large buried impact crater structure with an estimated age of about 66 million years was later identified under {{what is now the}} Yucatán Peninsula (the Chicxulub crater). Dewey M. McLean and others argue that the iridium may have been of volcanic origin instead, because Earth's core is rich in iridium, and active volcanoes such as Piton de la Fournaise, in the island of Réunion, are still releasing iridium.|$|E

50|$|The {{lesser omentum}} is formed, <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thinning</b> of the {{mesoderm}} or ventral mesogastrium, which attaches {{the stomach and}} duodenum to the anterior abdominal wall.

5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing electrical energy in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E
5|$|The gastrovascular cavity {{itself is}} divided {{into a number of}} {{chambers}} by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge {{at the base of the}} pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central lumen. They have stomach lining on both sides, separated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of mesoglea, and include filaments of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes. In some species, these filaments extend below the lower margin of the mesentery, hanging free in the gastrovascular cavity as thread-like acontial filaments. These acontia are armed with nematocysts and can be extruded through cinclides, blister-like holes in the wall of the column, for use in defence.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid sits {{near the}} front of the neck, lying against and around the front of the larynx and trachea. The thyroid {{cartilage}} and cricoid cartilage lie just above the gland, below the Adam's apple. The isthmus extends from the second to third rings of the trachea, with the uppermost part of the lobes extending to the thyroid cartilage, and the lowermost around the fourth to sixth tracheal rings. The thyroid gland is covered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> fibrous capsule, which has an inner and an outer layer. The outer layer is continuous with the pretracheal fascia, attaching the gland to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, via a thickening of the fascia to form the posterior suspensory ligament of thyroid gland also known as Berry's ligament. This causes the thyroid to move up and down with swallowing. The inner layer extrudes into the gland and forms the septae that divides the thyroid tissue into microscopic lobules. Typically four parathyroid glands, two on each side, lie on each side between the two layers of the capsule, {{at the back of the}} thyroid lobes.|$|E
