25|$|Vocal resonation is {{the process}} by which the <b>basic</b> <b>product</b> of {{phonation}} is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes {{on its way to the}} outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.|$|E

The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound. There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the chest, the tracheal tree, the larynx itself, the pharynx, the oral cavity, the nasal cavity, and the sinuses.|$|E
30|$|Consumer {{products}} can be segmented into {{two different types}} of products regarding their demand patterns: <b>basic</b> or functional <b>products</b> and fashion or innovative products (Fisher & Rajaram 2000). <b>Basic</b> <b>products</b> have a long life-cycle and stable demand, which is easy to forecast with standard methods. Fashion products on the other hand have a short life-cycle and highly unpredictable demand. Due to their short life-cycles fashion products are often bought just once prior to a selling period (and not reordered after demand occurred which is usually the case for <b>basic</b> <b>products)</b> which makes them hard to forecast. Fashion products thus need different forecasting methods than <b>basic</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
