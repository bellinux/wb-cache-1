500|$|The song's {{composition}} begun after Strange Music label-mate ¡Mayday! sent Tech N9ne {{the song}} with their and Kendall Morgan's vocals on it. He said the introspective chorus made him {{take a moment}} to reflect on his own rhymes. He detailed himself creating his verse saying, [...] "After I wrote my verse, it was my second show in Seattle. We did two shows, because I sold out both shows. There was like 2,000 the first night, and another 2,000 on the second night. So it was like, 'Whoa, we sold out both shows!' I was already tired from the night before, and we already had booked the studio time in Seattle. I went there, and I finished the last four bars of the verse I wrote. I wrote most of the verse—the first eight bars—on bus. It was getting closer to the show, and I wrote the last four bars at the studio because, our meet and greets aren’t an hour anymore. There’s like 300 people or 400 people, so you’re there until 6 pm now instead of 3 or 4. Now we got to go the studio, and I gotta be on stage at 9 pm, so it’s coming down to the wire I still have to eat and whatnot. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> and after I did it, I’m like, 'Ooh, the verse is elite.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Lester {{was offered}} {{producing}} credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant {{there would be}} someone ready {{in the event that}} Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. [...] "Being there all the time meant he [...] could take over," [...] Salkind admitted. [...] " [...] couldn't make up his mind on stuff." [...] On Lester, Donner reflected, [...] "He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on Three and Four Musketeers, which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it.</b> Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{sequel to}} her first {{greatest}} hits album, The Immaculate Collection (1990), GHV2 included fifteen singles released during Madonna's second decade in the recording industry, starting from [...] "Erotica" [...] (1992) to [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] (2001). Unlike the former release, GHV2 did not feature any new material. In an interview with BBC's Jo Whiley, Madonna spoke about {{the selection of the}} tracks, [...] "I only wanted songs that I could listen to five times in a row." [...] She also added that [...] "If you listen to the record, you can really see my evolution as a singer, songwriter, and, more important, a human being." [...] Madonna felt that because it was a [...] "greatest hits", it should only contain previously released hit songs. Several of her popular singles of that period were excluded from the album. Despite being a worldwide number-one hit in 2000, [...] "American Pie" [...] was not included because Madonna had regretted putting it on her eighth studio album, Music (2000). [...] "It was something a certain record company executive twisted my arm into doing, but it didn't belong on the album so now it's being punished... My gut told me not to , <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> and then I regretted it so just for that reason it didn't deserve a place on GHV2." [...] she said. Other notable exclusions were [...] "This Used to Be My Playground", [...] "Rain", [...] "I'll Remember" [...] and [...] "You'll See"—all of which had been included on her ballads compilation Something to Remember (1995).|$|E

2500|$|The {{president}} of the Independent Democrats, Patricia de Lille, told the court she was handed information by people whose identity she did not disclose. She first asked for a commission of inquiry into the arms deal. When that was refused she asked Mbeki to issue a proclamation to allow the Heath unit to investigate. She said that her [...] "role was {{to pass on the}} information and hope and pray that it will be investigated.

2500|$|By contrast, György Ligeti {{published}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the first chapter of this last piece in 1958, concluding that its [...] "ascetic attitude [...] akin to compulsion neurosis", and that Boulez [...] "had to break away from it... and so he created the sensual, feline world of the Marteau." [...] Speaking of Structures, Book I in 2011 Boulez described it as a piece in which [...] "the responsibility of the composer is practically absent. Had computers existed at that time I would have put the data through them and made the piece that way. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>it</b> by hand ... It was a demonstration through the absurd." [...] Asked whether it should still be listened to as music, Boulez replied: [...] "I am not terribly eager to listen to it. But for me it was an experiment that was absolutely necessary." ...|$|E
