25|$|There are {{a variety}} of rare {{diseases}} which resemble GH deficiency, including the childhood growth failure, facial appearance, delayed bone age, and low IGF levels. However, GH testing elicits normal or high levels of GH in the blood, demonstrating that the problem is not due to a deficiency of GH but rather to a reduced sensitivity to its action. Insensitivity to GH is traditionally termed Laron dwarfism, <b>but</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> 15 years many different types of GH resistance have been identified, primarily involving mutations of the GH binding protein or receptors.|$|E
