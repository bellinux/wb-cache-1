40|$|Integrated agricultural-aquaculture (IAA) systems {{involving}} tilapia culture {{have been}} promoted in Yucatan State, Mexico, {{as a way}} of producing fish protein and providing additional economic returns in poor rural areas. System productivity is sub-optimal due to lack of management skills, <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> (30 % protein-content tilapia feed) shortages and deficient technical assistance. To overcome resource limitations, producers complement <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> with the leaves of tree spinach (Cnidoscolus chayamansa), a plant found in Yucatan, other parts of Mexico, Central and South America, Africa, Asia and Oceania. Based on experimental data, a bioeconomic analysis was made to determine (1) the combination of <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> and tree spinach leaves which minimizes production costs and (2) the combination which maximizes economic returns. In a limited-resource scenario, a combination of 50 % <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> at manufacturer-recommended ration plus tree spinach ad libitum reduced feeding costs and increased producer economic returns by 37. 9 % vs. a complete <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> diet, 48. 4 % vs. a half-complete diet, and 98. 3 % vs. satiety rations. Use of tree spinach leaves in tilapia diets as a part of IAA systems in Yucatan greatly improved feed management efficiency and the results suggest that this feed input may be used for the same purpose in other regions where it is grown.

40|$|Tilapia {{culture in}} Yucatan State, Mexico, is largely semi-intensive. The {{producers}} are mostly poor farmers who receive government subsidies for purchase of fingerlings and <b>balanced</b> <b>feed.</b> Feeding practices are often inadequate (satiety rations), moreover, producers frequently suffer financial and resource shortfalls. During feed shortages producers {{are known to}} use empirical application of chaya (Cnidoscolus chayamansa) leaves, used traditionally in human and animal nutrition. A study was done of growth in juvenile tilapia using diets containing <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> with chaya (25 and 50 % of substitution), complete, half-complete and satiety rations of <b>balanced</b> <b>feed,</b> during the warm season. The results were used to develop a bioeconomic model and implemented in MS Excel program, with a one-day time step.

40|$|In Mexico, {{the culture}} of tilapia has {{developed}} in rural areas, where the main problem is low producer income. The state of Yucatan also experiences this situation, and scarcity of money needed to purchase inputs results in complementary feeding with chaya (Cnidoscolus chayamansa), whose leaves are edible for humans and animals. In this situation, CINVESTAV conducted experiments to determine the optimal level of substitution of <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> with ray chaya leaves. The test with 25 % and 50 % reduced <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> complemented with chaya (ad libitum) did not show significant differences (P> 0. 05) in growth compared to fishes fed with a complete ration of <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> (100 % feed table). A bioeconomic model was developed, including a submodel of growth according to observed results in each test. The model was developed in Excel, considering economic and management components. In addition, the analysis was completed using the Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS) to evaluate cost minimization. According to the MRTS results, {{it is necessary to}} add 2. 4 units of chaya for each reduced unit of <b>balanced</b> <b>feed,</b> {{in order to maintain the}} same level of production.

30|$|The {{trends in}} the {{production}} shares of soybeans are different. Soybeans were only adopted in Argentina in the 1972 – 1973, almost 20 years later than in the US. The story, told by Reca (2007), gives an interesting portrait of Argentine history. Whereas soybean production had been heavily encouraged in the US since the 1930 s, the Argentine agricultural sector always resisted its adoption and the Argentine government never took actions to promote it—it was considered an “exotic plant.” The scenario changed in 1972 – 1973, only by chance. Argentina used to import <b>balanced</b> animal <b>feed</b> from fish flour produced in Peru (from the “anchoveta peruana,” a type of anchovies). A change in sea currents in the Pacific Ocean caused a disruption in anchoveta production in 1972 and a scarcity of <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> in Argentina. As a result, soybeans were finally adopted in 1973 – 1974 after a joint initiative of the <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> industry and the Argentine Secretary of Agriculture. Soon after adoption, Argentina became a major producer, at an increasing rate.

40|$|Abstract—A compact printed {{dipole antenna}} with wide {{impedance}} bandwidth is proposed in this paper. This antenna {{consists of a}} pair of radiation metal arms and a microstrip-to-slotline transition structure. At the end of the feeding slotted line, a beveled slot with stepped connection structure is designed to realize an offset feeding structure for feeding the dipole antenna. By using the beveled offset feeding structure, the bandwidth of the dipole antenna is significantly improved. The microstrip-to-slotline transition is used as an integrated balun to realize a <b>balanced</b> <b>feeding</b> for the dipole antenna. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, a prototype of the designed antenna is fabricated and measured. The measured results show that the designed dipole antenna achieves a gain of 2. 2 – 4. 4 dBi across a wide impedance bandwidth from 2. 65 GHz to 17. 5 GHz with a compact size (33 mm × 16 mm).

Figure 3 shows the normalized radiation patterns of the folded-slot antenna for the E- and H-planes, operating at the ISM band. These patterns were measured in the anechoic chamber of the Electrical Engineering Department of National Taiwan University. Because of the antenna’s <b>balanced</b> <b>feeding</b> port, the radiation patterns appear to be rather symmetric. Comparing the measured data of the electric field at different frequencies, {{we find that the}} gain is about 4 dBi and the variation less than 1 dB over the desired frequency range. The gain variation is always obvious over the wide bandwidth on the slot antenna [6]. 6. CONCLUSION Using a nonuniform-width slot, we have presented a folded-slot antenna fed by CPW with tuning slits.

The proposed antenna consists of two pairs of orthogonal planar quasi-open-sleeve dipoles along the centerlines, a <b>balanced</b> <b>feeding</b> structure and a square ground plane. The planar quasi-open-sleeve dipole comprises a pair of bowtie-shaped planar dipoles with two parallel curve parasitic elements. The introduced parallel curve parasitic elements change {{the path of the}} current of the original bowtie-shaped planar dipoles at high frequencies and hence wideband characteristic is achieved. Two pairs of the planar quasi-open-sleeve dipoles placed orthogonally further broaden the bandwidth of the antenna with dual-polarization characteristics.

In all, were carried out 1999 BCS assessments on 459 cows, housed in a free-stall barn, and 88 cows, housed in a tie-stall barn. Statistical analysis involved the housing system (free-stall and tie-stall), the technological status (primiparous and multiparous cows), and the season. The mean BCS of free-stall cows decreased until 100 days in lactation, then it increased again and reached the peak in dry cows, 3 weeks before calving. Primiparous cows had higher BCSs than multiparous cows. The effect of season on BCS in the free-stall sys-tem cows was significant (P ≤ 0. 01 and P ≤ 0. 05). BCS was lowest in the autumn. Moreover, technological group had an effect on BCS in the free-stall barn (P ≤ 0. 01 and P ≤ 0. 05); however, housing system was without a significant effect on the mean BCS or its distribution.
