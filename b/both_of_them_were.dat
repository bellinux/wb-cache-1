5|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} royal antelope is Neotragus pygmaeus. It {{is placed in the}} genus Neotragus and the family Bovidae. It was first described by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae (1758). German zoologist Peter Simon Pallas recognised two species – Tragulus pygmaeus and Antilope pygmaea. However, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> found to have the same type, the royal antelope. Hence these were treated as synonyms for N. pygmaeus.|$|E
5|$|When Lech was nine, Feliksa {{married her}} brother-in-law, Stanisław Wałęsa (1916–1981), a farmer. Lech had three elder full siblings; Izabela (1934–2012), Edward (b.1937), and Stanisław (b.1939); and three younger half-brothers; Tadeusz (b.1946), Zygmunt (b.1948), and Wojciech (1951–1988). In 1973, Lech's mother and {{stepfather}} emigrated to the US for economic reasons. They lived in Jersey City, where Feliksa {{died in a car}} accident in 1975, and Stanisław {{died of a heart attack}} in 1981. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> buried in Poland.|$|E
5|$|Another myth current amongst Tamils {{says that}} the temple was {{renovate}}d by a legendary Chola king, Kullakotan. According to that myth, the king, who was afflicted with an incurable skin disease, was cured after taking a bath in the ruined temple’s holy pond. Following the miracle, the king went on to renovate the temple and created a community of temple caretakers to maintain the temple. The equivalent myth amongst the Sinhalese people indicates that the diseased king was Rajasinghe or Bhuvanekabahu and the king prayed to the presiding goddess who cured him of his affliction. There were at least two kings called Rajasinghe in Sri Lanka, and <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> involved in the actual renovations of the temple, and at least seven kings named Bhuvanekabahu, thereby {{making it difficult to}} identify the right king.|$|E

5|$|In late antiquity, {{historic}} accounts {{become much}} more diffuse, and the Iazyges generally cease to be mentioned as a tribe. In the late 4thcentury, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned, the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, who lived {{on opposite sides of}} the Tisza river. One theory is that these two tribes were formed when the Iazyges were conquered by the Roxolani, with the Iazyges becoming the Limigantes, and the Roxolani becoming the Argaragantes. Another theory is that a group of Slavic tribesmen gradually migrated into the area, subservient to the Iazyges, and the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes, and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Regardless of which is true, in the 5th century <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> conquered by the Goths, and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.|$|E
5|$|Nevin {{had only}} two hits in his last 32 at-bats with the Rangers, though <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> home runs. The Chicago Cubs sought a {{slugging}} first baseman to replace the injured Derrek Lee, and the Rangers traded Nevin to Chicago on May 31, 2006. The Rangers received second baseman and outfielder Jerry Hairston, Jr. in return. The Rangers also agreed to pay {{the difference in the}} two players' salaries. On August 31, the deadline for trades of players who had cleared waivers, the Cubs traded Nevin to the Twins for cash and a player to be named later. To make room for Nevin, Twins' outfielder Shannon Stewart was placed on the 60-day disabled list.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the County Court in Gospić {{tried and}} convicted in {{absentia}} {{a group of}} seven Croatian Serbs for their involvement in the killings of eight civilians (members of the Nikšić and Orešković families, but not the Rakić family) in Široka Kula, handing out prison sentences. Nikola Zagorac, Miroslav Serdar and Dragan Vunjak were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, while Dane Serdar, Dušan Uzelac, Milorad Barać and Dragan Uzelac each received sentences of 15 years in prison. In 1997, the County Court in Gospić also tried Vladimir Korica and Branko Banjeglav in absentia for {{taking part in the}} massacre. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. None of those convicted in absentia served any prison time. Dane Serdar voluntarily returned to Croatia in September 2003 and was granted a retrial as he had been convicted in absentia. Dane Serdar's 1994 conviction was overturned and he was acquitted in September 2004, after prosecution failed to present sufficient evidence against him.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the {{commanding}} officer of the JNA 51st Motorised Brigade, Enes Taso, was charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Dalj in August–December 1991. Taso is charged with the deaths of two policemen in the JNA attack on the Dalj police station, nine prisoners of war captured in Dalj, eleven captured in Vukovar, and 90 non-Serb civilians. In May 2012, Croatian authorities in Osijek started a trial of two Croatian Serbs charged with war crimes against Croatian civilians, including the gang rape of a 20-year-old woman and forcing her parents and siblings to watch the rape. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> convicted in September 2013 and sentenced to 12 years in prison.

5|$|On July 20, 1889, a range detective {{from the}} Association named George Henderson accused Ella Watson, a local rancher, of {{stealing}} cattle from a fellow rancher {{by the name}} of Albert John Bothwell. The cattlemen sent riders to arrest Ella before apprehending her husband, Jim Averell, as well. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> subsequently hanged from a tree. This gruesome act was one of the rare cases in the Old West in which a woman was lynched, an event that appalled many of the local residents and paved the way for future conflicts in the war. County Sheriff Frank Hadsell arrested six men for the lynching and a trial date was set. However, before the trial, threats were sent to the witnesses who would testify against the aggressors. One of those witnesses was young Gene Crowder, who mysteriously disappeared under unknown circumstances before the trial. Another, Jim's nephew and foreman Frank Buchanan, disappeared from the county as well after a shoot-out with unknown suspects, and was presumed to be hiding or murdered. Ralph Cole, another nephew of Averell's, died {{on the day of the}} trial from poisoning.|$|E
5|$|The first {{classic work}} about the Tang is the Old Book of Tang by Liu Xu (887–946) et al. of the Later Jin, who {{redacted}} {{it during the}} last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labelled the New Book of Tang) in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072), Song Qi (998–1061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060). <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> based upon earlier annals, yet those are now lost. Both of them also rank among the Twenty-Four Histories of China. One of the surviving sources of the Old Book of Tang, primarily covering up to 756, is the Tongdian, which Du You presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor Sima Guang (1019–1086). This historical text, written with 3 million Chinese characters in 294 volumes, covered the history of China {{from the beginning of the}} Warring States (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).|$|E

5|$|The strict {{qualifications}} {{required of}} presidential candidates resulted in walkovers during {{the elections of}} 1999, 2005 and 2017. The incumbent President Ong Teng Cheong did not run {{for a second term}} at the 1999 presidential election, saying that he had no compelling reason to do so. In addition to the eventual winner, Sellapan Ramanathan (better known as S. R. Nathan), the other potential candidates were Tan Soo Phuan, a member of the opposition Workers' Party of Singapore; and Ooi Boon Ewe, a private tutor turned real estate executive. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> found not to have met the criteria to stand for election. As a result, Nathan, a former civil servant and Ambassador to the United States, was deemed to have been elected President. At the presidential election of 2005, the persons who applied for a certificate of eligibility to contest the election were Nathan, Ooi and Ramachandran Govindasamy Naidu. However, as Nathan was again the only candidate issued with a certificate, he was elected by default on nomination day.|$|E
5|$|Much of Suffolk's early {{activity}} in East Anglian local politics was probably at the instigation of his mother, Alice, {{and he would}} later spend as much {{of his adult life}} at her manor of Ewelme as he did at his own manors. Suffolk played a prominent role in Commissions of the Peace in Norfolk and Suffolk, and these became a permanent position from 1464. On at least two occasions, Suffolk attempted to affect the outcome of a local parliamentary election, and the appointment of the county sheriff. Furthermore, he was a justice of the peace in Berkshire and Oxfordshire in the later 1460s. He involved himself {{in some of the most}} controversial episodes in East Anglian society of the time, for instance, attempting to purchase part of the by-then somewhat infamous Fastolf inheritance in 1461. This was another occasion in fact where we may in fact see his mother's guiding hand at work, as she is known to have been canvassing for support at court for such an outcome, and even Margaret Paston believed her to be personally behind the attacks. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> involved in a severe feud with the Paston family as a result of conflicting interests in the Fastolf inheritance. The duke also made other disputed (and in some cases outrightly illegal) claims to other properties in the region over the following decade, and in 1465, a group of his retainers destroyed the manor house of Hellesdon, ransacking its church. For these and other illegalities alleged by contemporaries, Suffolk escaped retribution, probably due to his royal connections. On the other hand, he was never able to use such connections to his advantage and persuade the king to intercede in any disputes on the duke's behalf.|$|E
5|$|On July 13, 1995, Cameron County {{officials}} and state authorities traveled to Mexico City to ask Mexican officials to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for Fischer's murder. Thousands of documents were translated from English to Spanish {{and handed over}} to Mexico's attorney general for review. On July 15, Mexican officials agreed to prosecute both of them for the murder in an international prosecution court in Mexico City. Texas prosecutors asked the Mexican government to use Article 4 of the Mexican Federal Penal Code, a little-used provision that permits Mexican citizens to be prosecuted in Mexico for crimes they committed outside the country. In order for the provision to take effect, it required the accused to be in Mexican territory; not to have faced justice {{in the country where}} the crime was committed; and that the crime was not only illegal in the country where it was committed, but also in Mexico. Murder in Mexico carries a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison, though it is common for people to be released after 15 to 25 years for good behavior. The Cameron County office said they would use a federal prosecutor from Tamaulipas as the judge. The two accused would be issued an arrest warrant and asked to appear in court where a federal judge would review their case and determine the punishment in a few months. When Puentes Pizaña heard the news, he was surprised and angered by the decision. He maintained his innocence saying he was only a car thief. Olivarez was in custody in a Matamoros prison. On September 20, a Mexican federal judge agreed to prosecute Puentes Pizaña and Olivarez for the murder. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> eventually found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison.|$|E

5|$|Sashadhar Mukherjee, an {{assistant}} sound-engineer at the studio, had a brotherly bond with Devika Rani because <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> Bengalis and spoke that language with each other. He established {{contact with the}} runaway couple and managed to convince Devika Rani {{to return to her}} husband. In the India of that era, divorce was legally almost impossible and women who eloped were regarded as no better than prostitutes and were shunned by their own families. In her heart of hearts, Devika Rani knew that she could not secure a divorce or marry Hassan under any circumstances. She negotiated with her husband through the auspices of Sashadhar Mukherjee, seeking the separation of her finances from those of her husband as a condition for her return. Henceforth, she would be paid separately for working in his films, but he would be required to single-handedly pay the household expenses for the home in which both of them would live. Himanshu agreed to this, in order to save face in society and to prevent his studio from going bankrupt. Devika Rani returned to her marital home. However, things {{would never be the same}} between husband and wife again, and it is said that thenceforth, their relationship was largely confined to work and little or no intimacy transpired between them after this episode.|$|E
