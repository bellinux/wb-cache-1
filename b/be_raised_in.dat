5|$|An {{alternative}} mourning {{style is}} {{to wrap the}} spherical finial with black cloth and place a black ribbon, known as a , above the flag. This style {{dates back to the}} death of Emperor Meiji on July 30, 1912, and the Cabinet issued an ordinance stipulating that the national flag should <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> mourning when the Emperor dies. The Cabinet has the authority to announce the half-staffing of the national flag.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man, {{armed with}} a sniper rifle and {{surveillance}} equipment, spies on a meeting between Fox Mulder, Dana Scully, and the Lone Gunmen. Frohike claims to have discovered information about the Smoking Man's mysterious past, stating {{that his father was}} an executed communist spy and that his mother died of lung cancer, causing him to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> various Midwest orphanages.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} IIH is not known. The Monro-Kellie rule {{states that the}} {{intracranial}} pressure {{is determined by the}} amount of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood inside the bony cranial vault. Three theories therefore exist as to why the pressure might <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> IIH: an excess of CSF production, increased volume of blood or brain tissue, or obstruction of the veins that drain blood from the brain.|$|E

5|$|After Dorothy's wedding {{much of the}} {{documentation}} of Olivia's life ceases. She moved out of Brunswick Gardens in 1924, throwing away personal correspondence and giving away hundreds of books. Hope Shakespear died on 5 July 1923; within months Olivia moved to an apartment in West Kensington, taking with her two maids {{who had been with}} the family for decades. Her life continued unchanged, filled with social events. In September 1926, Dorothy gave birth to a son, Omar Pound, who in 1927 was brought from France to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> England. Olivia became his guardian and Dorothy spent summers with her mother and son.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} to this rule occurs during medal presentation ceremonies at multi-sport {{events such as the}} Olympics and Asian Games. As Hong Kong competes separately from mainland China, should an athlete from Hong Kong win the gold medal, and an athlete from mainland China win the silver and/or bronze medal(s) in the same event, the regional flag of Hong Kong would <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the centre above the national flag(s) during the medal presentation ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being an}} {{artillery}} tower {{with a flat}} roof to carry heavy guns, the tower was not initially supplied with any artillery and was therefore unable to protect Rye against the hostile naval expeditions which attacked the coast in the 1520s. After many letters to from Guldeford to the Lord Chancellor, Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, some guns finally arrived around 1536 {{in the form of}} wrought iron serpentines. Prescient concerns began to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the mid-1530s about whether the Camber might silt up further and ultimately become unusable as an anchorage.|$|E
50|$|McGurk, born as Mick Rushford, <b>in</b> Glasgow, Scotland, <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the Gorbals notorious {{slum area}} by his {{grandmother}} and brothers; although some media reports claim that Rushford <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Edinburgh.|$|R
50|$|The 9th Bavarian Mixed Landwehr Brigade <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the {{northern}} part of the Kingdom of Bavaria, in the III Bavarian Corps area. The 43rd Mixed Landwehr Brigade was from the XI Corps area (the Province of Hesse-Nassau and the smaller Thuringian states). The 45th Mixed Landwehr Brigade <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the Kingdom of Saxony. The 53rd Mixed Landwehr Brigade <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the Kingdom of Württemberg.|$|R
50|$|Every President and Vice President, <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> {{a family}} with affiliations with Christian religions. Only former President John F. Kennedy, and former Vice President Joe Biden <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Roman Catholic {{families}}. Two former presidents, Richard Nixon and Herbert Hoover, <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> as Quakers. All the rest <b>were</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> families affiliated with Protestant Christianity. However, many presidents have themselves had only a nominal affiliation with churches, and some never joined any church.|$|R
5|$|Lafayette's father {{likewise}} {{died on the}} battlefield. On 1 August 1759, Michel de Lafayette {{was struck}} by a cannonball while fighting a British-led coalition at the Battle of Minden in Westphalia. Lafayette became marquis and Lord of Chavaniac, but the estate went to his mother. Perhaps devastated by the loss of her husband, she went to live in Paris with her father and grandfather, leaving Lafayette to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Chavaniac-Lafayette by his paternal grandmother, Mme de Chavaniac, who had brought the château into the family with her dowry.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day 1997, the Commission {{announced}} it would support the Link with £32 million of funding, 42% of the project cost. The Wheel and its associated basin was priced at £17 million, more than {{a fifth of the}} total budget. Another £46 million had to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the next two years before construction could commence, with contributions from BWB, seven local councils, Scottish Enterprise, and private donations being augmented by £8.6 million from the European Regional Development Fund.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} argued before Judge (and later President) William Howard Taft, who {{held that the}} federal court could not prevent the removal of {{officers}} by injunction. He advised the Republicans to seek remedy quo warranto in the state courts. Taft further opined that, should any federal question <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> such proceedings, the officers could seek remedy in a federal court on appeal. The Republicans were encouraged by Taft's decision, which {{cleared the way for}} an appeal {{all the way to the}} federal Supreme Court if a federal question could be raised.|$|E

50|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War II led to {{expansion of the}} regiment, the 4th Battalion being re-raised in 1940; the 5th <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1941. An 11th (Territorial) Battalion had <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> Peshawar in 1939 for line of communication protection duties; the 6th Battalion <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> from this <b>in</b> 1941.|$|R
50|$|The Surrey Gentlemen and Yeomanry Cavalry <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1794, but disbanded in 1828. A Southwark Troop <b>was</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> 1831 {{and became}} a full Regiment in the same year. That too was disbanded in 1848.|$|R
5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults begging for food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The law {{requires}} the lowering {{of the flag}} to {{the midpoint of the}} flagpole on the days of mourning or during mourning ceremonies. A black ribbon needs to be placed {{at the top of the}} flag; the length of the ribbon should be equal to the length of the flag. The flying flag has to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> its entirety, clean, and unfaded; moreover, the lower part of the flag should be at least 2.5 m off the ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament becomes inflamed {{and there}} may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resporption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E

5|$|When {{a second}} Bosnian Muslim Waffen-SS {{division}} was to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> June 1944, the cadre {{was provided by}} the 13th SS Division and Raithel was appointed as the divisional commander. The 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian) never reached full divisional strength and did not see action as a formation, but elements of the division fought briefly in southern Hungary in early October 1944. The Bosnian Muslim members of the division mutinied on 17 October 1944, but Raithel quickly gained control over the situation. Following the mutiny, the division was formally disbanded on 31 October and reliable elements were absorbed by the 13th SS Division and the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division.|$|E
5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, where for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E

5|$|Raithel {{subsequently}} {{commanded a}} regiment {{of the newly}} formed 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian) and led it during fighting against the Yugoslav Partisans in the Independent State of Croatia. Raithel was seriously wounded in mid-1944 and was replaced. When a new Waffen-SS division was to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> June 1944, the cadre {{was provided by the}} 13th SS Division and Raithel was appointed as the divisional commander. The 23rd Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Kama (2nd Croatian) never reached full divisional strength and did not see action as a formation, but elements of the division fought briefly in southern Hungary in early October 1944. Raithel quickly suppressed a mutiny by the Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the division in mid-October 1944, but it was disbanded and its reliable troops were absorbed by the 13th SS Division and the 31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division. Raithel was then appointed to command a regiment of 6th SS Mountain Division Nord in Alsace, where his regiment fought the United States Army. He received a serious head wound during fighting northeast of Frankfurt in early April 1945 and was captured by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after birth, he {{was taken}} from his cradle and adopted by his {{maternal}} uncle Kaihupaʻa to <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> the Hawaiian custom of hānai, an informal form of adoption between extended families practiced by Hawaiian royals and commoners alike. His uncle had been educated by the American Protestant missionary Levi Chamberlain and had served his entire life as a personal assistant and servant to King Kamehameha III and later his successor Kamehameha IV. Iaukea {{was taken to the}} kingdom's capital at Honolulu to live with Kaihupaʻa and his wife Keliaipala. They lived near the grounds of the old ʻIolani Palace, in the building of the former Royal School. Renamed Halepoepoe (meaning circular or round house), this building had been turned into a home for royal retainers and the kahu (caretakers) for the reigning King Kamehameha IV. Around the time he was five or six, Iaukea fell into a well and his uncle Kaihupaʻa broke his foot in the process of saving him, later dying from the injuries he sustained.|$|E
5|$|The 28th (Māori) Battalion had {{its origins}} {{before the start}} of the Second World War. In mid-1939, as war in Europe began to be seen as inevitable, Sir Āpirana Ngata started to discuss {{proposals}} for the formation of a military unit made up of Māori volunteers similar to the Māori Pioneer Battalion that had served during the First World War. This proposal was furthered by two Māori MPs, Eruera Tirikatene and Paraire Paikea, and from this support within the Māori community for the idea began to grow as it was seen as an opportunity for Māoris to participate as citizens of the British Empire and to test their warrior skills. At first the New Zealand government was hesitant, but on 4 October, the decision was announced that the proposal would be accepted and that the battalion would <b>be</b> <b>raised</b> <b>in</b> addition to the nine battalions and support units that had already been formed into three brigades of the 2nd New Zealand Division.|$|E
