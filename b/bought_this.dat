5|$|The {{palace of}} Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's {{unfinished}} projects. She <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of Cardinal Jean du Bellay, after the latter's death in 1560. She then commissioned de l'Orme {{to finish the}} work he had begun there. Drawings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling {{the size of the}} pavilions next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and rusticated pilasters. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side.|$|E
5|$|An {{animated}} short, Mike's New Car, {{was made}} by Pixar in 2002 {{in which the two}} main characters have assorted misadventures with a car Mike has just <b>bought.</b> <b>This</b> film was not screened in theaters, but is included with all home video releases of Monsters, Inc., and on Pixar's Dedicated Shorts DVD. In August 2002, a manga version of Monsters, Inc. {{was made by}} Hiromi Yamafuji and distributed in Kodansha's Comic Bon Bon magazine in Japan; the manga was published in English by Tokyopop until it went out of print. A series of video games, including a multi-platform video game were created based on the film. The video games included Monsters, Inc., Monsters, Inc. Scream Team and Monsters, Inc. Scream Arena. A game titled Monsters, Inc. Run was released on the App Store for iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad on December 13, 2012.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the Icelandic airline Loftleidir {{was granted}} the {{concession}} to fly from Keflavík Airport outside Reykjavík to New York and Chicago in the United States, and to Oslo, Copenhagen and London. The company established a hub at Keflavík. Braathens SAFE and Loftleidir {{made an agreement}} where Braathens SAFE would lease personnel and mechanical services to Loftleidir, and the two would split profits from the joint venture evenly. This allowed the two airlines to have a continual route between Hong Kong and New York as long as Braathens SAFE's concession lasted. In 1954, another DC-4, LN-HHK, was <b>bought.</b> <b>This</b> aircraft was sold to Loftleidir the following year. In 1956, another DC-4, LN-SUP, was bought, and used for charter and by Loftleidir. In 1959 and 1960, Loftleidir received two new Douglas DC-6B aircraft, with a five-year mechanical agreement with Braathens SAFE. In 1960, the two companies agreed to terminate the cooperation from 1 January 1961.|$|E

5|$|The {{game had}} {{multiple}} versions for players to purchase. A season pass was announced on November 12, 2015. Players who <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> {{version of the}} game could gain early access to operators offered in the DLCs and receive several weapon skins. The game was also released alongside its Collector's Edition, which included the game's season pass, a hat, a compass and bottle opener, a backpack, and a 120-page guide. A Starter Edition was released on PC in June 2016, featuring all the maps, modes and weapons of the standard edition, and included two operators plus enough Rainbow 6 Credits to purchase two more of the player's choice (players could purchase {{the rest of the}} operators with Renown or Rainbow 6 Credits). The Starter Edition was cheaper than the main game, and was initially available for a limited time. In February 2017, the Starter Edition became permanently available via Uplay.|$|E

25|$|William Rausch and {{his wife}} Olga Rausch <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> {{property}} in 1894, but did not build a house on it until 1906. At that time, they erected a native limestone house, with a central gable and jig-cut decorative trim.|$|E

25|$|When the boilers of Nos.7 and 8 needed {{replacing}} {{they were}} withdrawn from service, but no new boilers were <b>bought.</b> <b>This</b> is {{probably due to}} the extra expense of superheaters, and to the reduced need for steam locomotives after the introduction of the diesels. Neither is likely to run in the foreseeable future.|$|E
25|$|Although Carlos Alberto Cabral only enjoyed Serralves {{for seven}} years, {{the fact that}} Delfim Ferreira <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> {{property}} enabled it to remain intact, {{as part of the}} commitment made by both, until it was purchased by the State in 1987. A unique project was preserved, ensuring that its character, initially private, attained a public purpose.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{thereafter}} {{attempted to}} use the closed Mandal Airport at Vestnessletta in Mandal {{as the basis for}} charter flights, but Mandal Municipal Council would not allow the reopening of the Second World War airport. The winter of 1953–54 had heavy snowfall and on 3 March 1954 the hangar roof collapsed. None of Sørfly's aircraft were damaged, although Kjevik Flyklubb's Piper Cub was. Sørfly <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> aircraft, restored it and sold it a year later.|$|E
50|$|HVB <b>bought</b> <b>tis</b> {{first two}} steam {{locomotives}} from Krauss & Co. of Germany. They were numbered 1 and 2, and named Holmestrand and Vittingfoss. The company also bought three two-axle passenger cars and twenty-four freight cars. In 1902, Holmestrand {{was sold to}} TEB, because they had problems with their locomotives. The railway bought three passenger carriages, one which also had a second class compartment. Although it had a standard almost comparable to NSB's first class, it saw little use and nearly all passengers traveled in third class.|$|R

25|$|When Edward Akroyd (1810–1887) <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> {{building}} in 1838, on his engagement to Elizabeth Fearby of York, {{it was a}} much smaller eight-roomed house, built ca 1800. He and his brother Henry were working for their father Jonathan Akroyd, a rich worsted mill owner, and living at Woodside Mansion in Boothtown. Jonathan died in 1848, and it was possibly Edward's inheritance which paid {{for the development of}} Bankfield which began around this time. Edward encased the 18th century {{building in}} fairfaced stone and added two loggias, a dining room, Anglican chapel and kitchens.|$|E
25|$|The nearby manor of Well Hall {{was home}} to Sir John Pulteney, four times Lord Mayor of the City of London, and later to wealthy Catholic William Roper and his wife Margaret (daughter of Sir Thomas More, known to Catholics as Saint Thomas More, Chancellor to King Henry VIII). In 1733 Sir Gregory Page <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> estate for £19,000 and {{demolished}} Roper House, building Page House – later known as Well Hall House – on the site. Until its demolition in 1931, Well Hall House variously served as a home to watchmaker John Arnold, and later to socialist Hubert Bland and author Edith Nesbit.|$|E
25|$|Wholesalers in Manhattan faced {{expensive}} time, transportation, {{and labor}} costs when importing and then re-sending goods. So in 1895, Irving T. Bush, {{working under the}} name of his family's company, The Bush Co., organized six warehouses and one pier on the waterfront of South Brooklyn as a freight handling terminal. There had only been one warehouse on the site in 1890, and before that, the land contained an oil refinery belonging to the Bush & Denslow company of Rufus T. Bush, Irving T. Bush's father. Standard Oil <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> refinery in the 1880s and dismantled it, but after Rufus T. Bush's death in 1890, Irving T. Bush later bought the land back using his father's inheritance.|$|E

25|$|The Lynx proved {{unreliable}} for {{the first}} decade of operation. The aircraft had a large number of technical problems, which were aggravated through long delivery times for spare parts. Secondly the 337 had high turnover, amongst both pilots and mechanics. This caused an excessive number of flight hours to be used for training instead of service. The latter was largely solved when the number of crew members was cut from six to three. This gave each crew member more tasks, which increased the contentment and decreased turnover. Along with Denmark, Germany and Netherlands, a simulator was <b>bought.</b> <b>This</b> allowed more training there. Combined this allowed the Lynx to operate the requested number of service hours from 1992.|$|E
25|$|The {{second major}} flaw arose because a large {{proportion}} of the land in the new colony was bought for speculative reasons by people who had no intention of migrating to New Zealand and developing the land they had <b>bought.</b> <b>This</b> meant that the new colonies had a serious shortage of employers and consequently a shortage of work for the labouring classes. From the outset the New Zealand Company was forced to be the major employer in the new colonies and this proved a serious financial drain on the company. Repeated approaches were made to the British government seeking financial assistance and in late 1846 the company accepted an offer for a £236,000 advance with strict conditions on, and oversight of, future company operations.|$|E
25|$|The first {{peoples of}} New York are {{estimated}} to have arrived around 10,000 BC. Around AD 800, Iroquois ancestors moved into the area from the Appalachian region. The people of the Point Peninsula Complex were the predecessors of the Algonquian peoples of New York. By around 1100, the distinct Iroquoian-speaking and Algonquian-speaking cultures that would eventually be encountered by Europeans had developed. The five nations of the Iroquois League developed a powerful confederacy about the 15th century that controlled territory throughout present-day New York, into Pennsylvania around the Great Lakes. For centuries, the Mohawk cultivated maize fields in the lowlands of the Mohawk River, which were later taken over by Dutch settlers at Schenectady, New York when they <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> territory. The Iroquois nations to the west also had well-cultivated areas and orchards.|$|E

25|$|On 28 November 2011 the {{prefecture}} of Fukushima {{reported the}} find of cesium-contaminated rice, up to 1050 Becquerels per kilogram, in samples of 3 {{farms in the}} city Date {{at a distance of}} 50kilometers from the Fukushima Daiichi reactors. Some 9 kilo's of this crops were already sold locally before this date. Officials tried to find out who <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> rice. Because of this and earlier finds the government of the prefecture Fukushima decided to control more than 2300 farms in the whole district on cesium-contamination. A more precise number was mentioned by the Japanese newspaper The Mainichi Daily News: on 29 November orders were given to 2381 farms in Nihonmatsu and Motomiya to suspend part of their rice shipments. This number added to the already halted shipments at 1941 farms in 4 other districts including Date, raised the total to 4322 farms.|$|E
25|$|Scotsman James Stokes {{had arrived}} in Western Australia in 1834 {{at the age of}} 24. He saw the {{opportunity}} {{in the market for a}} brewery, and investigated potential sites. Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe had set aside a small triangular lot for use as a brewery; this block was bounded by Spring Street, Mount Street and St Georges Terrace. Stokes preferred the much larger block across Spring Street, which extended almost all the way to the riverfront. The site was more suitable because it featured a natural spring, there was a sufficient different in elevation to enable the use of gravity in the brewing process without the need for a large tower. The proximity to the river also made river transport an attractive option. Stokes <b>bought</b> <b>this</b> land from George Leake, and was operating his brewery by 1837. Although the brewery was named the Albion Brewery after the ancient name for Great Britain, it was more popularly known as Stokes' Brewery. It was the colony's first major stand-alone brewery.|$|E
