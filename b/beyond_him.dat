Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board had been set up under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was <b>beyond</b> <b>him,</b> Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E
5|$|Tulsidas {{hints at}} several places in his works, {{that he had}} met {{face to face with}} Hanuman and Rama. The {{detailed}} account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the Bhaktirasbodhini of Priyadas. According to Priyadas' account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water pot. On his return to the city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a Preta (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon. Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama with his eyes, to which the Preta responded that it was <b>beyond</b> <b>him.</b> However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised in the mean attire of a leper to listen to his Katha, he is the first to arrive and last to leave.|$|E

Then on July 2, 1863 for gallant and meritorius service in the Gettysburg Campaign he is breveted to colonel. However his new commander quickly makes a mistake that would be costly to Starr and the 6th Cavalry.|$|E
25|$|At his death, Wren was 90 (N.S.). Even {{the men he}} {{had trained}} and who owed much of their success to Wren's {{original}} and leadership were no longer young. Newer generations of architects were beginning to look past Wren's style. The Baroque school his apprentices had created was already under fire from a new generation that brushed Wren's reputation aside and looked back <b>beyond</b> <b>him</b> to Inigo Jones. Architects of the 18th century could not forget Wren, {{but they could not}} forgive some elements in his work they deemed unconventional. The churches left the strongest mark on subsequent architecture. In France, where English architecture rarely made much impression, the influence of St Paul's Cathedral {{can be seen in the}} church of Sainte-Geneviève (now the Panthéon); begun in 1757, it rises to a drum and dome similar to St Paul's, and there are other versions inspired by Wren's dome, from St Isaac's (1840–42) in St Petersburg to the US Capitol at Washington, D.C. (1855–65).|$|E
25|$|According to {{the sources}} {{identified}} below, Juan Diego was an Indian born in 1474 in Cuauhtitlan, {{and at the}} time of the apparitions he lived there or in Tolpetlac. Although not destitute, he was neither rich nor influential. His religious fervor, his artlessness, his respectful but gracious demeanour towards the Virgin Mary and the initially skeptical Bishop Juan de Zumárraga, as well as his devotion to his sick uncle and, subsequently, to the Virgin at her shrine – all of which are central to the tradition – are among his defining characteristics and testify to the sanctity of life which is the indispensable criterion for canonization. He and his wife, María Lucía, were among the first to be baptized after the arrival of the main group of twelve Franciscan missionaries in Mexico in 1524. His wife died two years before the apparitions, although one source (Luis Becerra Tanco, possibly through inadvertence) claims she died two years after them. There is no firm tradition as to their marital relations. It is variously reported (a) that after their baptism he and his wife were inspired by a sermon on chastity to live celibately; alternatively (b) that they lived celibately throughout their marriage; and in the further alternative (c) that both of them lived and died as virgins. Alternatives (a) and (b) may not necessarily conflict with other reports that Juan Diego (possibly by another wife) had a son. Intrinsic to the narrative is Juan Diego's uncle, Juan Bernardino; but <b>beyond</b> <b>him,</b> María Lucía, and Juan Diego's putative son, no other family members are mentioned in the tradition. At least two 18th-century nuns claimed to be descended from Juan Diego. After the apparitions, Juan Diego was permitted to live next to the hermitage erected at the foot of the hill of Tepeyac, and he dedicated the rest of his life to serving the Virgin Mary at the shrine erected in accordance with her wishes. The date of death (in his 74th year) is given as 1548.|$|E

Those who believe {{the people from the}} freighter to be dangerous, Ben among them, join Locke and head to the Barracks. After Ben confesses the freighter crew has come to capture him, Miles Straume (Ken Leung), a medium from the freighter, makes a deal with Ben, asking for $3.2 million in exchange for reporting Ben as dead to Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), the man who sent the freighter. Ben agrees after Miles rebuffs his claims such a small fortune is <b>beyond</b> <b>him.</b> Ben eventually gets his freedom when he tells Locke who sent the freighter. Once free, Ben urges Alex, and her boyfriend and mother, to travel to the Temple, for protection from the people on the freighter. However, they are ambushed en route by mercenaries from the freighter and all but Alex are killed. Alex is taken hostage after revealing herself to be Ben's daughter. In [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", Martin Keamy (Kevin Durand), the leader of the mercenaries, threatens to shoot Alex if Ben does not come forward; Ben staunchly denies any attachment to her, which results in her execution. Ben claims Widmore has [...] "changed the rules", then summons the smoke monster to attack the mercenaries. He then leaves with Locke and Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to communicate with Jacob. Locke enters Jacob's cabin alone, and returns stating they need to move the Island. They go to the , a Dharma station which allows them to do this. Ben sends Locke to become the new leader of the Others, then enters a secret level of the Orchid. He turns a large frozen wheel in the wall, which teleports the Island to a new location. Ben himself is transported to the Sahara Desert, specifically, Tunisia, which was formerly the ancient country of Carthage.|$|E

2500|$|In his memoirs, Berlioz {{described}} in excruciating detail the intense frustrations he experienced {{in seeing the}} work performed. For five years (from 1858 to 1863), the Paris Opéra – the only suitable stage in Paris – vacillated. Finally, tired of waiting, he agreed to let Léon Carvalho, director of the smaller Théâtre Lyrique, mount a production {{of the second half}} of the opera with the title Les Troyens à Carthage. It consisted of Acts 3 to 5, redivided by Berlioz into five acts, to which he added an orchestral introduction (Lamento) and a prologue. As Berlioz noted bitterly, he agreed to let Carvalho do it [...] "despite the manifest impossibility of his doing it properly. He had just obtained an annual subsidy of a hundred thousand francs from the government. None the less the enterprise was <b>beyond</b> <b>him.</b> His theater was not large enough, his singers were not good enough, his chorus and orchestra were small and weak." ...|$|E
2500|$|The joke is {{on several}} poets {{cultivated}} by Junimea, who were entirely different {{in style and}} approach. Draft versions of the poem specify the main targets: Junimist poet-soldier Theodor Șerbănescu, and, <b>beyond</b> <b>him,</b> the [...] "Young Germany" [...] idol Heinrich Heine. In Cugetările, Eminescu introduces the derisive neologisms a heiniza, [...] "to Heinefy", and motănime, [...] "cat swarm", which alternate and contrast with words from the deeper layers of the Romanian lexis. Like some German theorists of the day, Eminescu was convinced that [...] "gen'rous youngsters" [...] everywhere had made it their mission to destroy civilization, referring to them as [...] "idiots" [...] with [...] "rotten bodies"; as noted by scholar Ioana Pârvulescu, Dionis is ostensibly a poet by vocation, capable of putting together accomplished verse on a dare. The Cugetările addendum, Simion believes, explains that Poor Dionis should not {{be read as a}} passive and contemplative scenario: [...] "The image of the world as the insipid dream of a tomcat seems a daring minimization of philosophical concepts, curiously so in a spirit such as Eminescu's, that is so very attracted to speculative matters. However, once we hold everything up to the poet's polemical intent, his parody of meditation and mockery of cosmogonic representations reveal their true significance." ...|$|E

Their relationship began two years later during the filming of Tarana (1951 film. They became a romantic pair appearing in a total of four films together. Actor Shammi Kapoor recalled that [...] "Dilip Kumar would drive down from Bombay to meet Madhubala... he even flew to Bombay to spend Eid with her, taking time off from his shooting stint..." [...] But, Madhubala's father Ataullah Khan did not give them permission to marry. Dilip Kumar said: [...] "She was a very, very obedient daughter", and who, in spite of the success, fame and wealth, submitted to the domination of her father and more often than not paid for his mistakes. [...] "This inability to leave her family was her greatest drawback", believed Shammi Kapoor, [...] "for {{it had to be done}} at some time." [...] The Naya Daur (1957 film) court case happened in 1956 when Dilip Kumar testified against Madhubala and her father in favor of director B.R. Chopra in open court. This struck a fatal blow to the Dilip-Madhubala relationship as it ended any chance of reconciliation between Dilip Kumar and Madhubala'a father. Reflecting on this, while Dilip Kumar said he was [...] "trapped", Shammi Kapoor felt [...] "this was something which went <b>beyond</b> <b>him</b> (Dilip) and he couldn’t control the whole situation..." ...|$|E
