5|$|Gernsback's {{recovery}} from the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judgment</b> was remarkably quick. By early June he had launched three new magazines, two of which published science fiction. The June 1929 issue of Science Wonder Stories appeared on newsstands on 5May 1929, and was followed on 5June by the July 1929 issue of Air Wonder Stories. Both magazines were monthly, with Gernsback as editor-in-chief and David Lasser as editor. Lasser had no prior editing experience and knew little about science fiction, but his recently acquired degree from MIT convinced Gernsback to hire him.|$|E

Personal property may be acquired by occupancy (including the accessio, commixtio, and confusio of Roman law), by invention, as patent and copyright, or by transfer, either by the act of the law (as in <b>bankruptcy,</b> <b>judgment</b> and intestacy), or by the act of the party (as in gift, contract and will).|$|E

50|$|Re Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd is a 1998 {{judgment}} {{from the}} Supreme Court of Canada regarding {{the priority of}} employees interests when a company declares <b>bankruptcy.</b> The <b>judgment</b> hinged on {{the interpretation of the}} Employment Standards Act and has been taken to mark the Supreme Court of Canada's adoption of the purposive approach to legislative interpretation. It has since been frequently cited in subsequent decisions of Canadian courts, nearly every time legislation is interpreted.|$|R
50|$|In December 2008 Eclipse 400 {{position}} holders requesting refunds {{reported that}} their deposits had not been refunded and that telephone calls to the company were not being returned. According to the purchase contracts the deposits were fully refundable until November 2009. Court documents filed by Eclipse 400 position holders {{as part of the}} bankruptcy hearings alleged that the company misappropriated the US$3.2M collected from depositors, did not escrow it as contracted to do so and refused to refund it when required to. The Eclipse <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judgment</b> ordered the amount held in escrow, pending the outcome of an adversarial court action of the deposits.|$|E
50|$|Goldaş {{has been}} {{involved}} in several major financial disputes since 2008. In March 2008, Société Générale filed suit against Goldaş for not returning a large consignment of gold. In September 2009, Bank of Nova Scotia and Commerzbank filed suits against Goldaş for US$10.9 million and US$11.1 million, respectively. In April 2013, a judgment from the Bakırköy Commercial Court of First Instance in Istanbul had been made in favor of Commerzbank to force the bankruptcy of Goldaş; they announced their plans to appeal the verdict while still engaged with Bank of Nova Scotia in the Istanbul Anatolia Commercial Court of First Instance. Later that year, Turkey's High Court of Appeals effectively reversed the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judgment</b> of the lower Turkish court by heeding Goldaş's request for adjudication under British law before subjugation under Turkish bankruptcy law.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of {{bankruptcy}} filing on 25 November 2008 Eclipse had delivered 259 EA500s. Aircraft serial number 260 had been paid for {{on the morning of}} and in advance of the filing. The company had signed the bill of sale for the aircraft, but refused to release the aircraft to its owner. The aircraft had actually been ready to be delivered to the owners on 21 November 2008, but remained at the factory to have some discrepancies rectified. The keys had been given to the owners prior to the bankruptcy filing, but company security refused to let the aircraft taxi for departure. The dispute resulted in a court filed motion as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. In addition to damages and a declaratory judgment of ownership of the aircraft or the return of the money paid, the plaintiffs in the case alleged unjust enrichment, conversion and tortious interference. The bankruptcy judge noted the fate of this particular aircraft and in the final <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judgment</b> of 23 January 2009 ordered it released to its owner within five business days of the closing of the sale of the company assets. Due to the incomplete Chapter 11 procedure and move to Chapter 7, the order was delayed. The aircraft was finally released and was registered to its owner on 4 June 2009.|$|E
50|$|Rich's {{judgments}} are {{generally considered to}} be clear and concise. Some commentators attribute this more to laziness than to a knack for clarity. It was often rumoured that fellow justice (and later Chief Justice) Owen Dixon wrote many of Rich's judgments for him, and Dixon recorded in his papers that on one occasion (the case of Isaacs v McKinnon), in an appeal from the Federal Court of <b>Bankruptcy,</b> Rich's <b>judgment</b> was written by the judge whose decision was being appealed.|$|R
25|$|Smith {{claimed that}} J. Howard had orally promised her {{half of his}} estate if she married him. In September 2000, a Los Angeles {{bankruptcy}} judge awarded her $449,754,134. In July 2001, Houston judge Mike Wood affirmed the jury findings in the probate case by ruling that Smith was entitled to nothing. The judge ordered Smith to pay over $1million in fees and expenses to Pierce's legal team. The conflict between the Texas probate court and California <b>bankruptcy</b> court <b>judgments</b> forced the matter into federal court.|$|R
50|$|The {{misappropriation}} {{lawsuit by}} MTH eventually went to trial, and on June 7, 2004, {{a jury in}} Detroit, Michigan found Lionel liable and awarded MTH US$40,775,745. On November 1, 2004, a federal judge upheld the jury's decision. Lionel announced it would appeal, and two weeks later filed for <b>bankruptcy,</b> citing the <b>judgment</b> as the main reason. On December 14, 2006, the judgment was overturned on appeal, citing legal mistakes in the jury trial, and a new trial ordered.|$|R
50|$|During the probate proceedings, Smith {{declared}} bankruptcy in California and was awarded $474 million as a sanction for alleged misconduct. In 2002, the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>judgment</b> was vacated and her award {{was reduced to}} $88 million in a Federal District Court in California. In December 2004, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the District Court decision under the probate exception, ruling that the federal courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over state probate matters. The Ninth Circuit decision also affirmed the primacy of Texas Probate decision which determined that no misconduct had taken place and that Smith {{was not one of}} J. Howard Marshall's heirs. However, on May 1, 2006, the Supreme Court in Marshall v. Marshall reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision regarding the probate exception, allowing Smith another opportunity to pursue her claims in federal court. The case was remanded to the Ninth Circuit for adjudication of the remaining appellate issues. On June 25, 2009, the same three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on the remaining appellate issues. On March 19, 2010, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals issued its second opinion on remand, finding in favor of E. Pierce Marshall, that the California Bankruptcy Court did not have jurisdiction and the California Federal District Court was precluded from reviewing matters already decided in the Texas Probate Court.On September 28, 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court again agreed to hear the case. On June 23, 2011, the United States Supreme court decided the case in a 5-4 decision in favor of the Marshall family (now styled Stern v. Marshall 10-179). The majority of the Court decided Congress cannot constitutionally authorize non-Article III bankruptcy judges final order jurisdiction on state law based counterclaims to proofs of claim which are not necessary to resolve the claim itself.|$|E
50|$|Stuart made {{headlines}} in 1997 with his then-current Barricade Books, by reissuing The Turner Diaries, a novel {{thought to have}} been the inspiration behind Timothy McVeigh's bombing of the Murrah building. He was a strong advocate of freedom of the press, and believed it was important for {{people to be able to}} read and make up their own minds. (In the introduction he wrote to his reissue of The Turner Diaries, he made clear how strongly he opposed the viewpoint expressed in the book.) Also in the 1990s, casino mogul Steve Wynn sued Stuart over catalog copy. The copy on Running Scared, a biography of Wynn, made reference to a New Scotland Yard report that tied the Las Vegas tycoon to the Genovese Crime Family. (The book refuted some of the report's findings.) Stuart lost the libel case and was ordered to pay three million dollars in defamation, forcing him into <b>bankruptcy.</b> This <b>judgment</b> was overturned on appeal by the Nevada Supreme Court in 2001 and sent back for a new trial, which Wynn chose not to pursue.|$|R

50|$|The {{credit report}} also {{contains}} the borrowers past derogatory credit. This include collections, charge offs, repossession, foreclosures, <b>bankruptcies,</b> liens and <b>judgments.</b> Typically, {{if any of}} these items are present on the report, it increases the risk of the loan. For more serious blemishes such as foreclosures and bankruptcies, a lender may require up to two to seven years from the date of satisfaction indicated by the report before approving a loan. Furthermore, the lender may require the borrower to reestablish the credit by obtaining a certain amount of new credit to rebuild their credit. It is also the prerogative of the lender to require that all collections, charge offs, liens and judgments be paid prior to closing the loan.|$|R
