50|$|Nintendo Badge Arcade {{takes place}} in an arcade filled with {{machines}} known as Badge Catchers, each containing badges based on various Nintendo franchises such as Super Mario, Animal Crossing, The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, and Pokémon which are reorganised regularly. The arcade is hosted by a pink, anthropomorphic rabbit character called Arcade Bunny, who always greets the player, and often introduces promotional events. The Badge Catchers are viewed from a 2d side-on perspective. Similar to real-life UFO catchers, players must move the catcher's claw side to side, pick up badges, and try and drop them off the bottom-left of the screen. They can accomplish this by simply picking them up, or use other techniques such as pushing them or causing land-slides (this only works {{if there is a}} big pile of badges). Some Badge Catchers use alternate means of obtaining badges. The Hammer Arm knocks badges sideways towards the hole, the <b>Bomb</b> <b>Arm</b> blasts badges away in all directions, and the Stick Arm (which originally went unused, but was first revealed on April 28, 2016 in Japan) sticks badges onto the arm. Any badges that the player obtains can be placed on the Nintendo 3DS' HOME Menu, with certain badges able to launch some of the 3DS' built-in applications. Most badges can also be used as decorations for the Swapdoodle messaging app.|$|E

5|$|In {{the context}} of the Berlin Blockade in June 1948, the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Hoyt S. Vandenberg met with Forrestal to report the poor state of SAC. Following this meeting, Norstad {{recommended}} that Vandenberg replace Kenney, and Vandenberg quickly agreed, choosing Lieutenant General Curtis LeMay as the man he would prefer to lead the strategic <b>bombing</b> <b>arm</b> in case of war with the USSR. LeMay was made leader of SAC, and Kenney became commander of the Air University, a position he held from October 1948 until his retirement from the Air Force in September 1951.|$|R
50|$|In 1936, Germany's {{increasing}} {{air power}} was feared by British government planners who commonly overestimated its size, reach and hitting power. Planners used estimates {{of up to}} 72 British deaths per tonne of bombs dropped, though this figure was grossly exaggerated. As well, the planners {{did not know that}} German bombing aircraft of the day (not quite 300 Junkers Ju 52 medium bombers) did not have the range to reach the UK with a load of bombs and return to the mainland. British air officers did nothing to correct these perceptions because they could see the usefulness of having a strong <b>bombing</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R

During Operation Safed Sagar from June–July 1999, two Mirage squadrons flew a total of 514 sorties.

Produced by the subsidiary of Norinco, the Harbin Jiancheng Group (哈尔滨建成集团有限公司), Polar star 500 was shown to the public at the airshow, named after 500 kg gravity bomb used. However, the developer confirmed that gravity bombs of other different sizes are available upon customer's requests.

In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|R

5000|$|TG-100/250/500/1000: At the 9th Zhuhai Airshow held in November 2012, it was {{revealed}} that a family of laser-guided bombs (LGB) utilizing LT PGB upgrade kit was designated as Tian Ge series (or Tiange, 天戈 in Chinese, which is the ancient Chinese name for Boötes). Produced by the subsidiary of Norinco, the Harbin Jiancheng Group (哈尔滨建成集团有限公司), a total of four models of Boötes series were shown at the airshow, including Boötes-100, Boötes-250, Boötes-500 and Boötes-10000, (TG-100/250/500/1000) named after 100/250/500/1000 kg iron bombs used. The marketing of Boötes series LGBs suggests that the LT LGB upgrade conversion kit, as well as the <b>bombs</b> <b>armed</b> with such conversion upgrade kits, the Boötes series, are both available for export.

25|$|AWRE's {{trickery}} {{with the}} steel balls had other unintended outcomes. Even an event as inconsequential as early morning frost was an issue.

If the steel balls froze together inside the bomb cavity {{and could not be}} removed, the bomb was useless. AWRE's solution was to fit the bomb with an electric blanket. Because the <b>bombs</b> were <b>armed</b> before flight, the take-off was hazardous; the bombs could not be jettisoned, and landing with an <b>armed</b> <b>bomb</b> on return to base was too hazardous to contemplate. As a consequence, Violet Club could not be used on an airborne alert, or even flown to a remote dispersal base.|$|R

5|$|On taking {{command of}} the squadron, he chose to stop flying {{personally}} in order to concentrate on administration, a decision which was regarded dismissively by his men; relations were strained until January 1916, when he demonstrated his courage by walking into a burning bomb store to try to control the fire. He was awarded the Albert Medal for this act on the personal recommendation of General Hugh Trenchard, and in February 1916 was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of Training No. 6 Wing in England. In December 1916 he took command of No. 9 Wing in France, a long-range bomber and reconnaissance formation, and in October 1917 took {{command of the}} newly formed No. 41 Wing. This was upgraded as the 8th Brigade in December, with Newall promoted accordingly to the temporary rank of brigadier-general on 28 December 1917. During 1918, it joined the Independent Bombing Force, which was the main strategic <b>bombing</b> <b>arm</b> of the newly formed Royal Air Force.

50|$|In March 1942 the {{strategic}} <b>bombing</b> <b>arm</b> of the Soviet Union was reorganized as the Long Range Air Force (ADD). It raided Berlin from 26-29 August {{and again on}} the night of 9-10 September with 212 planes. It raided Helsinki {{for the first time on}} 24 August, Budapest on 4-5 and 9-10 September and Bucharest on 13-14 September. The German-occupied Polish cities of Kraków and Warsaw were not exempt, but the bombers concentrated primarily on military targets. There were 1,114 sorties over Germany in 1942. In March 1943 there was a strategic shift: in preparation for the Kursk Offensive, the bombers were directed against the German railroads behind the front. In April the Long Range Air Force expanded to eight air corps and eleven independent divisions containing 700 planes. After the Kursk preparations, the Soviets turned their attention to administrative and industrial targets in East Prussia in April. With 920 aircraft taking part, they dropped 700 tonnes of bombs there. The largest Soviet bomb of the war, an 11,000-pound weapon, was dropped on Königsberg during one of these raids.|$|R
