5|$|OutKast {{made a deal}} to hold Polaroid cameras {{during some}} of its performances. Polaroid does not release sales figures, but its public image, {{previously}} in decline with {{the growing popularity of}} digital cameras, was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> song.|$|E
5|$|The 1956 team {{repeated}} as NL champions; {{the team}} was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> play of Duke Snider, who hit a league-leading 43 home runs and also {{led the league in}} walks. They fell to third place (84-70) in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. The argument is <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> presence of symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.|$|E

50|$|The {{economic}} situation of <b>the</b> town was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> opening of <b>the</b> railway line Karlovy Vary-Johanngeorgenstadt in 1899.|$|R
5|$|The city of Arlington {{plans to}} {{increase}} the number of jobs within the city to over 20,000 by 2035, <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> proposed designation of the Arlington-Marysville Manufacturing Industrial Center by the Puget Sound Regional Council. The industrial center, located between the two cities near Smokey Point, already includes major distribution centers and other light industry.|$|E
5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because of the mass of the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fresh troops, the Spartans {{and their}} Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against the trench. The presence of more adversaries intensified Pyrrhus' determination {{to capture the}} city and he ordered another attack on the trenches. He was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses. The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about the futility of persevering with the siege {{and he decided to}} lift it and withdraw.|$|E
50|$|As of July 2017, the {{declared}} {{candidates are}} relatively {{unknown to the}} state's voters. Their identification by Democratic voters was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> addressing <b>the</b> 2017 state Democratic Convention, which saw its largest attendance of around 3,000 delegates in years.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the province was <b>bolstered</b> further <b>by</b> <b>the</b> construction of the Saint Petersburg-Riihimäki railroad in 1870, the Viborg-Joensuu railroad in 1894 and the Petrograd-Hiitola railroad in 1917.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> their victory, <b>the</b> Cossack and Tatar forces {{engaged with}} the troops of Hetman Mikołaj Potocki and {{defeated}} them at the Battle of Korsuń.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} coronation, Mindaugas {{transferred}} some lands to the Livonian Order – portions of Samogitia, Nadruva, and Dainava—although his control over these western lands was tenuous. There {{has been much}} discussion among historians as to whether in later years (1255–1261) Mindaugas gave even more lands to the order. The deeds might have been falsified by the order; the case for this scenario is <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that some of}} the documents mention lands that were not actually under the control of Mindaugas and by various irregularities in treaty witnesses and seals.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani {{ascended to}} the throne on January 29, 1891, nine days after her brother's death. During her reign, she {{attempted}} to draft a new constitution which would restore {{the power of the}} monarchy and the voting rights of the economically disenfranchised. Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the Bayonet Constitution, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> landing of US Marines under John L. Stevens to protect American interests, which rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 5th Battalion moved {{north of}} Khafji to block Iraqi {{reinforcements}} attempting {{to reach the}} city. This unit was further <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade, and heavily aided by Coalition air support. Although fear of friendly fire forced the 8th Ministry of Defense and Aviation Brigade to pull back the following morning, Coalition aircraft successfully hindered Iraqi attempts to move more soldiers down to Khafji and caused large numbers of Iraqi troops to surrender to Saudi forces.|$|E
50|$|As in all {{previous}} inter-war elections, the Independent group won {{a majority of}} the seats and this majority was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> holding <b>the</b> majority of the aldermanic seats also. <b>By</b> 1937 <b>the</b> Labour Party held almost all the seats in the industrial eastern part of the county.|$|R
50|$|This {{meeting was}} a support {{event of the}} 1997 Australian Grand Prix. The thin Super Touring field was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> cars from <b>the</b> Australian GT-Production Car Championship (indicated in italics).|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s, a {{succession}} of civil union bills were regularly introduced and rejected in Parliament, <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> discussion in <b>the</b> European Parliament on equal rights for homosexuals on marriage and adoption.|$|R
5|$|The Polish {{soldiers}} {{serving in}} the Dąbrowski Legion were granted Lombardian citizenship and were paid the same wage as other troops. They were allowed {{to use their own}} unique Polish-style uniforms, with some French and Lombardian symbols, and were commanded by other Polish speakers. By early February 1797 the Legion was 1,200 strong, having been <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> arrival of many new recruits who had deserted from the Austrian army.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to Arkansas {{and became a}} law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, Clinton was elected.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{failure of}} the English Short Parliament, the Scottish Parliament {{declared}} itself capable of governing without the king's consent, and in August 1640 the Covenanter army moved into the English county of Northumberland. Following the illness of the earl of Northumberland, who was the king's commander-in-chief, Charles and Strafford went north to command the English forces, despite Strafford being ill himself {{with a combination of}} gout and dysentery. The Scottish soldiery, many of whom were veterans of the Thirty Years' War, had far greater morale and training compared to their English counterparts. They met virtually no resistance until reaching Newcastle upon Tyne, where they defeated the English forces at the Battle of Newburn and occupied the city, as well as the neighbouring county of Durham.|$|E
50|$|His {{lessons in}} magic were <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> visits from <b>the</b> Phantom Stranger, {{and he had}} a sexual {{relationship}} with Madame Xanadu, but she refused to marry him because she saw his future.|$|R
50|$|Tavecchio contributed {{in other}} ways, too. After hitting the field goal that put Cal ahead for good, the kicker tackled Arizona's Travis Cobb on a kickoff return. <b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> Cobb's return, <b>the</b> Wildcats drove deep into Cal territory.|$|R
50|$|Crestwood has a {{very active}} SEN policy, with a higher than average {{proportion}} of SEN pupils than most other schools, this has been <b>bolstered</b> recently <b>by</b> <b>the</b> introduction of a scheme whereby Crestwood becomes the major centre for deaf or hard of hearing pupils throughout the Dudley Metropolitan Borough.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the box office and critical success of the film itself, the Mermaid soundtrack album earned two awards at the 33rd Grammy Awards in 1991: the Grammy Award for Best Album for Children and the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. <b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> film's success and the soundtrack's Oscars, Golden Globes and Grammy Awards, was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in September 1990 for shipments of two million copies of the soundtrack album, an unheard of feat for an animated film at the time. To date, the soundtrack has been certified six times platinum.|$|E
5|$|Partly as {{a result}} of Marshall's attacks on {{prominent}} Democratic-Republicans such as Governor Shelby, the Federalists gained influence in the state legislature. The Federalist cause was also <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> quashing of the Whiskey Rebellion by federal forces in 1794, and the federal victory over the Northwest Indians at the Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794. Later that year, the Federalists in the General Assembly nominated Marshall for the United States Senate. On the first ballot, Marshall garnered 18 votes, compared with 16 for Democratic-Republican John Breckinridge, 8 for John Fowler, and 7 for incumbent John Edwards. On the runoff ballot that followed, Marshall defeated Breckinridge by a vote of 2822.|$|E
5|$|While the {{cultivation}} of grapes and fruit trees supported a flourishing wine industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the effects of Prohibition and a legacy of restrictive laws after its repeal devastated the industry. For 50 years, New Jersey was limited by law to one winery license for every 1,000,000 state residents, which by 1980 effectively allowed for only seven wineries. The growth of the state's winery industry has been <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 1981 New Jersey Farm Winery Act, which repealed many Prohibition-era laws and allowed many small growers to open new wineries.|$|E
25|$|On 20 December, <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> {{reinforcements}} from <b>the</b> 12th Volksgrenadier Division, the Germans attacked {{from the}} south and east. This too failed. On 21 December, the Germans tried to bypass Dom Butgenbach to the southwest. A few German armored units penetrated Butgenbach, but the 2nd Battalion assisted by some reinforcements stopped them again.|$|R
50|$|Fearing {{that the}} strike would {{spread to other}} cities, the Federal Government ordered Senator Gideon Decker Robertson to mediate the dispute. After hearing both sides, Robertson settled in favour of the strikers and {{encouraged}} Council to accept the civic employee's proposal. <b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> their success, <b>the</b> labour unions would use striking again to gain other labour and union reforms.|$|R
50|$|From 28 June he had {{received}} an income from the fiefdoms of hundreds of Håbo, Ärlinghundra and Lagunda. In 1595 he came into conflict with his mother over sharing the proceeds from his fiefdoms. Sofia's income was in danger, but the issue was solved when King Charles forced him to return the fiefdoms, which were given to his mother. Gustav's income was later <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> getting <b>the</b> rights to the church tithes. In 1597 he also received the rights of Haguna hundred and the parishes of Lagunda and Håbo that were not under Sofia's control.|$|R
5|$|As at Northampton, Chapman's tactics {{were based}} upon the {{principles}} of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers, who would pass low inside the defence instead of crossing from the byline. He had been granted control of all footballing affairs at the club and made this responsibility work to his advantage, encouraging the club's reserve and third teams to play the same style of football so that their players would function effectively in the first team if selected. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network {{to find the right}} players for his tactical system. <b>Bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> money from the cup run, Chapman was able to make further signings such as goalkeeper Ted Taylor and forward Charlie Wilson (later to be joined by George Cook).|$|E
5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact {{that none of the}} money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as hot as the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|In March 2014, Bush {{announced}} her first live concerts in several decades: a 22-night residency called Before the Dawn in London from 26 August – 1 October 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo. Tickets {{sold out in}} 15 minutes. The concerts received positive reviews. In August 2014, <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> publicity around her upcoming performances, {{she became the first}} female performer to have eight albums in the Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart simultaneously, putting her at number three for simultaneous UK Top 40 albums (behind Elvis Presley with 12 albums in 1977, and The Beatles in 2009 with 11 albums. Note that in January 2016 following his death, David Bowie joined Elvis in the number one position with 12 albums); altogether she had 11 albums in the top 50. An eponymous three-disc album of recordings from Before the Dawn was released 25 November 2016.|$|E
50|$|Accreditation brings several {{significant}} benefits. Primarily, {{it improves}} public safety services <b>by</b> comparing <b>the</b> New Jersey State Police {{to the best}} procedures currently used by law enforcement and raising any non-compliant areas up to those standards. Additionally, it creates accountability to a respected benchmarking group that knows the work of modern policing. Public trust is <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> way of <b>the</b> transparency involved in the whole CALEA accreditation process.|$|R
2500|$|However, it was {{not until}} 1949 that the Free Birkenhead Public Library was {{established}} {{in the basement of the}} Council Chambers, opening on 14 November. It was a modest beginning, <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> support from <b>the</b> National Library. There was an initial budget of £500 (about $35,984 in 1st Quarter of 2017). The library began with a collection of around 1500 items, [...] "swelled by about another twenty books a month." ...|$|R
50|$|The Jewish {{community}} grew slowly until World War II. It was <b>bolstered</b> <b>by</b> {{refugees in}} <b>the</b> late 1930s and peaked at about 2,100. During the Nazi occupation of Norway, nearly all Jews were either deported to death camps or fled to Sweden and beyond. The Jews fleeing to Sweden were {{in many cases}} assisted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian underground movement, consisting mostly of non-Jewish Norwegians, but sometimes had to pay guides to lead them over the border.|$|R
