Suddenly, they notice the {{television}} broadcasting messages demanding that Earth surrender Mon-El or else. When they arrive at the DEO, Kara and Mon-El are informed by J'onn as they see a spaceship hovering around National City, and Mon-El has no explanation as to why they're after him. J'onn also wonders what happened to Winn, but he's spending time with Lyra at the museum. Kara decides {{to check out the}} ship, only to be met with weapons set on target and she dodges them only to be trapped inside a <b>bubble</b> <b>trap.</b> Mon-El intervenes, agreeing to turn himself in and they let Kara go. At the DEO, Mon-El tells Kara, J'onn, and Alex that he's ready to face the visiting aliens and prepares to beam aboard the ship, but a concerned Kara speeds off into his arms and are beamed up together. When they land on the ship, Kara is stunned to see the occupants bowing down to Mon-El. They are met by a couple, Lar-Gand and Rhea, who happen to not only be Mon-El's parents, but were the rulers of Daxam before its destruction — meaning Mon-El is the prince of the destroyed planet. Eventually, they apologize to Kara for trying to attack her.|$|E

A dynamic <b>bubble</b> <b>trap</b> might {{reduce the number of}} gaseous microemboli. MethodsA total of 50 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operation were recruited for this study. In 26 patients a dynamic <b>bubble</b> <b>trap</b> was placed between the arterial filter and the aortic cannula (group 1), and in 24 patients a placebo dynamic <b>bubble</b> <b>trap</b> was used (group 2). The number of high-intensity transient signals within the proximal middle cerebral artery was continuously measured on both sides during bypass, which was separated into 4 periods: phase 1, start of bypass until aortic clamping; phase 2, aortic clamping until rewarming; phase 3, rewarming until clamp removal; and phase 4, clamp removal until end of bypass. S 100 β values were measured before, immediately after, and 6 and 48 hours after the operation and before hospital discharge. ResultsThe bubble elimination rate during bypass was 77 % in group 1 and 28 % in group 2 (P <. 0001). The number of high-intensity signals was lower in group 1 during phase 1 (5. 8 ± 7. 3 vs 16 ± 15. 4, P <. 05 vs group 2) and phase 2 (6. 9 ± 7. 3 vs 24. 2 ± 27. 3, P <. 05 vs group 2) but not during phases 3 and 4. Serum S 100 β values were equally increased in both groups immediately after the operation. Group 2 patients had higher S 100 β values 6 hours after the operation and significantly higher S 100 β values 48 hours after the operation (0. 06 ± 0. 14 vs 0. 18 ± 0. 24, P =. 0133 vs group 2). Age and S 100 β values were correlated in group 2 but not in group 1.

40|$|Human {{response}} {{to drugs and}} environmental chemicals is often dramatically different from predictions made by conventional cell-based assays. Current in vitro methods for testing drug toxicity use a single cell type in a static culture environment, treated with a bolus dose. Such experiments do not capture the complex, dynamic response {{of the body to}} drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). Integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models allow prediction of pharmacological outcome from a give dosage, but have limitations in building realistic models. A micro cell culture analog (mu-CCA) is a microfluidic device based on a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, with multiple chambers each representing an organ or tissue on a silicon chip, with these chambers connected to emulate the blood circulation. This thesis work describes the combined approach of a PK-PD modeling and a mu-CCA platform, for testing the toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents. A PK-PD model was developed to predict tumor growth in a rat, treated with the chemotherapeutic agent, Tegafur. Various dosing scenarios and the effect of metabolizing enzyme levels were tested. As an experimental approach, the mu-CCA was improved in design, to accommodate 3 -D hydrogel cell cultures and to enable a long-term operation. Using the mu-CCA, metabolism-dependent toxicity of Tegafur was observed. A PK-PD model for a mu-CCA was developed, and differential responses of three cell lines (representing the liver, tumor, and marrow) to the drugs in static and dynamic conditions were analyzed. A major challenge in developing microfluidic systems is prevention of bubble formation. A microscale <b>bubble</b> <b>trap</b> was developed, and it was demonstrated that the presence of a <b>bubble</b> <b>trap</b> significantly alleviated the bubble interference. To address the issue of detection and analysis in a microfluidic device, an in situ, fluorescence optical detection system was developed and integrated with a mu-CCA, and a real-time detection of cell viability and metabolic activity was demonstrated. This thesis work demonstrates the use of a microfluidic device, mu-CCA for a pharmacokinetic-based drug toxicity study and its combination with a mathematical modeling for a quantitative analysis of cell death kinetics.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of fluid phenomena is of high {{interest in the}} management of cryogenic liquid propellants used in heavy-lift launchers. In order to efficiently design orbital cryogenic propellant storage facilities or cryogenic propulsion systems experiments concerning fill-levels, bubble formations and boiling have to be conducted in microgravity and on earth. Thus measurement devices are needed that can give insight into the spatial distribution and the behavior of the fluids inside the cryogenic system. One possibility to observe liquids inside a given volume without intruding into the system and thereby disturbing the flow characteristics is to use a capacitive system with electrodes embedded into the walls of the vessel. In this paper experiments with such a system at cryogenic temperatures are presented. To simulate the behavior of rocket fuel in space a cryostat was filled with liquid nitrogen and by way of controlling the pressure inside or locally heating the liquid bubbles were created. Two capacitive measurement systems have been submerged into the cryogenic liquid to monitor the location and size of bubbles inside the liquid and to observe the state of the liquid/gas interface. One system consisted of a cylindrical polycarbonate ring with four embedded electrodes and a polycarbonate lid at the top carrying one ring-shaped electrode. Many small bubbles thus could be trapped and coalesced in this half closed cylinder (<b>bubble</b> <b>trap)</b> forming a big single gas volume. The other system was a polycarbonate ring with 16 electrodes arranged along its circumference. The task of these systems was to measure the filling level inside the cylindrical <b>bubble</b> <b>trap</b> and to detect and quantify rising bubbles inside the cryostat by measuring the mutual capacitances of selected electrode pairs. To interpret the measurement results, FEM simulation results were used to generate a characteristic curve for the relationship between filling level and measured capacitances. To validate the results, two cameras were mounted inside the cryostat which allowed the simultaneous recording of the filling level and the existence of bubbles and bubble streams. We observed a good agreement between measurement and simulation. Overall the suitability of the system for cryogenic applications has been successfully demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|The {{details of}} bubble {{behaviour}} in chemically active cavitation {{are still not}} sufficiently well understood. Here we report on experimental high-speed observations of acoustically driven single-bubble and few-bubble systems {{with the aim of}} clarification of the connection of their dynamics with chemical activity. Our experiment realises the sonochemical isomerization reaction of maleic acid to fumaric acid, mediated by bromine radicals, in a <b>bubble</b> <b>trap</b> set-up. The main result is that the reaction product can only be observed in a parameter regime where a small bubble cluster occurs, while a single trapped bubble stays passive. Evaluations of individual bubble dynamics for both cases are given in form of radius-time data and numerical fits to a bubble model. A conclusion is that a sufficiently strong collapse has to be accompanied by non-spherical bubble dynamics for the reaction to occur, and that the reason appears to be an efficient mixing of liquid and gas phase. This finding corroborates previous observations and literature reports on high liquid phase sonochemical activity under distinct parameter conditions than strong sonoluminescence emissions...|$|E

Measurements using the device indicated very high ebullition rates (36. 3 – 366. 7 mlm− 2 h− 1) and N 2 ebullition flux (0. 025 – 0. 297 gm− 2 h− 1) at warmer months of September and October.

Distinct spatial variation of ebullition rates, and N 2 and N 2 O ebullition fluxes were observed, with the highest rate at the heavy sediment location.

Patients (n = 41) were divided into group I (GI, n = 22) with DBT introduced into the arterial line of ECC and group II (GII, n = 19) with placebo-DBT instead. Doppler ultrasonography was used for detection of microbubbles before and after DBT, and for detection of high intensity transient signals (HITS) within the middle cerebral artery.

We have modified the IPRL apparatus so as to be able to perform sterile perfusions of two livers simultaneously. The perfusion apparatus is a recirculating closed system in which the oxygenator is a plastic container separated into two chambers by a fenestrated plastic wall. A disposable macropore filter functions as both a <b>bubble</b> <b>trap</b> and perfusate filter. The sterilization process is done by immersing the various components in Benz-All solution.
