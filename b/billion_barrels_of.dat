25|$|In 2005 {{two-thirds of}} the province's {{population}} lived in urban areas, there was a diverse economic base, and citizens enjoyed a rich cultural life. The economic future based on high-priced oil and wheat looks bright. Saskatchewan is the ninth biggest supplier of oil to the U.S., shipping them more than Kuwait. The province has 1.2 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> recoverable conventional oil and an estimated 1.5 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> potential oil sands reserves (which create troublesome high carbon emissions when processed).|$|E
25|$|The Aktobe Field has an {{estimated}} reserve of 1.17 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil, {{and is being}} developed by the CNPC/AktobeMunaiGaz consortium. Smaller German and American joint ventures are also involved in oil extraction projects in the region.|$|E
25|$|According to IEA Indonesia was the 10th top {{natural gas}} {{producer}} in 2009: 76 billion cubics (bcm) 2.5% of world production of which 36 bcm was exported. In 2009 Indonesia was the 5th top coal producer: 263 million tonnes hard coal and 38 million tonnes brown. The majority of this, 230 Mt of hard coal, was exported. Indonesia has significant energy resources, starting with oil – it has 22 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> conventional {{oil and gas}} reserves, of which about 4 billion are recoverable. That's the equivalent of about10 years of oil production and 50 years of gas. It has about 8 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources. It has 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal. It has 28 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal potential.|$|E

50|$|A {{commonly}} used multiple of the BOE is the kilo <b>barrel</b> <b>of</b> oil equivalent (kboe or kBOE), which is 1,000BOE.

He was an early {{supporter}} of renewable energy, sponsoring measures on the production tax credit for wind energy and creating a Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) mandate to help build a renewable fuels industry. He also persuaded the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct and release the first official estimate of recoverable oil in the Bakken Formation in North Dakota.

PetroEcuador then took over 100% {{of the oil}} production management. 1.5 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil {{was reported to have}} been extracted while under the management of Texaco. There were also reports of 19 billion gallons of waste that had been dumped into the natural environment with the absence of any monitoring or overseeing to prevent damages to the surrounding areas.

25|$|In 1990, Crichton (pronounced KREI-tun) {{wrote in}} an opinion piece for the Dallas Morning News, stating that he first {{realized}} {{the vastness of the}} Middle Eastern oil reserves prior to 1950. He and a coworker determined, he said, that the Burgan Field in Kuwait, for example, held ten <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> crude oil. In 1951, he helped to establish San Juan Oil Company in Dallas, where he became the vice president of operations. During the 1950s, he took a group of American businessmen to Yemen to search for oil. During his long career, he was the president of the Yemen Development Corporation and the Dorchester Gas Corporation, Crichton was also involved in the mining of copper, zinc, gold, silver, and nickel through his Arabian Shield Development Company.|$|E
25|$|ESB, Ervia and Airtricity are {{the three}} main {{electricity}} and gas suppliers in Ireland. There are 19.82 billion cubic metres of proven reserves of gas. Natural gas extraction previously occurred at the Kinsale Head until its exhaustion. The Corrib gas field was due to come on stream in 2013/14. In 2012, the Barryroe field was confirmed to have up to 1.6 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil in reserve, with between 160 and 600 million recoverable. That could provide for Ireland's entire energy needs for up to 13 years, when it is developed in 2015/16. There have been significant efforts to increase the use of renewable and sustainable forms of energy in Ireland, particularly in wind power, with 3,000 MegaWatts of wind farms being constructed, some {{for the purpose of}} export. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has estimated that 6.5% of Ireland's 2011 energy requirements were produced by renewable sources.

25|$|Approximately 90% of the United Kingdom's North Sea {{oil fields}} {{are located in}} Scottish {{territorial}} waters. The tax revenue generated from an offshore site is not counted within the nation or region nearest to it, but is instead allocated to the UK Continental Shelf. The revenue from North Sea oil {{has been used to}} support current expenditure, rather than creating a sovereign oil fund. The SNP believes that a portion of the revenues should be invested in a sovereign oil fund. The Scottish government, citing industry regulator Oil and Gas UK, estimated in Scotland's Future that there were 24 <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil equivalent (boe) remaining to be extracted. Sir Ian Wood, founder of oil services company Wood Group, said in August 2014 that he believed there were between 15 and 16.5 billion boe and that the impact from declining production would be felt by 2030. In September 2014, an investigation by industry recruitment website Oil and Gas People stated that there were extensive oil reserves {{to the west of the}} Western Isles and Shetland. The report anticipated that the region would be developed within the next 10 years because of improvements in drilling technology, rig design and surveying.|$|E
500|$|One year later, Australia and Indonesia began {{drafting}} a treaty to share {{resources in the}} Timor Gap. The treaty was signed in December 1989, with estimates ranging from one to seven <b>billion</b> <b>barrels</b> <b>of</b> oil to be secured. This agreement, along with general economic partnership with Indonesia, is frequently cited as a crucial factor for the Australian government's position. And yet given that nearly 60,000 East Timorese had died during the fighting between Australian and Japanese forces that followed the invasion of Timor by the Japanese during the Pacific War some Australians believed their government owed a special debt to the former Portuguese colony. James Dunn, a senior Foreign Affairs adviser to the Australian Parliament {{before and during the}} occupation, condemned the government's position, saying later: [...] "What had been of vital strategic value in 1941 was, in 1974, irrelevant and dispensable." [...] Some Australian World War II veterans protested the occupation for similar reasons.|$|E
