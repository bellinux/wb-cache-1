Line weights from the later Norse period and associated evidence from elsewhere in Shetland indicates that deep-water fishing was also a regular undertaking. The Jarlshof site also produced ample evidence of the use of iron tools such as shears, scissors, sickles, and a fish-hook and knife. The ore was locally obtained <b>bog</b> <b>iron.</b> Hazel, birch and willow grew in the area at this time but the pine and oak must have been driftwood or imported timber.|$|E
25|$|Iron ore {{from the}} Ogden mile {{was brought to}} Nolan's Point (Lake Hoptcong). In 1880 the canal transported 1,700 boatloads (about 108,000 tons) of iron ore. Thereafter, {{competition}} from taconite ore in the Lake Superior region brought a decline in New Jersey <b>bog</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Migration period saw the {{expansion}} of land cultivation inland, especially in Southern Bothnia, and the growing influence of Germanic cultures, both in artifacts like swords and other weapons and in burial customs. However most iron {{as well as its}} forging was of domestic origin, probably from <b>bog</b> <b>iron.</b>|$|E

40|$|A sampler and an {{analytical}} and characterization scheme {{were developed to}} investigate the chemical and physical state of iron in a highly stained acid <b>bog</b> lake. <b>Iron</b> fractions were chemically separated by reactivity to bathophenanthroline (BPN) after specific digestion procedures. Physical separation involved anaerobic in situ filtration (450 nm), and in situ dialysis (4. 8 nm). This resulted in three size classes: particulate, colloidal, and dissolved. Unlike pH 6 - 8 lakes, inorganic, nonreactive species of iron [e. g., Fe(OH) $sub 3 $] represent minor amounts of the total iron in North Gate Lake. In situ radiochemical analyses revealed that colloidal sized reactive ferric iron predominates in the oxygenated epilimnion, while dialyzable or dissolved ferrous iron increases with depth. Unlike iron, organic matter is present in a nontransient colloidal state. In acid (pH 4 - 5) <b>bog</b> lakes ferric <b>iron</b> is not colloidal as an inorganic complex (OH$sup -$), but colloidal as reactive Fe$sup +$$sub 3 $ by complexation with the colloidal organic acids. After thermally induced mixing with anaerobic waters, ferric iron is reduced and dissolved.

25|$|After <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> {{was made}} {{redundant}} by the increasing availability of iron ore, Allaire closed the Howell Works and eventually retired {{there with his}} family. The property remained in private hands until being bequeathed to the state in 1941. Today, the Howell Works is a registered historic site known as Allaire Village.|$|E
25|$|Mishawaka’s {{recorded}} history {{began with the}} discovery of <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> deposits {{at the beginning of the}} 1830s. Settlers arriving to mine the deposits founded the town of St. Joseph Iron Works in 1831. Within a few years, the town had a blast furnace, a general store, a tavern, and about 200 residents. Business prospered, and in 1833 St. Joseph Iron Works, Indiana City, and two other adjacent small towns were incorporated to form the city of Mishawaka.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, Taunton {{was also}} {{the center of an}} {{important}} iron-making industry, utilizing much <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> from the numerous swamps in the surrounding area. The iron industry in Taunton produced a variety of goods including stoves (Weir Stove Company/Glenwood), tacks (Field Tack Company) and machinery. One of the more successful companies during this period was the Mason Machine Works, founded by William Mason, which produced machinery for the textile industry, as well as steam locomotives. The Taunton Locomotive Works (begun in 1846) also operated in the city during this time.|$|E

Supervised by Ian Hodder as a post-graduate at Cambridge, Parker Pearson was a contemporary of Sheena Crawford, Daniel Miller, Henrietta Moore, Christopher Tilley and Alice Welbourn; {{these students were}} influenced by Hodder's ideas, then a pioneering part of the post-processualist current within archaeological theory. He went on to gain his PhD at the University of Cambridge in 1985, producing a thesis on burials and <b>bog</b> bodies in <b>Iron</b> Age Denmark.|$|R
5|$|The {{physical}} evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, {{but it does}} not explain why he was killed. In North West England, there is little evidence for religious or ritual activity in the Iron Age period. What evidence does survive is usually in the form of artefacts recovered from peat <b>bogs.</b> Late <b>Iron</b> Age burials in the region often took the form of a crouched inhumation, sometimes with personal ornaments. Although dated to the mid-1st centuryAD, the type of burial of Lindow Man was more common in the pre-historic period. In {{the latter half of the}} 20thcentury, scholars widely believed that bog bodies demonstrating injuries to the neck or head area were examples of ritual sacrifice. Bog bodies were associated with Germanic and Celtic cultures, specifically relating to head worship.|$|R
25|$|Massachusetts {{became a}} leader in {{industrial}} innovation and development during the 19th century. Since colonial times, {{there had been a}} successful iron making industry in New England. The first successful ironworks in America was established at Saugus in 1646, utilizing <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> from swamps to produce plows, nails, firearms, hoops for barrels and other items necessary {{for the development of the}} Colony. Other industries would be established during this period, such as shipbuilding, lumber, paper and furniture making. These small-scale shops and factories often utilized the State's many rivers and streams to power their machinery.|$|E
25|$|The Iron Age {{brought a}} measure of {{prosperity}} to {{the people living in}} the area of the present-day Netherlands. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> extracted from the ore in peat bogs (moeras ijzererts) in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the Veluwe and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. Smiths travelled from small settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including axes, knives, pins, arrowheads and swords. Some evidence even suggests the making of Damascus steel swords using an advanced method of forging that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} documented European {{settlement of}} the present Lakewood area was by operators of sawmills, from about 1750 forward. One such sawmill – located at {{the east end of}} the present Lake Carasaljo – was known as Three Partners Mill from at least 1789 until at least 1814. From 1815 until 1818, in the same area, Jesse Richards had an iron-smelting operation known as Washington Furnace, using the local <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> ore. The ironworks were revived in 1833 by Joseph W. Brick, who named the business Bergen Iron Works, which also became the name of the accompanying town. In 1865, the town was renamed Bricksburg in 1865, and in 1880, it was renamed Lakewood and became a fashionable winter resort.|$|E
25|$|In the Bronze and Iron Ages, {{people used}} peat bogs for rituals to nature gods and spirits. Bodies {{of the victims}} of such sacrifices have been found in various places in Scotland, England, Ireland, and {{especially}} northern Germany and Denmark. They are almost perfectly preserved by the tanning properties of the acidic water (see Tollund Man {{for one of the most}} famous examples of a bog body). Peat wetlands also used to have a degree of metallurgical importance, being during the Dark Ages the primary source of <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> that was used to create swords and armour for Vikings. Many peat swamps along the coast of Malaysia serve as a natural means of flood mitigation, with any overflow being absorbed by the peat, provided forests are still present to prevent peat fires.|$|E
500|$|Drainage that {{reacted with}} the pyrite {{inclusions}} also deposited {{a form of}} <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> near several outcrops of the Marcellus. In the 19th century, iron ore from these deposits {{was used as a}} mineral paint pigment. After being heated in a kiln and finely ground, it was mixed with linseed oil, and used to paint exterior wood on barns, covered bridges, and railroad cars. In addition to the <b>bog</b> <b>iron,</b> [...] at several sloped locations in eastern Pennsylvania brown hematite was found lying on the Marcellus bedrock buried beneath the soil. These deposits were also excavated and used for mineral paint during that time. A bed of hematite paint ore is also found almost directly below the Marcellus, but it is actually part of the underlying Oriskany Formation.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the colonial}} era, the Pine Barrens was the {{location}} of various industries. <b>Bog</b> <b>iron</b> was mined from bogs, streams, and waterways, and was worked in furnaces at Batsto, Lake Atsion, Ferrago, Hanover, and several other locations. Iron from these early furnaces was instrumental in supplying the American military with weapons and camp tools during the American Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Second Barbary War. For example, Commodore Stephen Decatur, Jr. sailed to Algiers armed with 24-pound cannons that had been cast at Hanover in 1814. [...] The <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> industry declined in the mid-19th century after the discovery that iron ore could be mined more cheaply in Pennsylvania.|$|E
2500|$|From 800 BC onwards, the Iron Age Celtic Hallstatt culture became influential, {{replacing}} the Hilversum culture. Iron ore brought {{a measure of}} prosperity, and was available throughout the country, including <b>bog</b> <b>iron.</b> Smiths travelled from [...] settlement to settlement with bronze and iron, fabricating tools on demand.

2500|$|The only {{solution}} was for Allaire {{to become a}} manufacturer of pig iron himself. In 1822, {{in response to a}} recommendation from a friend, Allaire purchased [...] of land in Monmouth County, New Jersey, which contained a furnace used for manufacturing pig iron from the natural resource of <b>bog</b> <b>iron.</b> Allaire renamed the furnace the Howell Works, and over the next 20 years used it to source most of his pig iron, during which time Howell Works grew to be a substantial and largely self-sufficient community, complete with its own church, school, company store and farmland.|$|E
2500|$|By 1836, Howell Works had {{expanded}} to its peak operation and size. [...] By this time, the Works employed 400 to 600 workers, including {{not only those}} {{who lived in the}} Works community but many people from the surrounding region. The Works {{had expanded}} to over sixty buildings, including a large three-storey charcoal depot storing charcoal, <b>bog</b> <b>iron</b> and flux; the company store and the church; a carriage house and stables; a bakery, gristmill and slaughterhouse; a blacksmith, carpentry shop and wheelwright; an enamelling furnace; numerous row houses for married employees; and finally Allaire's mansion, which included a dormitory wing for the Works bachelors, managed by a housekeeper.|$|E
2500|$|Oxford Furnace, {{constructed}} in 1741, {{was the third}} furnace in Colonial New Jersey and the first constructed at a site where iron ore was mined.
