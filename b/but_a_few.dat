5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> are specialist feeders. Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15â€“20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E

In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.|$|E

The majority of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> were lost. It was for his theological writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum, and why he was made a saint.|$|E
5|$|In the {{election}} of 1796, under the Constitution as it stood then, each of the presidential electors had two votes, which they were to cast for different men. The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President.

The Federalists planned to deal with this by having all their Electors vote for John Adams, the Vice President, and all <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina.|$|E

Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E

All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.|$|E
5|$|Many prokaryotes have CRISPR RNAs, a {{regulatory}} system similar to RNA interference. Antisense RNAs are widespread; most downregulate a gene, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> are activators of transcription. One way antisense RNA can act is by binding to an mRNA, forming double-stranded RNA that is enzymatically degraded. There are many long noncoding RNAs that regulate genes in eukaryotes, one such RNA is Xist, which coats one X chromosome in female mammals and inactivates it.|$|E

By contrast, the Pohang Basin areas are made up of stratum that formed in the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic era, which consist of igneous rock, aqueous rock, porphyry, sandstone, and tuff.|$|E
