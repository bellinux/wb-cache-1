40|$|Hot spot often {{occurs in}} a module when the qualities of solar cells {{mismatch}} and <b>bypass</b> <b>diodes</b> are {{proved to be an}} efficient alternative to reduce the effect of hot spot. However, these principles choosing a diode are based on the parameters of <b>bypass</b> <b>diodes</b> and PV cells without consideration of the maximum heating power of the shaded cell, which may cause serious consequences.

The results indicate that the maximum power dissipation of the shaded cell occurs at short-circuit conditions. With the number of solar cells increasing, the shaded cell transfers from generating power to dissipating power and there is a maximum point of power dissipation in different shading situations that may lead to severe hot spot.
