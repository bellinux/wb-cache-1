5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Wataru Takeishi. The video opens with shots of New York City, and then has Hamasaki on a rooftop. Hamasaki is then singing the track with several different camera angles circulating her and the city. During the first verse, it has her in an apartment, sitting on a couch with a butterfly hair clip; this scene is used throughout the entire video. It then has three shots of her in different clothes; one with a <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat, the second with a red dress on, and the third with a black jacket and crop hair style. The shot {{with her in the}} <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> jacket, brown wig and cowboy hat then shows her on a rooftop singing the song. The final pre-chorus and chorus has her driving through New York City, and has her in a pink dress watching the snow fall; it ends with her in the red dress, holding her hands out for the snow to fall. The music video was included on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), A Complete Box Set (2004), the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014), and the DVD and Blu-Ray re-release edition of her 2001 compilation album A Best (2016).|$|E
5|$|On the German {{side of the}} lines, Voss {{had changed}} clothing. He wore a {{colourful}} civilian silk dress shirt beneath his unbuttoned knee-length <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le Mérite was at his throat. He was to lead {{one of the two}} scheduled afternoon patrols. Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich Rüdenberg had Voss's other side. After takeoff at 18:05 hours, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower Pfalz D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in Albatros D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three Pfalz D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich Löwenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn. None of the Jasta 10 aircraft would ever catch their Staffelführer.|$|E

However, the effect was more in Acid <b>leather</b> <b>brown</b> exposure. After Bismarck <b>brown</b> and acid <b>leather</b> <b>brown</b> exposure, the cholesterol decreased. It {{may be due to}} utilization of cholesterol in exposed fish and hindrance in metabolism. The serum cholesterol showed a decrease with an increase in the exposure time is highly significant The cholesterol was estimated by the method of Zak et al. (1954). The cholesterol reacts with ferric ions in the acid solution of ferric chloride and sulphuric acid. This reaction involved the " 3 hydroxy- 5 -ene " part of the cholesterol molecule, which is dehydrated to form cholesta- 3, 5, diene and is then oxidized by the sulphuric acid to link two molecules as biocholestra- 3, 5 diene. This obtained substance is finally sulphonated by sulphuric acid in the presence of metal ions (Fe + 3) and the red colored disulphuric acid having a high molecular extinction coefficient is formed The fresh water fishes were treated with two leather dyes as in (tables 1 & 2) the serum cholesterol shows decreasing trend on exposure to Bismarck <b>brown</b> and Acid <b>leather</b> <b>brown</b> at different time intervals (24 hrs, 48 hrs, 96 hrs and 1 week) and at all three concentrations.

25|$|Freddy is a dream-demon who attacks {{his victims}} from within their dreams. He is {{commonly}} identified by his burned, disfigured face, red-and-green striped sweater, brown fedora, and trademark metal-clawed <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> glove only {{on his right}} hand. This glove {{was the product of}} Krueger's own imagination, the blade having been welded by himself. Robert Englund has said many times that he feels the character represents neglect, particularly that suffered by children. The character also more broadly represents subconscious fears.|$|E
25|$|Schwarzenegger was {{the first}} {{civilian}} to purchase a Humvee. He was so enamored by the vehicle that he lobbied the Humvee's manufacturer, AM General, to produce a street-legal, civilian version, which they did in 1992; the first two Hummer H1s they sold were also purchased by Schwarzenegger. In 2010, he had one regular and three running on non-fossil power sources; one for hydrogen, one for vegetable oil, and one for biodiesel. Schwarzenegger was in the news in 2014 for buying a rare Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse. He was spotted and filmed in 2015 in his car, painted silver with bright aluminium forged wheels. His Bugatti has its interior adorned in dark <b>brown</b> <b>leather.</b> In 2017, Schwarzenegger acquired a Mercedes G-Class modified for all-electric drive.|$|E
25|$|John Paul II's {{body was}} clothed in the {{familiar}} white soutane, over which was placed a plain white alb. A stole, the symbol of ordained ministry, was placed around his neck. Over the inner vestments, John Paul II was clothed in a red chasuble. An ancient Byzantine custom, red is the colour of mourning for Popes. Around his collar, the pallium of white lamb's wool was draped. A white zucchetto and a white bishop's mitre adorned John Paul II's head. In his arm rested Paul VI's pastoral cross-staff, used by popes {{in place of the}} crozier. His hands clasped a rosary. At first, he lay in state in his favourite pair of Polish-made <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> shoes, size 44-1/2, which he wore on his travels throughout the world. Later, following the example of his immediate predecessors, these were changed to plain red leather papal shoes.|$|E

25|$|Mother and {{daughter}} both wear long white sundresses. The elegant presentation, {{which also includes}} a straw hat for each and a parasol for the mother, {{is typical of the}} fashion of the time, around 1910. The 19-year-old Maria has a simple floor-length dress that emphasizes her slender silhouette. At the neck the dress is finished with a stand-up collar. The tight-fitting sleeves contrast {{with the rest of the}} dress, and are of a more transparent white cloth, through which shines the skin. Of similar fabric is an panel of cloth mounted below the chest on a large ring. The sea wind blows the cloth into arabesques behind the daughter. Under the dress appears a <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> shoe; on its side reflections emphasize the smooth surface. In her right hand Maria holds a yellow straw hat with a wide, sweeping brim, decorated with purple colored flowers and a turquoise bow. She has pinned her brown hair into a knot, so that her face comes into its own.|$|E
500|$|Shoe polish was to {{be found}} just about {{everywhere}} Allied troops ventured. American war correspondent Walter Graeber wrote for TIME magazine from the Tobruk trenches in 1942 that [...] "old tins of British-made Kiwi polish lay {{side by side with}} empty bottles of Chianti." [...] A story indicative of the rise in global significance of shoe polish is told by Jean (Gertrude) Williams, a New Zealander who lived in Japan during the Allied occupation straight after World War II. [...] American soldiers were then finding the dullness of their boots and shoes to be a handicap when trying to win the affections of Japanese women. U.S. military footwear of the time was produced in <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> with the rough side out.|$|E
500|$|Hardy's {{opinion was}} that, [...] "if only {{it had an}} open timber roof instead of the plain ceiling, {{it would be one}} of the most picturesque College Libraries". Another author said (in 1914, after the {{provision}} of a library for undergraduates elsewhere in the quadrangle) that it was [...] "one of the most charming of Oxford libraries, and one of the least frequented". The window at the south end has four lights; Pevsner noted that it was Gothic in style, despite the date of construction. Simon Jenkins said that the library is [...] "a delight". Betjeman wrote in 1938 that [...] "The woodwork, the <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> of the books, the clear windows and the slim height of the room make it one of the best little-known sights of Oxford".|$|E

500|$|Another notable {{illuminated}} edition {{had been}} created in 1846 by Owen Jones in a legible blackletter script with one decorative initial per page. Produced by chromolithography, each of its 35 pages was individually designed with two half stanzas in a box surrounded by coloured foliar and floral borders. An additional feature was the cover of deeply embossed <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> made to imitate carved wood. A little earlier {{there had been a}} compositely illustrated work for which the librarian John Martin had been responsible. Having approached John Constable and other major artists for designs to illustrate the Elegy, these were then engraved on wood for the first edition in 1834. Some were reused in later editions, including the multilingual anthology of 1839 mentioned above. Constable's charcoal and wash study of the [...] "ivy-mantled tower" [...] in stanza 3 is held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, as is his watercolour study of Stoke Poges church, while the watercolour for stanza 5, in which the narrator leans on a gravestone to survey the cemetery, is held at the British Museum (see below).|$|E
500|$|Production {{designer}} John Myhre {{said his}} work load was [...] "six months squeeze down in to 3-4 months", given the sets were massive {{but he did}} not have the usual time to design and build before principal photography began. The lue underground hallways and Cerebro sets were faithful recreations of the sets seen in the first X-Men, albeit ransacked and damaged to imply the government had raided the mansion. The sets had many hidden [...] "Xs", including the staircase of the X-Mansion. Myrhe said he wanted to embrace the 1970s setting in the same way First Class embraced its 1960s setting, and costume designer Louise Mingenbach also drew heavily from 1970s styles for the clothing seen in the 1973 scenes. Hoult wore corduroys, Jackman a wooden-paneled buckle and a peacock-print shirt, and McAvoy wore a <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> jacket. Peters wore 1981-inspired clothing; this was Mingenbach's way of showing Quicksilver's irreverence for the exact time and place. In one scene, Mingenbach gave Fassbender as the younger Erik Lehnsherr a fedora as a nod to the one the character wore in the first X-Men film. For the future period of the film, Mingenbach wanted a darker, slightly futuristic and tactical look for the characters. This included changing the suit Patrick Stewart had previously worn as Xavier to battle fatigues.|$|E
500|$|Shakira {{performed}} [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] at the 2010 FIFA World Cup {{opening ceremony}} on 10 June at the Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg, South Africa. The song {{was preceded by}} performances of her past singles [...] "Hips Don't Lie" [...] and [...] "She Wolf". Freshlyground also appeared {{on the stage and}} Mahola sang her verse of the song. Numerous African dancers and musicians accompanied Shakira during the performance. For the performances, Shakira was dressed in a black and white zebra-print jumpsuit coupled with a silk-fringed skirt and bracelets made of <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> and silver pearls. Her outfit was designed by Italian fashion designer Roberto Cavalli. Diane Coetzer from Billboard praised the performance and called it the [...] "crowning moment" [...] of the concert show. Although critical of Cavalli's costume, Los Angeles Times critic Ann Powers complimented Shakira's performance of the three songs and commended her incorporation of native dancers and musicians in the show, writing: [...] "It was just a symbolic gesture, but a strong one in this evening-long review of pop music's journey from Africa to every corner of the earth, and back." [...] Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez, and Claudia Leitte's headlining performance at the 2014 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony was negatively compared to Shakira's as fans found the former's show disappointing in comparison to the latter's.|$|E

500|$|On November 2, 2009, several stills {{from the}} video were {{released}} onto the internet. The photos focused on {{two sets of}} the video, a desert location, and a snow and puddle-spotted alleyway. In both settings, Brown wears the same thick black glasses, <b>brown</b> <b>leather</b> trench coat, white T-shirt, and fingerless gloves, among other attire. Cassie appears in a photo from the alleyway scenes, as the desert scenes show Brown in [...] "deep contemplation". The video first aired on The Wendy Williams Show on Friday, November 13, 2009, when Brown was a guest on the show. The video opens with Brown sitting on an edge of a bed wearing a plain white T-shirt. As the music begins and he starts singing, his heart is shown lit up red and beating in his chest. The singer then walks into an alleyway on a winter's night, revealed {{in the air as}} he breathes. Brown walks past several storefronts, seeing images of Cassie broadcast on television. He then sees paparazzi taking photos of her, but she does not notice him. Brown is shown in a desert scene, and then returns to the winter night scene as Cassie sees him and they walk towards each other meeting face-to-face. They gather close, but Brown does not reel her in as the video ends. The music video ranked at forty-eight on the [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E
