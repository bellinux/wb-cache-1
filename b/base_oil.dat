5|$|There {{are several}} types of plant oils, {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a <b>base</b> <b>oil,</b> a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E
25|$|Chemically, transesterified {{biodiesel}} comprises {{a mix of}} mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids. The {{most common}} form uses methanol (converted to sodium methoxide) to produce methyl esters (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME) {{as it is the}} cheapest alcohol available, though ethanol can be used to produce an ethyl ester (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester – FAEE) biodiesel and higher alcohols such as isopropanol and butanol have also been used. Using alcohols of higher molecular weights improves the cold flow properties of the resulting ester, at the cost of a less efficient transesterification reaction. A lipid transesterification production process is used to convert the <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> to the desired esters. Any free fatty acids (FFAs) in the <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> are either converted to soap and removed from the process, or they are esterified (yielding more biodiesel) using an acidic catalyst. After this processing, unlike straight vegetable oil, biodiesel has combustion properties very similar to those of petroleum diesel, and can replace it in most current uses.|$|E
50|$|According to the American Petroleum Institute (API), <b>base</b> <b>oils</b> {{fall into}} five main groups.

2500|$|The merger was {{approved}} by the European Commission on September 29, 1999, and by the United States Federal Trade Commission on November 30, 1999. [...] As a condition for the Exxon and Mobil merger, the European Commission ordered to dissolve the Mobil's partnership with BP, as also to sell its stake in Aral. [...] As a result, BP acquired all fuels assets, two <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> plants, and a substantial part of the joint venture's finished lubricants business, while ExxonMobil acquired other <b>base</b> <b>oil</b> plants and a part of the finished lubricants business. [...] The stake in Aral was sold to Vega Oel, later acquired by BP. [...] The European Commission also demanded divesting of Mobil's MEGAS and Exxon's 25% stake in the German gas transmission company Thyssengas. [...] MEGAS was acquired by Duke Energy and the stake in Thyssengas was acquired by RWE. The company also divested Exxon's aviation fuel business to BP and Mobil's certain pipeline capacity servicing Gatwick Airport. [...] The Federal Trade Commission required to sell 2,431gas stations in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic (1,740), California (360), Texas (319), and Guam (12). [...] In addition, ExxonMobil should sell its Benicia Refinery in California, terminal operations in Boston, the Washington, D.C. area and Guam, interest in the Colonial pipeline, Mobil's interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, Exxon's jet turbine oil business, and give-up the option to buy Tosco Corporation gas stations. [...] The Benicia Refinery and 340Exxon-branded stations in California were bought by Valero Energy Corporation in 2000.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Mineral oil {{has been}} widely used as {{dielectric}} insulating fluid in transformers due to its excellent performance in-service. However, there are few issues with mineral oil such as it has poor biodegradability and could contaminate the environment if a spillage occurs. With the increasing tight regulation on safety and environment, alternative fluids for mineral oil are currently being investigated and among the suitable candidate is the vegetable oil. There are different types of vegetable oils {{and one of them}} is the palm <b>based</b> <b>oil.</b> At the moment, extensive research works are carried out to examine its feasibility to be applied in transformers. This paper will review the previous research works that were carried out to examine the suitability of palm <b>based</b> <b>oil</b> as dielectric insulating fluid in transformers. The physical and chemical properties of palm <b>based</b> <b>oil</b> are studied <b>based</b> on viscosity, acidity, oxidation stability and flash point. Next, the electrical characteristics of palm <b>based</b> <b>oil</b> are examined <b>based</b> on AC breakdown voltage, relative permittivity, dissipation factor and partial discharge...|$|R
40|$|This paper used {{graphite}} nanoparticles {{with the}} diameter of 35 and 80 [*]nm and LB 2000 vegetable <b>based</b> <b>oil</b> to prepare graphite oil-based nanofluids with different volume fractions by two-step method. The tribological properties of graphite nanoparticles as LB 2000 vegetable <b>based</b> <b>oil</b> additive were investigated with a pin-on-disk friction and wear tester. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were {{used to examine the}} morphology and the content of some typical elements of wear scar, respectively. Further, the lubrication mechanism of graphite nanoparticles was explored. It was found that graphite nanoparticles as vegetable <b>based</b> <b>oil</b> additive could remarkably improve friction-reducing and antiwear properties of pure oil. With the increase of volume fraction of graphite nanoparticles, the friction coefficient and the wear volume of disk decreased. At the same volume fraction, the smaller particles, the lower friction coefficient and wear volume. The main reason for the improvement in friction-reducing and antiwear properties of vegetable <b>based</b> <b>oil</b> using graphite nanoparticles was that graphite nanoparticles could form a physical deposition film on the friction surfaces...|$|R
