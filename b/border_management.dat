EU military operations are supported {{by a number of}} bodies, including the European Defence Agency, European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Military Staff. Frontex is an agency of the EU established to manage the cooperation between national border guards securing its external borders. It aims to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration. In 2015 the European Commission presented its proposal for a new European Border and Coast Guard Agency having a stronger role and mandate along with national authorities for <b>border</b> <b>management.</b> In an EU consisting of 28 members, substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states.|$|E
25|$|The {{armed forces}} were formed in 1947 when Pakistan became {{independent}} from the British Empire. Since then, {{the armed forces}} have played a decisive role in the modern history of Pakistan, fighting major wars with India in 1947, 1965 and 1971, and on several occasions seizing control of the civilian government to restore order in the country. The need for <b>border</b> <b>management</b> {{led to the creation}} of paramilitary forces to deal with civil unrest in the North-West and security of border areas in Punjab and Sindh by paramilitary troops. In 2016, the military had approximately 617,000 personnel on active duty, with 513,000 in the reserves, 402,000 in the paramilitary forces, and approximately 20,000 serving in the Strategic Plans Division Forces, giving a total of almost 1,500,000 soldiers. The armed forces have a large pool of volunteers so conscription has never been needed, though the Pakistani constitution and supplementary legislation allow for conscription in a state of war.|$|E
40|$|When {{it comes}} to Turkey, facts show that {{sometimes}} the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament have preferred other forms of cooperation along with accession. These have entailed different approaches towards the <b>border’s</b> <b>management.</b> This thesis aims to study what these different approaches are. In fulfilling this aim, William Walters’ geostrategical framework (2004) lays the theoretical foundations for this research. In his framework, each way of organising the border corresponds to {{the application of a}} certain geostrategy. Each geostrategy touches upon the border’s spatiality, its temporality, the type of function that it is supposed to achieve, and the perception that the EU institutions have of the “inside” (i. e., themselves) and the “outside” (i. e., in this case Turkey). The method of directed content analysis is applied over a selection of documents issued by the three analysed institutions to see what their geostrategical preferences are. The coding frame is constructed deductively, deriving from Walters’ framework. The chosen timeframe of analysis is 2004 - 2015. Results show that all of these institutions privileged Turkey’s candidacy status over any other forms of cooperations. However, other ways of approaching the <b>border’s</b> <b>management</b> are also present. Nonetheless, there are not dramatic variations in their preferences when the results are compared between institutions, nor between periods of time. Walters’ framework is also inductively developed, as the existence of one new geostrategy is found...|$|R

50|$|Borders was {{acquired}} in 1992 by Kmart, which had acquired mall-based book chain Waldenbooks eight years earlier in 1984. Kmart had {{struggled with the}} book division, having first tinkered with the assortment and later with discounting. In the Borders acquisition, Kmart merged the two companies in hopes that the experienced <b>Borders</b> senior <b>management</b> could bail out floundering Waldenbooks. Instead, much of the <b>Borders</b> senior <b>management</b> team left the company, leaving behind an even larger and more unwieldy division for Kmart executives to handle {{on the heels of}} aggressive expansions by rivals Barnes & Noble and Crown Books. Facing its own fiscal problems and intense pressure from stockholders, Kmart spun off Borders in a highly structured stock-purchase plan. The newly formed company was initially called Borders-Walden Group and, {{by the end of the}} same year, renamed simply Borders Group.|$|R

40|$|The European Commission {{published}} in November 2010 a Communication aiming at putting the EU Internal Security Strategy (ISS) into action.

This paper starts by critically examining {{the extent to which}} these objectives actually constitute shared common concerns in all EU 27 member states and whether they are based on independent and objective evidence. After demonstrating the contrary, we then argue that the ISS should be rather considered as an ‘Internal (In) security Strategy’ because of the lack of an accompanying solid rule of law and liberty strategy (model) focused on ensuring the delivery to everyone living in the EU (and who will be subject to increasing EU internal security policies focused on more surveillance, preventive measures and an intelligence-based approach) the twin rights of rule of law and fundamental rights...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Ameloblastic fibro-odontoma (AFO) is a quite rare, mixed odontogenic tumour {{generally}} seen in {{the early}} stages of life. Frequent signs of this tumour are asymptomatic swelling, delayed tooth eruption and mixed radiological appearance within well-defined <b>borders.</b> <b>Management</b> of the lesion includes enucleation of the tumour and long-term follow-up. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 10 -year-old girl was referred to our oral and maxillofacial surgery clinic with an incidental radiological finding of radiopaque mass in the posterior region of maxilla. OPG showed unerupted tooth bud of upper right second molar and was being prevented from eruption by the odontome. Under general anaesthesia, the lesion was enucleated and the permanent right upper second molar tooth bud removed. DISCUSSION: Mixed odontogenic tumours are a group of rare and interesting lesions which can mislead the clinician to variety of differential diagnosis. Adequate clinical and radiological investigations, proper surgical excison, accurate histopathological diagnosis, and long term follow up will ensure the right treatment plan for the patient. CONCLUSION: The possibility of a mixed rare tumour should be kept in mind by the clinician where they deal with the swellings of posterior maxilla in children. Histological assessment revealed a final diagnosis of ameloblastic fibro-odontoma...|$|R

40|$|The current {{refugees}} crises {{has made}} Europe {{an emblem of}} the ambivalences and failures {{in the management of}} forced migrations in the contemporary era. Cradle of human rights, {{but at the same time}} dominated by the securitarian logic nowadays hegemonic at world level, in face of the biblical exodus of the last months Europe has exhibited the arbitrariness of its borders, both internal and external. Indeed, if the integrated <b>borders</b> <b>management,</b> subjugated by aims of migration containment, was been accomplished exactly in the years in which Europe enlarged itself, thus making concrete the promise of the abolishment of the internal frontiers, today, the call for the guard of the external borders put into question the same idea of a European common space. But securitization, as evoked by the idea of an “European Fortress”, represents only one of the two poles of a pendulum perpetually swinging between an Europe of Fear and an Europe of Hope. The origin of this European Dilemma can be traced back in the post WWII era, when the European migration regime was initially shaped.

40|$|The sea lies at {{the heart}} of the EU {{prosperity}} and security: the Union and its member states depend on open and secure seas and oceans for their trade, transportation, energy, food, mineral resources, tourism, and a healthy marine environment. Maritime surveillance constitutes a key enabler for safeguarding the EU strategic interests at sea, by providing vital information on developments over, on and under the sea surface and coastal areas. A fundamental role in the process of collecting and communicating relevant information is held by satellite technologies which open paths to cost-effective and innovative alternatives to traditional surveillance techniques. The article proceeds as follows. The first section briefly outlines the key importance of the sea for the economic, military, energy, food, environmental, health, and cultural dimensions of EU security. Then, the concept of “maritime surveillance” is explained within the broader context of maritime security in the following section. In order to explore the use of satellite technologies in the EU maritime surveillance mechanisms, the third section of the paper examines three cases related to: the vessel monitoring system (VMS) and the vessel detection system (VDS); FRONTEX, the EU agency for external <b>borders</b> <b>management,</b> and the related framework of EUROSUR; and finally, the CleanSeaNet oil spill monitoring system developed by the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA).
