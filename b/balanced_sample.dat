50|$|The {{developers}} of the PAI examined various literary sources {{to come up}} with the five areas assessed by the PAI (validity of responses, clinical symptoms, interpersonal styles, complications for treatment, and characteristics of one’s environment). Constructs were included if they had been relatively stable in their importance of diagnosing mental disorders over time, and if they were important in contemporary clinical practice. The construct validation approach that was used to construct the PAI was used to maximize two types of validity: content validity and discriminant validity. To ensure that the PAI maximized content validity, each scale had a <b>balanced</b> <b>sample</b> of items that represented a range of important items for each construct. For example, the Depression scale has items involving physical, emotional, and cognitive content (as opposed to only questions about mood or interests). Each scale also assesses a range of severity for that scale; for example, the Suicidal Ideation scale has items that range from vague ideas about suicide to distinct plans for self-harm. To ensure that the PAI maximized discriminant validity, each of the scales should be relatively distinct from one another. For example, if the depression and anxiety scales had many of the same items on them, it would be difficult to tell if elevations on these scales meant that the person was experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, or both. As such, the {{developers of}} the PAI stressed the fact that their measure has no overlapping items to ensure better interpretation of the scales.|$|E

40|$|Commonly, in {{environmental}} and ecological populations, neighboring units within a finite population may provide similar information. In {{an attempt to}} obtain the most informative picture of a population, researchers {{may not want to}} collect information from similar units within the obtained sample. Moreover, when sampling from such populations, the selection of dispersed units may result in a reduction in the variance of estimators.;Hedayat, Rao, and Stufken (1988 a and 1988 b) introduced <b>balanced</b> <b>sampling</b> designs for the exclusion of contiguous units. Under the assumption that contiguous units provided similar information, finite populations of N units arranged in a circular, one dimensional ordering were considered. Sampling plans that excluded the selection of contiguous units within a given sample, while maintaining a constant second-order inclusion probability for non-contiguous units, were investigated. Stufken (1993) extended the ideas of <b>balanced</b> <b>sampling</b> avoiding contiguous units to <b>balanced</b> <b>sampling</b> avoiding adjacent units [...] -units that are within a spaces of each other [...] -from circularly ordered populations and provided necessary conditions for the existence of such sampling plans.;In this paper, two direct search algorithms for identifying generators of cyclical <b>balanced</b> <b>sampling</b> plans excluding adjacent units from circularly ordered populations are detailed.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is twofold. First, three {{theoretical}} principles are formalized: randomization, overrepresentation and restriction. We develop these principles and give a rationale for their use in choosing the sampling design in a systematic way. In the model-assisted framework, knowledge of the population is formalized by modelling the population and the sampling design is chosen accordingly. We show how the principles of overrepresentation and of restriction naturally arise from the modelling of the population.

Second, a review of probability <b>balanced</b> <b>sampling</b> is presented through the model-assisted framework.

40|$|Invasive {{species are}} an {{increasing}} problem, costing several {{billion dollars to}} the global economy. Monitoring methods are needed to provide scientists the necessary information to control populations of invasive species. Adaptive monitoring means that, for each additional survey, the monitoring design is updated {{based on the information}} obtained during the previous surveys. In this thesis we introduce a new general framework for adaptive monitoring. This method focuses on increasing the detection rate of invasive species over consecutive surveys. Compared with the existing monitoring methods, the proposed algorithm aims to improve adaptive monitoring by the following three points: (1) The use of a spatially <b>balanced</b> <b>sampling</b> design to select a sample in each survey, (2) by using both spatial and ecological information to update the monitoring strategy, and (3) by incorporating an eradication strategy to an adaptive monitoring design. In Chapter 1, we emphasise the need for the development of adaptive monitoring methods for invasive species. In Chapter 2, we outline the algorithm of our proposed method for adaptive monitoring and discuss the use of spatially <b>balanced</b> <b>sampling</b> designs. In Chapter 3, several sampling designs are introduced and their use for (adaptive) monitoring is evaluated. We give special attention to a new spatially <b>balanced</b> <b>sampling</b> design, named <b>Balanced</b> Acceptance <b>Sampling,</b> and compare it with a selection of existing (spatially <b>balanced)</b> <b>sampling</b> designs such as Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified sampling. In Chapter 4, we illustrate how ecological information can be used to update the monitoring strategy, which is demonstrated using a case study on the Asian tiger mosquito. In addition, several practical issues with probability sampling are discussed. In Chapter 5, the Nearest Unit Tessellation methods are introduced. These methods can model the observed spatial information of the species to update the monitoring strategy. Finally, we demonstrate how to combine ecological and spatial information to adjust a monitoring strategy. Chapter 6 also explores the use of a method to incorporate an eradication strategy to an adaptive monitoring strategy, using the Great White Butterfly data...|$|R

Four different SVM with AL approaches are proposed: 1) random sampling to select the initial pool to begin the AL algorithm; 2) doubling the training instances of Honeycomb to reduce the imbalance ratio before the AL algorithm; 3) a balanced pool with equal number Honeycomb instances and Lung Fibrosis instances; 4) a balanced pool of Honeycomb and Lung Fibrosis and implements <b>balanced</b> <b>sampling</b> throughout the AL algorithm.
