5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, but not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous {{to adopt the}} Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E
5|$|That's how I {{wanted to}} open the video, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it really sets {{up the rest of}} the story. It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all affect your journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's not meant to be an answer video; it's meant to be a profuse number of the question.|$|E
25|$|This {{country has}} been good to me. It gave me {{everything}} I have. I have never come out for any candidate before but I think Wendell L. Willkie {{will give us a}} square deal. So I am for Willkie <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he will help my people, and I figure my people should be for him, too.|$|E
60|$|CAPT. G. Not a secret, exactly, dear. I didn't say {{anything}} about it to you <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> it would amuse you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes--better," [...] she {{answered}} immediately. [...] "No, not better, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could love you better than Tom; but I {{should be so}} sorry--so sorry for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mate," [...] he was saying, [...] "it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thinks</b> {{gold dust}} of you--gold dust, {{and you may}} lay to that! If I hadn't took to you like pitch, do you think I'd have been here a-warning of you? All's up--you can't make nor mend; it's to save your neck that I'm a-speaking, and {{if one of the}} wild uns knew it, where'd I be, Tom--now, tell me, where'd I be?" ...|$|R
25|$|They all got {{together}} {{up there and}} there was a bloody massacre <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they shot about three hundred natives all in one hit {{and there was a}} hell of a row over it. It was all published in the papers and somebody let the cat out of the bag and anyhow the government and the judges in those times they realised what the trouble was and the whole thing was hushed up you see.|$|E
500|$|Torv later remarked in a DVD special {{featurette}} that [...] "this {{episode is}} actually a nice one <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she's kind of starting {{to look at these}} people as more than just a project. I think she’s starting to think about who they are" ...|$|E
500|$|... {{were able}} to {{change the face of}} Indian cricket. That's what I'm proud of, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we made a huge difference. People used to think that we would simply roll over when playing out of India, but we changed the image. [...] Absolutely, and that came from self-belief that, that we had the ability to do well outside India." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, better," [...] she {{answered}} immediately. [...] "No, not better; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could love you better than Tom. But I {{should be so}} sorry,--so sorry for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nevertheless,' said Gerald, 'if {{she is my}} equal, I {{wish she}} weren't a teacher, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> {{teachers}} as a rule are my equal.' ...|$|R

500|$|... "It's {{called the}} Tour of the Mongoose, and the {{mongoose}} is basically {{one of the}} few animals who can defeat the most venomous snakes with just one bite. And that's why I decided to name my tour that way, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that if we all have a little mongoose inside that can defeat the hatred and the resentment and the prejudice of everyday, we can probably win the battle." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{promoting}} {{her first}} international album in the United States, she was reportedly offered {{a role as}} a Bond Girl in The World Is Not Enough, {{as well as in}} High Fidelity. Anggun refused being an actress and said:"I was born a singer. I won't go into another profession, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> there are still many people out there who were born to be movie stars or models. My calling is music." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{live the}} life that most would die for, but there's {{a lot of things}} that come with this life. People don't take that into consideration. There are a lot of things in this life that I would trade in a minute just for a slice of normalcy [...] I just listed a few things that they {{probably}} never viewed from that particular perspective. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people need to see things another way; they need to see it other than just celebrity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mate," [...] he was saying, [...] "it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>thinks</b> {{gold dust}} of you--gold dust, {{and you may}} lay to that!

500|$|... "I said, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> it's fair <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> {{they showed}} {{when it first}} was said, and I was like, 'If someone's a racist, they should be portrayed as one. You shouldn't edit it {{to make them look}} good.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{about the}} child--our child--though, perhaps, I prefer to say MY child," [...] he began, {{with a certain}} brutal frankness. [...] "I'll tell you. But first, I don't want you to talk about BUYING your {{information}} of me. If I haven't told you anything before, it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> you oughter know. If I didn't trust the child to YOU, it's <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> you could go shashaying about with a child that {{was three years old}} when I"--he stopped and wiped his mouth {{with the back of his}} hand--"made an honest woman of you--I think that's what they call it." ...|$|R
500|$|Vasey {{later told}} King that [...] "We were lucky, {{we were very}} lucky." [...] King countered that [...] "if you're {{inferring}} that {{what we did was}} luck, I don't agree with you sir <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we weren't lucky, we were just bloody good." [...] Vasey replied that what he meant was that he, Vasey, was lucky. He confided to Herring that he felt that he had made a potentially disastrous mistake: [...] "it is quite wrong to send out a small unit like the 2/6th Independent Company so far that they cannot be supported." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the midst}} of these events, Chloe begins a {{recurring}} relationship with Chance's brother Ronan Malloy (Jeff Branson). The actress {{was pleased with the}} pairing's potential; [...] "My fingers are crossed that there will be more to come <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> those two characters could go so far with each other". Jeff Branson was also hopeful for the pairing, commending them for bringing out a [...] "different side" [...] of Ronan, describing them as [...] "a chance for him to drop the frosty, crusty exterior he puts on because Chloe really gets under his skin, but in a good way." ...|$|E
500|$|Coldplay {{announced}} {{details about}} [...] "X" [...] in March 2004 while {{the album was}} being recorded. Their initial plans were {{to stay out of}} the public eye throughout the year. Lead singer Chris Martin stated, [...] "We really feel that we have to be away for a while and we certainly won't release anything this year, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people are a bit sick of us." [...] This plan was not carried out, because of the pressure their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head had induced; but they were trying [...] "to make the best thing that anyone has ever heard".|$|E
5000|$|A short {{instrumental}} song titled [...] "Let's Hear That String Part Again, <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> Don't <b>Think</b> They Heard It All the Way Out in Bushnell" [...] {{appears on}} Sufjan Stevens' 2005 album Illinois.|$|R
6000|$|... 'From the Grange,' I replied; 'and {{while they}} make me lodging room there, I want to finish my {{business}} with your master; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> of having another opportunity in a hurry.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was merely}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> it right," [...] said Archie, who, {{now that he}} had worked himself into the vein, liked the sound of his own voice. [...] "It was indeed." ...|$|R
500|$|On May 11, 2010, {{during an}} {{interview}} on Larry King Live, Bush was asked about same-sex marriage. She said she views it as a generational issue and said she believes it will be made legal in the future. Bush offered support for the issue by saying, [...] "when couples are committed {{to each other and}} love each other... they ought to have the same sort of rights that everyone has." [...] Bush referred to her 2000 interview, reaffirming her support for Roe v. Wade, [...] "I think it's important that [...] remain legal. <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's important for people – that for medical reasons and, and other reasons." ...|$|E
500|$|Lydia {{discovered}} Zoe's true intentions for befriending her, {{and set out}} to take revenge. In {{a second}} interview with E4, Lister stated: [...] "I was really surprised when I learned about Zoe's 'master plan' to get Lydia to confess <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> after everything that Zoe's been through [...] the last thing she wants to do is ever see Lydia again, let alone try and make friends with her! But that is her only way, so I think it's really interesting." [...] She continued: [...] "The fight and the chase stuff with Lydia in the graveyard was really good, we filmed it at night. I was dressed as Madonna. We were in a cemetery, it was brilliant!..." ...|$|E
500|$|Dubbing [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{one of the}} {{highlights}} of her career, singer Heidi Mollenhauer described the experience in an interview with South Pasadena High School as [...] "very exciting, a little terrifying, and sometimes overwhelming". On recording the song, Mollenhauer said, [...] "The challenge really was to be able to release all that this song made me feel. I get choked up every time I talk about it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's such a beautiful moment." [...] Because Esmeralda is voiced by two different actresses, it was mandatory that Mollenhauer's singing voice blend with actress Demi Moore's husky speaking voice [...] "seamlessly." [...] Mollenhauer's performance of [...] "Someday" [...] is featured on the re-release of The Hunchback of Notre Dame.|$|E
40|$|Photograph {{taken for}} a {{newspaper}} owned by the Oklahoma Publishing Company. Caption: "It's not that I'm saying the wheel at Las Vegas was wired Against Eddie Cotton, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> they would do that to a nice old man. It's just that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that Cotton beat Jose Torres for the light heavyweight crown. ...|$|R
5000|$|In May 2009, {{the still}} {{anonymous}} 'Jack Night' explained to The Independent {{why he had}} begun his blog in February 2008: [...] "I {{wanted to write about}} where <b>I</b> <b>think</b> police reform has taken us in the 20 years that I have been in the force ... <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> the changes are always good." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>Because</b> <b>I</b> {{personally}} <b>think</b> it’s kind of overwhelming, {{the amount}} of projects we get. Because we’ve got like one project for every class and then a giant project and then sometimes a mini-project in every other class.|$|R
500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{there was a lot of}} cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E

Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating, [...] "I just {{really wanted to do}} more". Lavigne said on the foundation's website, [...] "I have always looked for ways to give back <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's a responsibility we all share". Philanthropist Trevor Neilson's 12-person firm, [...] "Global Philanthropy Group", advises Lavigne with her foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician John Legend.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> I can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E
5000|$|I feel honoured, I feel proud. I'm {{a little}} embarrassed <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> deserve all those {{wonderful}} compliments, so I just don't quite know how to behave. But it's a really wonderful day for me and I will remember it {{for a very long}} time.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he repeated. [...] "But it isn't <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> our Unionists {{and their}} opponents aren't foolish enough for {{anything}} of the sort. It's only <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't believe that the Germans are so stupid as to do such things.... Why should they?...|$|R
5000|$|Robinson {{has said}} that {{although}} [...] "My flip {{answer to the question}} of what song am I the most proud is [...] "(Wish I Had a) Grey Cortina" ... the true answer is [...] "War Baby" [...] is the song that I'm most proud of. ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it's the most truthful song that I've written, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> about it at all." ...|$|R
