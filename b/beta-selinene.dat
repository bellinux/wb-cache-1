The oil strongly inhibited MDA-MB 231 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cells, with an IC 50 of 15 ugmL 1, and the growth of Candida albicans, with an inhibition diameter of 18 mm, while its antioxidant activity, measured by DPPH and ABTS assay, proved to be negligible...|$|E

Batt. et Trab. was analysed by GC and GC–MS, the identified components constituting 78. 8 % of the oil.

40|$|The {{essential}} oil from Peperomia oreophila leaves (Piperaceae) was submitted to fractionation in silica gel column. This separation procedure yielded a fraction {{composed of a}} hydrocarbon sesquiterpene mixture which was identified as beta-elemene, alpha-ylangene, alpha-guaiene and <b>beta-selinene.</b> Besides, spathulenol and two sesquiterpenes with the rare ishwarane skeleton: 3 -ishwarol and 3 -ishwarone were also identified. 3 -ishwarone was the major component of the crude oil (78 % weight). Since the alcohol obtained was not sufficient to allow a complete structural determination, the original ketone was reduced to 3 -ishwarol {{in order to give}} additional quantities. After the two sesquiterpenes purification, they were characterized by spectrometric techniques (¹H-¹H COSY, HMQC, HMBC and NOESY) ...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen terpene {{compounds}} {{were isolated}} from the soldier defensive secretions of seven European termite taxa of the genus Reticulitermes (Isoptera, Rhinotermitidae). We describe species-specific mixtures of monoterpenes (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene), sesquiterpenes (germacrene C, germacrene A, germacrene B, <b>beta-selinene,</b> delta-selinene, gamma-selinene, (E) -beta-farnesene, gamma-cadinene, nerolidol), diterpenes (geranyl linalool, geranyl geraniol, geranyl geranial), and one sesterterpene (geranyl farnesol). Compounds were purified by HPLC and their structures determined by means of MS spectrometry, or 1 D and 2 D NMR spectroscopy. Comparison of two different analytical approaches, GC-MS and HPLC with subsequent NMR spectroscopy, revealed Cope rearrangement of germacrene A, germacrene B, and germacrene C to the respective beta-elemene, gamma-elemene, and delta-elemene under GC conditions, thus demonstrating the limits for this analytical approach. The species-specific compound composition provides insight into taxonomy and species origin of European Reticulitermes. The biological significance of the species-specific composition of Reticulitermes defensive secretions is briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oil of Ishpingo (Ocotea quixos, Lauraceae) fruit calices was analysed by GC (gas chromatography) and GC-MS (gas chromatography mass spectrometry). Fourty-four compounds were identified. The main components detected were transcinnamaldehyde (27. 9 %), methylcinnamate (21. 6 %), 1, 8 -cincole (8. 0 %), benzaldehyde (3. 6 %), and <b>beta-selinene</b> (2. 1 %). In vitro antioxidant {{properties of the}} {{essential oil}}, obtained by DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) and beta-carotene bleaching assays, were also evaluated. The oil exerted a relatively good capacity {{to act as a}} non-specific donor of hydrogen atoms or electrons when checked by the diphenylpicrylhydrazyl assay, quenching 52 % of the radical. On the other hand, it showed weak effects in inhibiting oxidation of linoleic acid when assayed by the beta-carotene bleaching test. Antibacterial activity of the essential oil was also checked against gram positive (Enterococcus foecalis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The oil also showed a dose-dependent antifungal activity against Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, phytopathogen Pythium ultimum and dermatophyte Trichophyton mentagrophytes...|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} oil {{of the leaves}} Solanium spirale Roxb. was isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed {{for the first time}} using GC and GC-MS. Thirty-nine constituents were identified, constituting 73. 36 % of the total chromatographical oil components. (E) -Phytol (48. 10 %), n-hexadecanoic acid (7. 34 %), <b>beta-selinene</b> (3. 67 %), alpha-selinene (2. 74 %), octadecanoic acid (2. 12 %) and hexahydrofarnesyl acetone (2. 00 %) were the major components of this oil. The antioxidant activity of the {{essential oil}} was evaluated by using the DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging assay. The oil exhibited week antioxidant activity with an IC 50 of 41. 89 mg/mL. The essential oil showed significant antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 43. 0 microg/mL and 21. 5 microg/mL, respectively.

40|$|By {{naturally}} occurring gene-transformation Ri-plasmids of Agrobacterium rhizogenes have been {{integrated into the}} plant genome of Chamomillo recutita, thereby inducing the formation of hairy roots. Clones with the best biosynthetic potential were multiplied for phytochemical investigations. The amounts of terpenoid and polyene compounds in the genetically transformed cultures were compared with those in in-vivo plants. In Hungary a wild chamomile population was found which contained significant amount of (-) -alpha-bisabolol in the oil from the inflorescence. We used biotechnological methods to preserve the genome of this wild type. Transformed chamomile root cultures were obtained by infection of sterile organized cultures with Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains #A- 4,# 15834, and #R- 1601. Hairy roots freed from bacteria were cultivated on solid medium and then in liquid, hormone-free, B 5 and MS media. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the essential oil was examined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The volatile compounds were identified by comparing their retention times with those of authentic standards and of essential oils of known composition, and by peak enrichment. Confirmation of identity was achieved by comparison of mass spectra with those {{reported in the literature}} and those of reference compounds. The amount of each component {{as a percentage of the}} total was determined by area normalization. GC and GC-MS studies showed that genetically transformed chamomile cultures generated the terpenoid and polyene compounds most characteristic of the parent plant. The main components of hairy root cultures were trans-beta-farnesene, alpha-farnesene, geranyl isovalerate, and cedrol. We identified <b>beta-selinene</b> as a new component of the genetically transformed cultures...|$|E
40|$|Helichrysum gymnocephalum {{essential}} oil (EO) was prepared by hydrodistillation of its leaves and characterized by GC-MS and quantified by GC-FID. Twenty three compounds were identified. 1, 8 -Cineole (47. 4 %), bicyclosesquiphellandrene (5. 6 %), gamma-curcumene (5. 6 %), alpha-amorphene (5. 1 %) and bicyclogermacrene (5 %) {{were the main}} components. Our results confirmed the important chemical variability of H. gymnocephalum. The {{essential oil}} was tested in vitro for cytotoxic (on human breast cancer cells MCF- 7), antimalarial (Plasmodium falciparum: FcB 1 -Columbia strain, chloroquine-resistant) and antioxidant (ABTS and DPPH assays) activities. H. gymnocephalum EO {{was found to be}} active against MCF- 7 cells, with an IC 50 of 16 +/- 2 mg/L. The essential oil was active against P. falciparum (IC 50 = 25 +/- 1 mg/L). However, the essential oil exhibited a poor antioxidant activity in the DPPH (IC 50 value > 1, 000 mg/L) and ABTS (IC 50 value = 1, 487. 67 +/- 47. 70 mg/L) assays. We have reviewed the existing results on the anticancer activity of essential oils on MCF- 7 cell line and on their antiplasmodial activity against the P. falciparum. The aim was to establish correlations between the identified compounds and their biological activities (antiplasmodial and anticancer). <b>beta-Selinene</b> (R- 2 = 0. 76), alpha-terpinolene (R- 2 = 0. 88) and aromadendrene (R- 2 = 0. 90) presented a higher relationship with the anti-cancer activity. However, only calamenene (R- 2 = 0. 70) showed a significant correlation for the antiplasmodial activity...|$|E
