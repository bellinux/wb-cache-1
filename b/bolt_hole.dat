5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for <b>bolt</b> <b>hole.</b> Inside, Simon found a puff adder, but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E
25|$|The {{derailment}} {{was found}} to be due to a broken rail at a rail joint, where a fatigue crack through the first <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> in a running-on rail had progressively developed and a triangular piece of rail had broken out. The sleeper at the joint had previously failed and been replaced with a shallower timber replacement. This replacement had not been well packed, was on a shallow layer of clean ballast and the rubber pad supporting the rail on the adjacent concrete sleeper was missing.|$|E
500|$|This brings Marius to the [...] "present day" [...] of the game's narrative: {{he gives}} the small sack, {{containing}} Boudica's severed head, to his subordinate, escorts Nero to his safe room, and tells his tale. Nero, who has since deduced that Marius is Damocles, flees deeper into his <b>bolt</b> <b>hole.</b> As Marius gives chase, he is temporarily distracted by Aquilo, {{the god of the}} north wind, who has been aiding Nero and whose stated goal is to cause the collapse of Rome. He is then mortally wounded by Nero and his elite guard, who were waiting to ambush him. However, Summer helps Marius claim the victory, and Marius tosses both Nero and himself off a parapet, where Nero is impaled on the sword of his own statue, fulfilling the Oracle's prophecy. Marius falls to the ground and dies from his wounds as Summer and Aquilo both vanish.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} measure the {{eccentricity}} of auto-hub’s center <b>hole</b> and <b>bolt</b> <b>holes,</b> a machine vision system is proposed in this article. Instead of normally used telecentric lens, a perspective lens {{is used in the}} vision system because of the large field of view. The eccentricity is calculated by sub-pixel edge extracting and circle-fitting algorithm. A correction method is put forward to compensate the systematic error resulting from the different perspective distortions of the center <b>hole</b> and the <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> because of the height difference between the center <b>hole</b> and the <b>bolt</b> <b>holes,</b> as well as the offset between the hub’s center shaft and the optical axis of the imaging system. The maximum variation and the standard variation are calculated to analyze the measurement uncertainty. Experiments had shown that the maximum variation and the standard deviation of the corrected measured eccentricity were reduced to 1 / 6 and 1 / 8 of those without correction...|$|R

Time:June 12, 2012 - June 13, 2012. Control Engineering and Information Science Research Association; Int. Front. Sci. Technol. Res. Assoc.; Trans Tech Publications; Chin-Yi University of TechnologyA {{machine vision}} based {{measurement}} system of auto-hub's eccentricity between the center circle and the pitch circle of <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> is proposed in this article. Pictures of all <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> are shot when the auto-hub is rotating. The eccentricity {{can be calculated}} by tiling these pictures to a global image. There are some error factors in the system such as run-out of rotation center, inclined platform, rotation angle error, tilted auto-hub's surface, roundness of the center hole and angle between <b>bolt</b> <b>holes</b> uneven. Mathematical models of these error factors are studied. By stimulating all these error factors, run-out of rotation center has the greatest impact and some key parameters are given in mechanical system design. 漏 (2012) Trans Tech Publications...|$|R
2500|$|The fatal {{fatigue crack}} in the inner lower boom had {{initiated}} at a <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> at Station 143, the rearmost of five bolt holes for attachment of the inner engine nacelle to the lower boom. [...] These holes were ⅞ inch (2.22cm) diameter and were anodised to resist wear and corrosion. [...] A cadmium-plated steel bush of length 1 ⅝ inch (4.13cm), chamfered at one end, was pressed into each hole. [...] Each bush was an interference fit in the hole to improve fatigue resistance and substantially increase the retirement life of the inner lower boom.|$|E
2500|$|At {{approximately}} 5:49 am, an 81-car Wisconsin Central train {{traveling from}} Stevens Point, Wisconsin, to Neenah, Wisconsin, approached {{the city of}} Weyauwega at , traveling on a downward grade. The first 16 cars of the train passed a switch without incident, after which 37 cars behind them derailed {{at the location of}} the switch, at 5:49:32 AM. [...] A subsequent NTSB investigation found the cause of the derailment to be a broken rail within the switch that was the result of an undetected <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> fracture. [...] The derailed cars included seven tank cars of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), seven tank cars of propane and two tank cars of sodium hydroxide. The derailment ruptured three of the tank cars, spilling both LPG and propane, which immediately ignited. The conductor of the train cut the train after the first nine cars, and proceeded onward [...] He informed local law enforcement of the hazardous material the train was carrying, and was instructed to tell the fire chief.|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{structural}} ironworker {{tools are}} the spud wrench, bolt bag, sleever bars, bull pins, drift pins and beaters. The spud wrench {{is the most}} important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes. [...] It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and {{the opposite end of the}} wrench can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align bolt holes on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy canvas bag used for storing bolts and nuts that erect a structure. A sleever bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a spud wrench is insufficient. [...] A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the <b>bolt</b> <b>hole</b> to align the others at the beam end or [...] "point" [...] and stuff the rest of the holes. Drift pins have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center. Are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.|$|E
