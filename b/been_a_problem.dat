5|$|Bautista throws three pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. His fastball {{travels in}} the high 90mph range. His curve can break down sharply, and he learned the changeup from Pedro Martínez. Wildness had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for Bautista {{throughout}} his career. He has trouble controlling his fastball and walks {{a great deal of}} hitters, which has often contributed to his departure from teams.|$|E
5|$|Erosion has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> {{along the}} Scarborough Bluffs. Properties {{located near the}} brink have been abandoned, and houses condemned, as the brink wears {{back away from the}} lake. Since the 1980s, large areas of beach {{at the base of the}} Bluffs have been {{reinforced}} with limestone breakwaters and construction rubble infilling.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s {{the company}} has experimented with Broadway shows, {{including}} Pacific Overtures (1987), Street Scene (1898), On the Town (2005), Kismet (2007), and Candide (2008). In many of ENO's lighter shows, {{the size of the}} Coliseum has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> both in putting across pieces written for much more intimate theatres and in selling enough tickets. In 2015 a new business plan for ENO included making money from a West End musical partnership with the impresarios Michael Grade and Michael Linnit.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at {{a bend in the}} river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E
5|$|Mota {{has three}} {{different}} kinds of pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a circle changeup. The slider is the pitch he usually uses to get outs. Wildness has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for him, though, and his fastball is easy to hit when thrown over the plate. In the past, he has thrown a splitter and a curveball.|$|E
5|$|Prior to restoration, {{of all the}} {{paintings}} in the Sistine Chapel, the lunettes and spandrels were the dirtiest. Added to this, there has always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> of poor daytime visibility of the panels nearest the windows because of halination. Consequently, they were the least well known of all Michelangelo's publicly accessible works. The recent restoration has made these masterly studies {{of human nature and}} inventive depiction of the human form known once more.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{mathematical}} <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> that <b>is</b> {{amenable to}} being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with {{the methods of}} mathematics.

5|$|The {{association}} {{is a registered}} charity and though fundraising has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> the centre is the sole beneficiary of the 'Lee Adamson Memorial Fund'; a fundraising trust set up when Adamson, a Deckham resident and volunteer at the centre, died of meningitis in 1998. By 2011, the fund had raised around £15,000 and a plaque was installed in his honour at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within {{days of the}} announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from one scene that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, American bombers {{such as the}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-29 Superfortress were {{protected}} by long-range escort fighters such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang. These fighters could not match {{the range of the}} Northrop B-35 or Convair B-36, the next generation of bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The development cost for longer-ranged fighters was high, while aerial refueling was still considered risky and technologically difficult. Pilot fatigue had also <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific, giving further impetus to innovative approaches.|$|E

5|$|Matters {{became more}} {{complicated}} in 1954, when the Independent Subway System (IND) started operating D trains on the Culver Line. At the time, the tracks had lettered names (i.e. Track A, Track B, {{all the way}} to Track H from east to west). However, the IND also used lettered designations for its routes (i.e. A, B, {{all the way to}} H as well). The BMT had used numbered route designations up to this point, so this had not <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> However, the D route was now using the Culver Line, which departed from tracks E and F. To avoid confusion, the tracks were renamed with numbered designations, which they still carry.|$|E
5|$|Natural predators of the Puerto Rican amazon {{include the}} red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), the broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus), the {{peregrine}} falcon (Falco peregrinus) and the pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatus). The thrasher invaded Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century and has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for the parrot population since 1973; to combat this, specially designed deep nests {{were prepared for}} the parrots in subsequent years to prevent competition from the invaders. Introduced honeybees (Apis mellifera), the related Hispaniolan amazon (Amazona ventralis), black rats (Rattus rattus) and Indian mongooses (Herpestes javanicus) may compete for nesting cavities, and the latter two may eat eggs and chicks.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez {{throws a}} fastball that travels about ninety-one mph for his main pitch, though it {{sometimes}} {{can go up}} to ninety-five mph. His other pitches (slurve and change-up) travel in the low eighties. Wildness has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> for Sánchez; he has walked 10% – 15% of major-league batters faced each season. However, he also strikes {{out a lot of}} batters; he struck out two hundred {{for the first time in}} his career in 2010. That year, he led all qualifying MLB starting pitchers in limiting hits per innings pitched (6.61 H/9), and his career swinging-strike percentage is among the best in the majors.|$|E

It is odd that in America some of these covers <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> because in the 80's when we would tour here, we always had boobs flashed to us {{at the front of the}} stage.

5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.|$|E
5|$|The animal faces {{a variety}} of {{critical}} threats. Poaching has long <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> Statistics show between 1959 and 1969 Amazonian Brazil alone accounted for 1,000 to 3,000 pelts annually. The species was so thoroughly decimated, the number dropped to just 12 in 1971. The implementation of CITES in 1973 finally brought about significant hunting reductions, although demand did not disappear entirely: in the 1980s, pelt prices were as high as US$250 on the European market. The threat has been exacerbated by the otters' relative fearlessness and tendency to approach human beings. They are extremely easy to hunt, being active through the day and highly inquisitive. The animal's relatively late sexual maturity and complex social life makes hunting especially disastrous.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} version to {{incorporate}} changes brought about through experience in operational service was the XX, {{which was designed}} to run on 100 octane fuel. This fuel allowed higher manifold pressures, which were achieved by increasing the boost from the centrifugal supercharger. The Merlin XX also utilised the two-speed superchargers designed by Rolls-Royce, resulting in increased power at higher altitudes than previous versions. Another improvement, introduced with the Merlin X, was the use of a 70%–30% water-glycol coolant mix rather than the 100% glycol of the earlier versions. This substantially improved engine life and reliability, removed the fire hazard of the flammable ethylene glycol, and reduced the oil leaks that had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with the early Merlin I, II and III series.|$|E

5|$|The {{road was}} {{constructed}} following World War I {{in order to}} provide improved access to the ports at Avonmouth Docks, which had replaced Bristol Harbour as the major local centre for commercial shipping. Upon opening on 2 July 1926, it was the single most expensive road project in Britain, costing £800,000 (now about £ million). The construction posed a number of significant engineering challenges, including long and deep rock cuttings, a viaduct over the River Trym, and retaining walls against the gorge adjacent to the River Avon. Falling rocks have since <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> along the Portway, particularly at the southern end close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge, with concrete canopies constructed to prevent loose rock and assist with remedial work.|$|E
5|$|The town {{is built}} on igneous rock in the James Valley, {{sandwiched}} between steep cliffs. It is therefore rather long and thin. The walls of the valley are rough and steep, and rockfalls have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> although now minimised by netting. A small stream, the Run, runs through the valley. The town is commonly divided into lower and upper parts, depending on the distance up James Valley. Being the island's main port (and with the Saint Helena Airport only receiving its first scheduled flight in October 2017) the town is still currently the main entrance to the island to visitors. Despite not being connected to Jamestown proper by road, Rupert's Valley, the next valley north, {{is also part of}} the town. It houses much of the island's infrastructure, such as its power station and associated fuel storage, and a one-ship wharf was completed in June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Tianchi Basins: As {{precipitation}} was {{for important}} agriculture and food production, the Song Chinese mathematician and inventor Qin Jiushao developed a precipitation gauge that was {{widely used in}} 1247 during the Southern Song dynasty to gather meteorological data. Qin Jiushao later records application of rainfall measurements in the mathematical treatise Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections. The book also discusses problems using large snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement. Tianchi Basins were installed at provincial and district capitals and bamboo snow gauges were situated in mountain passes. The rain gauges were conical or barrel-shaped with one being installed at each provincial and district capital in China. In the treatise, Qin Jiushao also discusses how point measurements were converted to real averages. These averages were important as they postulated indicators of natural disasters such as flooding, since river flooding has always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> in China.|$|E
