50|$|Bentley {{refused to}} allow the engine to be {{modified}} to incorporate the compressor. The huge Roots-type supercharger ("blower") was hence added {{in front of the}} radiator, driven straight from the crankshaft. This gave the Blower Bentley a unique and easily recognisable profile, and exacerbated its understeer. A guard protected the two carburetters located at the compressor intake. Similar protection was used (both in the 4½ Litre and the Blower) for the fuel tank at the rear, because a flying stone punctured the 3 Litre of Frank Clement and John Duff during the first 24 Hours of Le Mans, possibly depriving them of victory. The crankshaft, pistons and lubrication system were special to the <b>Blower</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} {{difference between}} the Bentley 4½ Litre and the Blower was {{the addition of a}} Roots-type supercharger to the <b>Blower</b> <b>engine</b> by engineer Amherst Villiers, who had also produced the supercharger. W. O. Bentley, as chief engineer of the company he had founded, refused to allow the engine to be modified to incorporate the supercharger. As a result, the supercharger was placed {{at the end of the}} crankshaft, in front of the radiator. This gave the Blower Bentley an easily recognisable appearance and also increased the car's understeer due to the additional weight at the front. A guard protected the two carburetters located at the compressor intake. Similar protection was used, both in the 4½ Litre and the Blower, for the fuel tank at the rear, because a flying stone punctured the 3 Litre of Frank Clement and John Duff during the first 24 Hours of Le Mans, which contributed to their defeat.|$|E

In this engine, the exhaust gases leave the cylinder at a speed sufficient to create a partial vacuum, drawing air into the cylinder. This creates a supercharging effect, cools the valves and improves scavenging (hence the name). This inertial supercharging was supplemented by a <b>blower.</b> These <b>engines</b> ran at low temperatures, due to their patented oil-cooled piston, and spherical smallend bearing.

50|$|When {{the furnace}} was fired the steam <b>engine</b> <b>blower,</b> now gone, forced a {{continuous}} blast of {{air into the}} bottom of the furnace in order to make the coke burn brighter and raise the temperature inside high enough to melt the iron (1,538 °C, 2,800 °F).

50|$|Pneumatic: the {{governor}} mechanism detects air {{flow from the}} flywheel blower used to cool an air-cooled engine. The typical design includes an air vane mounted inside the <b>engine's</b> <b>blower</b> housing and linked to the carburetor's throttle shaft. A spring pulls the throttle open and, as the engine gains speed, increased air flow from the blower forces the vane back against the spring, partially closing the throttle. Eventually a point of equilibrium will be reached and the engine will run at a relatively constant speed. Pneumatic governors are simple in design and inexpensive to produce. However, they do not regulate engine speed very accurately and are affected by air density, as well as external conditions that may influence airflow.|$|R

Active noise control (ANC), in which additional secondary sources are used to cancel noise from the original primary source, has drawn considerable attention and shown significant promise. However, the performance of narrowband ANC systems is limited by out-of-band overshoot (one kind of the passband disturbance), which was first addressed in a 1991 study by Dennis Morgan. Although several methods for alleviating the out-of-band overshoot were presented in his study, practical limitations still remain. In this thesis, the out-of-band overshoot problem in narrowband ANC is comprehensively studied. One characteristic of the out-of-band overshoot, asymmetry, is analyzed from both mathematics and zero-pole placement theory points of view. An effective technique to eliminate the out-of-band overshoot, phase compensation, is presented. Computer simulations for verifying the theoretical results are also provided. M. S.

40|$|Abstract. In active {{noise control}} filter, IIR filter {{structure}} which used for control filter assures the stability property. The stability characteristics of IIR filter structure is mainly determined by pole location of control filter within unit disc, so stable selection {{of the value of}} control filter coefficient is very important.

5000|$|Unlike the two earlier engines, {{which could}} use either a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}, the 710 engine is offered only with turbocharging. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design {{that uses a}} gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor. This system acts as a centrifugal <b>blower,</b> during low <b>engine</b> speed, when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine, the clutch disengages, and acts as a true centrifugal turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement. But, unlike the earlier 645 and 567, which offered both Roots-blown and turbocharging, EMD's turbo-compressor {{is an integral part}} of all 710 models, therefore this 50 percent increase is already incorporated into the maximum rated power of all 710 models. The putative horsepower of an otherwise equivalent displacement, but Roots-blown (i.e., [...] "supercharged") 710, may be approximated by multiplying the turbocharged horsepower by 0.67.|$|R
5000|$|The Detroit Diesel Series 51 was a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} built by General Motors, Detroit Diesel Division from 1951 to 1959. Unlike other GM/Detroit Diesel engines, the 51 series designation did {{not refer to}} the cylinder displacement, but rather to the year it was introduced. Two versions were produced, an inline two-cylinder (2-51, 108 cid L) and an inline four-cylinder model (4-51, 216 cid L). It was a simplified version of the Series 53 {{that did not have}} exhaust valves. This was accomplished by using loop scavenging ports for both intake and exhaust along with a mechanical <b>blower.</b> This <b>engine</b> used a dry sleeve with 9 intake ports and three exhaust ports in that sleeve. These sleeves were located {{in such a way that}} the exhaust ports lined up with exhaust ports in the block that were physically higher than the intake ports in the block. This resulted in pressurized cool air being forced through the intake ports just after the exhaust started exiting (note that the exhaust ports in the sleeves were higher at the top than the intake ports while the bottom of all ports in the sleeve are at the same height. The net compression ratio is 18:1. Unlike a two cycle gasoline engine, the crankcase was not used to draw in the fuel/air mixture. Instead, the blower forced air in the intake ports and fuel was injected by a camshaft actuated injector which was pressurized by a gear pump. As fuel is injected just before top dead center, little unburned fuel is expelled in the exhaust, unlike a two-cycle gasoline engine. The elimination of exhaust valves reduced the complexity and weight of the engine. The power output and RPM of this engine was controlled by governing the intake air and controlling the opening of the injectors with shutdown accomplished by completely closing off the air intake. The much lower weight of this engine compared to engines with valves made it quite suitable for applications where other engines of the same horsepower were not feasible. Its uses include: Marine propulsion, generators, pumps, air compressors, road graders and other industrial uses. It was never factory installed for automotive purposes but conversion kits and engines were made available for automotive use. This engine design did not see widespread use due to not being able to reduce the exhaust noise to an acceptable level, as any exhaust restriction would have resulted in a reduction of power and efficiency. It was a very fuel efficient engine with a high power output to fuel consumption ratio.|$|R
40|$|Cooling {{system in}} the engine {{functions}} as the protector of the machine by absorbing the heat. Heat engine is produced by fuel in the cylinder. The heat is deliberately created to generate energy, but it will cause excessive heat if it is left unchecked (over heating effect). In order to prevent overheating and keep the machine temperature, then it uses radiator. How effective radiator is used {{can be seen by}} using a tool called a radiator tester. Therefore, this research was Designed a Trial Radiator (Radiator Tester) Laboratory Scale Which is Completed by Round Handler 2 ̆ 7 s Machine and Regulator Wind <b>Blower</b> on Diesel <b>Engine</b> L 300.

The rpm test result and air speed on the field was applied to the radiator tester laboratory scale. From the results of the tests, it showed that there was an increase in value of the effectiveness of the radiator without external airflow to engine speed 1000 rpm and the average value was 0. 483.

5000|$|Accumulated heat is an {{important}} consideration {{in the operation of}} a compressor in an internal combustion engine. Of the three basic supercharger types, the Roots design historically possessed the worst thermal efficiency, especially at high pressure ratios. In accordance with the ideal gas law, a compression operation will raise the temperature of the compressed output. Additionally, the operation of the compressor itself requires energy input, which is converted to heat and can be transferred to the gas through the compressor housing, heating it more. Although intercoolers are more commonly known for their use on turbochargers, superchargers may also benefit from the use of an intercooler. Internal combustion is based upon a thermodynamic cycle, and a cooler temperature of the intake charge results in a greater thermodynamic expansion and vice versa. A hot intake charge provokes detonation in a petrol engine, and can melt the pistons in a diesel, while an intercooling stage adds complexity but can improve the power output by increasing the amount of the input charge, exactly as if the engine were of higher capacity. An intercooler reduces the thermodynamic efficiency by losing the heat (power) introduced by compression, but increases the power available because of the increased working mass for each cycle. Above about [...] the intercooling improvement can become dramatic. With a Roots-type supercharger, one method successfully employed is the addition of a thin heat exchanger placed between the <b>blower</b> and the <b>engine.</b> Water is circulated through it to a second unit placed near the front of the vehicle where a fan and the ambient air-stream can dissipate the collected heat.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 91 - 94) This research presents three novel adaptive noise cancellation {{techniques for}} reducing periodic interferences, such as <b>engines,</b> <b>blowers,</b> compressors, and fans. (1) The sub-band two-model adaptive HR noise cancellation scheme structure enables {{the cancellation of}} multiple sinusoidal interferences in a received speech signal. Compared with the classical LMS adaptive noise cancellation method of B. Widrow et al., this new structure has two major differences. First, the quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks {{have been used to}} decompose signals into sub-bands. Second, a new constrained time-varying HR notch filter and adaptive HR bandpass filter were developed to form a two-model adaptive HR noise canceller to remove the multi-rate noise from a received signal. Computer simulations were performed using a set of actual speech signals corrupted by car engine noise. Experiments demonstrated that more than 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements have been achieved. (2) In the case that the reference signal is not available, a new noise control structure using a single-pulse excitation generator, the synchronous adaptive noise control with LPC noise synthesizer, was developed. The linear predictive coding (LPC) technique is employed along with the adaptive noise-cancelling technique to form this new structure. The comparison result shows that the proposed structure converges faster and has a better mean-squared error compared with Elliott and Darlington’s method, {{in which there is no}} LPC noise synthesizer involved. (3) An alternative structure, the synchronous adaptive noise control with multi-pulse excitation, using a multi-pulse generator is also presented. Because of the better exciting signal generated by the multi-pulse excitation generator, the LPC synthesizer can be removed to reduce the complexity. Due to the engine noise’s periodic and harmonic properties, the weighting process has been omitted to further reduce computation cost. A faster convergence rate and a more than 10 dB mean-squared error (MSE) improvement have been achieved by using the new structure, as compared with that of Elliott and Darlington. M. S.

40|$|To {{correctly}} {{evaluate the}} vibration {{transmitted to the}} operators, {{it is necessary to}} consider each body’s point interested by the vibratory stimulus produced by machines. All the body’s part in contact to the vibration, when a portable device with internal combustion engine is used, are: hands, back and shoulders. Some information for wholebody vibration are available in the ISO 2631 - 1997 standard, which otherwise refers to a seated operator. ‘C’ type standards for the vibration analysis exist for some portable machines with an internal combustion engine which is comprehensive in the machine (chainsaw, brush-cutter, <b>blower).</b> If the <b>engine</b> is not inside the machine, but it is on the operator’s back, ‘C’ type standards on vibration measurements are quite incomplete. The IMAMOTER institute of CNR, the DISAFA Department (University of Turin) and the Occupational Medicine Department of the University of Catania started some tests to verify the vibration levels transmitted to an operator working with backed engine devices. Two machines have been examined: a blower and a spraying machine. Two operative conditions have been considered during all the tests: idling and full load. Three operators have been involved and each test has been repeated three times. The spraying machine has been tested both with the empty tank and with 10 litres of water, to simulate the load to be caused by the presence of liquid inside the tank. In this work the comfort condition of ISO 2631 - 1 standard was considered, using the frequency weighting Wc curve with the weighting factor 0. 8 for X axis (back-ventral direction) and the Wd curve for Y and Z axis (shoulder - shoulder and buttocks - head) with weighting factors 0. 5 and 0. 4 (respectively for Y and Z axis). Data were examined using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software package. The statistical analysis underlined that the running condition is the main factor to condition the vibration levels transmitted to the operator’s back, while the ballast and the operators are influent when the running conditions are distinguished.

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityTrochoidal-type machines belong to the category of planetary rotation machines and include pumps, <b>blowers,</b> compressors and <b>engines.</b> In general a trochoidal-type machine is simpler, quieter, lighter and smaller than a comparable reciprocating machine. This thesis focuses on two major aspects of trochoidal-type machines with conjugate envelopes: (i) the geometry and the characteristics {{of different types of}} trochoids and different types of conjugate envelopes; and (ii) methods to determine the contact forces and the contact stresses between the rotor and the chamber. The two types of trochoid are the peritrochoid and the hypotrochoid. For each type of trochoid, there are nine types of conjugate envelope. Conjugate envelopes provide, in general, the best geometry for sealing, high compression ratio and low contact forces and stresses. However, to date only two out of the nine types of conjugate envelope have been studied in any detail. General parametric equations of a conjugate envelope, in continuous form, are not available in the literature. In this thesis, unified and compact equations for the geometry and the geometric properties of trochoids are obtained. An additional type of conjugate envelope is discovered for each trochoid. Closed-form parametric equations for all nine types of conjugate envelopes, and the necessary and sufficient conditions for having a closed type 1 conjugate envelope are derived. A computer-aided design program, incorporating the equations, is developed. The characteristics and relationships of different types of trochoid and conjugate envelope are presented. Reducing the contact stresses in the trochoidal-type machine is very important because the machine can not be adjusted for wear. The main difficulty in calculating the contact forces and stresses is to determine the forces that are transmitted through each contact point. Since there are many contact points, the problem may be considered quasi-statically indeterminate. No satisfactory method of analyzing the contact forces and stresses in a trochoidal-type machine has been developed to date. Two methods to determine contact forces are developed in this thesis. One method is based on a versatile finite element model under quasi-static conditions. This model includes more detail such as the effects of contact friction and deformation, and provides contact forces and stresses everywhere. However, results need careful verification and interpretation. The other method is based on a simplified analytical model under the same conditions. This model provides physical insights to the problem and results to check the finite element model from different approaches. However, the accuracy and availability of the results is limited by additional assumptions. When the effects of contact friction and deformation are ignored, the results from both models are in good agreement. It is hoped that this thesis will prove valuable to the designer of all planetary rotation machines, especially for trochoidal-type machines with conjugate envelopes...|$|R
