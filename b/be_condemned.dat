5|$|Claudius {{also wrote}} commentaries {{on the books}} of Leviticus, the {{historical}} books of the Old Testament, the Gospel of Matthew, and all Pauline epistles, of which the commentary on the Epistle to Galatians shows some of his views prefigure those expressed by both the Waldensians and Protestants centuries later. It was once {{thought that he had}} in fact founded the Waldensians, however this was disproved in the 19th century. His epistles on 1 and 2 Corinthians, however, dedicated to Theodemir, abbot of Psalmody, and a possible student of his, were sent to Aachen by the dedicatee to <b>be</b> <b>condemned</b> by the assembled bishops of the realm. The Corinthian commentaries were unpublished, though it was these commentaries that sparked the controversy concerning icons and pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|Deparaja, {{a member}} of the royal family, {{authored}} Amaruka and a collection of romantic stories called the Sobagina Sone (1410), written {{in the form of a}} narration by the author to his wife. However, according to Kotraiah, Sobagina Sone was actually written by King Deva RayaII. The writing contains interesting details on the king's hunting expeditions and on the professional hunters who accompanied him. In 1525, Nanjunda Kavi, a feudatory prince wrote on local history, published a eulogy of prince Ramanatha (also called Kumara Rama) titled Ramanatha Charite (or Kumara Rama Sangatya) in the sangatya metre. The poem is about the prince of Kampili and his heroics at the dawn of the Muslim invasion into southern India. This work combines folk and epic literature. The protagonist rejects the advances of his stepmother, only to <b>be</b> <b>condemned</b> to death. He is rescued by a minister, but eventually achieves martyrdom fighting Muslim invaders at the capital.|$|E
5|$|The Megans are {{determined}} to put humanity and the Enterprise crew on trial for what humans did to their people during the Salem witch-trials as well as Lucien for bringing them here. Kirk comes out in support of Lucien's life and says that killing him would make the Megans just like humans. Lucien's punishment is to <b>be</b> <b>condemned</b> into limbo for eternity for bringing humans into the Megans' world. While Kirk states that humanity has progressed infinitely since 1691, the Megans ignore his words. At {{the end of the}} trial, Kirk offers his life to save Lucien's and the Megans are so impressed by the captain's gesture that they spare Lucien, and tell the Enterprise that they would welcome future human visits to their planet. They also return the Enterprise to its proper universe, while Lucien is revealed to be Lucifer.|$|E

5|$|The statehouse {{was built}} of blue limestone, two stories high. The {{governor}} and the Supreme Court occupied the lower floor, and the legislature occupied the upper floor, with each house in its own wing. The building {{was the site of}} many great events in its history, including a bier for Abraham Lincoln. The building was popular after its construction but by the 1860s Greek Revival architecture had fallen out of style, and the building was beginning to become decrepit. The building's limestone foundation began to fail, and many feared a general structural collapse of the building. In 1867 the ceiling in the chambers of the Indiana House of Representative collapsed. A debate was held in 1873 about how to preserve the building but no solution was found. By the time that Governor James Williams was elected to office, the building was about to <b>be</b> <b>condemned.</b> It was finally demolished in 1877.|$|E

25|$|Various {{languages}} and traditions include names suggesting affinities with Orcus, a Roman and Italic god of death. For many years people in Tyrol called the wild man Orke, Lorke, or Noerglein, while {{in parts of}} Italy he was the orco or huorco. The French ogre has the same derivation, as do modern literary orcs. Importantly, Orcus is associated with Maia in a dance celebrated late enough to <b>be</b> <b>condemned</b> in a 9th- or 10th-century Spanish penitential.|$|E
25|$|On June 15, 1692, twelve local ministers — {{including}} Increase Mather and Samuel Willard — submitted The Return {{of several}} Ministers to the Governor and Council in Boston, cautioning the authorities not to rely {{entirely on the}} use of spectral evidence:Presumptions whereupon persons may be Committed, and much more, Convictions whereupon persons may <b>be</b> <b>Condemned</b> as Guilty of Witchcrafts, ought certainly to be more considerable, than barely the Accused Persons being Represented by a Spectre unto the Afflicted.|$|E
25|$|I {{think there}} is a growing distaste for the family duties among women … that should <b>be</b> <b>condemned.</b> The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.|$|E

25|$|In 1571 {{a special}} {{congregation}} was created, the Sacred Congregation of the Index, {{which had the}} specific task to investigate those writings that were denounced in Rome as being not exempt of errors, to update the list of Pope Pius IV regularly and also to make lists of required corrections in case a writing was not to <b>be</b> <b>condemned</b> absolutely but only in need of correction; it was then listed with a mitigating clause (e.g., donec corrigatur (forbidden until corrected) or donec expurgetur (forbidden until purged)).|$|E
25|$|FIFA {{reviewed}} {{the possibility of}} increasing Suárez's ban but decided against punishing him for 'unsportsmanlike conduct'. This opened up a discussion on gamesmanship, asking {{the question of whether}} players in that situation should <b>be</b> <b>condemned</b> as a cheat, or applauded for their resourcefulness. One pundit, Paul Fletcher of the BBC, implied that most players would do the same thing in the 'heat of the moment' in order to avoid defeat. Ghana's sports minister, Akua Sena Dansua, called for changes to the rules in such circumstances.|$|E
25|$|With the {{establishment}} of the deep-water anchorage and improvements in port facilities, Stanley saw a dramatic {{increase in the number of}} visiting ships in the 1840s in part due to the California Gold Rush. A boom in ship provisioning and ship-repair resulted, aided by the notoriously bad weather in the South Atlantic and around Cape Horn. Stanley and the Falkland Islands are famous as the repository of many wrecks of 19th-century ships that reached the islands only to <b>be</b> <b>condemned</b> as unseaworthy and were often employed as floating warehouses by local merchants.|$|E

25|$|The {{terrorist}} acts perpetrated against innocent civilians by {{individuals and groups}} under the guise to liberate Oromia were abominable crimes and should <b>be</b> <b>condemned</b> in the strongest possible terms.

The killing of innocent civilians and destroying their properties couldn't be justified by any standard. I am of the view that a democratic unity on the basis of justice and equality would be of much benefit to the people of Oromia.|$|E
25|$|The rule of {{fair hearing}} {{is the other}} of the two pillars of natural justice. It is {{encapsulated}} in the Latin maxim audi alteram partem, which implies that everyone {{has a right to}} be heard and that none ought therefore to <b>be</b> <b>condemned</b> unheard. This principle must be observed by courts, tribunals, arbitrators and all persons or bodies having the duty to act judicially, save where their application is excluded expressly or by necessary implication. The need for fair hearing is important as it forms a part of good procedure by reflecting a universal sense of fair play.|$|E
25|$|There is {{an ancient}} pilgrimage called the Tro Breizh (tour of Brittany) which {{involves}} pilgrims walking around Brittany from the grave {{of one of the}} Seven Founder Saints to another.

In 2002, the Tro Breizh included a special pilgrimage to Wales, symbolically making the reverse journey of the Welshmen Paul Aurelian, Brioc, and Samson.
