5|$|The plot of Sherlock Holmes <b>Baffled</b> is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories; {{it is likely}} that the character's name was used purely for its familiarity with the public. Shot from a single point of view on a stage set, the intention of Sherlock Holmes <b>Baffled</b> was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E
5|$|Biograph films before 1903 {{were mostly}} actualities (documentary footage of actual persons, places and events), but Sherlock Holmes <b>Baffled</b> {{is an example}} of an early Biograph comedy {{narrative}} film, produced at the company's rooftop studio on Broadway in New York City. According to Christopher Redmond's Sherlock Holmes Handbook, the film was shot on April 26, 1900. Julie McKuras states that the film was released in May of the same year. Despite being in circulation, Sherlock Holmes <b>Baffled</b> was only registered on February 24, 1903, and this is the date seen on the film's copyright title card. The occasionally suggested date of 1905 is probably due to confusion with a Vitagraph film titled Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; or, Held for Ransom (1905).|$|E

25|$|<b>Baffle</b> Design: <b>baffles</b> {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} <b>baffle</b> is the segmental <b>baffle.</b> The semicircular segmental <b>baffles</b> are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent <b>baffles</b> forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. <b>Baffle</b> spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. <b>Baffles</b> must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the <b>baffles</b> be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having <b>baffles</b> spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the <b>baffles</b> spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between <b>baffles.</b> It is also important to ensure the <b>baffles</b> are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of <b>baffle</b> is the disc and doughnut <b>baffle,</b> which consists of two concentric <b>baffles.</b> An outer, wider <b>baffle</b> looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner <b>baffle</b> is shaped like a disk. This type of <b>baffle</b> forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut <b>baffle</b> generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal liquid {{sloshing}} in partially filled clear-bore tanks causes extensive {{degradation of}} tankers braking performance. To reduce the negative effect of longitudinal liquid sloshing on tankers, {{three kinds of}} transverse <b>baffles</b> were designed, namely, the conventional <b>baffle,</b> the circular <b>baffle,</b> and the staggered <b>baffle.</b> Each kind of <b>baffle</b> took several forms to investigate the impact of <b>baffle</b> installation angle, the sizes of holes pierced on the <b>baffle,</b> and their arrangement on the antisloshing effect. FLUENT software was used to simulate liquid sloshing in tanks equipped with different kinds of transverse <b>baffles</b> and subject to constant braking deceleration. A time-series analysis of the forces act on tank walls and transverse <b>baffles</b> was carried out. It was drawn that the <b>baffle</b> shape and its installation angle have great impact on the antisloshing effect of <b>baffles.</b> The study on the antisloshing effect of different transverse <b>baffles</b> is of great significance for tank vehicle driving and braking safety, {{as well as for}} the design of optimal transverse <b>baffles...</b>|$|R

5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts were quite <b>baffled</b> by {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them {{there appeared to be}} no logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed the attention of the American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E
5|$|New manager John Bentley led United to a fourth-place {{finish in}} 1912–13. He dropped Meredith to blood a young Jackie Sheldon. By this time, Meredith made {{headlines}} {{primarily due to}} his squabbling with the club over them stalling payment of his benefit matches and his dissatisfaction at being dropped. The club dropped to 14th spot in 1913–14, and only avoided relegation {{on the last day}} of the 1914–15 season after bribing Liverpool to lose 2–0 at Old Trafford; Meredith this time played no part in the resulting bribery scandal. He instead claimed to be <b>baffled</b> as to why his teammates refused to pass to him during the game.|$|E
30|$|The flow of {{the cold}} fluid is {{controlled}} by the shape of the <b>baffle.</b> The degree of turbulence created and energy utilized in the turbulence are governed by the <b>baffles.</b> Different <b>baffle</b> cuts, i.e., 25  % <b>baffle</b> cut, quarter <b>baffle</b> cut, and mirror quarter <b>baffle</b> cut are used for this analysis. The <b>baffles</b> are not only meant for structural support but also increase the external surface area of the tubes which resulted in improvement in the heat transfer.|$|R

5|$|Sherlock Holmes <b>Baffled</b> is a {{very short}} American silent film created in 1900 with {{cinematography}} by Arthur Marvin. It is the earliest known film to feature Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character Sherlock Holmes, albeit in a form unlike that of later screen incarnations. The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes. At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart the intruder end in failure.|$|E
5|$|The Atlas booster {{had been}} {{modified}} since the previous flight, and now included <b>baffled</b> fuel injectors {{and a new}} hypergolic fuel igniter instead of the original pyrotechnic igniter. This would completely eliminate problems with combustion instability and allow the booster to be released immediately upon attaining full thrust instead of being held on the pad for a few moments. The factory testing and checkout process for MA-8's booster, while still a lengthy affair taking several months (partially due to the new propulsion system), was nonetheless easier and shorter {{than it had been}} for any previous Mercury-Atlas vehicle as engineers gained more experience with the hardware and coordination between contractors improved.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{vibration}} problem of liquid-solid coupling of rectangular liquid-storage structure with horizontal elastic <b>baffle,</b> ignoring the influence of surface gravity wave, two different velocity potential functions corresponding to the liquid {{above and below the}} elastic <b>baffle</b> are assumed; based on the theory of mathematical equation and energy method, the formulas of basic frequency of liquid-solid coupling vibration system are derived, the <b>baffle</b> joined to the tank wall with 3 kinds of boundary conditions, namely, four edges simply supported, two opposite edges clamped and two opposite edges simply supported, and four edges clamped; the influence rules of <b>baffle</b> length-width ratio, the ratio of <b>baffle</b> height to liquid level, <b>baffle</b> elastic modulus, <b>baffle</b> density, <b>baffle</b> thickness, and liquid density on the coupling vibration performance are studied. The results show that the frequency of the clamped boundary is minimum; the influences of <b>baffle</b> length-width ratio and relative height on the basic frequency are much greater than that of the other system parameters; the relation between <b>baffle</b> length-width ratio and the frequency is exponential, while <b>baffle</b> relative height has a parabola relation with the frequency; the larger the <b>baffle</b> length-width ratio, the closer the <b>baffle</b> to the liquid level; the coupling frequency will be reduced more obviously...|$|R
40|$|A fluid-structure {{interaction}} {{phenomenon is}} an important consideration in several engineering fields. When a tank truck is braking, turning or in collision, the liquid in the partially-filled tank will slosh or even splash due to the oscillating of the unrestrained free surface of the liquid. The study of the pressure impulse on the <b>baffles</b> and walls can provide data on the impacts acting on the tank and <b>baffles</b> {{which can be used}} for simulating handling stability, especially for planes, rockets and spacecraft. We consider the wave impact against a vertical <b>baffle</b> in four cases: (i) A vertical <b>baffle</b> at free surface; (ii) A vertical <b>baffle</b> in front of a wall; (iii) A vertical <b>baffle</b> at a deck in front of a seawall; (iv) A vertical <b>baffle</b> on the seabed in front of a wall. The mathematical formulation and the boundary conditions for four cases of <b>baffles</b> which have different positions are presented using the pressure impulse theory. We used a basis function method to solve the mathematical formulation, and total impulse and moment impulse are investigated for each problem. The influence of the depth of <b>baffle</b> penetration {{and the size of the}} impact region is also studied. We can see different of impact pressure impulse for different case of <b>baffle.</b> We note that pressure impulse on the <b>baffles</b> almost same for case (i),(ii) and (iii) for different length of <b>baffles</b> with same size of impact. However the pressure impulse behind the <b>baffles</b> decreases when the length of <b>baffle</b> increases for case (ii) and (iii).

5|$|To avoid violating Edison's patents, Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large-format film {{measuring}} 2-23/32 inches (68mm) wide, with {{an image}} area of 2 × 2½ inches, four times that of Edison's 35mm format. Biograph film was not ready-perforated; the camera itself punched a sprocket hole {{on each side of}} the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second. Sherlock Holmes <b>Baffled</b> ran to 86.56 metres in length, giving the film a running time of 30 seconds (although in practice, due to the hand-cranked gearing of the Mutoscope this would have varied).|$|E

5|$|Driberg made {{no secret}} of his homosexuality, which he practised {{throughout}} his life despite its being a criminal offence in Britain until 1967; his ability to avoid any consequences for his risky and often brazen behaviour <b>baffled</b> his friends and colleagues. Always in search of bizarre experiences, Driberg befriended at various times the occultist Aleister Crowley and the Kray twins, along with honoured and respected figures in the worlds of literature and politics. He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to Anglo-Catholicism. After his death, allegations were published about his role over many years as an MI5 informant, a KGB agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.|$|E

40|$|Using <b>baffles</b> {{in exhaust}} {{mufflers}} {{is known to}} improve their transmission loss. The <b>baffle</b> cut ratio should affect the muffler performance analogous to a shell-and-tube heat exchanger. To the authors’ knowledge, there is no previous assessment reported in literature of the effects that the <b>baffle</b> cut ratio configuration has on acoustic response and back pressure. This investigation presents a parametric study {{on the effect of}} <b>baffle</b> configuration on transmission loss and pressure drop predicted. The effect of (i) the <b>baffle</b> cut ratio and <b>baffle</b> spacing, (ii) the number of <b>baffle</b> holes, and (iii) the hole distribution for their effect on transmission loss was investigated.

5|$|In {{designing}} puzzles, Barth {{wanted to}} keep puzzles open-ended, allowing the player {{to come to a}} solution without funneling them in a specific direction. The team designed puzzles based on general chemistry concepts without envisioning the specific solution that the player would take. They brainstormed a number of puzzles and then eliminated those with similar solutions, and arranged the others into a reasonable learning curve for the game. Despite this, Barth reflected that the tutorials provided to explain the game's mechanics had mixed responses, from some players who took up the concept easily to others that remained <b>baffled</b> as to the puzzle's goal even when instructions were set out step by step. In some cases, Barth discovered that players made assumptions on limitations of the game from these tutorials such as the idea that the red and blue waldos must remain in the separate halves of the screen. Based on the feedback that players had made on sites that hosted his previous Flash-based games, Barth designed the global-based histograms to allow players to check their solution without feeling overwhelmed by the top players as would be normally listed on a leaderboard. He also devised the means of sharing solutions through YouTube videos due to similar comments and discussions on the previous games.|$|E
5|$|The Monks, {{referred}} to by the name monks on record sleeves, were an American garage rock band formed in Gelnhausen, Germany in 1964. Assembled by five American G.I.s stationed in the country, the group grew tired of the traditional format of rock, which motivated them to forge a highly experimental style characterized by an emphasis on hypnotic rhythms that minimized the role of melody, augmented {{by the use of}} sound manipulation techniques. The band's unconventional blend of shrill vocals, feedback, and guitarist David Day's six-string banjo <b>baffled</b> audiences, but music historians have since identified the Monks as a pioneering force in avant-garde music. The band's lyrics often voiced objection to the Vietnam War and the apparently dehumanized state of society, while prefiguring the harsh and blunt commentary of the punk rock movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The band's appearance was considered as shocking as its music, as they attempted to mimic the look of Catholic monks by wearing black habits with cinctures symbolically tied around their necks, and hair worn in partially shaved tonsures.|$|E
