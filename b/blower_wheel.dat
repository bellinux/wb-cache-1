40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [90]- 91) The {{object of}} this study is to evaluate the cause of the failure of a plastic 20 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene <b>blower</b> <b>wheel.</b> The <b>blower</b> <b>wheel</b> plays an integral part in the forced distribution of the airflow in the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning system of commercial vehicles. Therefore, it is essential that the <b>blower</b> <b>wheel</b> be highly dependable. This is especially true for commercial vehicles where long warranty requirements and high reliability are required. Several test and analysis methods were employed to understand the cause of the failure of the <b>blower</b> <b>wheel.</b> Initially, the high-speed burst test was used to expose the effects of temperature and imbalance on the part. Experimental vibration analysis was performed on the <b>blower</b> <b>wheel</b> to show the characteristic natural frequencies. This was compared to the numerical natural frequencies found with a finite element analysis (FEA) software package. The experimental stress values were compared to the numerical stress values. The material analysis showed the material was not degraded during the injection molding process and it was not always meeting specifications for the glass coupling agent. Finally, the failures were compared to the S-N fatigue life curves for 25 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene and 20 % glass fiber-reinforced polypropylene material. The study found the root cause of the failures to be a combination of resonance, material issues and fatigue that cause the inlet top ring to break on the <b>blower</b> <b>wheel.</b> Improvements in design, process, and testing are recommended for the <b>blower</b> <b>wheel.</b> M.

40|$|The AHU (air handler unit) {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{research}} objects in HVAC (heating, ventilating and air conditioning) system containing coils, <b>blower</b> <b>wheel,</b> heater, etc. Most of the high efficiency blower wheels are driven by BLDC (brushless DC) motor. This paper mainly focuses on two severe problems in <b>blower</b> <b>wheel,</b> namely airflow blockage and unbalanced load of fan motor. Early diagnosis of these problems decreases energy consumption in HVAC system significantly. Condition monitoring method applied to both the stator current and stray flux is utilized in unbalanced load condition in a BLDC motor. The fundamental frequency and second harmonics of stray flux are analyzed as indicators under unbalance load condition. The discrimination between airflow blockage and unbalanced load based on stator spectrum analysis is also discussed in this paper. Some experiment results are given to prove that this method provides more efficacy and stability to diagnose the faults in <b>blower</b> <b>wheel...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} have a {{standard}} for furnaces that includes electricity consumption or for the efficiency of furnace blowers to be determined, it is necessary to determine the airflow of a furnace or furnace blower. This study focused on airflow testing, in order to determine if an existing test method for measuring blower airflow could be used to measure the airflow of a furnace, under conditions seen in actual installations and to collect data and insights into the operating characteristics of various types of furnace blowers, to use in the analysis of the electricity consumption of furnaces. Results of the measured airflow on furnaces with three types of blower and motor combinations are presented in the report. These included: (1) a forward-curved <b>blower</b> <b>wheel</b> with a typical permanent split capacitor (PSC) motor, (2) a forward-curved <b>blower</b> <b>wheel</b> with an electronically-commutated motor (ECM), and (3) a prototype blower, consisting of a backward-inclined <b>blower</b> <b>wheel</b> matched to an ECM motor prototype, which is being developed as an energy-saving alternative to conventional furnace blowers. The testing provided data on power consumption, static and total pressure, and blower speed...|$|E
40|$|Dayton PSC and Shaded Pole blowers provide {{economical}} {{air delivery}} for general heating, cooling, ventilating, or component cooling. Typical applications include cooling greenhouses, blowers for wood and corn stoves, ventilating small buildings, cooling electrical enclosures and removing heat from machinery. The blowers are exact replacements for many OEM blowers {{with the same}} physical footprint. Forward curve wheels driven by Dayton motors are rated for continuous duty with all-position mount. These units incorporate balanced ball or sleeve-bearing motors with cast aluminum end shields. This provides greater heat dissipation and protection, reducing down time due to component failure and accidental damage. Direct drive <b>blower</b> <b>wheels</b> are dynamically balanced to reduce noise and vibration and to maintain CFM at higher static pressures. Dimensions in. (mm...|$|R
