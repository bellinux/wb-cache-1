There was no method or technology to measure TCDD in blood in those days and none accepted to donate adipose tissue to measure it so as to determine contamination. Therefore, the only measurement available was TCDD in soil and in dead animals. At the beginning, tracking of areas with dead animals and children with burns was also conducted.

Frequencies and thermodynamic values obtained by using the standard 6 - 31 G basis set are better than those obtained using the BC 6 - 31 G basis set when compared to experiment and G 3 MF 2.

It was found that both leaving group and nucleophile KIE vary with the TS structure. However, a correct and measurable substituent effect on leaving group KIEs will only be found for a very reactant-like or for a very product-like TS. The substituent effect on nucleophile KIEs will only be found when the Nu-Cα bond formation in the TS is well advanced i. e., in a product-like SN 2 TS. [...] Nucleophile carbon k¹¹/k¹⁴ and secondary a-deuterium [(kH/kD) α] kinetic isotope effects (KIEs) were also calculated for the SN 2 reactions between tetrabutylammonium cyanide and ethyl iodide, bromide, chloride and tosylate and compared to the experimental results to determine whether these isotope effects can be used to determine the structure of the SN 2 transition states. The results showed that the nucleophile carbon k¹¹/k¹⁴ KIEs can be used to determine the transition state structure in different reactions and the results suggest that changing to a poorer leaving group leads to a tighter transition state. The magnitude of the experimental secondary α-deuterium KIE is related to the nucleophile - leaving group distance in the SN 2 transition state (RTS) for reactions with a halogen leaving group.

50|$|The {{first of}} these methods {{consists}} of a Pinner reaction of <b>benzyl</b> <b>cyanide,</b> giving phenylacetic acid ethyl ester. Subsequently, this ester undergoes cross Claisen condensation using diethyl oxalate, giving diethyl ester of phenyloxobutandioic acid.

50|$|The most {{versatile}} synthesis {{developed by the}} Swiss team first involved alkylation of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene with 1-amino-2-diethylaminoethane to form N-(β-Diethylaminoethyl)-2,4-dinitroaniline N'-(2,4-Dinitrophenyl)-N,N-diethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine. The 2-nitro substituent on the 2,4-dinitroaniline compound is then selectively reduced to the corresponding primary amine by utilizing ammonium sulfide as the reducing agent. The ammonium sulfide can be formed in situ {{by the addition of}} concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide followed by saturation of the solution with hydrogen sulfide gas. The intermediate formed by the selective reduction of the 2-nitro substituent, 2-(β-Diethylaminoethylamino)-5-nitroaniline, is then reacted with the hydrochloride salt of the imino ethyl ether of 4-ethoxyphenylacetonitrile (aka: p-ethoxybenzyl cyanide). The imino ether, 2-(4-Ethoxyphenyl)-acetimidic acid ethyl ester hydrochloride, is prepared by dissolving the 4-substituted <b>benzyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> in a mixture of anhydrous ethanol and chloroform and then saturating this solution with dry hydrogen chloride gas. The reaction between the 2-(β-dialkylaminoalkylamine)-5-nitroaniline and the HCl salt of the imino ethyl ether results in the formation of etonitazene. This procedure is particularly useful in the preparation of the 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-nitrobenzimidazoles. Varying the choice of the substituted phenylacetic acid imino ether affords compounds with a diversity of substituents on the benzene ring at the 2- position.

40|$|Abstract Males of {{a variety}} of insects {{transfer}} an antiaphrodisiac pheromone to females during mating that renders them less attractive to conspecific males. In cabbage white butterflies, the transfer of an anti-aphrodisiac can result in the unwanted attraction of tiny egg parasitoid wasps of the genus Trichogramma that hitch-hike with mated female butterflies to a host plant where they parasitize the freshly laid butterfly eggs. Here, we show that the anti-aphrodisiac <b>benzyl</b> <b>cyanide</b> (BC) of the large cabbage white Pieris brassicae is depleted by frequent display of the mate-refusal posture that signals a female’s unreceptivity to mating.
