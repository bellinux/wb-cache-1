50|$|In the {{recording}} process, a sufficiently amplified audio signal {{was sent to}} a heavily weighted electromagnetic recording head with a blunt diamond stylus that indented, rather than cut or engraved, a sound-modulated groove into the surface of the metal. Normally, a completely blank disc was used and {{the recording}} head was slowly carried toward its center by a dedicated feed mechanism. Some low-end recording units economized by eliminating the feed mechanism, relying instead on the use of discs already cut with a narrow <b>blank</b> <b>groove</b> that guided the stylus, which simply impressed its vibrations into the upper region of the existing groove. This cost-cutting approach produced recordings with a very limited dynamic range and generally inferior sound. In either case, because of the grain structure of the metal and its resistance to the side-to-side motions of the recording stylus, significant surface noise was inherent and the high-frequency signal content was heavily attenuated.|$|E
5000|$|The Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio Color was {{a unique}} album in jazz and popular music {{recorded}} annals. It was a two-LP set, with Side 4 apparently [...] "blank", the label not indicating any content. However, once word of [...] "the secret message" [...] got around among Rahsaan's fans, one would find that about 12 minutes into Side 4 appeared {{the first of two}} telephone answering machine messages recorded by Kirk, the second following soon thereafter (but separated by more <b>blank</b> <b>grooves).</b> The surprise impact of these segments appearing on [...] "blank" [...] Side 4 was lost on the CD reissue of this album.|$|R
5000|$|There {{were a few}} exceptions, namely, some {{conceptual}} [...] "anti-records" [...] {{they released}} in the late 1980s and early 90s. The first, from 1988, was entitled Wind Licked Dirt, and consisted of an uncut vinyl LP in a cover packed {{with a bunch of}} small pebbles, which are included to [...] "play" [...] the record with. A later edition of this was made with a [...] "CD" [...] (a clear protective disc from a spindle of blank discs), and it is currently available as a [...] "C-0 cassette." [...] The second was entitled Oxygen is Flammable, and was a broken piece of plastic packaged in a small box. Enclosed were instructions which state that the piece of plastic is a record, and that it's played by pouring water over it. The instructions also call attention to possible similarities between the sounds of water falling and fire rising. One record was cut with <b>blank</b> <b>grooves</b> and packaged with a piece of steel wool; the owner of the record was requested to scour the surface of the record with the steel wool and then play it. This record was entitled [...] "Fire". Another was called Shear, which was a ball of cotton batting packaged in a small box. Wrapped around the contents are instructions on three thin strips of paper, which informs the holder that the cotton batting is a recording, which is played by squeezing. The sounds this [...] "record" [...] gives are described by Larsen as being a [...] "sharp fluffy slightness" [...] and a [...] "thin fluffy pressed". These three releases are, in and of themselves, a kind of performance piece.|$|R
