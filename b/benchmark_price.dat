[...] In the year 2016, the levelized tariff in US$ for solar PV electricity has fallen below 2.42 cents/kWh. Also the international tariff of solar thermal storage power plants has fallen to US$ 6.3 cents/kWh which is cheaper than fossil fuel plants.

40|$|We {{simulate}} competitive <b>benchmark</b> wholesale <b>prices</b> {{for electricity}} in California {{during the summer}} of 2000, taking account of changes in gas prices, demand, and imports during this time period. We also examine the impact of changes in the prices of NOx emissions permits on the competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> for electricity. The competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> are compared to actual prices. A significant fraction of the changes in wholesale electricity prices in California during Summer 2000 can be explained by these four factors. The impact of higher NOx permit prices, and their interaction with reduced imports into California, have a particularly large impact on competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices.</b> However, during June, July and August a large unexplained difference between actual <b>prices</b> and competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> remains. We attribute this difference to supplier market power and related market imperfections. We then examine whether there is evidence of strategic behavior by suppliers during the highest priced hours during the summer. Evidence of supply withholding during these hours is identified. ...|$|R

40|$|Following {{open door}} policy, China is {{allowing}} a major and valuable national resource, namely land, to be privatized in the market. Land {{has not been}} allocated according to the market since the Communist party took power in 1949. Without extensive market activities it has become imperative for both central and local government to devise guidelines when selling land to developers who have found great potential in this market. After initial pilot studies in some cities, a <b>benchmark</b> <b>pricing</b> model was finally devised to provide guideline land prices. In theory, this model has the role of leading the existing land allocation system into a price mechanism similar to a market economy. However, {{the legacy of the}} socialist ideology concerning the assessment of value exerts a strong effect on the <b>benchmark</b> <b>pricing</b> model which makes the behaviour of the <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> inconsistent with market prices. An examination of the <b>benchmark</b> <b>pricing</b> of land in various Chinese cities has revealed that China is still favouring the use of a production cost function when valuing land. A combination of the cost and market value approaches has produced the first guidelines for land prices since 1949. These guidelines represents a compromise which may be useful in the short run but which cannot be effective in establishing market land price behaviour in the long run. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|During the Summer of 2000, {{wholesale}} {{electricity prices}} in California were nearly 500 % {{higher than they}} were during the same months in 1998 or 1999. This price explosion was unexpected and has called into question whether electricity restructuring will bring the benefits of competition promised to consumers. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine the factors that explain this increase in wholesale electricity prices. We simulate competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> for Summer of 2000 taking account of all relevant supply and demand factors [...] - gas prices, demand, imports from other states, and emission permit prices. We then compare the simulated competitive <b>benchmark</b> <b>prices</b> with the actual prices observed.

5000|$|Actually, Verstein argues, {{this data}} {{strongly}} supported a different theory of manipulation. The majors bought up potential hot oil {{that was being}} priced below the market—oil that if included in calculating the benchmark (for example, if bought up {{by one of the}} jobber middlemen whose purchases were included in the benchmark) would have lowered the benchmark and thus lowered the prices the majors received for all of their oil. But the prices that the majors paid for the potential hot oil did not go into the benchmark, and the prices the jobbers would have paid did not go into the benchmark (because the jobbers never bought that oil). [...] "By buying up any oil priced more cheaply than the current <b>benchmark</b> <b>price,</b> the oil companies could support the <b>benchmark</b> <b>price</b> against falling with the market." [...] Since 91% of the potential hot oil that the majors bought was bought below the <b>benchmark</b> <b>price,</b> and the majors disqualified that oil from inclusion in the benchmark by buying it themselves, the dancing-partner program prevented a huge drop in the spot market benchmark. Apparently, the government failed to realize this.|$|E
