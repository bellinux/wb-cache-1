5|$|I had to {{therefore}} {{come up with}} my {{own decisions}} about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> have to reconcile all of that, and people seem to think it works.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> love the richness of that video. To me it felt like a painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E
25|$|Into the '60s, I {{was still}} not of a frame of mind {{that we were not}} only making music, we were making history. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{recognize}} the impact because acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South {{in the early days of}} Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.|$|E

25|$|I {{discovered}} {{a dark and}} hairy creature on a branch... The sedapa was also hairy {{on the front of}} its body; the colour there was a little lighter than on the back. The very dark hair on its head fell to just below the shoulder-blades or even almost to the waist... Had it been standing, its arms would have reached to a little above its knees; they were therefore long, but its legs seemed to me rather short. I did not see its feet, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> see some toes which were shaped in a very normal manner... There was nothing repulsive or ugly about its face, nor was it at all apelike.|$|E
25|$|As well as {{reviving}} the rallying program, one of Hayes first accomplishments was to sign relatively unknown Scottish racing driver Jackie Stewart. Stewart was attending the 1964 British International Motor Show at Earl's Court, London, when Hayes approached him and later offered Stewart £500 to promote Ford products in 1965, {{along with the}} white Ford Zodiac that was the centrepiece of Ford's exhibit to drive that year. Stewart later commented: “I didn’t know who Walter Hayes was, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> know that to have a contract with Ford Motor Company {{was a big deal}} with great opportunities for the future, even though I wasn’t yet aware that Ford would enter Formula One.” The relationship was to last forty years, and be so successful it was the model for other Formula One stars and motor manufacturers.|$|E
500|$|Levin made no pretence of even-handedness. There were {{politicians}} {{he liked}} and politicians {{he did not}} like. For those in the latter category, [...] "Taper's lacerations wounded". He invented unflattering nicknames; he wrote later, [...] "I did not (though I wish I had) think of calling Sir Hartley Shawcross Sir Shortly Floorcross, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> call Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller Sir Reginald Bullying-Manner". When the latter was elevated to the peerage as Lord Dilhorne, Levin renamed him Lord Stillborn.|$|E

500|$|During {{his stay}} in New York, Karthi {{worked as a}} {{part-time}} graphic designer. He then decided {{to pursue a career}} in film-making; he attended two courses in basic film-making at State University of New York. He stated, [...] "I always knew I wanted to be in films <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know exactly what I wanted to do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them. But my father insisted that I get a good education before I joined the film industry".|$|E
500|$|Approaching {{the end of}} the season, Benfica had {{a three-point}} lead over Sporting in the league table. Their next {{opponent}} was Penafiel, whom they played at their home ground. With the stadium packed with Benfica fans, Penafiel surprised Benfica and beat them 1–0, costing them first place. After the game, Trappattoni said, [...] "It was good game <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not expect this outcome. We have to keep morale because Saturday we have a important game. There we will decide who is stronger." ...|$|E

I did not lose interest in developing the Christian tradition so as to render it intelligible, convincing, and illuminating in a changing context. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> reject the compartmentalization of my discipline of 'constructive theology,' especially in its separation from ethics, and more generally in its isolation from other academic disciplines... I was persuaded that no problem could be more critical {{than that of a}} decent survival of a humanity that threatened to destroy itself by exhausting and polluting its natural context." ...|$|E
500|$|On 4 January 2013, it was {{announced}} that Chamakh had been loaned to West Ham United {{until the end of the}} 2012–13 season. The loan deal was confirmed on West Ham's official site with the striker saying, [...] "I didn't have opportunities to play recently, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> well before and I know I am a very good striker. We played only one striker at Arsenal, so I didn't play a lot, so I hope to do so more with West Ham." [...] He played only three games for West Ham without scoring.|$|E
500|$|Ferrari {{hosted a}} press conference on the Tuesday after Jerez during which Schumacher {{admitted}} that he had made a mistake but said it was a misjudgement rather than a deliberate attempt to take out Villeneuve. [...] "I am human like everyone else and unfortunately I made a mistake," [...] he said. [...] "I don't make many <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> this time." [...] In their respective books on Schumacher, James Allen and Swiss motorsports author Luc Domenjoz have both since expressed the view that Villeneuve went into the corner too fast, and without Schumacher turning into him would have overshot the turn.|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class. The Countess's increasing intimacy {{with her husband and}} daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina. Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make me tell her that I did not like her, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not say either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{social worker}} and a police officer from Haringey council, Lisa Arthurworrey and Karen Jones, respectively, were {{assigned}} to her case, and were scheduled to make a home visit on 4 August 1999; however, the visit was cancelled once they heard about the scabies. Jones later said, [...] "it might not be logical <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know anything about scabies." [...] She said that she telephoned North Middlesex Hospital {{for information about the}} disease, but Garnham had evidence that the staff there dealt with no such inquiry. Jones was told by a doctor that Climbié's injuries were consistent with belt buckle marks, although she claimed in the inquiry {{there was no evidence of}} child abuse.|$|E
500|$|Shel Talmy, the {{producer}} on the track, {{has gone on}} record and put the controversy to rest {{in an interview with}} The Guardian, saying [...] "contrary to myth, Jimmy didn't play on 'You Really Got Me'." [...] In a 7 November 2014 interview with SiriusXM's Town Hall series, Page confirmed again that he did not play on the song, saying [...] "Oh, Crikey! I wasn't on 'You Really Got Me,' <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> play on the Kinks' records. That's all I'm going to say about it. But every time I do an interview, people ask me about 'You Really Got Me.' So maybe somebody can correct Wikipedia so people won't keep asking me." ...|$|E

I knew that Frank McLaury had {{the reputation of being}} a good shot and a dangerous man, and I aimed at Frank McLaury." [...] He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: [...] "The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury." [...] Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.|$|E
500|$|West {{released}} his first album, Blue Cowboy, in 1987. Blue Cowboy is {{an album of}} three original songs and five covers. Chuck Yarborough of the Cleveland Plain Dealer said, [...] "Listening to the first excerpt of his [...] "Blue Cowboy" [...] made me balk—you'll pardon the expression—at listening to the second. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> And the third. And so on. And now? Well, if I'm Nashville, I run West outta the game. The Hook. The Heave-Ho. The Thumb." [...] In a September 2012 review, music blog Long After Dark said, [...] "Blue Cowboy easily ranks with Ron Artest and Carl Lewis {{as one of the}} worst albums that a sports figure has cut ... ever. I can say that I managed {{to make it through the}} record, although it was not easy." ...|$|E
500|$|The Emperor {{considered}} appointing Luís Alves {{to command}} the Emperor's Battalion and asked him which side he would choose. According to historian Francisco Doratioto, Luís Alves answered that [...] "between {{the love of his}} father and his duty to the crown, he would stay with the latter." [...] PedroI expressed gratitude for his loyalty, but instead ordered him to take the Emperor's Battalion to the Field of Santana and join the rebels, preferring abdication to bloodshedding. Decades later, Luís Alves said in the Brazilian Senate: [...] "I marched along with the Emperor's Battalion to the Field of Santana, out of devotion to competent orders [...] I was not a revolutionary. I esteemed the Abdication. I judged that it would be of advantage to Brazil, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not concur directly or indirectly with it." ...|$|E
