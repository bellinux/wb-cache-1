Compound titles exist, such as Maravacakravarti that <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Maravar chief as well as Malavacakravarti that <b>belonged</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Malava chief. Ariyar in Tamil could denote a noble or a learned person, a Brahmin or alternatively a person from Aryavarta. Thus the title Arayacakravarti seems to fit the structure of similarly used titles across the Pandyan kingdom.|$|E

Specifically, results shown in this section are with ACI, and results shown in Section 3 are without ACI. The simulation parameters are specified in Table  1, if not otherwise indicated. To {{examine the effects of}} ACI on a given receiver, consider two transmitters: one transmitter is desired and generates the desired signal, and the other transmitter is not desired and generates ACI. Presented in this section are the following three scenarios. In the first scenario, the reference receiver <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> PU, the desired transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> another PU, and the interfering transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> SU. In the second scenario, the reference receiver <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> SU, the desired transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> another SU, and the interfering transmitter <b>belongs</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> PU.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} themes of the {{experience}} of <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male-only society, namely Freemasonry, by allowing members of the Freemasons to tell their stories of their experience of <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> Freemasonry. The epistemological framework was that of phenomenology, using a qualitative research design. The study involved a series of in-depth individual interviews. Their stories provide alternative ways of perceiving men’s experience of <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male-only society, focusing on the Freemasons. Several common themes were also identified in the participants’ interviews. The researcher found that the history of the Freemasons plays a large role in the member’s justification for female exclusion. Gender, as well as the members need <b>to</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male- only society, gave the researcher some insight into their experience of <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male-only society. The themes that were articulated in the study may be helpful in trying to understand the experiences of <b>belonging</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> male-only society.
