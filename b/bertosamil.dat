40|$|In whole-cell patch-clamped human atrial myocytes, the {{antiarrhythmic}} agent <b>bertosamil</b> (10 [*]μM) inhibited the sustained component, Isus (38. 6 ± 3. 1 %), and enhanced the inactivating component, It (9. 1 ± 6. 1 %), of the outward K+ current elicited by 750 [*]ms test pulses from − 60 [*]mV to + 50 [*]mV. Higher concentrations of <b>bertosamil</b> (> 10 [*]μM) inhibited both It and Isus. Suppression of Isus and stimulation of It by 10 [*]μM <b>bertosamil</b> was observed on renewed stimulation following a 2 [*]min rest {{period during which}} the drug was applied and persisted after washout, indicating a rest-dependent effect of <b>bertosamil</b> on the outward K+ current. Cell dialysis with an internal solution containing 10 [*]μM <b>bertosamil</b> increased both It (78. 0 ± 14. 7 %) and Itotal (26. 7 ± 8. 4 %) and inhibited Isus (28. 9 ± 6. 3 %, n= 6). In the presence of intracellular <b>bertosamil,</b> external application of the drug inhibited It and Isus in a concentration-dependent and use-dependent manner. Following the suppression of Isus by 200 [*]μM 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP), <b>bertosamil</b> (10 [*]μM) inhibited It. Washout of 4 -AP {{was associated with a}} larger It amplitude than that observed in control conditions. In myocytes characterized by a prominent Isus and lack of It, <b>bertosamil</b> (10 [*]μM) induced a rapid and partial inactivation of the current, together with inward rectification of the current measured {{at the end of the}} test pulse. In the presence of <b>bertosamil</b> the activation/voltage relationships, steady-state inactivation and recovery from inactivation of It were markedly modified, pointing to changes in the conductance underlying It. We conclude that <b>bertosamil</b> induces rapid inactivation of sustained outward current which leads to an apparent increase in It and decrease in Isus. This effect, which was distinct from the use-dependent inhibition of the outward K+ current, could represent a new antiarrhythmic mechanism...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bertosamil</b> is {{chemically}} {{related to}} the class-III anti-arrhythmic drug tedisamil and has been developed as a bradycardic, anti-ischemic and anti-arrhythmic drug. Its anti-arrhythmic properties might in part be attributed to its block of voltage-dependent potassium channels Kv 1. 2, Kv 1. 4. and Kv 1. 5. However, HERG-potassium channel block as an important target for class-III drugs {{has not yet been}} investigated. We investigated the effect of <b>bertosamil</b> on the HERG potassium channel heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes with the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. <b>Bertosamil</b> (70 μM) inhibited HERG tail currrent after a test pulse to 30 mV by 49. 3 ± 8. 4 % (n= 5) and the IC 50 was 62. 7 μM. Onset of block was fast, i. e. 90 % of inhibition developed within 180 ± 8. 22 s (n= 5), and block was totally reversible upon washout within 294 ± 38. 7 s (n= 5). Bertosamil-induced block of HERG potassium channels was state-dependent with block mainly to open- and inactivated channels. Half-maximal activation voltage was slightly shifted towards more negative potentials. Steady-state inactivation of HERG was not influenced by <b>bertosamil.</b> <b>Bertosamil</b> block elicited voltage–but no frequency-dependent effects. In summary, <b>bertosamil</b> blocked the HERG potassium channel. These blocking properties may contribute to the anti-arrhythmic effects of <b>bertosamil</b> in the treatment of atrial and particular ventricular arrhythmias...|$|E
