40|$|AIMS: Many {{variables}} affect mRNA measurements in {{post mortem}} human <b>brain</b> tissue. <b>Brain</b> <b>weight</b> has not hitherto been {{considered to be}} such a factor. This study examined whether there is any relationship between <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and mRNA abundance. METHODS: We investigated quantitative real-time RT-PCR data for five 'housekeeping genes' using the 104 adult brains of the Stanley Microarray Consortium series. Eleven data sets were analysed, from cerebellum, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex. We used a specified sequence of correlations, partial correlations and multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: <b>Brain</b> <b>weight</b> correlated with the 'raw' (i. e. non-normalized) data for two mRNAs, β 2 -microglobulin and TATA-binding protein, measured in cerebellum and hippocampus, respectively. In hippocampus, the geometric mean of three housekeeping gene transcripts also correlated with <b>brain</b> <b>weight.</b> The correlations were significant after adjusting for age, sex and other confounders, and the effect of <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> was confirmed using multiple regression. No correlations with <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> were seen in the anterior cingulate cortex, nor for the other mRNAs examined. CONCLUSIONS: The findings were not anticipated; they need replication in another brain series, and a more systematic survey is indicated. In the interim, we suggest that quantitative gene expression studies in human brain should inspect for a potential influence of <b>brain</b> <b>weight,</b> especially as the affected transcripts are commonly used as reference genes for normalization purposes in studies of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The relationship of <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> with β 2 -microglobulin mRNA may reflect the roles of major histocompatibility complex class I genes in synapse formation and plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Some {{individuals}} {{are able to}} avoid reaching the threshold for clinical dementia {{despite the presence of}} Alzheimer neuropathology. This disparity between the neuropathologic and clinical symptoms required for a diagnosis of AD is often attributed to cognitive resilience, defined in the current study as the combined influence of brain reserve and cognitive reserve. This study assessed how educational attainment (a common measure of cognitive reserve), as well as <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and cortical atrophy (measures of brain reserve), may influence the outcome of cognitive resilience independently or through interactions with each other. Methods: Analyses were based on the Nun Study, a longitudinal study of aging in 678 participants aged 75 + years at baseline. Educational attainment data were available through convent archives while <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and cortical atrophy data were collected through post mortem autopsies. Alzheimer neuropathology was assessed through post mortem autopsies and was defined using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) and National Institute on Aging and Reagan Institute (NIA-RI) neuropathologic criteria. Finally, dementia status was determined through annual cognitive testing using DSM-IV criteria. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess all associations between exposures (educational attainment, <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and cortical atrophy) and the outcome (cognitive resilience), controlling for participant age at the time of death and the presence of apolipoprotein E-ε 4. Results: Higher educational attainment and <b>brain</b> <b>weight,</b> and the absence of cortical atrophy were all positively associated with cognitive resilience defined using both CERAD and NIA-RI neuropathologic criteria. However, the negative association between cortical atrophy and cognitive resilience was significant only when <b>brain</b> <b>weights</b> were high. When <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and educational attainment were assessed in the same models, the influence of educational attainment fell below statistical significance. Finally, when educational attainment was assessed in models stratified by cortical atrophy status, it remained significant only in the presence of mild atrophy. Discussion: It was hypothesized that higher educational attainment, higher <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and the absence of cortical atrophy would all be positively associated with cognitive resilience. These hypotheses were supported by findings in the study. Further, it was hypothesized that the impacts of mild atrophy would be more significant among individuals with lower <b>brain</b> <b>weights</b> than among those with higher <b>brain</b> <b>weights,</b> as higher <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> would act as a buffer against mild atrophy. However, findings were contrary to this hypothesis, with results suggesting that atrophy was only significant when <b>brain</b> <b>weights</b> were high. This non-significant effect is likely partially related to low statistical power in the low <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> strata. However, this result may additionally be the result of a floor effect whereby low <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> depletes <b>brain</b> reserve {{to such an extent that}} further loss in tissue (through cortical atrophy) is unlikely to result in further impairment. Finally, it was hypothesized that educational attainment would be most strongly associated with cognitive resilience when brain reserve was low (i. e., in the presence of cortical atrophy or low <b>brain</b> <b>weight).</b> This hypothesis was partially supported by findings indicating that when mild atrophy was present, low educational attainment was associated with reduced odds of resilience. Overall, it appears that cognitive reserve factors (educational attainment) are important in reducing the clinical symptoms of AD in late life; however, these positive effects were only found when threats to brain reserve (cortical atrophy, low <b>brain</b> <b>weight)</b> were absent or of mild severity. Conclusion: Higher levels of education can improve cognitive reserve and help reduce the risk of dementia symptoms despite AD brain changes. These benefits are only realized, however, when low <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and cortical atrophy are avoided. This study and future efforts aimed at better understanding how late-life cognitive resilience is influenced by factors from across the lifespan could inform applications of cognitive resilience theory to clinical and community settings with the goal of offsetting the devastating impacts of AD...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{variations}} in morphometric parameter of mammalian brains {{may be influenced}} by process of functional complexity, evolution and adaptation. Comparative analysis of linear measurements of cerebrum in the human and baboon has shown morphometric differences. In the present study linear measurements from human and baboon cerebrum (n= 10 each) were used to predict various values for human and baboon brain and body parameters through multiple regression models. The average <b>brain</b> <b>weights</b> were found to be 2. 08 % and 0. 84 % of the body weights for humans and baboons respectively. The elasticity of regression models revealed that unit percentage increase in Occipital-Frontal (OF) distance would increase the human <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> by 66. 19 %, while the baboon <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> would increase by 7. 63 %. The unit percentage increase in the Height of Temporal Lobe (HTL) would increase the human <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> by 16. 28 %, while the baboon <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> would increase by only 0. 28 %. Unit percentage increase in Frontal-Temporal (FT) distance would decrease the human and baboon <b>brain</b> <b>weights</b> by 14. 04 % and 0. 46 % respectively. Inter-species values were also predicted through simulation techniques by using the ratios of model parameters with application of programming language Python.

We aimed to identify which clinical factors are associated with morphometric brain changes in cognitively normal aging. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 414 subjects, &# 8805; 50 years old submitted to clinical assessment and brain autopsy, after informed consent, was carried out at the S&# 227;o Paulo Autopsy Service, Brazil. Data on cognitive and functional evaluations were collected through structured interview applied to the next-of-kin. <b>Brain</b> <b>weight</b> (g) and volume (mL) measurements were obtained and adjusted for head circumference (cm). Associations between brain weight/volume and related factors were obtained through univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Participants were predominantly male (60. 4 %), Caucasian (69 %), with mean age of 67. 1 &# 177; 10. 9 years. Mean <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> was 1219. 2 &# 177; 140. 9 g, and mean brain volume was 1217. 1 &# 177; 152. 3 mL.

Ochratoxin A was dissolved in sodium bicarbonate and administered orally on seventh to fourteenth days of gestation at dosage of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 mg/kg bw, respectively. The remaining animals were used as an untreated control, and placebo were given by Sodium Bicarbonate. At the age of 18 -day pregnancy, mice were sacrified dan taken its brains. The fetuses brain growth and development were observed by measure <b>brain</b> <b>weight,</b> cerebrum width and length, cerebellum width and length, and the wall thichkness of cerebrum. Result of this studies indicated that OTA caused decreased of <b>brain</b> <b>weight,</b> the length and width of cerebrum and cerebellum, the wall thickness of cerebrum significantl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Freezing lesions to {{developing}} rat cortex induced between postnatal day (P) {{one and three}} (P 1 – 3) lead to malformations similar to human microgyria, and further correspond to reductions in <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and cortical volume. In contrast, comparable lesions on P 5 do not produce microgyric malformations, nor the changes in <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> seen with microgyria. However, injury occurring at all three ages does lead to rapid auditory processing deficits as measured in the juvenile period. Interestingly, these deficits persist into adulthood only in the P 1 lesion case 1. Given prior evidence that early focal cortical lesions induce abnormalities in cortical morphology and connectivity 1 2 3 4, we hypothesized that the differential behavioral effects of focal cortical lesions on P 1, P 3 or P 5 {{may be associated with}} underlying neuroanatomical changes that are sensitive to timing of injury. Clinical studies indicate that humans with perinatal brain injury often show regional reductions in corpus callosum size and abnormal symmetry, which frequently correspond to learning impairments 5 6 7. Therefore, in the current study the brains of P 1, 3 or 5 lesion rats, previously evaluated for <b>brain</b> <b>weight,</b> and cortical volume changes and auditory processing impairments (P 21 - 90), were further analyzed for changes in corpus callosum volume. Results Results showed a significant main effect of Treatment on corpus callosum volume [F (1, 57) = 10. 2, P Conclusion Decrements in corpus callosum volume in the P 1 and 3 lesion groups are consistent with the reductions in <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and cortical volume previously reported for microgyric rats 1 8. Current results suggest that disruption to the cortical plate during early postnatal development may lead to more widely dispersed neurovolumetric anomalies and subsequent behavioral impairments 1, compared with injury that occurs later in development. Further, these results suggest that in a human clinical setting decreased corpus callosum volume may represent an additional marker for long-term behavioral outcome. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHomozygous Igf 1 − 1 − mice at 2 {{months of}} age had reduced <b>brain</b> <b>weights,</b> with {{reductions}} evenly affecting all major brain areas. The gross morphology of the CNS was normal, but the size of white matter structures in brain and spinal cord was strongly reduced, owing to decreased numbers of axons and oligodendrocytes. Myelinated axons were more strongly reduced in number than unmyelinated axons. The volume of the dentate gyrus granule cell layer was reduced {{in excess of the}} decrease in <b>brain</b> <b>weight.</b> Among populations of calcium-binding protein-containing neurons, there was a selective {{reduction in the number of}} striatal parvalbumin-containing cells. Numbers of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, striatal and basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, and spinal cord motoneurons were unaffected. Cerebellar morphology was unaltered. Our findings suggest cell type- and region-specific functions for IGF-I and emphasize prominent roles in axon growth and maturation in CNS myelination...|$|R
40|$|In haplorhine {{primates}} (tarsiers, monkeys, apes, and humans), {{there is}} a significant correlation between <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and maximum life-span when the effect of body size is removed. There is also a significant correlation in haplorhine primates between <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and female age at first reproduction. For strepsirhine primates (lorises and lemurs), there are no significant correlations between <b>brain</b> <b>weight</b> and either life-span or female reproductive age when the effect of body size is removed. This lack of correlation in strepsirhine primates {{may be related to the}} fact that these primates are nocturnal and/or natives of the island of Madagascar, both of which conditions may reduce competition for resources and predation pressure. These findings suggest that in haplorhine primates the genetic systems controlling brain growth are linked to the systems governing the life cycle so that species with longer cycles have larger brains. When the effect of body weight is removed, leaf-eating haplorhines have significantly smaller brains and shorter lives than haplorhines with other diets. Harem-living haplorhines also have significantly smaller brains and shorter life-spans than troop-living haplorhines when the effect of body weight is removed. We also sought to test the rate-of-living hypothesis by determining whether primates with basal metabolic rates that are higher than would be expected for their body size have shorter maximum life-spans than would be expected for their body size. Metabolic rate is not correlated with life-span or female age at first reproduction when the effect of body size is removed...|$|R
