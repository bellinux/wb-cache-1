5|$|All beetle larvae {{go through}} several instars, {{which are the}} {{developmental}} stages between each moult. In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the planidium) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as hypermetamorphosis; it occurs in the Meloidae, Micromalthidae, and Ripiphoridae. The <b>blister</b> <b>beetle</b> Epicauta vittata (Meloidae), for example, has three distinct larval stages. Its first stage, the triungulin, has longer legs to go {{in search of the}} eggs of grasshoppers. After feeding for a week it moults to the second stage, called the caraboid stage, which resembles the larva of a carabid beetle. In another week it moults and assumes the appearance of a scarabaeid larva – the scarabaeidoid stage. Its penultimate larval stage is the pseudo-pupa or the coarcate larva, which will overwinter and pupate until the next spring.|$|E
2500|$|Spanish fly is an emerald-green beetle, Lytta vesicatoria, in the <b>blister</b> <b>beetle</b> family (Meloidae). It {{and other}} such species were used in {{preparations}} offered by traditional apothecaries, {{often referred to as}} Cantharides or Spanish fly. [...] The insect {{is the source of the}} terpenoid cantharidin, a toxic blistering agent once used as an aphrodisiac. The original Spanish fly aphrodisiac extract is forbidden to sell due to its negative side effects and it's replaced by a new version called Spanish fly Pro, which doesn't contain the problematic Cantharidin.|$|E

50|$|Many parrot {{species in}} the Americas, Africa, and Papua New Guinea consume kaolin or clay, which both {{releases}} minerals and absorbs toxic compounds from the gut. Great bustards eat <b>blister</b> <b>beetles</b> of the genus Meloe to decrease parasite load in the digestive system; cantharidin, the toxic compound in <b>blister</b> <b>beetles,</b> can kill a great bustard if too many beetles are ingested. Great bustards may eat toxic <b>blister</b> <b>beetles</b> of the genus Meloe to increase the sexual arousal of males.|$|R
5000|$|The {{level of}} {{cantharidin}} in <b>blister</b> <b>beetles</b> {{can be quite}} variable. Among <b>blister</b> <b>beetles</b> of the genus Epicauta in Colorado, E. pennsylvanica contains about 0.2 mg, E. maculata contains 0.7 mg, and E. immaculata contains 4.8 mg per beetle; males also contain higher levels than females.|$|R

50|$|Pyrota insulata, {{sometimes}} {{known by}} the common name yellow-crescent <b>blister</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a <b>blister</b> <b>beetle,</b> so called because if squeezed, it can produce an irritant called cantharidin that causes a blister on exposed human skin.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blister</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{occasional}} late-summer {{problems in}} Iowa alfalfa fields. The beetles feed on alfalfa and soybean foliage, but leaf loss {{is not of}} economic importance. The real problem with <b>blister</b> <b>beetles</b> lies in their toxicity to livestock, especially horses, when accidentally consumed in feed. The beetles produce cantharidin, an irritant that causes painful blistering when the insects are handled. The cantharidin remains in the beetle 2 ̆ 7 s body even after it dies. That becomes a problem when alfalfa is swathed, during which dead <b>blister</b> <b>beetles</b> {{can be incorporated into}} the hay as it is made...|$|R
