5|$|Despite these performances, Kartik was {{retained}} for the ODI tour of Pakistan with Harbhajan still injured, taking five wickets at 32.80 at {{an economy}} of 5.46. He played {{in three of}} the five matches and India won all of these. Kartik was also in the Test squad, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> not action as India opted to field only Kumble and took the series 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Milwaukee was {{initially}} {{assigned to the}} Mississippi Squadron upon commissioning, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> no action before she was ordered south to join West Gulf Blockading Squadron. The ship departed Mound City, Illinois on 15 October and arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana 12 days later. Lieutenant Commander James H. Gillis relieved Magune on 22 November. She was still under repair there on 27 November, although Milwaukee reached Mobile Bay by 1 January 1865.|$|E
5|$|Nina {{also carried}} some of General Alekseyevs 13 cm guns. Several {{of these were}} used at the fort at Tangane {{on the island of}} Rugsundøy. They engaged the British light cruiser , {{reportedly}} scoring one hit on the cruiser, during Operation Archery in 1941, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> no other combat during the war.|$|E

5|$|The 2005–06 {{season was}} an injury-plagued one for Ginóbili, who {{suffered}} foot and ankle injuries that hindered {{his ability to}} play. He managed 65 games in the regular season, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> a dip in major statistics {{as compared to the}} previous season. During the playoffs, he returned to form, but was unable to prevent the Spurs from being eliminated by the Dallas Mavericks in the Conference Semifinals.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} {{took part}} in the Second Boer War as part of the Imperial Yeomanry. In the First World War, it fought on the Western Front, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> relatively little action as horsed cavalry. After conversion to infantry, it fought in the trenches, notably during 3rd Ypres in 1917 and during the German Spring Offensive in 1918.|$|E
5|$|After its {{deployment}} in the Korean War, {{the division}} {{was active in}} Europe and the United States during the Cold War, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> relatively little combat until the Persian Gulf War, when it faced the Iraqi military. A few years after that conflict, it was inactivated {{as part of the}} post-Cold War U.S. military drawdown of the 1990s. The division was reactivated in October 1999 as a formation for training and deploying U.S. Army National Guard units before its deactivation in October 2006.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Rubí's recommendations, Presidio de San Agustín de Ahumada was closed in 1771, leaving the Texas coast unoccupied except for La Bahía. In July 1772, however, the {{governor}} of Texas heard rumors that English traders were building a settlement {{in the area of}} the Texas coast that had been abandoned. The commander of La Bahía was sent to find the settlement, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> no sign of other Europeans. His expedition did, however, discover that the San Jacinto River emptied into Galveston Bay and not into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, the battleship and her sisters were placed back in active service as the V Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet and tasked with coastal defense in the North Sea. They were also deployed briefly to the Baltic <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> no action. In 1915, the ships were again withdrawn from service and relegated to secondary duties. Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse {{was used as a}} depot ship in Kiel and eventually a torpedo target ship. After the war, the Treaty of Versailles greatly reduced the size of the German Navy. The vessel was sold for scrapping to a German company and broken up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Both commanders were {{a product}} of the {{environment}} of European warfare, which generally took place in open fields with relatively easy mobility, and were thus uncomfortable with woodland warfare. Neither liked the irregular warfare practiced by the Indians and British counterparts like Rogers' Rangers, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> them as a necessary evil, given the operating environment. Although the French depended on Indian support to increase their comparatively small numbers throughout the war, Indian forces were quite low in this battle, and Montcalm generally disliked them and their practices.|$|E

5|$|Canopus was {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean in early 1915 for the Dardanelles Campaign. She participated in major attacks on the Ottoman coastal fortifications defending the Dardanelles in March 1915, but the British and French fleets proved incapable of forcing the straits. After the Gallipoli Campaign ended with the withdrawal of Allied forces in January 1916, Canopus patrolled the eastern Mediterranean, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> no further action. She was removed from service in April 1916 and was converted into a barracks ship in early 1918. After the war, the ship was broken up in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Dante Alighieri was {{the first}} {{dreadnought}} battleship built for the Regia Marina (Royal Italian Navy), and completed in 1913. The ship served as a flagship during World War I, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> very little action other than the Second Battle of Durazzo in 1918 where she did not engage enemy forces. She never fired her guns in anger during her career. Dante Alighieri was refitted in 1923, stricken from the Navy List in 1928 and subsequently sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Despite its name, Old Louisville was {{actually}} {{built as a}} suburb of Louisville starting in the 1870s, nearly a century after Louisville was founded. It was initially called the Southern Extension, and the name Old Louisville did not come until the 1960s. Old Louisville was initially {{home to some of}} Louisville's wealthiest residents, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> a decline in the early and mid-20th century. Following revitalization efforts and gentrification, Old Louisville is currently home to a diverse population with a high concentration of students and young professionals.|$|E

5|$|HMS Curacoa was a C-class light cruiser {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the First World War. She {{was one of the}} five ships of the Ceres sub-class and spent much of her career as a flagship. The ship was {{assigned}} to the Harwich Force during the war, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> little action as she was completed less than a year before the war ended. Briefly assigned to the Atlantic Fleet in early 1919, Curacoa was deployed to the Baltic in May to support anti-Bolshevik forces during the British campaign in the Baltic during the Russian Civil War. Shortly thereafter the ship struck a naval mine and had to return home for repairs.|$|E

5|$|In 1846, Dow spoke {{before the}} {{legislature}} {{in favor of}} statewide prohibition. The bill passed, but lacked the enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, {{he ran for the}} state legislature in a special election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Chappuis {{played for}} the Chicago Hornets, also of the AAFC, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> only limited playing time as a back-up to Hoernschemeyer and Johnny Clement {{on a team that}} went 4–10. When the AAFC went out of {{existence}} after the 1949 season, Chappuis retired from football. In announcing his retirement in June 1950, Chappuis said he was through with professional football and that his ambition then was to enjoy a more leisurely lifestyle {{and to be able to}} visit Ann Arbor for those fall football games.|$|E
5|$|Napoli saw {{action in}} the Italo-Turkish War in 1911 and 1912; she {{took part in the}} attack on Derna, Libya, and the amphibious assaults on the islands of Rhodes and the Dodecanese in the Aegean Sea. Napoli {{remained}} in service during World War I in 191518, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> no action {{as a result of the}} cautious policies of both the Italian and Austro-Hungarian navies. She remained in the Italian inventory until she was stricken from the naval register in August 1926 and was subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of his graduation from Brown in 1916, Chase, now a sergeant, joined A Battery at Quonset Point, Rhode Island, where it was mobilised for duty on the Mexican Border. The unit remained in the El Paso, Texas, area for a time, <b>but</b> <b>saw</b> no action. While there, Chase passed an examination for commissions in Regular Army.
