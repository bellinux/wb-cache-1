5|$|Energy <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> methods, namely laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> and {{electron}} <b>beam</b> <b>welding,</b> {{are relatively}} new processes {{that have become}} quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> is done in a vacuum and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E
5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding,</b> and electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E
5|$|Other recent {{developments}} in welding include the 1958 breakthrough of electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding,</b> making deep and narrow welding possible through the concentrated heat source. Following {{the invention of the}} laser in 1960, laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> debuted several decades later, and has proved to be especially useful in high-speed, automated welding. Magnetic pulse welding (MPW) is industrially used since 1967. Friction stir welding was invented in 1991 by Wayne Thomas at The Welding Institute (TWI, UK) and found high-quality applications all over the world. All of these four new processes continue to be quite expensive due the high cost of the necessary equipment, and this has limited their applications.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA new {{surfacing}} method {{based on}} the laser melting was investigated in this study {{in order to improve}} the fatigue crack propagation performance of high strength al-alloy and its laser <b>beam</b> <b>weld.</b> The main objective was to reduce the Fatigue Crack Propagation (FCP) rate and increase the fatigue life of Al-alloy welded structure. The fatigue crack propagation rate of Al-alloy 6056 was assessed using CT- 100 specimen including base material, base material with Local Laser Surfacing (LLS), laser <b>beam</b> <b>weld</b> and laser <b>beam</b> <b>weld</b> with LLS respectively. The results show a significant reduction in fatigue crack propagation rate with LLS treatment because the fatigue crack retardation phenomenon is obvious when the fatigue crack close to or meet the laser surfacing lane. The fatigue life of BM with LLS specimen is higher than that of BM specimen. For the LBW, there shows same results. That is FCP rate of the specimen of laser <b>beam</b> <b>weld</b> with LLS treatment shows significant reduction compared with the specimen of laser <b>beam</b> <b>weld</b> without LLS treatment. The facture surface and microstructure of LLS and LBM were observed also in order to explain the basic mechanism of LLS improving the fatigue life...|$|R

5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> and electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding.</b> Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the only}} welding process was forge welding, which blacksmiths had used for millenia to join iron and steel by heating and hammering. Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first {{processes}} to develop late in the century, and electric resistance welding followed soon after. Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods. Following the wars, several modern welding techniques were developed, including manual methods like SMAW, now {{one of the most popular}} welding methods, as well as semi-automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW, SAW, FCAW and ESW. Developments continued with the invention of laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding,</b> electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding,</b> magnetic pulse welding (MPW), and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century. Today, the science continues to advance. Robot welding is commonplace in industrial settings, and researchers continue to develop new welding methods and gain greater understanding of weld quality.|$|E
5|$|While many welding {{applications}} {{are done in}} controlled environments such as factories and repair shops, some welding processes are commonly used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, such as open air, underwater, and vacuums (such as space). In open-air applications, such as construction and outdoors repair, shielded metal arc welding is the most common process. Processes that employ inert gases to protect the weld cannot be readily used in such situations, because unpredictable atmospheric movements can result in a faulty weld. Shielded metal arc welding is also often used in underwater welding in the construction and repair of ships, offshore platforms, and pipelines, but others, such as flux cored arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding, are also common. Welding in space is also possible—it was first attempted in 1969 by Russian cosmonauts, when they performed experiments to test shielded metal arc welding, plasma arc welding, and electron <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> in a depressurized environment. Further testing of these methods was done in the following decades, and today researchers continue to develop methods for using other welding processes in space, such as laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding,</b> resistance welding, and friction welding. Advances in these areas may be useful for future endeavours similar to the construction of the International Space Station, which could rely on welding for joining in space the parts that were manufactured on Earth.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of very narrow weld bead and highly strength overmatching on the fracture toughness of laser <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> components are investigated. This study {{focuses on the}} difference of plastic constraint in fracture toughness specimen (3 -point bend specimen, 3 PB) and structural components with crack in the weld metal. The equivalent crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) ratio, β, for the correction of CTOD toughness for constraint loss in structural components is numerically analyzed. The narrowness of weld bead induces constraint loss by plastic deformation in the base metal, both the 3 PB and structural components. Nevertheless, {{in the case of}} the wide plate with shallow crack, the highly strength overmatching elevates the opening stress. Therefore, it is found that the β increase with increasing strength mismatch ratio. The influence of highly strength overmatching on β is important for assessment of fracture performance of laser <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> component. The applicability of β to correction of critical CTOD in laser <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> components is discussed. The fracture toughness tests with the 3 PB and tension panel (edge through-crack panel) of the laser <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> joints were conducted at a low temperature in the brittle fracture range. It is indicated that β can be applied to the CTOD toughness correction in laser <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> component...|$|R

The motivation {{is to improve}} the design and reliability of an electron <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> worm wheel, which may contain large cracks due to hot cracking. Material properties of the weld zones were determined by minitensile specimens. The fracture behaviour of the weld was investigated with CTS- and SENB-specimen. So far, estimates of the threshold values for the fatigue crack growth can be presented. Further experimental and numerical investigations are planned. ...|$|R

5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance spot welding (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, spot welding was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E
500|$|The {{heat-affected zone}} (HAZ) is a ring {{surrounding}} the weld {{in which the}} temperature of the welding process, combined with the stresses of uneven heating and cooling, alter the heat-treatment properties of the alloy. The effects of welding on the material surrounding the weld can be detrimental—depending on the materials used and the heat input of the welding process used, the HAZ can be of varying size and strength. The thermal diffusivity of the base material plays a large role—if the diffusivity is high, the material cooling rate is high and the HAZ is relatively small. Conversely, a low diffusivity leads to slower cooling and a larger HAZ. The amount of heat injected by the welding process plays an important role as well, as processes like oxyacetylene welding have an unconcentrated heat input and increase the size of the HAZ. Processes like laser <b>beam</b> <b>welding</b> give a highly concentrated, limited amount of heat, resulting in a small HAZ. Arc welding falls between these two extremes, with the individual processes varying somewhat in heat input. To calculate the heat input for arc welding procedures, the following formula can be used: ...|$|E

40|$|Several new {{commercial}} advanced high- strength steels exhibit high strength and enhanced form- ability.

40|$|Electron <b>beam</b> (EB) <b>welding</b> was {{performed}} on three different aluminium alloys, namely alloys 2024, 5005, and 6061 (plate thickness 5 mm except alloy 5005 which was 3 mm in thickness), to establish the local microstructure-property relationships that would satisfy the service requirements for an electron <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> aluminium alloy component with weld zone strength undermatching. Microstructural characterisation of the weld metals {{was carried out by}} optical and scanning electron microscopy. A very low level of porosity was observed in all EB welds owing to surface cleaning before welding and the vacuum environment of the EB welding process. Extensive microhardness measurements were also conducted in the weld regions of the joints. Global tensile properties and fracture toughness properties (in terms of crack tip opening displacement, CTOD) of the EB joints were determined at room temperature. The effects of strength mismatch and local microstructure on fracture toughness of the EB joints are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the characterisation of residual stress in electron <b>beam</b> <b>welded</b> P 91 ferritic– martensitic steel plates (9 mm thick) by neutron diffraction and contour measurement methods. The novelty {{of the work}} lies in revealing the residual stress profile at a fine length scale associated with a ∼ 1 mm wide fusion zone. A characteristic ‘M’ shaped distribution of stresses across the weld line is observed with high tensile peaks situated just beyond the heat affected zone/parent material boundary. Measured stresses close to the weld centreline are significantly less tensile than the adjacent peaks owing to martensitic phase transformation during cool down of the weld region. The effect of applying a second smoothing weld pass is shown to be undesirable from a residual stress standpoint because it increases the tensile magnitude and spread of residual stress. The results are suitable for validating finite element predictions of residual stress in electron <b>beam</b> <b>welds</b> made from ferritic–martensitic steels. ...|$|R
