Much research on the environmental fate of hormones has focused on the structural isomers most biologically active in mammals, e. g., the 17 <b>beta-isomers</b> of the estrogen estradiol (E 2) and the synthetic androgen trenbolone (TB). However, recent work has shown that the alpha- and <b>beta-isomers</b> of E 2 and TB can cause comparable effects on certain aquatic species. To improve our understanding and ability to predict isomer-specific interactions with environmental sorbents, we measured the association (K-DOC) of the alpha- and <b>beta-isomers</b> of E 2 and TB as well as their primary metabolites (estrone and trendione) with two commercial dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources by measuring both free and DOC-bound hormone concentrations. We also measured solvent-water partition coefficients partitioning (K-SW) for the same hormones using hexane, toluene, and octanol. Log K-DOC log. K-OC (OC-normalized sorption by soils), and K-OW values are all greater for the beta-isomer except between the E 2 isomers. Theoretical descriptors reflecting electronic character and solute-solvent interactions were calculated to elucidate isomer-specific behavior. Trends for log K-OW and log K-DOC among hormones as well as between isomers are explained reasonably well by computed electrostatic potential and H-bonding parameters.

Alpha-Flupenthixol was 185 times more potent than the beta-isomer as an inhibitor of platelet aggregation. In contrast both isomers were equipotent as inhibitors of uptake of 5 -HT and dopamine.

40|$|Spray dried {{products}} with controlled crystallinity is desired to realize an improved quality and functionality {{of the final}} products. This study used the glass-filament single droplet drying technique to study lactose crystallization behaviour during convective drying. Single lactose droplets with different proportions of alpha- and <b>beta-isomers</b> were subjected to air drying temperatures of 70 degrees C and 110 degrees C. Lactose particles dried at 70 degrees C with higher initial proportions of alpha-isomer showed the lowest dissolution rate. XRD analysis on the freshly dried particles showed that higher crystallinity was achieved with a higher air drying temperature and a higher initial alpha-isomer proportion. This observation was confirmed with the SEM observation of lactose particles that were both freshly dried and with a post-drying crystallization process. Dried lactose particles could have a two-layer morphology where the surface shell and the interior part possess different crystallinity, due to the different crystallization kinetics during drying. The results suggest that during drying there is a critical crystallization stage where both droplet temperature and moisture content are sufficiently high, constituting large T - T-g driving force.

40|$|We report {{here the}} source {{apportionment}} of atmospheric soil microorganisms and higher plant metabolites based on chemical markers (hydroxy fatty acids: FAs) {{in the snow}}pack samples collected from Mount Tateyama in central Japan during spring 2009 (N = 6) and 2011 (N = 7). A homologous series of beta-hydroxy FAs (C- 9 -C- 20), constituents of Gram-negative bacteria (GNB), in snowpacks clearly suggest a long-range atmospheric transport of dust-associated bacteria followed by scavenging by snowflakes. Similarly, higher atmospheric abundances of alpha-(C- 16 -C- 32) and omega-(C- 9 -C- 30) -hydroxy FAs in the snow layers containing Asian dust revealed contributions from soil microbes and higher plant epicuticular waxes. Moreover, covariation between the concentrations of hydroxy FAs and water-soluble Ca 2 + (dust tracer), together with calculated air mass backward trajectories, demonstrated their source regions such as the Taklamakan Desert, Gobi Desert, and Loess Plateau. A close match of molecular distributions of hydroxy FAs (with the predominance of omega- and <b>beta-isomers)</b> is noteworthy between snowpack (present study) and springtime aerosols from Chichijima Island in the western North Pacific (WNP). This observation suggests a "below-cloud scavenging" of transported dust particles and associated soil microbes in the East Asian outflow by snowflakes. These distributions are, however, contrary to those observed in the fresh snow samples from Sapporo, northern Japan (predominance of a-hydroxy FAs), which {{could be explained by}} "in-cloud" microbial oxidation processes. This comparison, therefore, provides additional insights regarding the aeolian transport of soil microbes in the East Asian outflow to the WNP, which has not been available...|$|E
40|$|Having {{access to}} mild and operationally simple {{techniques}} for attaining carbohydrate targets {{will be necessary}} to facilitate advancement in biological, medicinal, and pharmacological research. Even with the abundance of elegant reports for generating glycosidic linkages, the stereoselective construction of alpha- and beta-oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates is by no means trivial. In an era when expanded awareness of the impact we are having on the environment drives the state-of-the-art, synthetic chemists are tasked with developing cleaner and more efficient reactions for achieving their transformations. This movement imparts the value that prevention of waste is always superior to its treatment or cleanup. Chapter 1 of this thesis will highlight recent advancement, in this regard, by examining strategies that employ transition metal catalysis in the synthesis of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates. These methods are mild and effective for constructing glycosidic bonds with reduced levels of waste through utilization of sub-stoichiometric amounts of transition metals to promote the glycosylation. The development of a general and practical method for the stereoselective synthesis of beta-O-aryl-glycosides that exploits the nature of a cationic palladium(II) catalyst, instead of a C(2) -ester directing group, to control the beta-selectivity is described in chapter 2. The beta-glycosylation protocol is highly diastereoselective and requires 2 - 3 mol % of Pd(CH 3 CN) 4 (BF 4) 2 to activate glycosyl trichloroacetimidate donors at room temperature. The method has been applied to D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-xylose donors with a non-directing group incorporated at the C(2) -position to provide the O-aryl glycosides with good to excellent beta-selectivity. In addition, its application is widespread to electron-donating, electron-withdrawing, and hindered phenols. The glycosylation is likely to proceed through a seven-member ring intermediate, wherein the palladium catalyst coordinates both the C(1) -trichloroacetimidate nitrogen and C(2) -ether oxygen, blocking the alpha-face. As a result, the phenol nucleophile preferentially approaches from the top face of the activated donor, leading to the formation of the beta-O-aryl glycoside. The area of sugar urea derivatives has received considerable attention in recent years because of the unique structural properties and activities that these compounds display. The urea-linkage at the anomeric center is a robust alternative to the naturally occurring O- and N-glycosidic linkages of oligosaccharides and glycoconjugates, and the natural products that have been identified to contain these structures show remarkable biological activity. While methods for installing the beta-urea-linkage at the anomeric center have been around for decades, the first synthesis of alpha-urea glycosides has been much more recent. In either case, the selective synthesis of glycosyl ureas can be quite challenging, and a mixture of alph- and <b>beta-isomers</b> will often result. Chapter 3 provides a comprehensive review of the synthetic approaches to alpha- and beta-urea glycosides and examines the structure and activity of the natural products, and their analogues, that have been identified to contain them. There are only a handful of reports for the construction of beta-urea glycosides, and even fewer that are able to attain the alpha-urea structures. Chapter 4 will cover two of these methods, where a transition metal catalyst is employed to facilitate the alpha-selective transformation. The 1 st-generation process, covered in section 4. 1, involves the cationic palladium(II) -catalyzed rearrangement of glycal trichloroacetimidate to alpha-glycal trichloroacetamide in its key step. The transformation is carried out with only 0. 5 mol% Pd(CH 3 CN) 4 (BF 4) 2 catalyst and is both highly alpha-selective and tolerant to a diverse array of protecting groups. The glycal product of the rearrangement is functionalized to pyranoside, protected, and then converted to glycosyl urea in 3 -steps. A diverse array of primary and hindered secondary nitrogen nucleophiles have been coupled with the alpha-acetamide products, generating alpha-urea glycosides with retention of stereochemical integrity at the anomeric center. This is the first synthesis of alpha-glycosyl urea to rely {{on the nature of the}} catalyst/ligand complex, rather than substrate, to control selectivity. This method, however, suffers from limitations in scope and a dependence on toxic osmium tetroxide to functionalize the glycal. In section 4. 2, the development and mechanistic investigation of a 2 nd-generation process, able to overcome the limitations of the glycal methodology to provide an efficient and highly stereoselective access to alpha-urea glycosides, is decribed. This two-step procedure begins with a highly selective nickel-catalyzed conversion of alpha-glycosyl trichloroacetimidate to alpha-trichloroacetamide. The alpha-selectivity in the reaction is controlled with a cationic nickel(II) catalyst, Ni(dppe) (OTf) 2. Mechanistic studies have identified a coordination of the nickel catalyst with equatorial C 2 -ether group of the glycosyl trichloroacetimidate to be paramount for achieving an á-selective transformation. A cross-over experiment has indicated that the reaction does not proceed in an exclusively-intramolecular fashion. The alpha-trichloroacetamide products are directly converted into alpha-urea glycosides by reacting them with a variety of nucleophilic amines in presence of cesium carbonate. Only alpha-urea products are observed, as the reaction retains stereochemical integrity at the anomeric center during the urea-forming step...|$|E
