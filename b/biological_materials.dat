5|$|Insect ecology is the {{scientific}} study of how insects, individually or as a community, interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem. Insects play {{one of the most important}} roles in their ecosystems, which includes many roles, such as soil turning and aeration, dung burial, pest control, pollination and wildlife nutrition. An example is the beetles, which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> into forms found useful by other organisms. These insects, and others, are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created.|$|E
5|$|Isotopes {{of carbon}} are atomic nuclei that contain six protons plus {{a number of}} {{neutrons}} (varying from 2 to 16). Carbon has two stable, naturally occurring isotopes. The isotope carbon-12 (C) forms 98.93% of the carbon on Earth, while carbon-13 (C) forms the remaining 1.07%. The concentration of C is further increased in <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> because biochemical reactions discriminate against C. In 1961, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted the isotope carbon-12 {{as the basis for}} atomic weights. Identification of carbon in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is done with the isotope C.|$|E
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of <b>biological</b> <b>materials.</b> Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E

Tobulėjant technologijoms, kyla poreikis apsaugoti asmenų, iš kurių paimama biologinė medžiaga, bei mokslininkų, naudojančių šią medžiagą, interesus, susijusius su nuosavybės teisėmis į biologinius žmogaus audinius ir organus bei reglamentuoti biologinę medžiagą kaip nuosavybės teisės objektą. Taipogi svarbu nustatyti dirbtiniu būdu sukurto audinio ir organo statusą teisinėje sistemoje bei įvertinti genų inžinerijos įtaką nuosavybės teisės reglamentavimui. Šis darbas susideda iš dviejų dalių. Pirmoje darbo dalyje analizuojamas žmogaus santykis su biologine medžiaga bei šios biologinės medžiagos kaip nuosavybės teisės objekto teisinis reglamentavimas. Antroje darbo dalyje nagrinėjama naujųjų technologijų išradimų įtaka iš žmogaus gaunamo produkto kaip nuosavybės teisės objekto teisiniam reglamentavimui. Abiejose dalyse atskleidžiamas žmogaus biologinės medžiagos kaip nuosavybės teisės objekto reglamentavimas Lietuvoje bei užsienio valstybėse. Tyrimo metu nustatyta, kad biologinei medžiagai atitikus nuosavybės teisės objekto formalius reikalavimus ją galima laikyti nuosavybės teisės objektu. Priėjus šią išvadą buvo konstatuota, kad žmogaus biologinė medžiaga nuosavybės teisės objektu gali tapti tik ją atskyrus nuo kūno. Mokslininko išradimo ar dirbtiniu būdu sukurto audinio ar organo atveju biologinė medžiaga laikoma nuosavybės teisės objektu ją išskyrus iš natūralios aplinkos arba pagaminus techninio proceso metu. Atsinaujinančių biologinių medžiagų bankuose mokamos kompensacijos ar atlygis parodo, jog atsinaujinanti biologinė medžiaga gali būti nuosavybės teisės objektu. Genų inžinerijos procedūrose savo biologinę medžiagą suteikiantis donoras taip pat turi nuosavybės teisę į nuo jo kūno atskirtą medžiagą, kol ją perduoda pasirašydamas informuoto paciento sutikimą. Todėl genetinės medžiagos panaudojimas embriono dirbtiniam apvaisinimui genų donorui ateityje gali suteikti tėvo statusą bei sukurti teises ir pareigas vaiko atžvilgiu. Atlikus visus darbe keliamus uždavinius, darytina išvada, jog žmogaus biologinei medžiagai atitinkant tam tikras sąlygas, tokias kaip atskyrimas nuo kūno, išskyrimas iš natūralios aplinkos ar gamyba techninio proceso metu, ginamasis teiginys: žmogaus biologinė medžiaga gali būti nuosavybės teisės objektu, pasitvirtino. New {{technologies}} have created plenty of {{new ways to}} isolate human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> and use it for various purposes: renewable <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> donation, medical researches and inventions, tissue engineering by artificially making tissues, organs and transplantation of them, genetic engineering and modification for curing genetic diseases. As new technologies are rapidly evolving {{there is a need}} to protect those who provide <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> and researchers, who use this material. Legal interests related to property rights of human biological tissues and organs also need to be protected, as well as the ones who regulate human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> as the subject of property rights. Furthermore, it is important to assess laboratory-grown tissue or organ position regarding the legal system and evaluate the impact of genetic engineering on property law regulation. The thesis aims to investigate whether human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> can be the subject of property rights by containing the following tasks: 1. 	To determine and compare human biological tissue as the subject of property rights’ legal regulation in Lithuania and other countries. 2. 	Delimit person‘s and researcher‘s right to human biological tissue and invention made from human <b>biological</b> <b>material.</b> 3. 	Examine the impact of new technologies, such as tissue engineering and genetic engineering, on human biological tissue as the subject of property rights’ legal regulation. This paper consists of two sections. First section analyses human relation with <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> and its relation to property rights’ legal regulation. By analyzing this section it was concluded, that if human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> fulfills property rights’ formal requirements, such as economic content that makes the property subject a part of the market, also possibility to possess and dispose of the subject – it can be the subject of property rights. The conclusion stated that human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> can be the subject of property rights only when separated from the body. By paying compensation or money reward renewable <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> banks show that by transference of human <b>biological</b> <b>material,</b> renewable <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> can be the subject of property rights. Furthermore, courts’ practice about the inheritance of reproductive cells shows that renewable human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> can be described as a personal property. In that way, in some cases, a person can have an ownership of human <b>biological</b> <b>material.</b> These days researchers are able to create a product which contains another person‘s <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> or was created by using this material. They can patent this product and by doing so create exclusive rights to dispose of the invention in commercial ways. Also <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> becomes the subject of the patent. By analyzing researcher’s right to patent his invention, which is made by using another person‘s <b>biological</b> <b>material,</b> it is visible that the main legal principle that courts follow is whether the product is in its natural environment or is isolated from it or produced by the means of technical process. If invention contains <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> which is identical to natural <b>biological</b> <b>material,</b> but is isolated from its natural environment or is produced by the means of technical process, it can be the subject of the patent. Another rule for patenting invention holding <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> is to get the informed consent of the <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> donor. In some cases processing of human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> so it changes its primal function can be assessed as a different subject from human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> and also be granted a patent. Forasmuch as that patent grants researcher property rights and human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> is the subject of the patent, it can be concluded that human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> can be the subject of researcher’s property. The second section of this paper analyses the impact of the products of new technological inventions on the regulation of human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> as the subject of property rights. A tissue engineered product such as tissue or organ is considered to be the subject of property rights when it is isolated from its natural environment or produced by the means of technical process. Artificially made tissues, organs made of human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> commercialization does not violate human dignity, integrity principles, because tissue or organ is extracted not from human body, but is made by the means of technical process. Also, the <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> which is used is being isolated from its natural environment. Because of its specific way of procuring, artificially grown tissue and organ also satisfy the patentable subject’s formal requirements. For the reasons described above tissue engineered product designed from <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> can be the subject of property rights. It is advisable for the legislator to regulate not only the tissue engineered advanced therapy medical products in European Union member states but also the tissue engineered product, such as artificially made tissue or organ, position in the legal system. It is advisable to ascribe such tissue or organ as a special category of human <b>biological</b> <b>material,</b> which could be described as the tissue engineered product – specifically human tissue or organ, made from human <b>biological</b> <b>material.</b> By researching genetic engineering’s legal regulation towards the <b>biological</b> <b>material,</b> the conclusion was drawn that genetic material is part of human <b>biological</b> <b>material.</b> Therefore during the genetic engineering procedure performing mitochondrial replacement therapy and later artificial insemination, person who provided from his body isolated genetic material has ownership towards that material until he transfers this material to another person and by doing so it belongs to that person. For the reasons above genetic material can be the subject of property rights. Also, by examining the courts’ practice and legal literature it can be concluded, that the person, who holds property rights towards the genetic material can be acknowledged as a legal third parent of a child, if by donating his genetic material that person is an intentional lender of procreative genetic material and has a purpose raising a child as his own. Accomplishing all the tasks described in this paper, it can be concluded that if human <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> satisfies conditions, such as separation from the body, isolation from its natural environment or production by the means of technical process, it can be the subject of property rights...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: During {{the course}} of a double murder trial, it became {{apparent}} that the two adhesive lifters from the two cadavers had been mislabeled before being presented in court. The question was raised whether DNA testing from the <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> remaining attached to the lifters could resolve this mix-up. In fatal shooting cases where a bullet has been fired through a body surface, an adhesive lifter is applied directly to the entrance wound. The total nitrite residues, as well as <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> surrounding the wound (blood, hair, tissue) are transferred to the adhesive lifter. The nitrite residues are used for estimating firing distance. In a worst-case scenario, the <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> on the lifter may be the only remaining reference material from a victim. In this paper, we examined whether the <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> retrieved from adhesive lifters could be used for DNA typing after the lifters had been treated for GSR pattern. In as much as the <b>biological</b> <b>material</b> found on the lifters can be typed and profiled following physical and chemical treatment, we submit that archived adhesive lifters {{can be used as a}} future source of reference DNA from cadavers where no other sample is available...|$|R

25|$|Cosmic rays {{also cause}} {{elemental}} transmutation in the atmosphere, in which secondary radiation {{generated by the}} cosmic rays combines with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere to generate different nuclides. Many so-called cosmogenic nuclides can be produced, but probably the most notable is carbon-14, which is produced by interactions with nitrogen atoms. These cosmogenic nuclides eventually reach the Earth's surface and {{can be incorporated into}} living organisms. The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years. The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short half-life of carbon-14 are the principles used in radiocarbon dating of ancient <b>biological</b> <b>materials,</b> such as wooden artifacts or human remains.|$|E
25|$|ESEM is {{especially}} useful for non-metallic and <b>biological</b> <b>materials</b> because coating with carbon or gold is unnecessary.

X-ray analysis is difficult with a coating of a heavy metal, so carbon coatings are routinely used in conventional SEMs, but ESEM makes it possible to perform X-ray microanalysis on uncoated non-conductive specimens; however some specific for ESEM artifacts are introduced in X-ray analysis. ESEM may be the preferred for electron microscopy of unique samples from criminal or civil actions, where forensic analysis may need to be repeated by several different experts.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} principle of radiosurgery {{is that of}} selective ionization of tissue, by means of high-energy beams of radiation. Ionization is the production of ions and free radicals which are usually deleterious to the cells. These ions and radicals, which may be formed from {{the water in the}} cell or <b>biological</b> <b>materials,</b> can produce irreparable damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in the cell's death. Thus, biological inactivation is carried out in a volume of tissue to be treated, with a precise destructive effect. The radiation dose is usually measured in grays (one gray (Gy) is the absorption of one joule of energy per kilogram of mass). A unit that attempts to take into account both the different organs that are irradiated and the type of radiation is the sievert, a unit that describes both the amount of energy deposited and the biological effectiveness.|$|E
