5|$|When the {{legislature}} convened on February 19, {{two sets of}} officers attempted to preside. Marshall and Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, both claimed the right to preside over the state senate. Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising any authority in the senate; Beckham counter-sued for possession of the capitol and executive building. The cases were consolidated, and <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> agreed to let the courts decide the election. On March 10, a circuit court found in favor of Beckham and the Democrats. By a 6–1 vote, the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the state's court of last resort at the time, upheld the circuit court's decision on April 6, legally unseating Taylor and Marshall. The case of Taylor v. Beckham was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, but the court refused {{to intervene in the}} case because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from that opinion was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

The second Klan expanded with new chapters in cities in the Midwest and West, and reached <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats,</b> {{as well as men}} without a party affiliation. The KKK state organizations endorsed candidates from either party that supported its goals. The goal of prohibition in particular helped the Klan and some Republicans to make common cause in the Midwest.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the poor}} state of Venezuela's economy that {{includes}} {{a high risk of}} default and a 2016 deal offering 49.9% of Citgo as collateral for a $1.5 billion loan to Russia, {{it is possible that the}} Bolivarian Government of Venezuela may give Citgo to Rosneft, Russia's government-run oil company. <b>Both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the United States urged oversight on this deal, describing CITGO's sale to Russia as a risk to the national security of the United States.|$|E
25|$|The FBI Headquarters in Washington, DC {{is named}} the J. Edgar Hoover Building, after Hoover. Because of the {{controversial}} nature of Hoover's legacy, there have been periodic proposals to rename it by legislation proposed by <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> in the House and Senate. For example, in 2001 Senator Harry Reid sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover's name from the building. Reid said J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building is a stain on the building. The Senate did not adopt the amendment.|$|E

The number was finally estimated to be $38.2 billion, more than all 49 other states' deficits combined. Already suffering from low approval ratings, Davis's numbers hit historic lows in April 2003 with 24% approval and 65% disapproval, according to a California Field Poll. Davis was almost universally disliked by <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> {{in the state and}} a recall push was high.|$|E

25|$|STV {{has some}} {{history in the}} United States. Many cities, {{including}} New York City, once used it {{to break up the}} Democratic Party monopolies on elective office. Cincinnati, Ohio, adopted STV in 1925 {{to get rid of a}} Republican Party monopoly, but the Republicans returned the city to FPTP in 1957. From 1870 to 1980, Illinois used a semi-proportional cumulative voting system to elect its House of Representatives. Each district across the state elected <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> year-after-year. Cambridge, Massachusetts, (STV) and Peoria, Illinois, (cumulative voting) continue to use PR. San Francisco had citywide elections in which people would cast votes for five or six candidates simultaneously, delivering some of the benefits of proportional representation.|$|E
25|$|The support {{given by}} Federal Reserve Board, under Ben Bernanke, and the US Treasury with Paulson at the helm, in the {{acquisition}} of Bear Stearns by J.P. Morgan and the $200bn facility made available to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac attracted {{a great deal of}} criticism in congress by <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats.</b> Paulson and Geithner made every effort to enable Barclays to acquire Lehman Brothers, including convincing other large Wall Street firms to commit their own funds to support the deal. In light of the recent Bear Stearns criticism, Paulson was against committing public funds towards a bailout, for fear of being labelled 'Mr Bailout'. When British regulators indicated they would not approve the purchase, Lehman went into bankruptcy, and Paulson and Geithner worked to contain the systemic impact.|$|E

Under fire from <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats,</b> Coburn apologized, saying, [...] "My intentions were good, but I've obviously made an error in judgment in how I've gone about saying what I wanted to say."

50|$|The movie {{traces the}} roots of the US {{establishment}} (<b>both</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrat</b> parties) mindset into the doctrine of Edward Bernays, pioneer in the field of public relations and propaganda, who believed the democracy is hard to handle and people are just too stupid to govern themselves in democracy, so there is a need of an elite, public guardians who manage the society and there is a need of public relation practitioners who would be professionals in working for the government for managing, manipulating the public and engineering consent.|$|R

500|$|Unlike Lincoln, {{who had a}} close {{rapport with}} Seward, Johnson kept his own counsel, and {{generally}} did {{not take advantage of}} Seward's political advice as Congress prepared to meet in December 1865. Johnson had issued proclamations allowing for the southern states to reform their state governments and hold elections; they mostly elected men who had served as prewar or wartime leaders. Seward advised Johnson to state, in his first annual message to Congress, that southern states meet three conditions for readmission to the Union: repeal of secession, repudiation of the war debt incurred by the rebel governments, and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. [...] Johnson, hoping to appeal to <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats,</b> did not take the suggestion. Congress did not seat southerners, but appointed a joint committee of both houses to make recommendations on the issue. [...] Johnson opposed the committee; Seward was prepared to wait and see.|$|E
500|$|Some {{supporters}} {{and opponents of}} the NPVIC have based their position {{at least in part}} on a perceived partisan advantage of the compact. Former Delaware Governor Pierre S. du Pont IV, a Republican, has argued that the compact would be an [...] "urban power grab" [...] and benefit Democrats. However, Saul Anuzis of the Republican National Committee wrote that Republicans [...] "need" [...] the compact, citing what he believes to be the center-right nature of the American electorate. New Yorker essayist Hendrik Hertzberg maintains that the compact would benefit neither party, noting that historically <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> have been successful in winning the popular vote in presidential elections. In the last five presidential elections, simulations of close results with the electoral vote system have favored Democrats in three (2004, 2008, 2012) and favored Republicans in two (2000, 2016). In those same five presidential elections, Democrats won the popular vote in four of them.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} {{two weeks of the}} campaign, Brown was injured in an {{accident}} and became a wheelchair user.

Both men spent the last days of the campaign in Louisville, knowing that, with its sizable population, it would be key to the election. Goebel continued his attack on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, supporting striking laborers from the railroad and charging that the Republican party was controlled by trusts. <b>Both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> warned of the possibility that election fraud and violence would be perpetrated by the other side.

In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes <b>both</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>and</b> <b>Democrats</b> equally, and also says that [...] "the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place" [...] and that [...] "everyone else is just running around talking.
