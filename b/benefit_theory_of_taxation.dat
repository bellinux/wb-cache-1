40|$|At {{the turn}} of the twentieth century, the U. S. system of public finance {{underwent}} a dramatic, structural transformation. The late nineteenth-century system of indirect taxes, associated mainly with the tariff, was eclipsed in the early decades of the twentieth century by a progressive income tax. This shift in U. S. tax policy marked the emergence of a new fiscal polity - one that was guided not simply by the functional and structural need for government revenue but by concerns for equity and economic and social justice. This Article explores the paradigm shift in legal and economic theories that undergirded this dramatic shift in U. S. tax policy. More specifically, this Article contends that a particular group of academic economists played a pivotal role in supplanting the <b>benefits</b> <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> and its concomitant vision of the state as a passive protector of private property, with a more equitable principle <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> based on one 2 ̆ 7 s ability to pay - a principle that promoted a more active role for the state in the distribution of fiscal burdens. In facilitating this structural transformation, these theorists were able to use the growing concentration of wealth and the ascendancy of new economic ideas as justifications for using a progressive income tax to reallocate the burdens of financing the burgeoning American regulatory, administrative, and welfare state...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> optimal <b>taxation</b> using the tax reform {{approach}} and generalized social marginal welfare weights. A tax system is optimal if no budget neutral small reform can increase a weighted sum of (money metric) {{gains and losses}} across individuals. However, the social marginal welfare weights used for aggregating gains and losses are not derived from a standard social welfare function based on individual utilities but instead directly specified to reflect society’s views for justice. Hence, our optimal tax formulas are no longer obtained by maximizing an objective function. Nevertheless, optimum tax formulas take the same form as standard utilitarian tax formulas by simply substituting standard marginal social welfare weights by those generalized marginal social welfare weights. Hence our theory nests standard theory and is equally tractable. We show how the use of suitable generalized social welfare weights can help resolve most of the puzzles of the traditional welfarist approach and account for existing tax policy debates and structures while retaining Pareto constrained efficiency. In particular, generalized welfare weights can provide a rich <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> optimal <b>taxation</b> even absent any behavioral responses. Generalized welfare weights {{can be derived from}} social justice principles, leading to a normative <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> We show how the most prominent alternatives to utilitarianism can be re-cast within our theory. Generalized welfare weights can also be derived from estimating actual social preferences of the public, leading to a positive <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> We use a simple online survey to illustrate this latter approach. Our theory brings back social preferences as a critical element for optimal tax theory analysis...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: on the one hand is to discuss Ricardo’s version <b>of</b> the labour <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> value; and on the other hand, is to analyse some crucial aspects <b>of</b> Ricardo’s <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> as an {{extension}} and further elaboration <b>of</b> his <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> value.

40|$|One of more {{important}} problems {{dealt with by}} the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> is the differentiation of tax burden according to the paying capacity of a taxpayer. Theoretical considerations concerning that problem may lead to practical results. The <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> however, should not {{be treated as a}} science whose task is to formulate practical advice. It is the tax praxis, supported by the theory, that should construct the tax system, along the principle of tax solvency of a taxpayer. In the adjustment <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> to the tax solvency of a taxpayer of great significance is the adequate determination of the tax assessment basis and the choice of the type of a tax rate. The tax assessment basis indicate the level of tax a taxpayer may pay, while tax rates indicate the level of tax a taxpayer should pay. A tax rate determines {{the degree to which the}} increase of the tax assessment basis will be burdened and determines the limits of such a burden. The most adequate is a progressive tax rate. Of course, it is difficult to adjust the level <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> to the tax solvency of a taxpayer by means of progressive tax rates only. There is no rule which would make it possible to determine a just level of such rates. Besides, its is also important to levy the taxes only in connection with such circumstances which actually reflect the solvency of a taxpayer. Non-fiscal aims of taxes have negative effects on tax solvency, for the attainment of such aims is the factor by means of which the legislator determines legal criteria of differentiating the tax burden.

This literature takes the endowment of workers with human capital as given. The present paper analyses the effects of tax progression in a model with endogenous human capital formation.

With full deductibility, tax progression raises employment and welfare. With incomplete deductibility, in contrast, the effect of tax progression on employment and welfare may be negative.

Tax is a compulsory levy by the Government on people and organizations within its jurisdiction. <b>Taxation</b> is one <b>of</b> the most important sources of revenue to government. Adam Smith and David Ricardo are {{the first people to}} propound <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> Adam Smith gave four maxims or canons <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> as simplicity, certainty, neutrality/fairness and efficiency of collection. These maxims have inspired many other theories thereafter. Thus Tax Reforms have been seen as very important to assist the government achieve its goals including sustainable economic development. The paper calls on government to find ways of dealing with tax evasion and tax avoidance for sustainable development is a pattern of growth that advocates use of resources aimed at meeting human needs of the present and future generations. Sustainable economic development is world wide and broader than traditional economic development which is limited to the third world...|$|R

Without borrowing restrictions, the optimal policy is characterized by smooth time paths of taxes and public investment.

This theoretical result is tested empirically using data on public investment of more than 1, 000 US municipalities in the period from 1972 to 1997 in various states that impose or do not impose borrowing restrictions on municipalities. The empirical results are supportive, indicating that in presence of borrowing restrictions public investment is becoming responsive to the deficit and is stronger affected by revenue shocks...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of Laffer curve. According to the idea of Laffer curve when the tax rate exceeds certain {{treshold}} (revenue-maximizing tax rate) the tax revenue would in absolute terms decrease with rising tax rate. Therefore this thesis tries to discover whether those facts are valid in the corporate income taxation for 20 OECD countries for the time period from 1965 to 2006. The structure of the thesis could be divided into three parts. In first introductory chapters we would discuss the issue <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> in general. We will briefly examine the history <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and explore the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> and tax systems. The second part of this thesis will focus on the Laffer curve in detail. Third chapter will introduce the theory behind Laffer curve and discuss its properties for different types <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> In the following chapter the literature and different possibilities of estimation of Laffer curve and (or) Laffer effects would be reviewed. Fifth chapter focuses on the corporate income taxation per se and examine the development of corporate income tax revenues and rates in our sample countries.
