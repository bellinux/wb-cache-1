5|$|Each carving {{receives}} a special name, and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. The image to the left shows an example of Torajan wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center <b>bottom</b> <b>panel</b> represents buffalo or wealth, a wish for many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents a knot and a box, a hope {{that all of the}} family's offspring will be happy and live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an aquatic animal, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results.|$|E

25|$|Figure 1 (<b>bottom</b> <b>panel).</b> From {{the point}} of view of the {{interior}} of the car, an accelerating reference frame, there is a fictitious force pushing the passenger backwards, with magnitude equal to the mass of the passenger times the acceleration of the car. This force pushes the passenger back into the seat, until the seat compresses and provides an equal and opposite force. Thereafter, the passenger is stationary in this frame, because the fictitious force and the real force of the seat are balanced.|$|E

2500|$|If closed, the pustaha takes {{form of a}} beast {{standing}} on its four hooves. The top panel is surmounted with a carved representation of the serpent-like animal {{with the head of}} a singa. At the <b>bottom</b> <b>panel</b> is four legs or hooves. Achim Sibeth commented that the animal is the representation of the Naga Padoha, a primordial water serpent that rules the underworld. A Batak creation myth told that {{back in the days when}} there was only sea, the serpent stirred up sand from the ocean bed to create the first islands which create the islands of Indonesia. Other expert thinks that the figure represents the singa. The word singa, borrowed from Sanskrit singa meaning [...] "lion", dates back to contact with Hindu traders in the southern Batak area. In Batak culture however, the singa itself is a complicated mythical creature related to the female serpent. An example of the representation of a singa can be found in a wooden animal head that was collected by Tassilo Adam, a German planter who is also an enthusiast in Batak Toba culture.|$|E

60|$|Minor artists {{had worked}} with Kano the magnificent. These {{had been allowed to}} lay brush upon panels of wood in the outer verandahs, and very {{faithfully}} had they toiled. It was not till the guide called my attention to them that I discovered scores of sketches in monochrome low down on the verandah doors. An iris broken by the fall of a branch torn off by a surly ape; a bamboo spray bowed before the wind that was ruffling a lake; a warrior of the past ambushing his enemy in a thicket, hand on sword, and mouth gathered into puckers of intensest concentration, were among the many notes that met my eye. How long, think you, would a sepia-drawing stand without defacement in the midst of our civilisation were it put on the <b>bottom</b> <b>panel</b> of a door, or the scantling of a kitchen passage? Yet in this gentle country a man may stoop down and write his name in the very dust, certain that, if the writing be craftily done, his children's children will reverently let it stand.|$|E

5000|$|The {{solar panels}} are {{produced}} from scrap gallium arsenide cells using a well documented production process. As a result, they cost 35 times less than comparably powerful off-the-shelf panels.

As a result of the TASC manufacturer going out of business during development, only the The top and <b>bottom</b> <b>panels</b> on EQUiSat contain these cells. The other three panels use the TrisolX cells. 24 cells in a 4S6P configuration, and three side panels contain 20 cells in a 4S5P configuration. The top and <b>bottom</b> <b>panels</b> are currently designed to output 8.76V at 140-170 mA for an average output power of just over 1.3 W in full sunlight.
