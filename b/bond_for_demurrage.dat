50|$|In business, {{demurrage}} is a {{delay in}} delivery of a product via delivery truck. When a delay occurs with product delivery, the delivery party can elect to claim a no fault delay by submitting a <b>demurrage</b> charge. Criteria <b>for</b> allowable <b>demurrage,</b> payment conditions, and payment terms <b>for</b> <b>demurrage</b> are typically prenegotiated and accepted by the vendor via contract prior to conduct of business. Some vendors allow free no-cost time for limited hour(s) when demurrage occurs, others do not allow free time <b>for</b> delays. The <b>demurrage</b> charge is normally an hourly rate. Unforeseeable until delivery, costs of delays are sometimes separately invoiced from the cost of deliverable.|$|R

50|$|The {{bill of lading}} {{sometimes}} {{contains a}} clause as to the shipowner's lien. Without any express provision for it, the shipowner has by common law a lien for freight. If it is desired to give the shipowner a lien <b>for</b> <b>demurrage</b> or other charges, it must be expressly provided for. The lien is {{the right of the}} shipowner to retain the goods carried until paid the freight charges, demurrage, or other charge for which a lien has been given. The lien may be waived, and ends with delivery of the goods, or by any dealing with the consignee inconsistent with a right of the shipowner to retain possession of the goods until payment has been made. The shipowner may preserve his lien by landing the goods and retaining them in his own warehouse, or by storing them in a public warehouse, subject to the conditions required by the Merchant Shipping Act (1894).|$|R
