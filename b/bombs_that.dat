5|$|Janet Hamilton, {{the nineteenth}} century poet and essayist, died in Langloan in 1873. Present-day writers Anne Donovan (Orange prize winner), Brian Conaghan (the author of three novels The Boy Who Made it Rain' (2011) 'When Mr Dog Bites' (2014) and 'The <b>Bombs</b> <b>That</b> Brought Us Together' (2016)) and award-winning author Des Dillon are all from Coatbridge.

Weight reduction was accomplished by removal of all gun turrets and armor plating. This work {{was done by the}} 509th Composite Group for the early Silverplate aircraft, but later models were delivered without them. These B-29s represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants.|$|E
5|$|Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} {{extensive damage}} during the war, and Smith {{and his wife}} often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary <b>bombs</b> <b>that</b> fell in their garden. Smith was called up for military service, but was discharged three years later, and subsequently worked in an aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of}} the war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led his wife to complain that Smith was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money. During 1942–1943, Mimi's sister Julia lived with Lennon at The Dairy Cottage; 120a Allerton Road, Woolton, which was owned by the Smith family.|$|E
5|$|A later report {{covering}} the use the Tallboy bomb {{was able to}} directly compare {{the performance of the}} Mk. XIV and SABS in similar mission profiles. Eliminating <b>bombs</b> <b>that</b> fell far from the target as gross errors, those that fell near the target were twice as close to it when using SABS. Additionally, the number of gross errors with the Mk. XIV was double that of the SABS. The report noted that this additional accuracy did not confer any sort of superiority because the Mk. XIV's tactical freedom in terms of manoeuvring offset any advantage when a long bomb run was not possible. They also noted that a mission using SABS to drop bombs on a target marker would not be any more accurate than the Mk. XIV.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Toho's 1954 film Godzilla, which {{depicted}} a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo, many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films, including Warning from Space. Along with other films such as Shintōhō's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet, Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures. The film also used the theme of atomic <b>bombs</b> <b>that</b> was present in many films at the time, but showed how the weapons, which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier, could be put to good use. Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions {{in the style of}} earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World, which depicted a comet {{on a collision course with}} the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Fez is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) puzzle platform game {{set in a}} three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and {{is the basis of}} Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to the universe. In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, <b>bombs</b> <b>that</b> reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.|$|E
5|$|Mimi and Smith {{were finally}} married on 15 September 1939. They bought a semi-detached house called Mendips—named after {{the range of}} hills—at 251 Menlove Avenue, in a middle class area of Liverpool. Menlove Avenue {{suffered}} extensive damage during World War II, {{and she said that}} she often had to throw a wet blanket on incendiary <b>bombs</b> <b>that</b> fell in the garden. During the war the government took over the Smiths' farmland for war work, and Smith was called up for service, but was discharged three years later, working in an aircraft factory in Speke {{until the end of the}} war. Smith later left the milk trade and started a small bookmaker's business, which led Mimi to complain later that he was a compulsive gambler, and had lost most of their money.|$|E

5|$|The Army sent Fitch to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. By mid-1944, about a {{third of}} the {{technicians}} at Los Alamos were from the SED. While there, he met many of the greats of physics including Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Enrico Fermi, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Bruno Rossi, Emilio Segrè, Edward Teller and Richard C. Tolman, in some cases attending courses on physics taught by them. He worked in the group headed by Ernest Titterton, a member of the British Mission, and became well-acquainted with the techniques of experimental physics. He participated in the drop testing of mock atomic <b>bombs</b> <b>that</b> was conducted at Wendover Army Air Field and the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station, and worked at the Trinity site, where he witnessed the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945. He was discharged from the Army in 1946, but continued to work at Los Alamos as a civilian for another year in order to earn some money. He would briefly return to Los Alamos in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In June 1943, {{a series}} of Allied air raids {{attacked}} La Spezia {{in an attempt to}} neutralize the three battleships. On 5 June, she was hit by two large <b>bombs</b> <b>that</b> struck her port side. She was transferred to Genoa for repairs, which were not completed before the Armistice that ended Italian participation in the war. Littorio was hit by three bombs on 19 June, a week after her sister was damaged. She was renamed Italia after Benito Mussolini's regime collapsed. Roma was damaged during the 5 June attack and again in a third attack on 23 June. In September 1943, following the withdrawal of Italy from the war, all three ships and {{a significant portion of the}} Italian fleet left port to be interned in Malta. While en route, German bombers laden with Fritz-X radio-guided bombs attacked the formation. One hit Italia in the bow forward the main battery turrets, causing serious damage. Two hit Roma; one passed through the ship and exploded under her keel, and the second hit near the forward magazines. The bomb detonated the magazines, causing a massive explosion that destroyed the ship with heavy casualties.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon <b>bombs</b> <b>that</b> were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

5|$|The IJN {{then decided}} to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol, rubber, tin and other {{strategic}} minerals back to Japan after the American carriers departed the South China Sea (Operation Kita). They loaded their cargoes beginning on 6 February at Singapore and departed four days later. Also carrying some 1,150 oilfield workers, they were escorted by Ōyodo and three destroyers. Decrypted Japanese radio signals revealed the Japanese plan to the Allies, and 15 submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships. An additional 11 were moved into position while the group was en route, but only three were ultimately able to attack. None of them were successful before the Japanese reached Kure on 20 February. The Fourth Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships. On 19 March Kure was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and Hyūga was hit three times by <b>bombs</b> <b>that</b> killed 37 men and wounded 52. Her gunners claimed to have shot down one American dive bomber during the attack. Ise was hit twice during the attack, but her casualties, if any, are unknown.|$|E
