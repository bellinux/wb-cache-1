40|$|Ozone {{measurements}} from 1970 to 1984 {{from the}} Nimbus 4 <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> and the Nimbus 7 solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> spectrometers show {{significant decrease in}} total ozone only after 1979. The downward trend is most apparent in October south of 70 deg S in the longitude zone 0 to 30 deg W where planetary wave activity is weak. Outside this longitude region, the trend in total ozone is much smaller due to strong interannual variability of wave activity. This paper gives a phenomenological description of ozone depletion in the Antarctic region based on vertical advection and transient planetary waves...|$|E
40|$|The SBUV/TOMS is {{designed}} to measure the extraterrestrial ultraviolet solar irradiation and the solar ultraviolet radiation from the earth and its atmosphere. Methods to recover the ozone information from <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> measurements are described. Mapping of the total ozone and 200 mb height fields is obtained...|$|E
40|$|Contours and gridded {{values are}} given {{for seven years}} of monthly mean total ozone data derived from {{observations}} with the <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> instrument on Nimbus- 4 for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The instrument, algorithm, uncertainties in derived ozone and systematic changes in the bias {{with respect to the}} international groundbased ozone network of Dobson instruments, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} are to develop techniques {{to detect and}} remove long-term instrument drifts from the operational Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV/ 2) data base using periodic measurements made by the Shuttle Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Spectral Radiometer and to evaluate the potential effects of scattering by atmospheric aerosols on our ability to detect trends in ozone using SBUV-class instruments...|$|R
40|$|Since 1960 {{three classes}} of zone {{sounders}} have been developed: (1) <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet,</b> (2) infrared limb and nadir radiance, and (3) stellar and solar occultation methods. With these techniques ozone has been measured from 20 to 100 km. Tropospheric ozone measurements are beyond present technology, but total ozone is determined with the <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> and nadir infrared methods...|$|R
50|$|The Space Shuttle <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> {{instruments}} in the payload bay also continued to take readings {{that were used to}} help calibrate free-flying satellites that continually monitored the ozone content of Earths atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|The {{first month}} of spin-scan ozone imaging (SOI) data (October 1981) was {{processed}} and compared with {{total ozone mapping spectrometer}} and ground based data. Short term variations in the ozone field have been revealed using animated sequences of SOI data. High correlations were observed between SOI ozone and upper tropospheric meteorological data. The relationship between ozone and temperature in the stratosphere was investigated by examining Nimbus 4 <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> ozone and selective chopper radiometer temperature measurements as well as solar Nimbus 7 solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> ozone and stratospheric and mesospheric sounder temperature measurements. Results from these ozone temperature studies were compared with calculations from theoretical 2 -D models. All of the lims infrared monitor of the stratosphere data was processed at 10 pressure levels and correlations between various species have been performed. The Venus Atmospheric Drag model was modified taking into account recent investigations on the Venus thermosphere and the resulting model was considered for incorporation into the Venus International Reference Atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{reductions}} in the ozone content of {{the middle and upper}} stratosphere over the polar cap regions were associated with the major solar proton event of 4 August 1972. This reduction, which was determined from measurements with the <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> experiment on the Nimbus 4 satellite, is interpreted as being due to the catalytic destruction of ozone by odd-nitrogen compounds (NOx) produced by the event...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of horizontally inhomogeneous clouds on the accuracy of total ozone column retrievals from space. The focus here is on retrievals based on <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> light measurements in Huggins bands {{in the range of}} 315 â€“ 340 nm. It is found that simplifying the description of cloud properties in the ozone-retrieval algorithm studied can produce errors of up to 6...|$|E
40|$|Modifications {{made to the}} SBUV/ 2 (solar <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> mod 2) to make it {{compatible}} with the Shuttle are examined. The Shuttle SBUV (SSBUV) in-flight radiometric calibration checking system is also described. Requirements, constraints, and methodology for combining SSBUV data with SBUV/ 2 data to remove its long-term drift are discussed...|$|R
30|$|More {{complete}} datasets {{have been}} accumulated, {{and this has}} led to new findings on trends. For example, a 33 -year PMC data from the satellite solar <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) instrument show significantly smaller trends than were previously published. Still, the data continue to indicate a long-term increase in PMC brightness, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|R
50|$|Besides the Galileo spacecraft, Atlantis payload bay {{held two}} {{canisters}} containing the Shuttle Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SSBUV) experiment. SSBUV, which {{made its first}} flight on STS-34, was developed by NASA to check the calibration of the ozone sounders on free-flying satellites, and to verify the accuracy of atmospheric ozone and solar irradiance data. The experiment operated successfully.|$|R
40|$|To aid {{investigations}} of energetic particle {{effects on the}} <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (BUV) instrumentation aboard Nimbus 4, solar proton events characterized as polar cap absorption events occurring in the period April 1970 to April 1976 were summarized. Energetic particle effects on total ozone above the 4 mb pressure level measured by Nimbus 4 were analyzed. Proceedings of a workshop meeting of operation aurorozone are included as background material for possible effects of bremsstrahlung on atmospheric ozone...|$|E
40|$|Large-scale {{stratospheric ozone}} {{reduction}} due to precipitating energetic solar protons is examined, {{based on the}} <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> experiment on the Nimbus 4 satellite during the 1972 solar flare. Some chemical equations for the processes are outlined. Distinct asymmetries in the columnar ozone content, the amount of ozone depression, and their temporal variation above 4 mb level (about 38 km) were observed between the two hemispheres. These asymmetries are ascribed to the differences mainly in dynamics and partly in the solar illumination and the vertical temperature structure between the summer and the winter polar atmospheres...|$|E
40|$|Analysis of <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> radiances {{observed}} at tropical latitudes by the Atmosphere Explorer-E satellite reveals both annual and semiannual cycles in upper stratospheric ozone. The annual variation dominates the signal at wavelengths which sense ozone primarily above 45 km while below this, {{to the lowest}} altitude sensed, 35 km, the semiannual component has comparable amplitude. Comparison of radiance measurements taken with the same instrument at solar minimum during 1976 and solar maximum in 1979 show no significant differences. This suggests that variations in upper stratospheric ozone over the solar cycle are small, although the data presently available do not allow a definite conclusion...|$|E
40|$|The {{retrieval}} {{of the ozone}} profile from satellite ultraviolet measurements can be extended to greater depths when multiple scattering is taken into account. The sensitivity of the multiple-scattered wavelength radiances to geophysical variables are discussed and results of profile inversions of Nimbus 4 <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> data for coincident ground-truth measurements with and without multiple scattering are presented...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{ground-based}} researchers remotely operating {{experiments in}} Columbias payload bay continued their observations. Scientists {{working with the}} Space Shuttle <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> instrument continued probing the layers of Earths atmosphere and recorded data on tropospheric emissions from Mexican and Central American volcanoes; sulfur dioxide from industrial by-products in the troposphere above China and Japan; and observations in the mesosphere above the Mexican volcano Colima.|$|R
40|$|The Instruments {{are divided}} into two groups, ground based {{instruments}} and satellite-borne instruments. The ground based instruments include a Dobson ozone spectrophotometer, a filter ozonometer, and ozonesondes. The satellite-borne instruments include: a <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> spectrometer, a high resolution infrared radiation sounder, a infrared interferometer spectrometer, a limb radiance inversion radiometer, and multichannel filter radiometer. A list of investigations using stratospheric satellite data is presented...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{more than}} one year of <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> radiances {{obtained}} from an equatorial orbit by the Atmosphere Explorer-E satellite reveals an annual cycle in tropical, high altitude ozone which shows no latitude dependence between 20 degrees south and 20 degrees north. The amplitude of the variation increases with altitude. In the 35 to 45 km altitude region statistics of the data suggest no variation whatsoever, while in the lower mesosphere the radiances indicate an ozone increase of 25 to 30 percent between January and July with a decrease thereafter provided the solar irradiance remained constant except for the variation with earth-sun distance...|$|E
40|$|Differences in {{wavelength}} pair ozone values {{determined from}} <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (BUV) instrument measurements are directly correlated with scene reflectivity which, in turn, {{is a function}} of scene cloudiness. At low solar zenith angles (overhead sun), maximum discrepancies between pair values of 2 to 3 percent. These discrepancies are believed to be due to algorithmic behavior and imply a mean error in the final derived ozone of approximately 5 percent for cases of 50 percent reflectivity. Results using a new algorithm show a significant decrease in pair discrepancy and, therefore, in the error of the final derived ozone...|$|E
40|$|Seasonal global maps of {{the dark}} current {{produced}} by corpuscular radiation contributing to the background level of the Nimbus- 4 <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (BUV) instrument were developed, using BUV monochrometer nighttime data in the pulse counting mode during solar and magnetically quiet periods. The existence of high intensity surges has been discovered which occur on a sporadic basis and which cause sufficient enhancements of dark current within the subauroral regions to produce background levels similar to those within the South Atlantic anomaly. Examples are provided of the nominal quiet dark current intensity maps, and the variability and implications of the surge data are discussed...|$|E
50|$|Other {{payloads}} in Atlantisâ€™s {{cargo bay}} included the Shuttle Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SSBUV-7) payload and the Experiment on the Sun Complementing ATLAS (ESCAPE-II). Payloads {{located in the}} middeck include the Physiological & Anatomical Rodent Experiment (PARE/NIR-R), Protein Crystal Growth-Thermal Enclosure (PCG-TES), Protein Crystal Growth- Single Locker (PCG-STES), Space Tissue Loss/National Institute of Health (STL/NIH-C), Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) and the Heat Pipe Performance-2 Experiment (HPP-2).|$|R
40|$|Shuttle Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SSBUV) {{spectrometer}} {{observations of}} ozone {{concentrations in the}} upper stratosphere made in October 1989 are combined here with measurements made in October 1980 by the similar SBUV instruments on NASA's Nimbus- 7 satellite. It is shown that the ozone concentration near 45 km has decreased during this period by about 7 +/- 2 percent. The trend is consistent with predictions of a 2 D photochemical model...|$|R
50|$|Atmospheric ozone {{depletion}} is an environmental problem of worldwide concern. At the time, NASAs NIMBUS-7 satellite and NOAAs TIROS satellites provided dailydata to permit researchers to detect ozone trends. The Shuttle Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Instrument, from the Goddard Space Flight Center, carried an ozone detector instrument {{identical to those}} on the satellites. By comparing Discoverys measurements with coordinated satellite observations, scientists were able to calibrate their satellite instruments to insure the most accurate readings possible.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for the calculation of a multiple-scattering correction to the single-scattering calculation of the radiance of the terrestrial atmosphere resulting from <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> solar radiation in the spectral region used in the ozone profile inversion. This method uses jointly the usual analytical and Monte Carlo methods. Effects of the lower boundary of the atmosphere, cloud tops, and ground surface are investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The ratio of multiple to single scattering is determined, and its importance in ozone profile inversion of backscattered UV solar radiation from the terrestrial atmosphere is evaluated. The polarization of the atmospheric radiance is treated briefly...|$|E
40|$|With a three-parameter {{analytical}} model, {{the ozone}} profile below 10 mbar {{to the surface}} {{is derived from the}} Nimbus 4 satellite <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> and infrared measurements. Comparison of the derived profiles with those observed by ozonesondes shows that gross features are satisfactorily reproduced. Meridional cross section of the ozone partial pressure derived from the satellite data reveal the significant equator-to-pole features, as well as seasonal variability. An examination of the sensitivity of the method shows that an error in infrared radiance of approximately 1 erg leads to an error of about 10 mbar in the weighted mean pressure of the ozone layer in the tropics...|$|E
40|$|Two {{years of}} Nimbus 4 <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> data have been recalibrated and reprocessed. A Laplace {{transform}} inversion {{was applied to}} radiances at 2876 A and below for 560, 000 individual scans for the period April 1970 -May 1972. The behavior of ozone near 50 km {{as a function of}} time, latitude, and longitude is presented. The high-latitude 1 -mbar ozone mixing ratio is maximum at the winter solstice, about 10 microgram/g and is minimum at the summer solstice, about 4 microgram/g. Below 30 deg latitude the ozone is fairly constant at 4 microgram/g. Ozone variability is large in winter and spring and small in summer and fall...|$|E
40|$|Data {{obtained}} from the <b>backscattering</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> instrument on Nimbus 4 are compared with standardized observations such as ground based Dobson and M 83 measurements. Results of the comparison are discussed {{and their impact on}} planning for a satellite ozone monitoring program is assessed. It is suggested that the satellite data be used as a transfer standard whereby, if a discrepancy in an individual ground station is detected, that station instrument would be noted for recalibration...|$|R
40|$|Live footage shows Milt Heflin, the Lead Flight Director {{participating}} in the STS- 34 Mission Briefing. He addresses the primary objective, and answered questions from the audience and other NASA Centers. Heflin also mentions the Shuttle Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> secondary payload, and several experiments. These experiments include Growth Hormone Crystal Distribution (Plants), Polymer Morphology, Sensor Technology Experiment, Mesoscale Lightning Experiment, Shuttle Student Involvement Program "Ice Crystals", and the Air Force Maui Optical Site...|$|R
50|$|STS-34 Atlantis (October 18-23, 1989) {{launched}} from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, and landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California. During the mission, the crew deployed the Galileo probe to explore Jupiter, operated the Shuttle Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> Instrument (SSBUV) to map atmospheric ozone, conducted several medical experiments, and numerous scientific experiments. Mission objectives were accomplished in 79 orbits of the Earth, traveling 1.8 million miles in 119 hours and 41 minutes.|$|R
40|$|Global ozone fluxes and flux divergences {{within the}} region between 30 and 0. 4 mbar are {{computed}} for the period from December 1, 1978, to November 30, 1979, using Nimbus 7 solar <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> ozone profiles and meteorological data derived from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellites. The annual cycle of ozone transports in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres is presented and discussed. It is found that planetary scale waves are responsible for initiating the high-latitude ozone buildup in winter. The time of occurrence and {{the position of the}} annual maximum ozone are found to be closely related to the planetary wave activity in both hemispheres...|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} {{conducted}} of the quasi-biennial oscillations (QBO) variations in zonal mean total columnar ozone, {{taking into account}} seven years of Nimbus 4 <b>backscattered</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> (BUV) measurements. The data analysis technique employed is briefly discussed, and theoretical results reported by Reed (1964) are reviewed. The BUV results are compared with the theoretical expectations and Dobson-derived results. In the tropics, the results {{are found to be}} in agreement with the theoretical study of Reed. This agreement suggests that the principal effect is through quasi-biennial variations in Hadley cell strength. Favorable comparisons are found between the BUV results and the results based on Dobson data...|$|E
40|$|The Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) {{instrument}} was launched on the Nimbus 7 satellite in October 1978. This instrument {{is designed to}} measure spatial variations in the total ozone field. The employed technique {{is an extension of}} the <b>Backscattered</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (BUV) total ozone method. The TOMS instrument has an improved capability for detailed monitoring of total ozone. The obtained data appear to contain information about dynamical processes in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere. Investigations are being conducted to determine qualitatively the conditions, if any, where total ozone fails as a predictor for tropopause height. Quantitative relations between the dynamic parameters and total ozone are also being studied...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} to monitor the long-term calibration of the Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) instruments. It {{is based on the}} fact that the radiance in one channel can be expressed as a linear sum of the radiances in neighboring channels. Using simulated radiances for the SBUV and TOMS instruments, various scenarios of changes in instrument calibration are investigated. Results from sample processing of SBUV data are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Measurements {{from the}} Solar <b>Backscatter</b> <b>Ultraviolet</b> (SBUV) provide solar UV flux in the 160 to 400 nm {{wavelength}} range, {{backed up by}} independent measurement in the 115 to 305 nm range from the Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME). The full disc UV flux from spatially resolved measurements of solar activity was modeled, which provides {{a better understanding of}} why the UV variations have their observed temporal and wavelength dependencies. Long term, intermediate term, and short term variations are briefly examined...|$|R
40|$|The SBUV instrument, on Nimbus- 7, {{measures}} the <b>backscatter</b> <b>ultraviolet</b> radiance at 12 wavelengths. The radiance data from these wavelengths {{was used to}} deduce the ozone profile and the total column ozone. In February 1987, there was an instrument malfunction. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe the malfunction, to determine the effect of the malfunction on the data quality, and if possible, to correct for the effects of the malfunction on the data from the SBUV instrument...|$|R
