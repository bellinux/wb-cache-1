5|$|Karl Schäfer {{is first}} {{introduced}} {{to when the}} player arrives in a remote town {{in the mountains of}} Tibet in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He is voiced by René Auberjonois. At the time of his appearance, he has been living in the village for 70 years. During World War II, he had led an Ahnenerbe expedition to find the entrance of Shambhala. However, afraid of what the Nazis would do with the power found in the Cintamani Stone, Schäfer shot and killed all {{of the members of the}} expedition <b>but</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, she {{is being}} {{followed}} by a gang, led by a furious Telugu-speaking lady. Shiva manages to lose the pursuers and decides to change the route to avoid the gang, but encounters a second gang. He realises that this gang is not following Charulatha, <b>but</b> <b>himself,</b> as they are the henchmen of a Mumbai-based gangster Baali (Milind Soman). He recalls an incident that happened some years ago in Mumbai, when he stayed there at his friend Poochi's (Jagan) house. He had beaten one of Baali's men, who had attacked him, and later Baali himself, not knowing about him and his reputation in the city, and returned to Bangalore. Both gangs are following the couple to achieve their own ends. After reaching Mumbai and experiencing a series of events, they end up at Poochi's house. Poochi finds out where the grandmother lives and Shiva brings Charulatha there. Shiva, unable to bear {{the thought that the}} journey is complete, leaves silently only to find Charulatha on the road. After hesitating, she reveals that her relatives had spoken ill about her parents, which prompted her leave, not wanting to push the matter further. While in a state of doubt, they are attacked by Baali's gang, who have teamed up with Jayaraman.|$|E

25|$|Cymoril: A Melnibonéan, Elric's {{cousin and}} consort. He hopes {{to one day}} make her his wife and empress. She tries to {{understand}} and help Elric, but like his subjects, she has difficulty understanding Elric's motivations and would have him rule as the emperors of old, with no concern for any <b>but</b> <b>himself.</b>|$|E
25|$|His piety only seemed {{actually}} {{present and}} noticeable {{when he was}} in times of need or greatly distressed, such as in the time of his great monetary losses between 1840 and 1844. He is also remembered to have been very severe in his judgements on criminals, <b>but</b> <b>himself</b> managed to avoid controversy or accusation in the public eye.|$|E
25|$|By 6:00a.m. on November 30, all of Schofield's {{army was}} well north of Spring Hill and its vanguard had reached Franklin, where {{it began to}} build breastworks south of town. In the morning Hood {{discovered}} Schofield's escape, and after an angry conference with his subordinate commanders in which he blamed all <b>but</b> <b>himself</b> for the failure, ordered his army to resume its pursuit, setting up the disastrous Battle of Franklin that afternoon.|$|E

25|$|The band's lineup {{proved to}} be a problem {{throughout}} its career. During the recording of the debut album, Meisner left the group {{as a result of a}} conflict with Furay (reportedly, Meisner had objected after Furay barred all <b>but</b> <b>himself</b> and Messina from the first album's final mix playback sessions). After a stint playing with Ricky Nelson's Stone Canyon Band, Meisner later became a founding member of the Eagles. Messina briefly took over on bass until Timothy B. Schmit joined the band in September 1969.|$|E
25|$|Despite Burney's criticism, fellow music {{historian}} Sir John Hawkins {{thought they}} 'succeeded so well … {{as to make}} from it a book of lessons which few could play <b>but</b> <b>himself,</b> and which has long been deservedly celebrated.' Babell's transcription of arias from Handel's opera Rinaldo includes 'Vo' far guerra', which Handel intended as a showpiece for his harpsichord playing and is quite remarkable in its virtuosity; Babell's transcription was made from his memory of how Handel improvised in performances. In 1894, Friedrich Chrysander published Babell's piano reduction of Rinaldo in the Händel-Gesellschaft volume 48.|$|E
25|$|One of the Breton lais {{recorded}} in Old French by Marie de France in the 12th century concerns {{a young man}} named Guigemar. Injured in a hunting accident, after making his way to a harbour that he had no idea existed, he climbs aboard a boat on which there is a bed, lies on this bed and soon the boat is underway, although there is nobody on board <b>but</b> <b>himself.</b> Burning at the boat's prow are lighted candles and, like King Arthur, this vessel takes him to a place where he will be healed of his wound.|$|E

25|$|By 6:00a.m. on November 30, all of Schofield's {{army was}} well north of Spring Hill and its vanguard had reached Franklin, where {{it began to}} build breastworks south of town. In the morning Hood {{discovered}} Schofield's escape, and after an angry conference with his subordinate commanders in which he blamed all <b>but</b> <b>himself</b> for the failure, ordered his army to resume its pursuit. Spring Hill had been, arguably, Hood's best chance to isolate and defeat the Union army and recriminations for the lost opportunity soon began flying. Hood believed that Cheatham was most responsible. Historians Thomas L. Connelly, Eric Jacobson, and Wiley Sword have each assigned blame to both Hood and Cheatham.|$|E
25|$|Merlin (Merrdyn) - Merlin is a {{powerful}} warlock who is several hundred years old {{and may have been}} born in Atlantis. Merlin has been an influential figure for a very long time, working towards a greater goal known to no-one <b>but</b> <b>himself.</b> He was advisor to Vortigern, the last great king of Britain. When Ambrosius Aurelianus and Uther Pendragon killed Vortigen and stole his throne, Merlin appeared to change his allegiance and support Ambrosius until his death, and then Uther when he succeeded him. It is rumoured that he and Morgana had a short, explosive affair, but now they are sworn enemies. Merlin is hard drinking and often is callous when dealing with other people.|$|E
25|$|Orlok is a {{fugitive}} on a distant planet, where he learns that a ten billion credit reward {{for the killing}} or kidnapping of Judge Dredd has been advertised by the Government-in-exile of East-Meg One, a band of ex-diplomats and others who survived the thermonuclear destruction of that city by Dredd's hand in 2104. Although {{not interested in the}} reward, he considers it unfitting that Dredd should be killed by anyone <b>but</b> <b>himself,</b> and heads for Earth. Arriving in Mega-City One, he is detected by Anderson, who tries to dissuade him from killing Dredd. Too late, she realises that Orlok has not changed as much as she thought, and she tries to arrest him, but Orlok overcomes her and takes her prisoner.|$|E

25|$|Abu Zakariya (1203–1249) {{served the}} Almohads in Ifriqiya as {{governor}} of Gabès, then in 1226 {{as governor of}} Tunis. In 1229 during disturbances within the Almohad movement, Abu Zakariya declared his independence, having the Mahdi's name declared at Friday prayer, <b>but</b> <b>himself</b> taking the title of Amir: hence, {{the start of the}} Hafsid dynasty (1229–1574). In the next few years he secured his hold on the cities of Ifriqiya, then captured Tripolitania (1234) to the east, and to the west Algiers (1235) and later Tlemcen (1242). He solidified his rule among the Berber confederacies. Government structure of the Hafsid state followed the Almohad model, a rather strict hierarchy and centralization. Abu Zakariya's succession to the Almohad movement was acknowledged as the only state maintaining Almohad traditions, and was recognized in Friday prayer by many states in Al-Andalus and in Morocco (including the Merinids). Diplomatic relations were opened with Frederick II of Sicily, Venice, Genoa, and Aragon. Abu Zakariya the founder of the Hafsids became the foremost ruler in the Maghrib.|$|E
25|$|Andrija Hebrang accused his party's dissidents, Vidošević and Primorac, {{as well as}} most right-wing {{candidates}} for 'stealing' his votes saying the result was that two left-wingers would face-off in the second round. Despite this, he called the election a great victory of the right claiming that right-leaning candidates combined achieved better results that left-leaning candidates combined. In making this assertion, he failed to consider Bandić as left-leaning, and ignored Vidošević's appeal to the left-leaning voters as well. Vidošević conceded defeat saying that one should never blame his failures on others, <b>but</b> <b>himself.</b> He urged the public to continue believing in a better tomorrow saying that Croatia should be a country of knowledge and justice, not of corruption and divisiveness. Pusić gave a short teary speech calling Croatia a country with a lot of potential with only the right leadership. She also noted that no government would ever be able to win without the support of HNS. Primorac said he would be forming a new party which would be independent from both HDZ and SDP and said he saw a bright future for Croatia.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} speculation {{as to the}} actual paternity of Paul I. It is suggested {{that he was not}} Peter's son at all, but that his mother had engaged in an affair—to which Elizabeth had consented—with a young officer named Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov, and that he was Paul's real father. In any case Peter never gave any indication that he believed Paul to have been fathered by anyone <b>but</b> <b>himself.</b> He also did not take any interest in parenthood. Elizabeth though most certainly took an active interest. She removed the young Paul and acted as if she were his mother and not Catherine. The Empress had ordered the midwife to take the baby and to follow her. Catherine was not to see her child for another month and then on the second time briefly for the churching ceremony. Six months later Elizabeth let Catherine see the child again. The child had in effect become a ward of the state and in a larger sense, the property of the state, to be brought up by Elizabeth as she believed he should be — as a true heir and great-grandson of her father, Peter the Great.|$|E

25|$|Pius XII {{allowed the}} {{national}} hierarchies of the Church {{to assess and}} respond to their local situation under Nazi rule, <b>but</b> <b>himself</b> established the Vatican Information Service to provide aid to, and information about, war refugees. He gave his blessing {{to the establishment of}} safe houses inside the Vatican and in monasteries and convents across Europe and oversaw a secret operation for priests to shelter Jews by means of fake documents - with some Jews made Vatican subjects to spare them from the Nazis. On papal instructions, 4000 Jews were hidden in Italian monasteries and convents, and 2000 Hungarian Jews given fake documents identifying them as Catholics. Pius' diplomatic representatives lobbied on behalf of Jews across Europe, including in Nazi allied Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovakia, Vichy France and elsewhere. The papal nuncios most active in the rescue of rescue of Jews included Angelo Roncalli (the future Pope John XXIII); and Angelo Rotta, Nuncio to Budapest, who enabled many Jews to survive and was recognised as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem; and Archbishop Andrea Cassulo, Nuncio in Romania, who appealed to the Antonescu regime to stop deportations of Jews, and received the same honour from Yad Vashem.|$|E

[...] When working on [...] "A Contract with God", he tried to capture these emotions by acting out Frimme Hersh's character in his head.|$|E
