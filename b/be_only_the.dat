5|$|Since Oklahoma won the Big12 Championship game, they {{represented}} the Big12 Conference in the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona. Contractually, the Fiesta Bowl hosts the Big12 Champion and then picks, {{from among the}} BCS eligible teams, the opponent. For 2007, the Fiesta Bowl picked Boise State as Oklahoma's opponent. The game took place on New Year's Day in the then-new University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals. The Broncos led the Sooners {{the majority of the}} game, but the Sooners made up an 18point deficit late in the game and led by a touchdown with a minute left in regulation. With 18seconds left, the Sooners had the Broncos in a fourth-and-18 situation from midfield, but were stunned when the Broncos executed a hook and lateral for the tying score. This would <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> first of three Boise State trick plays that helped elevate this game to epic status.|$|E
5|$|The Grolier Codex (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Sáenz Codex) is a Maya book of a pre-Columbian type but of disputed authenticity. It first appeared in a private collection in the 20th century and was displayed at the Grolier Club in New York, hence its name. The codex consists of a fragment of a Maya book, containing almanacs of Venus represented in a simplistic fashion. The Grolier Codex would <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> fourth surviving pre-Columbian Maya book if genuine. The codex {{is said to have been}} recovered from a cave in the Mexican state of Chiapas in the 1960s, together with a mosaic mask and some blank pages of pre-Columbian fig-bark paper. It was displayed at the Grolier Club from April 20 to June 5, 1971, and is now held in Mexico City. In 1973, Michael D. Coe published the first half-size recto-side facsimile of the codex in The Maya Scribe and His World, produced by the Grolier Club. The codex contains a Venus almanac that, in structure, is closely related to the Venus almanac contained in the Dresden Codex.|$|E

According to Hufvudstadsbladet, the Confederation has subsequently changed their stance and no longer favours making Swedish voluntary, while maintaining the need for learning other languages.|$|E
25|$|The {{report of}} French seizure - which, if true, would <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> second time a Portuguese India ship was {{captured}} by enemy action (the first was in 1509) - was given by the 16th-century chronicler Gaspar Correia (who is not always reliable, and acknowledges this is hearsay) and also the 16th-century chronicler Francisco de Andrada. Both Correia and Andrada state that Luís de Menezes went on the Santa Catarina de Monte Sinai, and his brother, the ex-governor Duarte de Menezes, on a different ship, the São Jorge.|$|E
25|$|An entirely {{different}} form of perfectionism has arisen {{in response to}} rapid technological change.

Skeptics assert that rather than perfect goodness, it would <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> appearance of perfect goodness, reinforced by persuasion technology and probably brute force of violent technological escalation, which would cause people to accept such rulers or rules authored by them.|$|E

25|$|The St. Francis, {{sometimes}} referred to as the San Francisquito, would <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> second concrete dam to be designed and built by the Bureau of Water Works and Supply. The first was the near identical, in size and shape, Mulholland Dam, on which construction had begun one year earlier. The design of the St. Francis was in fact an adaptation of the Mulholland Dam with certain changes which were made so as to suit the location. Most of the design profiles and computation figures of stress factors for the St. Francis came from this adaptation of the plans and formulas which had been used in the constructing of Mulholland Dam. This work was done by the Engineering department within the Bureau of Water Works and Supply.|$|E
25|$|During construction, two of {{the clubs}} which {{previously}} had Gamla Ullevi as their home stadium, GAIS and IFK Göteborg, played at the much larger Ullevi stadium, while the third club of the Alliance, Örgryte IS, played on Valhalla IP. It was originally said that Nya Gamla Ullevi would be officially opened with a match played between an Alliance teamfeaturing players from the three Alliance clubs just like when Gamla Ullevi was reopened in 1992and the Sweden national team or a European top club. Later it was proposed that the women's national team might play the opening match, with an Alliance team playing a second opening match. Nya Gamla Ullevi will <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> second Swedish top league stadium built since 1966, after Borås Arena that was opened in 2005.|$|E
25|$|As {{darkness}} fell, the Union {{force was}} able to retreat and to elude Confederate cavalry pursuers in the broken terrain. The Confederate pursuit also was apparently called off early due to apprehension that the Union force might <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> advance of a larger body of troops and because the Confederate force was supposed {{to return to their}} post that night. Confederates took such supplies and equipment as were left behind and burned a passenger car and five platform cars that had been left behind. When the Union commanders at Arlington got word of the attack, they sent wagons to bring back the wounded and the dead but these did not reach the location of the fighting. The next day, a Union sympathizer picked up the bodies of six of the Ohio men and brought them into the Union camp.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Heffron, who {{supported}} a general policy of decentralising tertiary education across the state, directed his Department {{to begin the}} establishment of various Teachers' Colleges in New South Wales, to provide sufficient tertiary training to the expanding numbers of teachers filling the new schools and colleges across the state. Among them was the Newcastle Teachers' College, established in 1949 and opened in 1950, which facilitated growing calls {{from the city of}} Newcastle for a more permanent University in the city. In May 1951, Heffron indicated his support {{for the establishment of a}} satellite college of Sydney University in Newcastle as an initial step towards the establishment of a full university. By July Heffron sought to approach Sydney University officials to facilitate efforts [...] "to have a university established in Newcastle as soon as possible", and noted that his moves to purchase land in the city as the site of this college was an indication of the government's intentions: [...] "I didn't buy that site in Newcastle just for fun. I want to provide a university in Newcastle and I want that to <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> first step in providing universities all over the state". However, by the time Heffron opened the Newcastle University College (NUC) on 3 December 1951, no affiliation had been finalised. By May 1952, a University Establishment Group had gained much momentum but Heffron had been notified by Premier Joseph Cahill that there were insufficient funds available for the establishment of another full university. Nevertheless, in early 1954 this college had become a college of the New South Wales University of Technology. As premier, in late 1961 Heffron moved with his Minister for Education, Ernest Wetherell, that the Newcastle University College would become a full university [...] "come what may". This was achieved when on 12 March 1962, the University of Technology Vice-Chancellor Philip Baxter notified the NUC Warden, Professor James Auchmuty, that it would be allowed to take on full autonomy to become the University of Newcastle from 1 January 1965.|$|E

2500|$|In perpetuating and {{expanding}} the modernizing {{tradition of the}} Reform movement, Gottschalk performed the June 1972 ordination of Rabbi Sally Priesand, {{the first woman to}} be ordained in the United States and believed to <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> second woman ever to be formally ordained in the millennia-long history of Judaism. Rabbi Gottschalk called the ordination of Priesand [...] "historic", one that breaks stereotypes and allows [...] "Jewish women to consider seeking the rabbinate" [...] and a testament to Reform Judaism's efforts at achieving [...] "equality of women in the congregation of the Lord". Priesand wept when Gottschalk spoke with her as she was handed her ordination certificate.|$|E
