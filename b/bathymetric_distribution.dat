40|$|Abstract Juveniles of many {{coral reef}} fish species {{are thought to}} either follow the same <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distribution</b> {{patterns}} as the adults, or to occupy shallower waters.

In sharp con-trast to the general trend known from the literature and from this research, the abundance of juvenile zebra angelfish, Genicanthus caudo-vittatus, peaked at deeper waters (60 – 65 m) compared with the adults (30 m). This suggests that the deeper reefs may serve as nursery grounds for the zebra angelfish. Peak juvenile abundance coincided with relatively low predator abundances. This raises the question, which fac-tors constrain the <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distribution</b> of the remaining species.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in deep-sea exploration technology {{coupled with an}} increase in worldwide biotic surveys, biological research, and underwater photography in shallow water marine regions such as coral reefs, has allowed for a relatively rapid expansion of our knowledge in the global diversity of many groups of marine organisms. This paper is part of the PLoS ONE review collection of WoRMS (the Worldwide Register of Marine Species), on the global diversity of marine species, and treats the pennatulacean octocorals, a group of cnidarians commonly referred to as sea pens or sea feathers. This also includes sea pansies, some sea whips, and various vermiform taxa. Pennatulaceans are a morphologically diverse group with an estimated 200 or more valid species, displaying worldwide geographic and <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distributions</b> from polar seas to the equatorial tropics and from intertidal flats to over 6100 m in depth.

40|$|The postmetamorphic {{ontogenesis}} of 11 deep-sea asteroid {{species is}} described. Juvenile <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distributions</b> are compared to adults. The deep-sea juvenile asteroids of the NE Atlantic could be distinguished to species level {{from a very}} early stage of development. In all species, except Porcellanaster ceruleus and Plinthaster dentatus, the arms grow faster than the body. In Porcellanaster ceruleus and Plinthaster dentatus, early growth is nearly isometric. In {{the appearance of the}} epiproctal cone, the change in form of the furrow and apical spines, the early development of the cribriform organ adjacent to the madreporite and the appearance of sediment in the stomach indicate that Porcellanaster ceruleus is likely to undergo a shift in habitat and diet during the juvenile phase. Porcellanaster ceruleus is probably a predator on meiofauna and small macrofauna during the early stages of life, changing to a burrowing lifestyle ingesting sediment particles.

The Gulf of California is one {{of the most}} mega-diverse regions in the world, for which few fishery information is available. We present here latitudinal and <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distribution</b> of the most abundant and frequent bycatch species from the Gulf of California. The samples were obtained from a total of 111 hauls taken during seven research cruises of the closed shrimp season (2002 - 2005 - 2007), and also, from research cruises made at depths up to 90 m. Due to the high variety species in this experimental shrimp bycatch, only those with highest biological value index (BVI) were selected. A total of fifteen species had the highest BVI and represented about 60 % of the total abundance. A total of 16 508 organisms were analyzed, representing 243 fish, crustacean, mollusk and echinoderm species. Fish were the most abundant, being the most frequent species: Urobatis halleri, Synodus scituliceps, Diplectrum pacificum, Haemulopsis nitidus and Eucinostomus argenteus. A wide latitudinal distribution of these species along the study area, as well as a <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distribution</b> from 9 to 67 m depth, was observed. Two of these species were found at 325 m depth. Due to the wide <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distribution</b> obtained, total abundances and sizes for each species by depth strata should be determined, and one can assume that deeper than 25 m, the capture of these species decreases, and these areas can be used as natural repopulation areas, for depths where they are mainly captured by the commercial shrimp fishery.

After its introduction it has colonized most Mediterranean areas, but the mechanism underlying its acclimatization and invasion process remains unknown. To understand this process, we decided i) to assess in situ the seasonal biomass and phenological patterns of populations inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea {{in relation to the}} main environmental factors, and ii) to experimentally determine if the tolerance of W. setacea to different light and temperature conditions can explain its colonization success, as well as its <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distribution</b> range. The <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distribution,</b> biomass, and phenology of W. setacea were studied at two localities, and related to irradiance and temperature values recorded in situ. Laboratory experiments were set up to study survival, growth and reproduction under contrasting light and temperature conditions in the short, mid, and long term. Results showed that, in the studied area, the <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distribution</b> of W. setacea is restricted to a depth belt between 25 and 40 m deep, reaching maximum biomass values (126 g dw m− 2) at 30 m depth. In concordance, although in the short term W. setacea survived and grew in a large range of environmental conditions, its life requirements for the mid and long term were dim light levels and low temperatures. Biomass of Womersleyella setacea did not show any clear seasonal pattern, though minimum values were reported in spring. Reproductive structures were always absent. Bearing in mind that no herbivores feed on Womersleyella setacea and that its thermal preferences are more characteristic of temperate than of tropical seaweeds, low light (50 µmol photon m− 2 s− 1) and low temperature (12 °C) levels are critical for W. setacea survival and growth, thus probably determining its spread and <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distribution</b> across the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E

The lower mesophotic zone harbored a specialized coral community consisting of predominantly Agaricia grahamae, Agaricia undata and a “deep-water” lineage of Madracis pharensis, with large colonies of these species observed close to their lower distribution limit of ~ 90 m depth. All three species associated with “deep-specialist” photosynthetic endosymbionts (Symbiodinium). Fragments of A. grahamae exhibited growth rates at 60  m similar to those observed for shallow Agaricia colonies (~ 2 – 3  cm yr - 1), but showed bleaching and (partial) mortality when transplanted to 100  m. We propose that the strong reduction of temperature over depth (? 5 °C from 40 to 100  m depth) may play an important contributing role in determining lower depth limits of mesophotic coral communities in this region. Rather than a marginal extension of the reef slope, the lower mesophotic represents a specialized community, and as such warrants specific consideration from science and management...|$|R

The samples {{used in this}} study were collected in bottom trawl surveys between 36 and 779 m depth. Generalized linear models, linear regression, cluster and similarity percentage analyses, and generalized additive models were used to compare the two areas. Twenty-nine elasmobranch species were caught, 12 of them common to both areas, 7 appearing only in the Balearic Islands, and 10 only in Algeria. The <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distributions</b> of species were, in most cases, best fitted to uni-modal response curves. The models for species common to both areas showed similar bathymetric trends, except for Etmopterus spinax, which in Algeria showed a maximum abundance lo¬cated 154 m shallower than in the Balearic Islands. Four bathymetric assemblages were identified in both areas with similar depth ranges but with different species composition. The mean values of the community descriptors were higher on the shelf in the Balearic Islands, whereas higher values were detected on the slope in Algeria. Different between-area bathymetric trends for all the descriptors were detected, with the exception of mean fish weight.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{ecological}} and physiological processes governing depth distribution limits in species. Temperature and hydrostatic pressure are considered to be two dominant factors. Research has shown that some marine ectotherms are shifting their <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distributions</b> in response to rapid anthropogenic ocean surface warming. Shallow-water species unable to undergo latitudinal range shifts may depend on bathymetric range shifts to seek refuge from warming surface waters. As a first step in constraining the molecular basis of pressure tolerance in shallow water crustaceans, we examined differential gene expression in response to acute pressure and temperature exposures in juveniles of the shallow-water shrimp Palaemonetes varians. Significant increases in the transcription of genes coding for an NMDA receptor-regulated protein, an ADP ribosylation factor, ?-actin, two heat shock protein 70 kDa isoforms (HSP 70), and glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were found in response to elevated pressure. NMDA receptors have been implicated in pathways of excitotoxic damage to neurons and the onset of high pressure neurological syndrome (HPNS) in mammals. These data indicate that the sub-lethal effects of acute barotrauma are associated with transcriptional disturbances within the nervous tissue of crustaceans, and cellular macromolecular damage. Such transcriptional changes lead to the onset of symptoms similar to that described as HPNS in mammals, and may act as a limit to shallow water organisms’ prolonged survival at depth...|$|R

Hydroids were obtained at two of 65 stations in Operation GEOCOSTA RIO I, each represented by one species: Aglaophenia rhynchocarpa Allman, 1877 and Plumularia strobilophora Billard, 1913. In Operation GEOCOSTA RIO II, hydroids were present at four of the 25 sampled stations. Fourteen species were recorded: Pennaria disticha Goldfuss, 1820, Tubulariidae mt. 1, Filifera mt. 1, Filifera mt. 2, Bougainvilliidae mt. 1, Bimeria vestita Wright, 1859, Plumularia strobilophora Billard, 1913, Amphisbetia operculata (Linnaeus, 1758), Dynamena dalmasi (Versluys, 1899), Sertularella tenella (Alder, 1857), Campanularia hincksii Alder, 1856, Clytia gracilis (M. Sars, 1850), Clytia paulensis (Vanhöffen, 1910), and Orthopyxis integra (Macgillivray, 1842). The ranges of three species (Aglaophenia rhynchocarpa, Plumularia strobilophora, Clytia paulensis) were extended southwards along the Brazilian coast. The <b>bathymetric</b> <b>distributions</b> of six species (B. vestita, P. strobilophora, C. hincksii, C. paulensis, D. dalmasi, O. integra) were also extended on the Brazilian continental shelf...|$|R
