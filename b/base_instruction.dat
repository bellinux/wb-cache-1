The population is XI grader Sciences of Senior High School in Brebes for academic year 2011 / 2012. Initial data analysis showed that the population are normally distributed and homogeneous, so the sampling technique which used is cluster random sampling. From this sampling, XI Science- 5 used as a control class (Problem <b>Based</b> <b>Instruction</b> learning model without Predict-Observe-Explain approach) and XI Science- 1 as an experiment class (Problem <b>Based</b> <b>Instruction</b> with Predict Observe Explain approach).  Final data analysis showed that learning outcomes for both classes are normally distributed and have equal variances.

Interestingly, all of the 13 community based activities provided in this questionnaire received at least one rating of "never would be needed" in the adult lives for students with mental retardation. In general, these educator participants appeared to be dissatisfied with the current amount of instructional time allocated for community based activities. In addition, these educator participants perceived limited staff, transportation, scheduling, cost, and administrator reluctance factors as the major potential barriers to community <b>based</b> <b>instruction.</b> Further, differential responses between EMI educator participants and TMI, SMI, and SXI educator participants were noted for the questionnaire items related to necessity of community based activities, and satisfaction with the total amount of instructional time in community based activities.

40|$|Two {{hardware}} {{methods for}} remedying {{the effects of}} true data dependences are studied. The first method, dependence speculation, is used to eliminate address generation-load dependences. This is enabled by address prediction that permits load instructions to proceed speculatively without waiting for their address operands. The second technique, dependence collapsing, is used to eliminate data dependences by combining a dependence among multiple instructions into one instruction. The potential of these techniques for improving processor performance is demonstrated via trace-driven simulation.

However, both enumerating all possible custom instructions of a given data-flow graph and selecting the most profitable custom instructions from the enumerated custom instructions are computationally difficult problems. In this paper, we propose efficient algorithms for custom instruction enumeration and custom instruction selection. Compared with previously proposed well-known enumeration algorithms, our approach can achieve a significant speedup while generating the identical set of all possible custom instructions or only connected custom instructions. Experimental results also show that a code size reduction rate up to 76 % can be achieved for a set of computational intensive programs, and the speed-up achieved is up to 8. 2 ×...|$|E
