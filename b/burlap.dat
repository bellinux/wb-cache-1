Trees were transplanted during 2009 and 2010 in three times (dormant season, early and late growing season). Survival rate and Relative Growth Rate index based on tree height (RGRH) and trunk diameter (RGRD) were measured during the first and second years. Trees transplanted early in the growing season showed the most survival percentage during the two years, as compared to other transplanting dates. Survival of Balled and <b>burlapped</b> and immature transplanted trees was significantly greater than bare root or mature trees. The significant effect of age treatment was continued in the second year. IBA treatment had no effect on survival rate of the studied species. Balled and <b>burlapped</b> and immature transplanted pine trees also had higher RGRH and RGRD compared to bare root or mature trees.

This legacy is described as a memory in the form of ecological structure or ecological interactions that remains at a location from a previous condition. We examined how forested floodplain restoration strategy, based on planting intensity, influenced wetland community structure and soil chemical and physical factors after 15 years. The site was divided into 15 strips, and strips were assigned to one of five restoration treatments: plantings of acorns, 2 -year-old seedlings, 5 -ft bareroot trees, balled and <b>burlapped</b> trees, and natural seed bank regeneration. Our community composition survey revealed that plots planted with bareroot or balled and <b>burlapped</b> trees developed closed tree canopies with little herbaceous understory, while acorn plantings and natural colonization plots developed into dense stands of the invasive species reed canary grass (RCG; 'Phalaris arundinacea'). Restoration strategy influenced bacterial community composition but to a lesser degree compared to the plant community response, and riverine hydrology and restoration strategy influenced wetland soil conditions. Soil ammonium concentrations and pH were similar across all wetland restoration treatments, while total organic carbon was highest in forest and RCG-dominated plots compared to mixed patches of trees and open areas. The differences in restoration strategy and associated economic investment resulted in ecological tradeoffs. The upfront investment in larger, more mature trees (i. e., bareroot, balled and <b>burlapped)</b> led to floodplain forested communities, while cheaper, more passive planting strategies (i. e., seedlings, seedbank, or acorns) resulted in dense stands of invasive RCG, despite the similar floodplain hydrology across all sites.

40|$|Trees {{experience}} tremendous {{stress in}} the trans-planting process, primarily from adverse changes {{in their ability to}} absorb water due to root loss. Water stress is the primary cause of transplant failure. Root loss affects hor-mone synthesis and distribution that regulate shoot growth.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD {{project was}} to study tree establishment, both how it may be {{improved}} in urban areas {{and how it is}} measured and defined. The establishment phase of trees is a period of reduced tree vitality, and a successful establishment is crucial for long-term survival and prosperity of newly planted trees. However, failed plantings and poor establishment is a common problem in the often harsh growing conditions present in urban areas. Improving tree establishment is thus important for securing the presence of trees in urban environments. Another important part is to understand how the process of establishment is expressed in trees, so that the needs of the trees can be met. Tree nursery industry has recently developed production systems that aim to produce trees that are better prepared for transplanting. This study set out to investigate the effect nursery production systems might have on tree establishment success, and to examine different ways of assessing establishment, since the term is not consistently defined. Sweet cheery and red oak trees, cultivated as either bare-rooted (BR), balled & <b>burlapped</b> (B&B), root-pruned (RP), air-potted (AP) or fabric container (FC) grown were planted at one urban and one rural site in Southern Sweden. The trees were studied during the final nursery year and the four first post-transplant years. The production systems influenced total root length for both species, providing root systems with large differences in appearance. Shoot growth was restored to pre-transplant values for RP, FC and B&B sweet cherry trees at the rural site, three years after transplanting. Water status was significantly higher for AP trees than BR trees of both species, but only during the first year after transplanting, at the rural site. In general, effects of production system were more pronounced at the rural site with the higher water availability, indicating that none of the studied production systems was superior to use in urban plantings. Visual assessments of the establishment success of the trees were affected by leaf size, colour and shape. Leaf size was related to water status. Water status and shoot growth measurements were not correlated during the first years after transplanting. The term establishment can be used in different ways, and the differences might affect the outcome of an establishment assessment...|$|R

40|$|Three oak species (swamp {{white oak}} [Quercus bicolor Willd. ], scarlet oak [Quercus coccinea MÏnchh. ], and bur oak [Quercus macrocarpa Michx. ]) at three caliper sizes (small - 3. 8 cm [1. 5 in], medium - 6. 4 cm [2. 5 in], and large 10. 2 cm [4 in]) were transplanted balled and <b>burlapped</b> in spring within a nursery {{where they were}} {{subject to the same}} {{environmental}} conditions over three growing seasons. Nine treatments (the interaction of all species and size variables) were analyzed to determine the influence caliper size and species had on mortality, canopy dieback, canopy growth and root growth. Caliper size had no influence on post-transplant leaf area for all species, while species influence on post-transplant leaf area was difficult to measure due to leaf morphology differences between these oak species. Shoot growth for all treatments was consistently well below that of the control trees over all three growing seasons, with only one exception. In this study, mortality and canopy dieback data provided better measures of post-transplant performance than canopy growth data. Transplanted trees were considered successful if they not only survived but also thrived (had less than 20 % canopy dieback). All three species transplanted equally well at the small caliper size. Species significantly influenced transplant survival and success rates for both the medium caliper and large caliper treatments. For both of these caliper size treatments swamp white oaks had higher survival and success rates than either other species, {{with the exception of the}} large caliper scarlet oaks that were equal in survival alone to the large caliper swamp white oaks. Additionally, more medium and large caliper scarlet oak transplants survived and thrived than bur oaks at those sizes. Caliper size only significantly influenced post-transplant performance of bur oaks, with smaller caliper trees transplanting with greater survival and success. Although caliper size did not significantly influence post-transplant performance for scarlet oaks and swamp white oaks, both species did trend toward fewer large caliper trees thriving than either other caliper size. This study suggests that the influence of caliper size on post-transplant performance strongly varies between species, even for species within the same genera, due at least in part to root system morphology. The species that had the most fibrous root system, swamp white oak, transplanted with the greatest success and the species with the coarsest root system, bur oaks, transplanted with the least success. There was a strong positive relationship between the number of roots that are cut during the transplanting process and the number of new roots per tree that developed at the ends of those severed roots after transplanting. However, the influence that the number of cut roots had on the number of new roots per tree that were produced differed greatly by species. When the same number of roots per tree were cut, swamp white oaks generally produced more new roots per tree than either other species and scarlet oaks generally produced more new roots than bur oaks...|$|R
