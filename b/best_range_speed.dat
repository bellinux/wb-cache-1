40|$|The {{rotorcraft}} {{industry has}} recently shown a {{new interest in}} compound rotorcraft as a feasible alternative to tackle {{the rapid growth of}} civil aviation activities and associated environmental impact. Indeed, aircraft contribution to the global emissions of CO 2 CO 2, NOxNOx, and noise are driving the development of innovative technologies and vehicles. At present, compound rotorcraft architectures are regarded by the industry as promising platforms that can potentially increase productivity at a reduced environmental cost. In order to quantify the benefits of compound rotorcraft, this paper details the performance analysis of a coaxial counter-rotating rotor configuration with a pusher propeller. A comprehensive approach targeting the assessment of the aforementioned rotorcraft design for civil applications is presented herein. The methodology developed encompasses a rotorcraft flight dynamics simulation module and an engine performance module, coupled with a gaseous emissions prediction tool for environmental impact studies. They have been integrated together to constitute a standalone performance simulation framework and verified with the performance calculations of Harrington's “rotor 1 ” and the Sikorsky X 2 TD. The method is then applied to evaluate the performance of a conceptual coaxial rotorcraft, during a notional inter-city air taxi mission, in terms of cruise altitude, speed, and range, overall mission time and environmental impact. The several trade-offs between these parameters highlight the need for an integrated optimisation process. Besides, the concept demonstrates the benefits of the compound rotorcraft architecture with a <b>best</b> <b>range</b> <b>speed</b> reaching 90 m/s leading to reduced response times and increase of round trips in a given time. As a consequence, operators will need fewer vehicles and heliports to cover the same areas. This outcome is highly attractive in the current growing market...|$|E

40|$|A {{heavy lift}} slowed-rotor tandem {{compound}} helicopter {{was designed as}} a part of the NASA heavy lift rotorcraft systems investigation. The vehicle is required to carry 120 passengers over a range of 1200 nauticalmiles and cruise at 350 knots at an altitude of 30, 000 feet. The basic size of the helicopter was determined by the United States Army Aeroflightdynamics Directorate’s design code RotorCraft. Then performance, loads, and stability analyses were conducted with the Comprehensive Analytical Model of Rotorcraft Aerodynamics and Design II. Blade structural design (blade inertial and structural properties) was carried out using the loading condition from theComprehensive AnalyticalModel of Rotorcraft Aerodynamics andDesign II. A rotor parametric study was conducted to investigate the effects of the twist, collective, tip speed, and taper on aircraft performance. Designs were also developed for alternate missions to explore the influence of the design condition on performance.

40|$|Aerodynamics {{results in}} two {{characteristic}} speeds of flying birds: the minimum power speed and the maximum <b>range</b> <b>speed.</b> The minimum power speed requires the lowest rate of energy expenditure per unit time to stay airborne and the maximum <b>range</b> <b>speed</b> maximizes air distance traveled {{per unit of}} energy consumed. Therefore, if birds aim to minimize the cost of transport under a range of wind conditions, they are predicted to fly at the maximum <b>range</b> <b>speed.</b> Furthermore, take-off is predicted to be strongly affected by wind speed and direction. To investigate the effect of wind conditions on take-off and cruising flight behavior, we equipped 14 European shags Phalacrocorax aristotelis with a back-mounted GPS logger to measure position and hence ground speed, and a neck-mounted accelerometer to record wing beat frequency and strength. Local wind conditions were recorded during the deployment period. Shags always took off into the wind regardless of their intended destination and take-off duration was correlated negatively with wind speed. We combined ground speed and direction during the cruising phase with wind speed and direction to estimate air speed and direction. Whilst ground speed was highly variable, air speed was comparatively stable, although it increased significantly during strong head winds, because of stronger wing beats. The increased air speeds in head winds suggest that birds fly at the maximum <b>range</b> <b>speed,</b> not at the minimum power speed. Our study demonstrates that European shags actively adjust their flight behavior to utilize wind power to minimize the costs of take-off and cruising flight...|$|R

40|$|On the {{preceding}} paper, the authors expressed the DC Motor precise speed control with PLL-IC and {{the stability of}} PLL speed control loop as a sampled data feedback control was emphasized. This paper (2 nd Report) is the research and experimental report on the wide <b>range</b> <b>speed</b> control of DC motor with PLL-IC. On the stereo turn table drive and the most typical motor speed control with PLL-IC, the <b>speed</b> control <b>range</b> is comparatively small, but on industrial services of motor application wide <b>speed</b> control <b>range</b> is generally expected. We have developed a new control system, which enables wide <b>range</b> <b>speed</b> control by applying the parallel reference voltage proportional to the setting speed upon the phase comparator output. In this system, a wide <b>range</b> <b>speed</b> control is roughly operated by the minor speed control loop and only the precise speed control necessitated with motor load torque is executed by the PLL speed control loop. Accordingly we can decrease the PLL gain and improve the stability of PLL speed control loop. Two examples, one has an adjustable frequency devider inside of PLL loop and the other outside of PLL loop, are theoretically and experimentally compared...|$|R

50|$|A special type of bow, {{called a}} bulbous bow, {{is often used}} on large power vessels to reduce wave-making drag.

A bulbous bow must be properly designed to mitigate the wave-making resistance of a particular hull over a particular <b>range</b> of <b>speeds.</b> A bulb that works for one vessel's hull shape and one <b>range</b> of <b>speeds</b> could be detrimental to a different hull shape or a different <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> Proper design and knowledge of a ship's intended operating speeds and conditions is therefore necessary when designing a bulbous bow.|$|R
