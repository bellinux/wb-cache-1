5000|$|Entrance to {{the church}} from the north is through three doorways beneath the portico, each leading into a vestibule. [...] There are arched windows above the outer doorways. A <b>blank</b> <b>panel</b> above the central one was {{intended}} to house a bas-relief depicting Christ's entry into Jerusalem. Hardwick's church was basically rectangular in plan, with two small extensions behind the entrance front, and two wings placed diagonally flanking the far end (the liturgical east), [...] which originally housed private galleries equipped with chairs, tables and fireplaces. Two tiers of galleries, supported on iron columns ran around three sides of the church.

5000|$|DEC {{also offered}} an {{optional}} hard-copy device called an electrolytic copier, which {{fit into the}} <b>blank</b> <b>panel</b> {{on the right side}} of the display. This device was able to print, scan-line by scan-line, an exact replica of the screen onto a damp roll of special paper. It did this by electroplating metal from an electrode into the paper. The paper ran between two electrodes. The electrode on one side was a thin straight bar oriented across the paper width. The electrode on the other side was a thin helical bar wrapped around a rotating drum. One rotation of the drum scanned an intersecting area of the electrodes across the width of the paper. While the copier did an admirable job of capturing the contents of the screen, the output of the copier had an unfortunate resemblance to wet toilet tissue. [...] Digital patented the innovation of having a single character generator provide the text font for both screen and copier.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} has a symmetrical U-shaped plan, and is constructed in brick with stone dressings. It has a hipped roof in grey slate, {{and is in}} two storeys. The main block has five bays, with the entrance bay in the centre; the second and fourth bays are recessed. Between the bays, and on {{the corners of the}} building, are rusticated quoins. The entrance bay leads to a through passage. The entrance is surrounded by a Tuscan-style doorcase with a basket arch. Above it is a niche containing the painted statue of a Blue Coat boy sculpted by Edward Richardson. In the upper storey is a six-pane sash window, above which is a pediment containing a circular clock face. The recessed bays contain a basket-arched 19-pane sash window, and each lateral bay has a doorway with pilasters, above which is a <b>blank</b> <b>panel.</b> Between the storeys is a stone band. Every bay in the upper storey has a sash window similar to that in the central bay. Centrally on top of the block is an octagonal cupola with a copper roof.

Their front faces have basket-arched sash windows, and the north wing has an additional basement window.|$|E
5000|$|Collins {{mixed media}} portraits defy convention, a black flash of oil paint often {{resembling}} a grainy photograph artfully collaged with antique hued book pages, scraps of paper, encaustic or resin, suggesting {{the passage of}} time and personal history. [...] For Collins, each <b>blank</b> <b>panel</b> begins with pages upon pages of dictionary or encyclopedia pages...an overdose of information that reflects the assault on our senses of our modern day world - the notion that you should be taller, richer, younger… and over this noise, Collins lovingly places layer upon layer of newsprint which has been aged outside at her studios by the wind, rain and sun… allowing nature and its layers, to calm the noise. [...] As the layers continue, book covers, reclaimed metal, tools, and other historically relevant items become her “combine.” Pages from the 1800s bring along with them each soul along the journey who has touched those same pages - the touch of generation upon generation become included in her work. The figurative image of the horse is intertwined in approximately half of all works, with the rest becoming brilliant deep abstract colorfields. The final layer is that of a clear resin which Collins moves across her canvasses and panels with a blowtorch while the works lie flat. The brilliant resulting works have been touched by each element: fire; sun; wind; rain; touched by generations of hands; and is so layered as to provide an infinite depth of the viewer; the works both becalm and bedevil simultaneously with names from “Fausto” to “Angel”.

5|$|The English-language Adventures of Tintin {{books were}} {{originally}} published with handwritten lettering created by cartographer Neil Hyslop. 1958's The Crab With the Golden Claws {{was the first}} to be published with Hyslop's lettering. Hyslop was given versions of Hergé's artwork with <b>blank</b> <b>panels.</b> Hyslop would write his English script on a clear cellophane-like material, aiming to fit within the original speech bubble. Occasionally the size of the bubbles would need to be adjusted if the translated text would not fit. In the early 2000s, Tintin's English publishers Egmont discontinued publishing books featuring Hyslop's handwritten lettering, instead publishing books with text created with digital fonts. This change was instigated by publisher Casterman and Hergé's estate managers Moulinsart, who decided to replace localised hand-lettering with a single computerised font for all Tintin titles worldwide.|$|R
40|$|We have {{proposed}} that visual narratives in comics are organized with a hierarchic narrative “grammar. ” Inspired by classic “click ” studies of syntax, we inserted <b>blank</b> “disruption ” <b>panels</b> Before, At, or After the constituent boundaries of comic strips. In self-paced viewing, Experiment 1 found that blanks After the boundary were viewed slower than Before or At the boundary. <b>Panels</b> immediately following <b>blanks</b> were slower than corresponding panels in sequences without <b>blank</b> <b>panels,</b> but only when placed Before or After the boundary. Three ordinal panel positions following the boundary, <b>panels</b> following <b>blanks</b> At the boundary or with No-Blanks were viewed faster than <b>panels</b> following <b>blanks</b> After or Before the boundary. This supports constituency because disruptions had greater impact within, as opposed to between, constituents. Using ERPs, Experiment 2 found a larger anterior negativity to blanks within constituents (Before/After) than between constituents (At). This indicates disruptions of constituents are recognized before reaching a subsequent panel. A larger P 600 appeared to blanks After the boundary than in the first constituent (Before/At). This positivity may reflect a reanalysis reflecting the inability to integrate all prior panels into a single constituent, since they are divided by the constituent boundary...|$|R

40|$|Effective cooling of {{data centers}} {{presents}} a dual challenge: increased cooling power {{to meet the}} ever increasing device heat loads, {{and the need for}} energy efficient cooling. Detailed analysis of the thermal and flow conditions within a data center are necessary for obtaining optimal design and operational parameters. This paper describes the application of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based model in a production data center for improving its operational efficiency. The model used in the present work is based on conjugate heat transfer and fluid flow at data center level. The effect of heat dissipation from racks, and thermal and flow conditions at perforated tiles are bought into the model through boundary conditions. The model is rigorously validated by comparing simulation results with actual measurements. Extensive parametric studies have been performed, and key issues, resulting in mixing and ineffective cooling, have been identified. Several design and operational changes have been recommended in terms of placement of <b>blanking</b> <b>panels,</b> operation of CRAC units, and operating set-points. These recommendations have been implemented at the data center, resulting in energy savings to the tune of 20 %. Further, the model has been used extensively for obtaining guidelines for efficient ramping up of the data center...|$|R
40|$|In The Bowery in two {{inadequate}} descriptive systems (1974 – 75), Martha Rosler bridged {{the concerns}} of art with those of political documentary. The artwork, a series of twenty-one black-and-white photographs, twenty-four text <b>panels</b> and three <b>blank</b> <b>panels,</b> embraces the codes of the photo-text experiments of the period and applies them to the social reality of New York’s Lower East Side. This artwork has {{played a key role}} in debates on contemporary art and aesthetics, but it has not been the object of careful scrutiny or analysis. In this illustrated book, Steve Edwards offers three distinct approaches to the art work. First, he engages in a work of ekphrasis - a careful description of Rosler's The Bowery. Edwards considers both the photographs and the text panels attending to the oddities and overlooked characteristics of the work. Secondly, the author contextualises the project in relation to the work of the San Diego Group, examines the prevailing view of the work as a critique of documentary photography and studies its relation to Jean-Luc Godard and other examples of political modernism. Here he also provides an overview of Rosler's career and the place within her oeuvre of The Bowery. Thirdly, he offers a speculative reading of The Bowery within the pastoral tradition. In the process, this unlikely artwork is positioned in the long tradition of western poetics. The book makes an original contribution to the discussion of contemporary art and political aesthetics through a meticulous study of one art work and an historical reconstruction of the cultural materials from which it was constructed. This study combines careful looking, historical research and draws extensively on critical theory to provide a model for approaching artworks. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Cisco Systems {{data center}} {{efficiency}} study {{is to improve the}} energy efficiency of Lab C in Cisco’s Building 7. The main phases involved are research, energy analysis, CFD simulations, and lab testing. The first part of the project entailed research in the data center field. This included attending two lectures provided by Cisco, visiting the annual Silicon Valley Data Center Energy Efficiency Summit hosted by Network Appliance, going on many data center tours, and taking a 3 -day 6 Sigma CFD training class. Next, the 1 st Law of Thermodynamics was applied to the CRAH (computer room air handler) unit as a preliminary analysis in order to gain insight on the air handler’s performance. Over winter quarter, HVAC equipment performance data was collected in order to develop numerical models for a chiller, CRAH unit, cooling tower, and water pumps using Engineering Equation Solver software. The models calculated the power requirements and efficiencies of this equipment over varying parameters. These parameters include flow rates due to variable frequency drives (VFDs) on the water pumps and CRAH units, chilled water temperature, outdoor air temperature, and lab room temperature. Once the individual equipment models were complete, they were integrated into a single, system level model for optimizing all parameters toward best energy efficiency of the system. Another area of the project was implementing and testing cold aisle containment on a CFD model of Lab C. Containment curtains, <b>blanking</b> <b>panels,</b> and skirts were installed in the virtual model and the resulting temperatures of the lab were compared with the unmodified Lab C.
