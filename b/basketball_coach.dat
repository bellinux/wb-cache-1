40|$|This article {{examines}} the earnings gap {{between male and female}} National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) head <b>basketball</b> <b>coaches.</b> Within women's <b>basketball,</b> female head <b>coaches</b> earn base salaries 9 % higher than males. Estimates from a human capital earnings model suggest that differences in job performance and institution-specific gender segregation explain this earnings gap. The base salaries of women's head <b>basketball</b> <b>coaches</b> of both sexes are also compared to those of men's head <b>basketball</b> <b>coaches.</b> Women's head coaches of either gender earn about 50 % of the base salary of the average men's head coach. The earnings differential between women's and men's <b>basketball</b> <b>coaches</b> is attributable to occupation and not the coach's gender, thus prestige from men's sports, customer discrimination, and the preferences of athletic directors may explain this gap.
