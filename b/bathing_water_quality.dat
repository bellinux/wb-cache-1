40|$|The {{water in}} the Amsterdam canals Prinsengracht and Herengracht {{as well as the}} river Amstel near the Berlagebrug and the IJmeer at the inlet of pumping engine Zeeburg is {{contaminated}} with faeces from human or animal origin. Eight of twelve possible pathogens studied were detected in the water; these are Campylobacter, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, rotavirus, enterovirus, reovirus and norovirus. Microbiological contamination of the {{water in the}} Amsterdam canals can occur through discharge of wastewater from houseboats into the canals, but also through purified or non-purified sewage that enters the canal directly or via the Amstel. People exposed to microbiologically contaminated surface water may develop mild health complaints such as gastroenteritis, skin complaints, and ear and eye complaints, but also more severe conditions like hepatitis. Every year, particularly during the summer, many people enter the Amsterdam canals, voluntarily or not. Others, like occupational divers, are exposed to the canal water while exercising their jobs.

40|$|Abstract: Welcome Bay and Chaguaramas Bay in the {{northwest}} peninsula of Trinidad contain large marinas and smaller sections of bathing beaches. Bacteriological surveys were conducted at both bays to assess <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and to determine potential sources of pollution. These surveys were conducted during the wet season of 1996 and the dry season of 1997. Eleven sample stations were established at Welcome Bay and 12 at Chaguaramas Bay. Freshwater samples were collected from rivers and drains within the survey area. Marine water samples were collected from marinas, bathing beaches and inshore and outer areas at both bays. Five water samples were collected from each sampling station during the wet season of 1996 and six {{during the dry season}} of 1997. The membrane filter technique was used to determine faecal coliform and Escherichia coli levels in all samples. There was a seasonal effect on <b>water</b> <b>quality,</b> with significantly higher faecal coliform levels in the wet season, when <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> was not in compliance with international standards. This represents a potential health risk in <b>bathing</b> areas. <b>Water</b> <b>quality</b> was better at the outer area of both bays. <b>Water</b> <b>quality</b> at the inner bay areas was most likely adversely affected by land-based sources of pollution identified in this study.

40|$|The European Union (EU) has openly {{solicited}} {{advice on}} the development of EU <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> policy and made calls for the development of remotely sensed operational real world solutions. This research demonstrates a new approach to estimating water quality using remote sensing and specifically to monitoring <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> by using remote sensing to "flag" failing areas for manual survey. This method meets the environmental demands of the EU, the tourist industry, the water industry and environmental monitoring agencies throughout the world. The results show the genuine potential for a remotely sensed monitoring system that could, with further research, lead to an efficient and effective method of monitoring <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality.</b> These findings are particularly important given the imminent changes in EU Bathing Water policy, an expected increase in monitoring costs (currently estimated by the EU to be 15 million euros for 2001 (EU, 2002)) and the widespread availability of airborne sensors and satellites. Simultaneous water quality and spectral data were collected at Southend-on-Sea pier with a Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) loaned spectroradiometer and water sampling equipment. Simultaneous data enabled the accurate analysis of the relationship between water quality and reflectance, avoiding the normal delays experienced with flown or satellite data. The thesis successfully proposes and investigates a remotely sensed flagging system for <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> monitoring using both statistical and visual analysis to identify optimum wavelengths which identify threshold levels of E. coli, suspended sediments, low pH, nitrates, chlorophyll, faecal coliform and temperature. The findings demonstrate that remote sensing could be used to monitor several of the water quality parameters that are relevant to the EU Bathing Water Directives and, in particular, the monitoring of effluent in bathing waters through the successful identification of high E. coli counts. Through the creation and integration of a localised water quality model, it demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} predict when water quality parameters exceed a threshold level through direct remote sensing or through the use of remotely sensed indirect water quality parameters. The success rate of remotely sensed "flagging" of samples above a threshold level was tested and used to yield a "predictor" rating for each parameter. Finally, a spectral physical model was constructed that identifies the parameters, wavelengths and secondary parameters that could be used to flag failing water quality areas. This model could be used to improve monitoring coverage and reduce overall costs. The application of the model, which was based on Case 2 coastal water, to other types of coastal area is suggested as needing further research before it could be widely exploited. Remote sensing information could lead to a greater understanding of the coastal environment and offers potential near real time monitoring, allowing for the first time reactive management of coastal water quality in failing water quality areas. This would provide a solution to many of the issues raised by the EU regarding the current <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> directives and provides the remote sensing community with a practical solution to a real world problem...|$|E
40|$|Environmental {{problems}} and {{issues are not}} limited by artificial boundaries created by man. Usually there are different teams or individuals working on the catchments, estuaries, rivers and coastal basins in different countries using different parameters and formulations for various processes. However, the system is a natural one and as such no boundaries exist. When a rain drop of water moves from a catchment to a stream, river or estuary and to the sea, it does not know at any stage whether {{it is in the}} catchment, river, estuary or sea. In recent years there has been growing concern about the impact of diffuse source pollution on river, estuarine and coastal water quality and particularly with regard to non-compliance of bathing waters. Hydro-environmental impact assessment modelling studies are generally regarded as having several fundamental shortcomings in model simulations, which can lead to erroneous environmental impact assessment outcomes. These shortcomings were addressed in this project and included: 1. Applying a Cloud to Coast (C 2 C) approach to modelling flow and solute transport processes in river, estuarine and coastal waters; 2. Improving the computational linking of catchment, river and estuarine-coastal models; 3. Improving the kinetic decay process representation in deterministic models, to include the impacts of salinity, solar irradiance, turbidity and temperature, and; 4. Using parallel (GPU based) computing to enhance the computational speed in executing <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> models. In this research study, the Ribble Estuary and Fylde Coast model was refined to more accurately predict <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and use parameters which give a better representation of the existing physical and bio-chemical processes. A Cloud to Coast (C 2 C) approach to modelling was implemented by using common input parameters and formulations in both the 1 -D and 2 -D domains of the Ribble Estuary and Fylde Coast model. An empirical formulation linking the mortality (decay) rate of bacterial water quality indicators to environmental conditions such as solar irradiation, turbidity, temperature and salinity was added to the numerical code. The linked boundary between the 1 -D and 2 -D domains of the numerical model was improved by removing the large overlapped linked region. An existing numerical code was rewritten {{to take advantage of the}} parallel computing capability of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). This was tested on the Ribble Estuary and the Thames Estuary model. Thames Estuary models of varying mesh density were prepared in this research study using lots of bathymetric data (over 80 million points) and tested on the GPU. This research study improved the ability to predict <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> accurately by introducing more realistic representation of environmental conditions and using parallel computing. This improved the ability to carry real time forecasting of <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and hence prevent failure to meet the requirements of the EU Bathing Water Directive...|$|E
30|$|Although, {{with a more}} or less generalist approach, a {{surveillance}} program is currently in place for marine <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> (DOE, 2006) that lays emphasis on levels of E.coli, oil and grease, total suspended solids and selected heavy metals. Public recreational beaches are however, apparently left out of these surveillance schemes. A recent report highlighted challenges in the management of coastal recreational beaches in Malaysia (Dada et al., 2012). Particularly worrying is the possibility of direct sewage and stormwater discharge into beaches coupled with the apparent absence of early warning systems that inform the public on how safe the beaches are. Also recent review articles on recreational beaches in Malaysia have highlighted potential impacts of tourism activities, shipping, refinery effluent, land reclamation and coastal zone property development on recreational <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> (Dada et al., 2012;Praveena et al., 2011). Every year, an estimated 120 million cases of gastrointestinal illnesses and 50 million cases of respiratory ailments are contracted by bathers in polluted coastal waters (Shuval, 2003).

The European <b>Bathing</b> <b>Water</b> Directive 2006 / 7 /EC which came into place in 2011 sets strict new standards for the classification of <b>bathing</b> <b>waters.</b> Ability to rapidly test microbiological <b>quality</b> of <b>bathing</b> <b>waters</b> is {{a powerful tool for}} meeting <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> standards and guidelines, risk assessment and management systems. Real-time and on-line monitoring are key factors for consideration in current method developments for continuous indicator organism assessment to meet early warning requirements and water safety plans. The aim of this work is to address the need for tests capable of rapid on-site and in-situ assessment of microbiological <b>water</b> <b>quality.</b> To achieve an active management of bathing areas and to reduce the risk associated with the presence of faecal pollution, such tests are essential.

Water quality is of central importance to the tourist industry, since a minimum of water clarity is required to make the water attractive for swimming and bathing. Rampant resort development in Varna Bay in recent years has led to water quality deterioration, because tourist capacity has expanded without concurrent increases in the capacity to collect and treat sewage. We used a numerical model to simulate the Secchi depth (a proxy for <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality)</b> in Varna Bay, {{as a function of the}} loading of nutrients and total suspended solids.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} cultural and economic benefits of bathing waters and the shellfish industry in the UK, water quality in estuarine and coastal waters has attracted considerable public attention in recent years. However, some bathing beaches {{have had to be}} closed on various occasions because the Faecal Indicator Organism (FIO) levels exceeded the minimum mandatory standard. The relationships between faecal bacteria sources in the upstream catchment and the <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> are complex, since multiple processes and driving factors affect the transport and fate of FIOs through the basin. To obtain accurate FIO predictions and better management of bathing water compliance, for a changing environment and more stringent standards, it is necessary to build an integrated modelling system which includes comprehensive dynamic faecal processes from catchments, gullies, pipes, tanks, river networks etc., through to the estuarine and coastal waters. In the paper, details are given of the development of such an integrated numerical model for simulating the transport and dynamic decay processes of FIOs from a catchment region to the coast. The model is used to predict the distribution of FIO concentrations in the bathing waters near Blackpool, {{which is one of the}} most popular bathing resorts in the UK. Furthermore, its <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> is governed by multiple faecal sources in the catchments, with different land uses and some highly urbanised regions. In addition, the FIO transformation processes in the riverine and estuarine waters are driven by: tidal currents, wind induced waves, inflow and faecal discharges, unsteady sediment transport etc., and are included in the integrated model by linking a number of processes within a modified EFDC 2 -D model. The extensive measured and statistical data from the catchments, river networks, CSOs, WwTWs discharges and estuaries have been collected for determining various model parameters, and for calibration and validation of the integrated model.

The “Blue Flag” award which bases its water quality standards upon the guideline E. coli levels of Directive 76 / 160 /EEC, has become the measure of recreational value of bathing areas. Loss of such designations can have significant impacts with respect to local tourist economies. A revised Bathing Water Directive (Directive 2006 / 7 /EC) came into force in 2006 and will supersede the existing 1976 Directive with effect from December 2014. The revised Directive gives stronger focus on the protection of public health, a proactive approach to the management of <b>bathing</b> <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and greater public participation. It establishes stricter microbiological standards for two new parameters, Intestinal Enterococci (I. E.) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The directive introduces a new classification system determined {{on the basis of}} a four-year period instead of the monitoring results from a single bathing season. This will give a balanced rating that allows for the discounting of short-term pollution incidents.

During high flow conditions the sediment re-suspensions processes were dominant, therefore the bed bacteria concentrations played a dominant role on the overall bacteria concentration levels in the water column. In contrast, during low flow conditions sediment deposition prevails and bacteria are removed from the water column. The partition coefficient was found to be more important than the bed bacteria concentrations, during low flow conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} Morecambe´s three {{designated}} bathing waters {{to pass the}} EU Directive on <b>Bathing</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Quality</b> depends {{on the time of}} day when the sample is taken, the indicator organism tested for and whether the test uses the most strict (Guideline) or the least strict (Imperative) criteria. Morning and afternoon sampling for faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci and the pathogen Campylobacter was carried out monthly over the 1996 and 1997 bathing seasons. In the afternoons average faecal coliforms declined by 77 % in 1996 and 87 % in 1997 compared with the mornings, faecal streptococci by 79 % and 83 % and campylobacters by 66 % and 86 %. This decline in bacterial numbers between morning and afternoon was related to variations in water temperature and levels of ultraviolet radiation. All three bathing waters failed the Guideline criteria of the EU Directive on <b>Bathing</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Quality.</b> Using the Imperative criteria, no bathing waters passed in the mornings of either year, some passed in the afternoons of 1996 and all passed in the afternoons of 1997. The increased pass rate in 1997 coincided with improved sewage treatment, high temperatures and increased levels of sunshine. In 1997 sampling by the Environment Agency produced fewer failures than our morning sampling but more than our afternoon sampling. Their sampling was done around midday. It is suggested that where possible all sampling of EU designated bathing waters should be carried out in the early mornin...|$|E
30|$|Another {{approach}} {{that could be}} built based on results of clustering analysis of data obtained from BQM is beach profiling. Unlike the beach zoning previously iterated involving multiple zones per beach, beach water profiling is a general picture involving a classification system for several beaches, in which case, multiple beaches per class or zone. Beach water profiling is increasingly gaining increasing acceptance in some countries. A fundamental objective {{of this approach is}} to allow the citizenry to make an informed choice on which beach to choose for recreational activities. This is done via the annual public disclosure {{in the form of a}} report, the bacteriological quality of available coastal and freshwater <b>bathing</b> <b>waters.</b> Clusters built from data generated from BQM could be aligned with other factors to produce a profiling system that includes a general description of the <b>bathing</b> <b>water,</b> where wastewater outfalls and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) are positioned, potential sources of pollution, management measures, the location of the sampling points and how the beach has performed against bathing quality ratings over the previous months and years. With a beach profiling program in place, beaches could then be classified as good, fair or poor based on pre-defined quality criteria counts. It is noteworthy to assert that relevant agencies in Malaysia have made giant strides in this direction particularly for rivers in Malaysia. <b>Water</b> <b>quality</b> data from the 143 river basins throughout Malaysia are used to determine the <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> status weather in clean, slightly polluted or polluted category and to classify the rivers in Class I, II, III, IV or V based on <b>Water</b> <b>Quality</b> Index (WQI) and Interim National <b>Water</b> <b>Quality</b> Standards (INWQS) for Malaysia every year (Dada et al 2012). It is hoped that a similar classification scheme be developed for recreational beach waters. A further improvement of this approach will involve the designation of beach managers for each beach who will be responsible for putting up signs at each designated <b>bathing</b> <b>waters</b> advising on the beach class, current beach <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> and potential pollution sources.|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} was conducted among athletes to determine the possible health effects of <b>bathing</b> in fresh <b>waters.</b> The study was spread over two summers, during which 827 triathletes (swimmers) in seven quarter triathlons and 773 run-bike-runners (non-swimmers) participated. Detailed questionnaires were used {{to collect data on}} disease occurrence and potential confounding factors, and intensive <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> monitoring was used to assess exposure. Swimmers had a two-fold increased risk of health complaints than non-swimmers in the week after the event. The risk of gastroenteritis increased with the concentrations of thermotolerant coliforms and E. coli in the <b>water.</b> <b>Bathing</b> in <b>waters</b> with thermotolerant coliform concentrations above 100 / 100 ml, relative to <b>bathing</b> in <b>waters</b> with concentrations of 100 / 100 ml or lower was associated with a three to five-fold increased risk of gastroenteritis, dependent on the case-definition that was used. After <b>bathing</b> in <b>waters</b> with concentrations below 100 / 100 ml the risks were comparable with the risks among the non-bathers. A relation with other indicators of <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> was not observed. All bathing locations met the Dutch standards for thermotolerant coliforms {{at the time of the}} triathlon (less than 2000 / 100 ml). The occurrence of a swimming-associated health risk after <b>bathing</b> in <b>waters</b> that meet current <b>water</b> <b>quality</b> standards means that the current standards can not realize the Dutch policy to achieve absence of a health risk from bathing in Dutch surface waters by the year 2010. The standards should be revised if the nature and frequency of the complaints are considered unacceptable...|$|R

The north shore has two bathing areas, a kiosk and toilets as well as a chargeable parking site. The south shore has a bathing area which is only accessible on foot or by bike after a 20 minutes walk (1.6 km) from the Kloster Reutberg monastery, which also has a parking site. In winter, the lake is a popular meeting place for ice skating und curling.|$|R
