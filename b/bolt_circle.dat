25|$|In {{the context}} of road cycling, compact {{drivetrain}} typically refers to double cranksets with a smaller (usually 110mm) <b>bolt</b> <b>circle</b> diameter than the standard 130mm or Campagnolo's 135mm. As of 2006, {{all of the major}} component manufacturers such as Shimano and Campagnolo offer compact cranks in their midrange and high-end product lines. The compact crankset provides a compromise between the standard road double crankset (with 39/52 or 39/53 tooth chainrings) and the road triple (with 30/42/52 or 30/39/53 tooth chainrings). The compact crankset has two chainrings and typical ratios are 34/48, 34/50 and 36/50. This provides nearly the same lower gear ratios as a triple but without the need for a third chainring, a triple front derailleur and a long cage rear derailleur. Both Shimano and Campagnolo recommend and sell front derailleurs specifically designed for compact cranksets, claiming better shifting.|$|E

50|$|An {{indexing}} head, {{also known}} as a dividing head or spiral head, is a specialized tool that allows a workpiece to be circularly indexed; that is, easily and precisely rotated to preset angles or circular divisions. Indexing heads are usually used on the tables of milling machines, but may be used on many other machine tools including drill presses, grinders, and boring machines. Common jobs for a dividing head include machining the flutes of a milling cutter, cutting the teeth of a gear, milling curved slots, or drilling a <b>bolt</b> hole <b>circle</b> around the circumference of a part.|$|R
50|$|All of {{the larger}} {{batteries}} still exist; Battery 214 was a private residence in the 1990s. The former military airfield is now a civilian airfield. The <b>bolt</b> <b>circle</b> for Battery Dynamite is still in place; it is probably the only <b>bolt</b> <b>circle</b> for a 15-inch dynamite gun remaining. Batteries Butterfield, Barlow, and Dutton were a municipal brush dump in the 1990s.

Most of the administrative garrison buildings still exist and have been repurposed.|$|E
5000|$|Axles were Dana 44 {{front and}} 9¼" [...] or 8 1/4" [...] Chrysler {{corporate}} rear. AWD models (1973-1979) were {{equipped with the}} full-time version of the Dana 44 that had no provision for locking hubs and had a front wheel bearing design with a somewhat dubious reputation. In 1980 when the part-time 4WD system was introduced, the front Dana 44 was equipped with a more conventional front wheel bearing design and automatic locking hubs. Late in the 1984 model year the Dana 44 was switched to a CAD (Center Axle Disconnect) version. The CAD Dana 44 was vacuum actuated by a switch on the transfer case and powered by engine vacuum. The CAD Dana 44 was carried on {{until the end of}} Ramcharger production in 1993. The vacuum switch on the transfer case would occasionally fail and either leave the CAD engaged or not engage the CAD at all. Limited slip differentials were available for the 9¼" [...] rear axle. The AWD versions used a 5 on 4½" [...] wheel <b>bolt</b> <b>circle</b> and the part-time 4WD models used a 5 on 5½" [...] <b>bolt</b> <b>circle.</b> Two wheel drive models used the 5 on 4.5" [...] wheel <b>bolt</b> <b>circle</b> and in 1985 changed to the 5 on 5.5" [...] pattern.|$|E

Twice {{he made a}} circuit of the meadow at a wild gallop, with flying serape and loosened rein, and twice returned. The third time his speed increased; the ground seemed to stream from under him; in the distance the limbs of his steed became invisible in their furious action, and, lying low forward on his mustang's neck, man and horse passed like an arrowy <b>bolt</b> around the <b>circle.</b> Then something like a light ring of smoke up-curved from the saddle before him, and, slowly uncoiling itself in mid air, dropped gently {{to the ground as}} he passed. Again, and once again, the shadowy coil sped upward and onward, slowly detaching its snaky rings with a weird deliberation that was in strange contrast to the impetuous onset of the rider, and yet seemed a part of his fury.

5000|$|The NRP {{was founded}} in January 1949 by James Madole through the merger of several earlier American fascist organizations. Its {{headquarters}} were in the Yorkville area of New York City. The NRP was named for a phrase from the Last will and testament of Adolf Hitler, which stated that [...] "I die with a happy heart aware there will spring up...the seed of a radiant renaissance of the National Socialist movement." [...] By 1954, government investigators, although unable to determine the exact size of the party, estimated its membership to be between 200 and 700, [...] although historian John George thought that NRP membership never exceeded 50 at any given time. The group also had an [...] "elite Security Echelon," [...] headed in the 1960s by covertly Jewish United Klans of America leader and Odinist Dan Burros, who killed himself {{on the same day}} in 1965 that his ethnicity was revealed by The New York Times. By 1963 Madole was running the party out of his apartment at 10 West 90th Street.The NRP used a blue lightning bolt within a white circle on a field of red as its symbol.

The G20 series sported an SB 262 4.3L engine, not much was changed mechanically in the vehicles since their release, other than carburetor to a throttle body injection fuel system, and less use of a vacuum system. Currently there are more after market part options available for its V8 counterparts. Not much {{has been done in}} the lines of performance options for the small V6 G20 models, but the reliability remains the same throughout all the G-series models.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{departure}} from the other Y-body cars, lesser but still notable, were the wheels. Both Buick and Oldsmobile had standardized their Y-body cars on an odd 9.5 in brake drum with four lug studs on a 4.5 in-diameter circle (a [...] "four-on-four-and-a-half" [...] bolt pattern), with 14 in wheels, shared by no other GM cars at the time. Pontiac went with a 9 in drum, but used five studs on the same <b>bolt</b> <b>circle</b> ("five-on-four-and-a-half") and 15 in wheels. This was a second configuration shared by no other GM cars but would be identical to the wheels on the Ford Mustang when released some four years later in mid-1964. Perhaps only coincidentally, the Pontiac plant that produced the Tempest's undercarriage was in Los Angeles, {{across the street from}} the Ford plant where the Mustang's was developed.|$|E
5000|$|From 1894 to 1901, the Army {{purchased}} and installed several coastal artillery batteries of 15 inch (381 mm) dynamite guns {{as part of}} the coast defense modernization program initiated by the Endicott Board.

In addition to the guns and their ammunition, the steam boiler, compressor, and other equipment necessary to operate the guns weighed over 200 tons. Among other locations, three guns were installed as Battery Dynamite at Fort Winfield Scott, near the Presidio of San Francisco. In 1904 the batteries were decommissioned, and the guns dismounted and scrapped.

5000|$|Numerous changes {{occurred}} in 1971. First came another new grille design (the [...] "egg crate") for Chevrolet trucks and black paint over {{portions of the}} GMC grille. Second, an additional trim package was introduced: the Cheyenne. On GMC models, this {{was referred to as}} the Sierra. These packages consisted mostly of comfort features — nicer interiors, more padding and insulation, carpet, chrome trim, and upper and lower side molding and tailgate trim. 1971 was the first year for AM/FM radios factory installed. Finally, the front brakes on all light-duty trucks were switched from drum brakes to disc brakes, resulting in much less brake fade under heavy use. While prior C/K half-ton trucks had used a six-lug bolt pattern (6 x 5.5") for the wheels, two-wheel-drive models switched to a five-lug pattern (5 x 5-inch <b>bolt</b> <b>circle)</b> common to Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac, and Cadillac passenger cars. The 1/2 ton 4 x 4 retained the 6 lug bolt pattern. This bolt pattern would remain the standard {{through the end of the}} C/K series (along with the Chevrolet/GMC vans).

5000|$|Many of the {{garrison}} buildings of Fort H. G.

The 16-inch Battery 111 is in Navy hands but can be viewed externally. The 6-inch Battery 214 is part of a private residence. Battery 215 remains at the west end of the island, and nearby is the <b>bolt</b> <b>circle</b> for the 15-inch dynamite gun, the only intact emplacement of its type. Fort Michie and its unique 16-inch disappearing emplacement are well preserved, but the island is owned by the American Museum of Natural History to study migratory terns, and can only be visited by prior arrangement. Much of Fort Terry was reused by the Animal Disease Center and the batteries remain intact, but Plum Island's future is uncertain and it currently requires prior arrangement to visit. Fort Tyler was used as a bombing range in World War II; its island {{is little more than a}} sandbar and has shifted, thus severely damaging the fort. Camp Hero is well preserved with several fire control towers, some disguised as seaside cottages. The 16-inch batteries can be viewed externally.

50|$|Early Sevilles {{produced}} between April 1975 (a {{total of}} 16,355) to {{the close of}} the 1976 model year were the first Cadillacs to use the smaller GM wheel bolt pattern (5 lugs with a 4.75 in bolt circle; the 2003-2009 XLR also uses this pattern). The first Sevilles shared only a strict minority of components with the engineering starting point, the GM X-Body. The rear drums measured 11 in and were similar to the ones used with the Nova 9C1 (police option) and A-body (Chevelle, Cutlass, Regal, LeMans) intermediate station wagons. Starting with the 1977 model year, production Sevilles used the larger 5 lug — 5 inch <b>bolt</b> <b>circle</b> common to full-size Chevrolet passenger cars (1971-76), Cadillacs, Buicks, Oldsmobiles, Pontiacs, and 1/2 ton Chevrolet/GMC light trucks and vans. It also received rear disc brakes, a design which would surface a year later as an option on the F-body Pontiac Trans Am. 1975-76 models had a mandatory vinyl top {{due to the fact that}} the roof section was originally tooled up in two parts; the rear section around the C-pillar was pressed especially for Cadillac, and a regular X-body sedan roof pressing was used for the forward parts. Due to customer demand, a painted steel roof was offered beginning in 1977, which required a new full roof stamping. 1977 Seville production increased slightly to 45,060 vehicles. The following year, production increased to 56,985 cars and ended up being the peak production year for the first generation Seville.|$|E
