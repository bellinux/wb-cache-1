5|$|Among the German claimants was Helmut Lent who was {{credited}} with two victories. After landing at Jever from a patrol, Lent took off to intercept. He engaged Herbie Ruse's Wellington, killing most of the crew. The Wellington was pouring black smoke, and Lent broke off believing it about to crash. Lent then pursued Officer Thompson's Wellington, which crashed just {{off the coast of}} Borkum. Lent's third claim was not granted: he attacked and downed Flying Officer Wimberley's aircraft, but because the aircraft was already badly damaged and judged to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> crash, Lent was refused the victory. Instead, Stab./JG 1's Geschwaderkommodore Schumacher was given the credit. Schumacher also shot down Pilot Officer Lewis's aircraft, close to Borkum. At 13:45, the German fighters—at the limit of their endurance—returned to base. By 14:05, the other bomber formation was beyond interception range and the last shots were fired.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} {{began with a}} speedy Cardiff attack. Corinthian countered, {{resulting}} in shots from both Claude and Gilbert Ashton within 15 seconds of each other. Another Cardiff attack resulted in Ferguson missing the goal from a few feet out once again. After four minutes in the second half, Corinthians attacked once more. Fred Ewer played it down the left wing to Kenneth Hegan, who passed it into the centre towards Gilbert Ashton, who fired it past Farquharson. Shortly after the restart, Billy Thirlaway appeared to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> score a certain goal for Cardiff, but was charged down by Russell. Further chances came in rapid succession; for Cardiff, Ferguson struck the crossbar with one shot; then for Corinthian, Claude Ashton passed forward to Jenkins, who struck it wide of an open goal mouth. Hegan sent the ball over the bar, and then a further shot by Claude Ashton was charged down.|$|E

25|$|As Gacy {{drove to}} various {{locations}} that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The {{purpose of the}} warrant was specifically {{to search for the}} body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.|$|E
25|$|Intermediates are {{workers with}} fully {{developed}} ovaries. These wasps are non-inseminated laying females, {{and they are}} present throughout the entire colony cycle. Intermediates lay eggs, but the eggs are eaten either by themselves or by other colony members. It is possible that non-inseminated laying females are always present {{in order to provide}} extra energy in the colony. Their eggs may be used for trophic purposes, since male production is controlled entirely by queens. This oophagy (egg eating behavior) can provide additional sustenance for the colony. Inseminated workers are typically older and are likely to have been potential queens at colony initiation. Therefore, non-inseminated egg layers are young and seem to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> swarm. In a study on P. exigua foraging activity, a higher proportion of workers than intermediates were observed in all the colonies. Their study observed 12 colonies in Bom Jesus da Lapa, Bahia, Brazil.|$|E

Testing at the Monza circuit in early September had indicated that the performance gap between McLaren and Ferrari had narrowed. Despite this, Ferrari were hoping that their straight-line speed would be better suited to Monza's long straights.

500|$|Upon recommissioning, Lord Warden was {{assigned}} to the First Reserve, where she served as a guardship in the Firth of Forth. In this role, she went on annual summer cruises to various ports.

500|$|When the europium-doped yttrium {{orthovanadate}} red phosphor {{was discovered}} in the early 1960s, and understood to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> cause {{a revolution in the}} color television industry, there was a scramble for the limited supply of europium on hand among the monazite processors, as the typical europium content in monazite is about 0.05%. However, the Molycorp bastnäsite deposit at the Mountain Pass rare earth mine, California, whose lanthanides had an unusually high europium content of 0.1%, was about to come on-line and provide sufficient europium to sustain the industry. Prior to europium, the color-TV red phosphor was very weak, and the other phosphor colors had to be muted, to maintain color balance. With the brilliant red europium phosphor, it was no longer necessary to mute the other colors, and a much brighter color TV picture was the result. Europium has continued to be in use in the TV industry ever since as well as in computer monitors. Californian bastnäsite now faces stiff competition from Bayan Obo, China, with an even [...] "richer" [...] europium content of 0.2%.|$|E

500|$|The rapid {{evolution}} of warship design, for which Warrior was partly responsible, {{meant that she}} started to become obsolete only ten years after she had been launched. In 1871 the Royal Navy commissioned its first mastless capital ship, [...] In the absence of masts, the main armament could move from the broadside and traverse more freely from a higher position. In the same year, Warrior began a refit that lasted until 1875; it added a poop deck and steam capstan, a shorter bowsprit, and replacement boilers. In April 1875, the ship was recommissioned, and assigned to the First Reserve, where she served as a guardship at Portland. In this role, she went on annual summer cruises to various ports. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, she was mobilised due to concerns that the victorious Russians might <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> attack Constantinople, forcing Great Britain to intervene, but nothing transpired and Warrior cruised to Bantry Bay instead. In April 1881 she {{was transferred to the}} Clyde District, where she served as guardship until 31 May 1883. Two of her masts were discovered to be rotten that month and with no replacements available, the ship was decommissioned and the masts removed.|$|E

Anderson asserted that it's not far-fetched to say that online video will dramatically accelerate scientific advance, and that video contributors may <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> launch [...] "the biggest learning cycle in human history." [...] In education, for example, the Khan Academy grew from YouTube video tutoring sessions for founder Salman Khan's cousin into what Forbes Michael Noer called [...] "the largest school in the world", with technology poised to disrupt how people learn. YouTube was awarded a 2008 George Foster Peabody Award, the website being described as a Speakers' Corner that [...] "both embodies and promotes democracy." [...] The Washington Post reported that a disproportionate share of YouTube's most subscribed channels feature minorities, contrasting with mainstream television in which the stars are largely white. A Pew Research Center study reported the development of [...] "visual journalism", in which citizen eyewitnesses and established news organizations share in content creation.

500|$|Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (especially on his two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen on his work more generally ( [...] ; [...] ). Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the [...] "technical and speculative innovations" [...] of Klavierstücke I–IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter , they nevertheless produced a [...] "sharp emotion, {{the result of a}} beneficial shock engendered by their boldness" [...] and provided [...] "an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations" [...] While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how it always seemed to <b>be</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. [...] With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, {{it seems to me that}} the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time[...] [...] [...] I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. [...] In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that [...] "Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course" [...] and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carré, Klavierstück X, Inori, and Jubiläum [...]|$|E
