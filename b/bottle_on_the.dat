Claire and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) give it to Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Jin's wife, and she opts to bury the <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> beach. In the hatch, Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking {{what appears to be}} a corridor to another section of the bunker. They discover that the barrier is very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E

It was claimed that he routinely drank luxury red wine (at a cost of around $1,200 USD per <b>bottle)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> public expense account. Furthermore, the wine was bought at a local restaurant in which Brixtofte was a shareholder. Municipal employees reported that the charismatic mayor had over years shown increasing signs of alcoholism and established an autocratic, timid climate at the town hall.

They appeared on The Cafe on 16 October 2008. The Prodigy personally invited the band to support them on their sold-out arena tour of the UK; all of the members are fans of Fight Like Apes and Liam Howlett entered their dressing room to give his regards. Sony Music Entertainment Japan signed the band for the Asian release of Fight Like Apes and the Mystery of the Golden Medallion. They headlined the Levi's One to Watch Tour in November 2008.

500|$|With Lisa {{now facing}} a long jail sentence, Marge decides {{to help her}} out. She starts reading Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and becomes {{addicted}} to it. When the trial resumes, Marge tells Lisa that she now knows a way that she can help her. While Ned is being cross-examined by Clarice, Marge gives Homer a cold beer. Homer, ecstatic at getting a beer, tries to open it unsuccessfully. The more he tries, the more primitive he gets, hooting and banging the <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench, disrupting the trial. Finally, Ned loses his cool and refers to Homer as a [...] "big monkey-faced gorilla." [...] Clarice then asks Ned to compare {{the picture of the}} [...] "missing link" [...] and Homer shaking the beer over his head, and asks if he truthfully believes Homer cannot be related to apes. Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. Lisa kindly tells Ned that she fully respects religious beliefs, but she just does not think it is proper for the church to dominate the school, the same way that Mr. Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy do not want scientists taking over the church. Ned agrees and offers to take Lisa and his kids out for ice cream.|$|E

[...] Steve Peace co-wrote and produced the 1988 film Return of the Killer Tomatoes; Condit appeared as unbilled, unspeaking pizzeria patron during a fight sequence wearing a trucker cap who smashes a <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head of a cowboy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fundamental}} {{distinction between}} real and other ales {{is that the}} yeast is still present and living in the container from which the real ale is served, although it will have settled {{to the bottom and}} is usually not poured into the glass. Because the yeast is still alive, a slow process of fermentation continues in the cask or <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way to the consumer, allowing the beer to retain its freshness. Another distinction is that real ale should be served without the aid of added carbon dioxide, or [...] "top pressure" [...] as it is commonly known. Common dispensing methods are the handpump, or [...] "by gravity" [...] direct from the cask. Electric pumps are occasionally seen, especially in the Midlands and Scotland.|$|E
2500|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions were}} infamously chaotic, and involved the studio owner reportedly calling Century Media {{to ask if}} the band was mentally unstable, and threatening to kick them out. This particular incident occurred after Mike Williams had attempted to record the sound of smashing glass for {{the introduction to the}} album, by smashing a <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor of the studio. In the process, he slashed open his hand and bled all over the studio floor; this recording did make it to the record as the introduction to the first track, [...] "My Name Is God (I Hate You)." [...] One of the band members then apparently smeared the words [...] "Hell" [...] and [...] "Death to Pigs" [...] in Williams' blood.|$|E
2500|$|Several of {{the other}} {{locations}} were filmed in and around Pemberton Valley. Key scenes were also filmed in Riverlands. The interior of Scully's home was a set in Burnaby, outside of Vancouver. The set was an old roller rink or at least sounded like one, as it was very noisy. During filming, Carter placed a carrot juice <b>bottle</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table of the set, having just finished the drink, as {{he thought it would}} be [...] "a nice sort of Mulder touch." [...] Some of the artwork in Mulder's office came from a friend of Carter's who had a gallery in Vancouver and was named Monica Reyes, a name that had previously been used in her honor for a character who features in a recurring role in the series' eighth season and appears as a main character in every episode of the series' ninth season. One of the pictures on the wall of Mulder's office was by Douglas Coupland, who was featured in the real Monica Reyes' gallery and had written a book Carter liked which was called Hey Nostradamus!, so Carter stuck a Post-It on which he wrote the book's title onto the picture.|$|E
