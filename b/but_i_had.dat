5|$|McDowell's {{statement}} of admission {{was published in}} David McKittrick's book Lost Lives:"There was very little planning. I only came into it because of my UDR connection {{and the fact that}} I had a uniform. I was given a sub-machine gun <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never fired it. I passed out when the explosion happened and that was when I lost the gun, the glasses, and a UDR beret".|$|E

25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I regret to say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E

25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I never had anything to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
500|$|I did not weep, and it pained me that I {{could not}} weep. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no more tears. And, {{in the depths}} of my being, in the {{recesses}} of my weakened conscience, could I have searched for it, I might perhaps have found something like–free at last! ...|$|E

It's {{not that they}} are not my children, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> them because I wanted him to be a father. People make remarks, 'I can't believe she left her children.' Left them? I left my children? I did not leave my children. My children are with their father, where they are supposed to be. I didn't do it to be a mother... If he called me tonight and said let's have five more , I'd do it in a heartbeat." ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> am a great sinner, sayest thou. [...] "I will in no wise cast out," [...] says Christ. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> am an old sinner, sayest thou. [...] "I will in no wise cast out," [...] says Christ. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> am a hard-hearted sinner, sayest thou. [...] "I will in no wise cast out," [...] says Christ. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> am a backsliding sinner, sayest thou. [...] "I will in no wise cast out," [...] says Christ. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> served Satan all my days, sayest thou. [...] "I will in no wise cast out," [...] says Christ. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sinned against light, sayest thou. [...] "I will in no wise cast out," [...] says Christ. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sinned against mercy, sayest thou.

500|$|In 1905, Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber {{engraved}} the obverse of Roosevelt's inauguration medal, {{while his}} assistant, George T. Morgan, engraved the reverse. [...] Roosevelt disliked the work, and engaged Saint-Gaudens to design an unofficial medal commemorating the inauguration. [...] Saint-Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber {{on the question}} of the new coinage; he wrote to his brother, Louis Saint-Gaudens, [...] "Barber is a S.O.A.B. [...] <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a talk with the President who ordered Secretary Shaw in my presence to cut Barber's head off if he didn't do our bidding".|$|E
500|$|Moore {{commented on}} the writing process: [...] "The theme I {{had to deal with}} in Inchon was too big for a movie that was less than two hours. When Toho was {{originally}} involved, they wanted a love story between an American boy and a Korean girl. My technique is to research and then fictionalize, a technique I used successfully in French Connection. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to fictionalize the real landing at Inchon, making it seem that a lighthouse was a pivotal factor when in fact it wasn't. I couldn't do that, which is why other writers were brought in." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Like most people, I {{had heard}} of Gandhi, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was {{particularly}} moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see {{for the first time}} its potency in the area of social reform." ...|$|E

500|$|Eddie Condon, Hoagy Carmichael, and Mezz Mezzrow, {{all of whom}} hyperbolically {{raved about}} his playing, also saw Beiderbecke play live or {{performed}} alongside him. Condon, for instance, wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke's piano playing: [...] "All my life I had been listening to music [...] <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never heard anything remotely like what Beiderbecke played. For the first time I realized music isn't all the same, it had become an entirely new set of sounds" [...] "I tried to explain Bix to the gang," [...] Carmichael wrote, but [...] "t was no good, like the telling of a vivid, personal dream [...] the emotion couldn't be transmitted." ...|$|E
500|$|Blender asked Bowie in 2002 {{whether he}} still {{believed}} his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, [...] "I don't {{think it was}} a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people." [...] Bowie said {{he wanted to be a}} songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in [...] "puritanical" [...] America, [...] "I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do".|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{assumed the}} role of {{unofficial}} [...] "protector" [...] for her husband after the attempted assassination in 1981. On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by troubled 25-year old John Hinckley, Jr as they left the Washington Hilton hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized. She recalled having seen [...] "emergency rooms before, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never seen one like this – with my husband in it." [...] She was escorted into a waiting room, and when granted access to see her husband, he quipped to her, [...] "Honey, I forgot to duck", borrowing the defeated boxer Jack Dempsey's jest to his wife.|$|E

500|$|Smith's {{first film}} role came in Heaven Help Us (1985). She then played Putter in The Legend of Billie Jean (also 1985). The film was a box office bomb and {{critically}} panned, although Smith [...] "thought {{it would be}} the movie that launched my career. And then it was out at the box office about 10 days before it died." [...] When filming was over, she rejoined The Real Thing before being out of work for six months. Smith worried her career was over. However, the following year, she played Connie in Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive (1986), noting it was [...] "truly a dreadful film, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a great part in it." ...|$|E
500|$|Del Potro's {{first half}} of the season was {{hampered}} by injuries and a change of coach, starting with a first-round loss in Adelaide, where he was the seventh seed. He then made it to {{the second round of the}} Australian Open in January, only to retire against David Ferrer due to an injury. Del Potro returned to the circuit in March, winning his first match against Jesse Levine at the Sony Ericsson Open, before losing in the second round to López. Struggling with injuries, his ranking fell as low as no. 81 in April. [...] "At the start of the year, I was playing good, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> many injuries, many problems with my body, with my physique", said del Potro. [...] "I changed my coach, changed my physical trainer, I changed everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Power was {{released}} in the United States on September 13, 1988, through Sire on vinyl, compact disc, and cassette. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 on October 1, 1988, at number 102. Power stayed on this chart for 33 weeks and peaked at number 35 on November 12, 1988. While touring to support Power, Ice-T visited schools as a mentor [...] "telling the students of his shady past and profitable present". By January 1989, Power had sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States and went gold. A profanity-free version of the record was never released. Ice-T compared this {{to the release of}} N.W.A.'s album, stating that he felt releasing a clean album was [...] "selling out" [...] and that [...] "N.W.A. made more money because of it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my integrity." ...|$|E

500|$|Hackworth said [...] "it was {{neck and}} neck, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{absolute}} belief {{we could do}} it". [...] Four-time Olympic gold medallist Matthew Pinsent said of the race [...] "it truly was amazing". [...] Cambridge coach Robin Williams was generous in defeat: [...] "Credit to Oxford. They did an awesome job and took their chance. It was a fantastic race", while Oxford's coach Sean Bowden said [...] "I believed {{that if we could}} get through Barnes Bridge well we could still do it. [...] They were rowing so well and I knew how much they wanted it." [...] Simon Barnes of The Times noted that [...] "Cambridge reeled in an early Oxford lead and went ahead themselves ... that should {{have been the end of}} it... But this Oxford crew just kept pestering away ... and, with the finish in sight, Cambridge ... yielded." ...|$|E
500|$|Anti-German {{sentiment}} rose {{among the}} British public, in newspapers, and in elite gentlemen's clubs, where resentment was inflamed by Admiral Lord Charles Beresford despite Churchill's remonstrances. Driven by public opinion, Churchill asked Prince Louis to resign as First Sea Lord on 27 October 1914. When acceptance of Battenberg's resignation was delayed by the King's {{opposition to the}} appointment of Fisher in his place, Louis wrote to Churchill, [...] "I beg of you to release me. I am {{on the verge of}} breaking down & I cannot use my brain for anything". On 13 November he wrote to Churchill's Naval Secretary, Rear-Admiral Horace Hood, [...] "It was an awful wrench, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no choice from the moment it was made clear to me that the Government did not feel themselves strong enough to support me by some public pronouncement." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 30, Chandler brought Hendrix to the London Polytechnic at Regent Street, where Cream was {{scheduled}} to perform, and where Hendrix and Eric Clapton met. Clapton later commented: [...] "He {{asked if he could}} play a couple of numbers. I said, 'Of course', <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a funny feeling about him." [...] Halfway through Cream's set, Hendrix took the stage and performed a frantic version of the Howlin' Wolf song [...] "Killing Floor". In 1989, Clapton described the performance: [...] "He played just about every style you could think of, and not in a flashy way. I mean he did a few of his tricks, like playing with his teeth and behind his back, but it wasn't in an upstaging sense at all, and that was it... He walked off, and my life was never the same again".|$|E
