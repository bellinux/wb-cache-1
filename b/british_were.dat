5|$|In April 1956, Marshall led a {{delegation}} to London to negotiate for complete self-rule in the Merdeka Talks, but the talks failed when the <b>British</b> <b>were</b> {{reluctant to give}} up control over Singapore's internal security. The <b>British</b> <b>were</b> concerned about communist influence and labour strikes which were undermining Singapore's economic stability, and felt that the local government was ineffective in handling earlier riots.

Both the Gratiot and Cerre families intermarried with the Chouteau family to create a Creole-dominated society in the 1780s and 1790s. The families also had marital ties to Spanish government officials, including the lieutenant governors Piernas and Cruzat.|$|E

5|$|Eyre and {{the crew}} were landed and marched to Antibes, where they were imprisoned with the crew of a Sardinian frigate that had been {{captured}} the day before Speedy. The crew had been imprisoned on Martin's flagship Sans Culotte and had been severely treated, with their captain, Ross, not being allowed to wash or shave. The <b>British</b> <b>were</b> placed in a dungeon at Antibes, with only straw to lie on, awaiting {{the decision of the}} authorities. After three weeks in this state, they were marched to Aix-en-Provence and were confined in the prison there. After a month imprisoned in Aix, Maximilien Robespierre fell and the Reign of Terror came to an end. The <b>British</b> <b>were</b> paroled. Eyre and the officers were taken to Romans, in Dauphiné where Eyre remained until May 1795 when he was released in exchange for a French officer. He faced a court-martial for the loss of Speedy, but was honourably acquitted.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, a British {{expeditionary force}} invaded Buenos Aires.

Rosas was then assigned to the Caballería de los Migueletes (a militia cavalry), although he was probably barred from active duty during this time due to illness.|$|E

5|$|The column {{had yet to}} {{run into}} any American troops when they reached Howard's Tavern (also known as Howard's Half-Way House), {{just a few hundred}} yards from the Jamaica Pass. Tavern keeper William Howard and his son William Jr. were forced to act as guides to show the British the way to the Rockaway Foot Path, an old Indian trail that skirted the Jamaica Pass to the west (located today in the Cemetery of the Evergreens). Five minutes after leaving the tavern, the five American militia {{officers}} stationed at the pass were captured without a shot fired, as they thought that the <b>British</b> <b>were</b> Americans. Clinton interrogated the men and they informed him that they were the only troops guarding the pass. By dawn, the <b>British</b> <b>were</b> through the pass and stopped so that the troops could rest. At 09:00, they fired two heavy cannons to signal the Hessian troops below Battle Pass to begin their frontal assault against Sullivan's men deployed on the two hills flanking the pass, while Clinton's troops simultaneously flanked the American positions from the east.|$|E

5|$|A two-day long {{bombardment}} of Flushing forced its capitulation on 15 August. Ratified the following day, {{it left the}} British in control of Walcheren which they garrisoned with 10,000 troops. Schouwen and Duiveland on the Eastern branch of the Scheldt, were occupied peacefully on 17 August. The French fleet had already withdrawn to Antwerp however, having been informed on 29 July when the <b>British</b> <b>were</b> still at sea. Between the British and their objective were now more than 35,000 French soldiers, garrisoned in heavily armed forts at Lillo, Liefkenshoech, and Antwerp. The deliberate destruction of dykes by the French had led to widespread flooding, and with disease spreading through the British army, {{it was decided to}} abandon the expedition in early September.|$|E
5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support.

The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could not be seen as supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence.
