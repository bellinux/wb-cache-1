2500|$|André Muller Weitzenhoffer—a {{friend and}} peer of Milton Erickson—wrote, [...] "Has NLP really {{abstracted}} and explicated {{the essence of}} successful therapy and provided everyone with the means to be another Whittaker, Virginia Satir, or Erickson?... failure {{to do this is}} evident <b>because</b> <b>today</b> there is no multitude of their equals, not even another Whittaker, Virginia Satir, or Erickson. Ten years should have been sufficient time for this to happen. In this light, I cannot take NLP seriously... contributions to our understanding and use of Ericksonian techniques are equally dubious. Patterns I and II are poorly written works that were an overambitious, pretentious effort to reduce hypnotism to a magic of words." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Because,</b> <b>today,</b> {{locomotives}} {{no longer}} {{tend to have}} separate driving and carrying axles (see wheel arrangement), as was formerly common with steam locomotives, but usually have bogies where all axles are driven, the term running gear is (inaccurately) superseding the term 'driving gear' {{in some parts of}} the world.|$|E

40|$|The Federal Government's {{industrial}} relations proposals {{may reduce the}} unemployment rate slightly, although recent American research into minimum wage changes shows this to be doubtful. They will certainly have unpleasant consequences. One of {{the claims of the}} reform advocates is that productivity will improve. Yet, since innovation will be discouraged by the changes, these supposed productivity gains will prove illusory. Most Australians are better off today than we were 20, 50 or 100 years ago, not because we can buy more, but it is the new and improved products that make our lives better. We don't watch three black-and-white TV sets just because we could afford to; we watch a colour one.

30|$|An {{important}} {{limitation of}} this work is that the NLSY 79 contains only one cohort and how well findings generalize to the broader population is unclear. In particular, female labor force participation rates have increased substantially since the NLSY 79 sample left school. <b>Because</b> <b>today’s</b> women may “look” more like NLSY 79 men than NLSY 79 women, we might expect that they will experience similar health insurance effects as I identify for NLSY 79 men.|$|R

Nevertheless, the tactic of intimidating the batsman is still used to an extent that would have been shocking in 1933, although it is less dangerous now <b>because</b> <b>today's</b> players wear helmets and generally far more protective gear.

50|$|Digital immigrants, {{although}} they {{adapt to the}} same technology as natives, possess a sort of accent which restricts them from communicating the way natives do. In fact, research shows that, due to the brain's malleable nature, technology has changed the way today's students read, perceive, and process information. This means that today's educators may struggle to find effective teaching methods for digital natives. Digital immigrants might resist teaching digital literacy because they themselves were not taught that way. Marc Prensky believes {{this is a problem}} <b>because</b> <b>today's</b> students speak a new language that educators do not understand.|$|R
