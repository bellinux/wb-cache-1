50|$|A Public inquiry was convened to {{investigate}} the accident, during which it emerged that the airport's approach lighting system may have been switched off {{at the time of}} the aircraft's landing attempt. The inquiry also heard evidence regarding a <b>bent</b> <b>screwdriver</b> that had been found in the wreckage, but as this had been removed by an airport worker before its position in the wreckage had been recorded, the likelihood of the object jamming the flight controls could not be assessed. At the conclusion of the inquiry, while it made recommendations regarding the security of aircraft crash sites and tool control during maintenance, and suggested that records be kept of when airport approach lighting was switched on or off, no official cause of the accident was determined.|$|E
