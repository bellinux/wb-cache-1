Timestamp: 03 : 59 - 05 : 10. Due to feasibility issues and musical preferences, Web audio applications have tended to emphasize the use of synthesized instruments and short samples (e. g., drums) over large <b>banks</b> <b>of</b> longer <b>files</b> that sample other acoustic instruments such as a violin or piano. As the sounds generated by sampled acoustic instruments are quite realistic, {{they are likely to be}} of interest to many users of Web audio applications. Using the Tone. js Web Audio framework, this paper describes an initial investigation into load times when rendering music with such sampled instruments. A method is proposed for reducing load times, and hence optimizing Web Audio playback, based on empirical analysis of the note durations used across different music corpora. Experimental results for 400 randomly selected short music excerpts indicate that the proposed method does lead to significant load time reductions, from 3 : 87 s to 1 : 72 s.

500|$|A {{week after}} the audit results were released, Kentucky's Executive Branch Ethics Commission {{reported}} that Farmer was the only constitutional officer who had failed to file a required disclosure of his 2011 finances by the required April 16 deadline. Farmer's attorney said the omission was [...] "simply a matter of oversight on Richie's part given with [...] what all has been going on." [...] Days later, First National <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Manchester <b>filed</b> a foreclosure suit against Farmer, alleging that no payments had been made on his $300,000 home mortgage since January 2012.

Earlier that week, a judge denied Farmer's request to reduce his child support payments, which were based on his salary as agriculture commissioner. Farmer, {{who had not been}} employed since leaving office in January 2012, told the court that the investigation into his tenure as agriculture commissioner had made it difficult to find employment. The judge found that Farmer was [...] "voluntarily underemployed", although he suspended the child support payments for the months of September and October 2012 in light of Farmer's recovery from an August 30 hip replacement surgery.
