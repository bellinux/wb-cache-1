All {{these groups}} are {{separated}} by distinctions clear and bold--and many of them by that broadest of all distinctions which lies between disorganization and consistency--accumulation and adaptation, experiment and design;--yet to all one or two principles are common, which again divide the whole series {{from that of the}} Transalpine Gothic--and whose importance Lord Lindsay too lightly passes over in the general description, couched in somewhat ungraceful terms, [...] "the vertical principle snubbed, as it were, by the horizontal." [...] We have already alluded to the great school of color which arose in the immediate neighborhood of the Genoa serpentine. The accessibility of marble throughout North Italy similarly modified the aim of all design, by the admission of undecorated surfaces. A blank space of freestone wall is always uninteresting, and sometimes offensive; there is no suggestion of preciousness in its dull color, and the stains and rents of time upon it are dark, coarse, and gloomy. But a marble surface receives in its age hues of continually increasing glow and grandeur; its stains are never foul nor dim; its undecomposing surface preserves a soft, fruit-like polish forever, slowly flushed by the maturing suns of centuries. Hence, while in the Northern Gothic the effort of the architect was always so to diffuse his ornament as to prevent the eye from permanently resting on the <b>blank</b> <b>material,</b> the Italian fearlessly left fallow large fields of uncarved surface, and concentrated the labor of the chisel on detached portions, in which the eye, being rather directed to them by their isolation than attracted by their salience, required perfect finish and pure design rather than force of shade or breadth of parts; and further, the intensity of Italian sunshine articulated by perfect gradations, and defined by sharp shadows at the edge, such inner anatomy and minuteness of outline as would have been utterly vain and valueless under the gloom of a northern sky; while again the fineness of material both admitted of, and allured to, the precision of execution which the climate was calculated to exhibit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the deep-drawing process, the {{application}} of low-frequency vibration to the <b>blank</b> <b>material</b> has recently been focused on {{with the aim of}} improving the friction performance between the die and the <b>blank</b> <b>material.</b> A servo-controlled press machine is suitable for applying low-frequency vibration to the blank during the deep-drawing process, because the punch speed and blank holder force (BHF) are easily controlled as process parameters by using the servo motors. In this study, a BHF with low-frequency vibration was proposed as a technique for improving deep-drawability, which is mainly affected by the friction performance and the lubricant condition. We found that the friction performance between the blank surface and the blank holder was decreased {{in the case of a}} BHF with low-frequency vibration since the lubricating oil rapidly flowed into the clearance during the forming process. Furthermore, for a BHF with low-frequency vibration, the punch force and the deformation resistance were lower than those in a deep-drawing test without low-frequency vibration...|$|E

40|$|Organic {{contamination}} of sedimentary rocks can produce artefacts {{in studies of}} hydrocarbon composition, and this can have significant negative consequences for interpretations of the geobiological record. False positives - that is cases of non-syngenetic hydrocarbon biomarkers - are common in Precambrian studies, and significant challenges persist despite the intensive effort devoted to these studies. Efforts to standardize the 'burden of proof' for distinguishing between contamination and syngenetic material have to date failed to yield a simple or universal protocol, yet the need remains great, as both bitumen-lean rocks and bitumen-rich samples can be vulnerable to the accumulation of false-positive signals. In an effort {{to determine the best}} approach to quality control, we tested the capability of different <b>blank</b> <b>materials</b> to collect ambient contamination by assessing their capacity to adsorb hydrocarbons during storage in plastic bags and found that commonly used Quartz sand does not provide an adequate measure of storage- or laboratory-induced contamination. Brick blanks, having the advantage that they can parallel rock samples even during the sawing process, are characterized by similar poor adsorption properties. Primarily steered by mineralogy, organic carbon content and surface area, model-black shales can adsorb up to 20 times more contaminants than sand blanks and up to 200 times more contaminants than organic-free model-carbonates. This observation provides an explanation for reports and observations of seemingly systematic stratigraphic variation of contaminants, but mostly should raise awareness for the evaluation of procedural blanks, in particular of sample-to-blank ratios, when studying bitumen-lean rock samples of varying lithologies. Additionally, differences between the hydrocarbon profiles in plastic bags and the hydrocarbon signatures transferred to <b>blank</b> <b>materials</b> emphasize difficulties in the unequivocal detection of contamination sources. Artificial black shale pellets can provide enhanced contamination control in biomarker studies - particularly for exceptionally vulnerable samples such as Precambrian rocks, meteorites or extraterrestrial sample-return material...|$|R

This concept is here tried out by recycling screen-printed electrodes {{that were to}} be disposed of and by choosing as sensory element a low cost material offering specific response for an environmental contaminant. Microcystins (MCs) were used as target analyte, for being dangerous toxins produced by cyanobacteria released into water bodies. The sensory element was a plastic antibody designed by surface imprinting with carefully selected monomers to ensure a specific response. These were designed {{on the wall of}} carbon nanotubes, taking advantage of their exceptional electrical properties. The stereochemical ability of the sensory material to detect MCs was checked by preparing <b>blank</b> <b>materials</b> where the imprinting stage was made without the template molecule. The novel sensory material for MCs was introduced in a polymeric matrix and evaluated against potentiometric measurements. Nernstian response was observed from 7. 24 × 10 − 10 to 1. 28 × 10 − 9 M in buffer solution (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 6. 6), with average slopes of − 62 mVdecade− 1 and detection capabilities below 1 nM. The <b>blank</b> <b>materials</b> were unable to provide a linear response against log(concentration), showing only a slight potential change towards more positive potentials with increasing concentrations (while that ofthe plastic antibodies moved to more negative values), with a maximum rate of + 33 mVdecade− 1. The sensors presented good selectivity towards sulphate, iron and ammonium ions, and also chloroform and tetrachloroethylene (TCE) and fast response (< 20 s).

Externally threaded fasteners comprise the bulk of fasteners used in these applications with over 90 % of being produced by thread rolling. The thread rolling process is now widely acknowledged as the fastest and most efficient method of producing accurate external threads, with surface finish and mechanical properties. The typical production rates are around one piece per second. In order to ensure a perfect thread rolling process, it is important for blank of work piece to be properly pre-machined.
