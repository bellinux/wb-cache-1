40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{transformative}} practices of Gitksan dance and story {{and how they}} offer a myriad of connections to our histories and a means for intergenerational transmission of this sacred knowledge. Exemplifying these processes in my lineage, I explore dance as the predominant environment where I learned my Adaawk, as Simoiget Hagbegwatku maintained these. Grounded in Adaawk, I follow a pedagogy which serves time-honoured Gitksan approaches, investigating the way story forms {{a powerful tool for}} learning. By translating these processes to pedagogy I find a style of discourse which honours Adaawk and shares in the healing authority of the songs. Integral to my understanding are the Indigenous pedagogical approaches of Cajete, Hampton and Kenny and <b>Battiste’s</b> and Smith’s perspectives on Indigenous epistemologies. These approaches are considered alongside Snowber’s concepts of embodied learning and the socio-cultural theories of Rogoff, Lave and Wenger...|$|R
60|$|Ebbo {{explained}} that he thought of making his way to Genoa to consult the merchant Gian Battista dei <b>Battiste,</b> whose description of the captive German noble had so strongly impressed Friedel. Ebbo knew the difference between Turks and Moors, but Friedel's impulse guided him, and he further thought that at Genoa he should learn the {{way to deal with}} either variety of infidel. Theurdank thought this a prudent course, since the Genoese had dealings both at Tripoli and Constantinople; and, moreover, the transfer was not impossible, since the two different hordes of Moslems trafficked among themselves when either had made an unusually successful razzia.|$|E
60|$|At length his own slave {{name was}} shouted; {{he was called}} up by the captain of his gang, and, while expecting some fresh punishment, or, maybe, to find himself sold into some {{domestic}} form of slavery, he was set before a Jewish agent, who, after examining him on his name, country, and station, and comparing his answers with a paper of instructions, informed {{him that he was}} ransomed, caused his fetters to be struck off, and shipped him off at once for Genoa, with orders to the captain to consign him to the merchant Signor del <b>Battiste.</b> By him Sir Eberhard had been received with the warmest hospitality, and treated as befitted his original station, but Battista disclaimed the merit of having ransomed him. He had but acted, he said, as the agent of an Austrian gentleman, from whom he had received orders to inquire after the Swabian baron who had been his fellow-captive, and, if he were still living, to pay his ransom, and bring him home.|$|E

She credits her doctoral dissertation as one of the many starting points interest in revitalizing the native language saying that a conversation with her advisor about the multiple writing systems of the Mi'kmaq language inspired her to research the histories of these writing systems. There are three different methods for writing with two still in use the first and most commonly used is the Pacifique system and the second and more controversial method being the Francis-Smith system. According to <b>Battiste</b> the Francis-Smith system of writing comes with more controversy for many reasons but the primary reason being, as she puts it, [...] "reflecting {{the fact that we are}} now using English as a second language in most of our communities," [...] and [...] "it seems to undercut the power of the old language for many."
