5|$|Several {{systems have}} been {{developed}} that map the IPA symbols to ASCII characters. Notable systems include Kirshenbaum, ARPABET, SAMPA, and X-SAMPA. The usage of mapping systems in on-line text has to some extent been adopted in the context input methods, allowing convenient keying of IPA characters that would <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> unavailable on standard keyboard layouts.|$|E
5|$|Nine power-ups each supply Mario with {{a special}} costume that grants him {{temporary}} abilities. For example, special mushrooms bestow the player with a Bee, Boo, or Spring Suit. The Bee Suit allows Mario to temporarily hover through the air, climb special walls, and walk on clouds and flowers; the Boo Suit allows him to float through the air, as well as become transparent and move through certain obstacles; and the Spring Suit allows him to jump to high areas that would <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> inaccessible, yet lowering his mobility. The recurring Fire Flower allows Mario to throw fireballs at enemies, and the newly introduced Ice Flower allows Mario to create hexagonal tiles of ice to cover any liquid surface he walks on. The Rainbow Star grants Mario invincibility, allowing him to destroy any enemies that he touches, {{as well as being}} able to run faster.|$|E
5|$|To be {{eligible}} to vote at a contested election in any constituency, a voter's name must be on the latest certified register of electors for that constituency. The name of the voter {{will be included in}} the register of electors for a constituency if on the cut-off date for the production of the register of electors the voter is a citizen of Singapore, at least 21 years old, and ordinarily resident or deemed to be ordinarily resident in Singapore at an address that is in that constituency. For the purpose of preparing or revising a register of electors, information stated on a voter's National Registration Identity Card is used to determine that he or she complies with the above requirements, unless the facts are shown to <b>be</b> <b>otherwise.</b>|$|E

5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would <b>be</b> <b>otherwise.</b> Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, Jack {{displayed}} a continued partiality towards amps and pedals from the 1960s. Jack used {{a number of}} effects to create his sound, such as a DigiTech Whammy IV to reach pitches that would <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> impossible with a regular guitar. When performing live, Jack used a Randy Parsons custom guitar, a 1964 JB Hutto Montgomery Airline, a Harmony Rocket, a 1970s Crestwood Astral II, and a 1950s Kay Hollowbody. Also, while playing live, he used an MXR Micro-Amp, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi distortion/sustainer, and an Electro-Harmonix POG (a polyphonic octave generator). He also used a Boss TU-2 tuner pedal. He plugged this setup into a 1970s Fender Twin Reverb, and two 100-Watt Sears Silvertone 1485 amplifiers paired with two 6x10 Silvertone cabinets. In addition to standard guitar tuning, Jack also used several open tunings.|$|E

25|$|Ohio {{also offers}} the OhioLINK program, {{allowing}} Ohio's libraries (particularly those from colleges and universities) access to {{materials for the}} other libraries. The program is largely successful in allowing researchers for access to books and other media that might not <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> available.|$|E
25|$|In {{isolated}} rural areas, {{electricity grid}} extensions {{are often not}} economical. Off‐grid renewable technologies provide a sustainable and cost‐effective alternative to the diesel generators that would <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> be deployed in such areas. Renewable technologies can also help to displace other unsustainable energy sources such as kerosene lamps and traditional biomass.|$|E
25|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a {{disciplinary}} council is an ecclesiastical trial during which {{a member of}} the church is tried for alleged violations of church standards. If {{a member of the}} LDS Church is found guilty of an offence by {{a disciplinary}} council, he or she may be excommunicated or their church membership may <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> restricted. Disciplinary councils are also referred to unofficially as church courts.|$|E

25|$|Skin dryness in {{some people}} with SS {{may be the result}} of {{lymphocytic}} infiltration into skin glands. The symptoms may develop insidiously, with the diagnosis often not considered for several years, because the complaints of sicca may <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> attributed to medications, a dry environment, aging, or may be regarded as not of severity warranting the level of investigation necessary to establish the presence of the specific underlying autoimmune disorder.|$|E
25|$|Strict fasting is canonically {{forbidden}} on Saturdays and Sundays {{due to the}} festal {{character of}} the Sabbath and the Resurrection, respectively. On those days wine and oil are permitted even if abstention from them would <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> called for. Holy Saturday is the only Saturday of the year where a strict fast is kept every year, though it is also kept on the Eve of Theophany in years when that day falls on Saturday.|$|E
25|$|William had 12 {{children}} and 56 grandchildren. His two eldest sons alone (William and Henry) had 29 children between them. He {{was a strong}} supporter of overseas colonisation – he was wont to say that, with so many children, he could not <b>be</b> <b>otherwise.</b> Frederick and three of his brothers went to the United States while their elder brother, Henry, joined the first expedition of settlers to New Zealand. Henry's son, Francis Petre, was a leading architect who designed the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament (Christchurch, New Zealand).|$|E

25|$|The fossil {{preserves}} no {{traces of}} any skin, scales or feathers. In 1999 Philip J. Currie hypothesised this might <b>be</b> <b>otherwise,</b> suggesting the tubes {{found on the}} tail base would represent the filaments of protofeathers. In 2011, however, Dal Sasso & Maganuco rejected this interpretation because the tubes taper at both ends, while integument filaments {{are expected to have}} only a tapered top end. Nevertheless, they considered it likely that Scipionyx in life had protofeathers as these are known to be present with the compsognathids Sinosauropteryx and Sinocalliopteryx.|$|E
25|$|Currently, RNA-Seq {{relies on}} copying of RNA {{molecules}} into cDNA molecules prior to sequencing, hence the subsequent platforms {{are the same}} for transcriptomic and genomic data. Consequently, the development of DNA sequencing technologies has been {{a defining feature of}} RNA-Seq. Direct sequencing of RNA using nanopore sequencing represents a current state-of-the-art RNA-Seq technique in its infancy (in pre-release beta testing as of 2016). However, nanopore sequencing of RNA can detect modified bases that would <b>be</b> <b>otherwise</b> masked when sequencing cDNA and also eliminates amplification steps that can otherwise introduce bias.|$|E
25|$|This play {{portrays a}} family in a ferociously {{negative}} light as the parents and two sons express accusations, blame, and resentments – qualities which are often paired with pathetic and self-defeating attempts at affection, encouragement, tenderness, and yearnings for things to <b>be</b> <b>otherwise.</b> The pain of this family is made worse by their depth of self-understanding and self-analysis, combined with a brutal honesty, as they see it, {{and an ability to}} boldly express themselves. The story deals with the mother’s addiction to morphine, the family’s addiction to whiskey, the father’s miserliness, the older brother’s licentiousness, and younger brother’s illness.|$|E
