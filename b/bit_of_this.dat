Kirkus Reviews awarded it a starred review with the consensus that [...] "Art, intrigue, and plenty of twists and turns make this art mystery a great read." [...] Children's Literature reviewer Claudia Mills gave generally positive comments, calling the novel [...] "engrossing and engaging". The website Kidsreads well-loved children's books. It's that good." [...] A reviewer of The Trades website called it [...] "an entertaining read that manages to serve several purposes in one concise novel" [...] and found the characters [...] "unusual yet likable", but felt that [...] "the disappointing <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> novel is that the solutions always arrive through a series of disconnected events that just lead the kids to think in certain ways." [...] Kadon Enterprises, a game puzzle company, reviewed the book, praising the writing style and puzzles.|$|E

[...] On [...] "Palace", ASAP Rocky demonstrates alliterative lyricism and [...] cadence and flow. His flow patterns have been compared by writers to those of Cleveland-based hip hop group Bone Thugs-N-Harmony. August Brown of the Los Angeles Times writes that [...] "his reserved, steely delivery owes equal debts to Houston's syrup daze and Dipset's uptown intensity". He addresses his rapping style on [...] "Purple Swag": [...] "I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow". On [...] "Leaf", he addresses hip-hoppers' criticism of his style: [...] "They say I sound like André / mixed with Kanye / {{a little bit of}} Max / a little bit of Wiz / {{a little bit of that}} / a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> / get off my dick".|$|E

2500|$|Another type of {{stripped}} down and raw {{music with a}} variety of moods and a basic ensemble of guitar, bass, dobro or steel guitar (and later) drums became popular, especially among poor whites in Texas and Oklahoma. It became known as honky tonk and had its roots in Western swing and the ranchera music of Mexico and the border states, particularly Texas, together with the blues of the American South. Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys personified this music which has been described as [...] "a little <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> {{and a little bit of}} that, a little bit of black and a little bit of white... just loud enough to keep you from thinking too much and to go right on ordering the whiskey." [...] East Texan Al Dexter had a hit with [...] "Honky Tonk Blues", and seven years later [...] "Pistol Packin' Mama". These [...] "honky tonk" [...] songs associated barrooms, were performed by the likes of Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells (the first major female country solo singer), Ted Daffan, Floyd Tillman, and the Maddox Brothers and Rose, Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams, would later be called [...] "traditional" [...] country. Williams' influence in particular would prove to be enormous, inspiring many of the pioneers of rock and roll, such as Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis, as well as Chuck Berry and Ike Turner, while providing a framework for emerging honky tonk talents like George Jones. Webb Pierce was the top-charting country artist of the 1950s, with 13 of his singles spending 113 weeks at number one. He charted 48 singles during the decade; 31 reached the top ten and 26 reached the top four.|$|E
2500|$|The Farmers General held a {{monopoly}} of the production, import {{and sale of}} tobacco in France, and the taxes they levied on tobacco brought revenues of 30 million livres a year. However this revenue began to fall because of a growing black market in tobacco that was smuggled and adulterated, most commonly with ash and water. Lavoisier devised a method of checking whether ash had been mixed in with tobacco: [...] "When a spirit of vitriol, aqua fortis or some other acid solution is poured on ash, there is an immediate very intense effervescent reaction, accompanied by an easily detected noise." [...] Lavoisier also noticed that {{the addition of a}} small amount of ash improved the flavour of tobacco. [...] Of one vendor selling adulterated goods he wrote [...] "His tobacco enjoys a very good reputation in the province... the very small proportion of ash that is added gives it a particularly pungent flavour that consumers look for. Perhaps the Farm could gain some advantage by adding a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> liquid mixture when the tobacco is fabricated." [...] Lavoisier also found that while adding a lot of water to bulk the tobacco up would cause it to ferment and smell bad, the addition of a very small amount improved the product. Thereafter the factories of the Farmers General added, as he recommended, a consistent 6.3% of water by volume to the tobacco they processed. To allow for this addition, the Farmers General delivered to retailers seventeen ounces of tobacco while only charging for sixteen. To ensure that only these authorised amounts were added, and to exclude the black market, Lavoisier saw to it that a watertight system of checks, accounts, supervision and testing made it very difficult for retailers to source contraband tobacco or to improve their profits by bulking it up. He was energetic and rigorous in implementing this, and the systems he introduced were deeply unpopular with the tobacco retailers across the country. This unpopularity was to have consequences for him during the French Revolution.|$|E

6000|$|What a deplorable {{condition}} then {{is a poor}} Pharisee in! For mercy he cannot pray, he cannot {{pray for}} it with all his heart; for he seeth, indeed, no need thereof. True, the Pharisee, though he was impudent enough, yet would not take all from God; he would still count, that there was due to him a tribute of thanks: [...] "God, I thank thee," [...] saith he, but yet not a <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> for mercy; but for that he had let him live, for I know not {{for what he did}} thank himself, till he had made himself better than other men; but that betterment was a betterment in none other judgment than that of his own, and that was none other but such an one as was false. So then, the Pharisee is by this time quite out of doors; his righteousness is worth nothing, his prayer is worth nothing, his thanks to God are worth nothing; for that what he had was scanty, and imperfect, and it was his pride that made him offer it to God for acceptance; nor could his fawning thanksgiving better his case, or make his matter at all good before God.|$|E
