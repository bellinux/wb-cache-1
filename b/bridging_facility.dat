In this article we concentrate on two fundamental instruments to support {{the pursuit of a}} security centric supply chain management (SecSCM) mission. Firstly the security taxonomy within the SCM context provides a comprehensive knowledge map of relevant artifacts and issues for players to communicate and collaborate in this special field. Ultimately it supplies building blocks for qualitative modeling required by security management. Secondly security management in SCM seeks practical computation and analysis capabilities, thus requiring a migration from qualitative models to quantitative models. We utilize dependency modeling as the <b>bridging</b> <b>facility</b> and probabilistic modeling as the inference engine in our solution to deal with complexity and uncertainty dominant in SecSCM. In addition we explore the proposition within essential application of healthcare supply chain security management. Noticing the enormous challenge presented by the new research mission, we emphasize identifying and examining generic issues and potential solutions, rather than particular problems or algorithms with limited usage and significance...|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{environment}} {{provides a}} whole new spectrum of challenges to communications and networking. The ability to study satellite network conditions in a reproducible and controlled manner has relied mainly on simulations and experimental testbed. Investigations on network protocols and multimedia applications over satellite networks via operational hardware-based testbed are costly and inflexible while results from simulators may be inaccurate due to assumptions made during the modeling process. Hence, a satellite network emulator is proposed to overcome these obstacles as it has complementing properties of both hardware-based testbed and pure software-based simulators. The proposed emulator is to imitate the performance dynamics in IP networks over satellite links. Operating at the Medium Access Control (MAC) of Data Link Layer, the emulator is able to emulate the propagation delay and bit errors of satellite channels. This is a very useful and cost-effective approach to show the impact of satellite link delay and transmission errors on Internet services and applications. Architecturally, the paper describes how the emulator is built upon LINUX IEEE 802. 3 <b>bridging</b> <b>facility</b> (brctl) and LINUX firewall (netfilter). As packet level emulation paradigm is used, the emulator is capable of producing precise satellite channel model and thus, put forward itself as a reliable, adaptable and economical alternative for research on satellite communication networking and applications. This paper presents a project on a LINUX-based satellite link emulator, including the design and algorithm of the emulator and performance evaluation of Internet applications (data, voice and video) based on the emulator. It also explains the design and setup of a flexible and expandable testbed to supplement the performance evaluation process. The effects of the satellite emulator on voice, video and data are also studied {{through the use of}} Internet applications such as Microsoft Netmeeting and TCP/IP based data transfer.

40|$|The {{focus on}} {{entrepreneurs}} as drivers of {{the economies of}} nations has catapulted them into {{the forefront of the}} local and international marketplace. This has led to a demand for entrepreneurial education and training resulting in a plethora of different and often divergent views. One commonality that has emerged is that entrepreneurship can be taught; although it cannot be taught in conventional and traditional ways. It requires a move from traditional education and training to more enterprising participative and supportive forms of business development. It requires investments of time, resources and support. Incubators are facilities that are engaged with entrepreneurs and offer a variety of support including education and training. This study has assessed the effectiveness of training offered by the Seda Nelson Mandela Bay ICT incubator. There has been limited research undertaken on entrepreneurial education and training in an incubator setting. This study followed the qualitative paradigm. The sample comprised of 10 small businesses at the Seda Nelson Mandela Bay ICT incubator. Empirical data was obtained by interviewing the owners of the small businesses using an interview schedule. Issues such as the most effective training programme, content that it contained, methodology used and quality of the facilitator and applicability of the training programme were explored. The study found that the small businesses were opportunity driven rather than necessity driven and that the incubator served as a <b>bridging</b> <b>facility</b> in moving the businesses from the informal sector to the formal sector. The content of the training programmes was found to be effective when a mix of both theoretical and practical is offered especially with an emphasis on the underlying entrepreneurial themes of confidence, persistence and uncertainty and so on. It also found that training programmes should be linked to the life cycle of the business and address the specific needs of the small business owner. The start-up phase requires very specific training. Most of the facilitators were found to be experienced and empathetic. However, only a few were using a wider range of preferred learning styles favoured by entrepreneurs such as role playing, simulation, brainstorming and problem-solving techniques. The study also found that when generic training programmes are offered there was less recall {{on the part of the}} trainees. The management team of the incubator is an important determinant of the success of the incubatees and it is recommended that they need to be well versed in their sector and have good networking skills. There is a strong link between the theoretical and the practical content of training programmes especially where the emphasis is more on the practical content. It is recommended that facilitators pay attention to their relationship with trainees as it is a critical success factor in the training programme. Training programmes offered over a period of time add more value to the incubatee. This might be because of the mentoring and counselling that is available after each training module is completed. Finally, more research needs to be undertaken on the quality and effectiveness of training programmes offered by incubators to small businesse...|$|E

The shared history of two non-profit organizations that began in in Brevard County, FL in the mid twentieth century is remarkable. NASA began in 1958, and the Bridges organization began in 1956. The historically significant American community of Brevard County, FL now faces the challenges of a new focus without the NASA space shuttle program and accommodating an increasingly aging population, while the similarly aged Bridges organization faces similar organizational and population challenges as well. This study first provides a historical background of Brevard County, FL and the Bridges organization.

Transportation planners cannot assume bicyclists are solely focused on minimizing travel time or distance—standard practice assumptions for vehicular modes.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with infrastructure maintenance and repair policies, when the managing agency does not value expenses linearly. Such nonlinearity naturally arises in the stochastic world of reliability engineer-ing, manifesting, for instance, as risk aversion: the ideal maintenance and repair policy has a low cost variance, {{as well as a}} low average cost. Another type of nonlinear behavior arises when one tries to match future expendi-tures with an externally-determined budget. Dynamic programming tech-niques are applied to create two algorithms (FindPolicy and EvalPolicy) which are of use in this problem: FindPolicy determines an optimal main-tenance policy, while EvalPolicy allows a previously-determined policy to be evaluated according to a broad class of measures of effectiveness. These algorithms are applied to a hypothetical <b>bridge</b> <b>facility,</b> to determine and evaluate short-term and long-term maintenance policies. In this exam-ple, large reductions in solution variance are attainable with only slight increases in average cost...|$|R
