The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been {{observed}} shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, woolly-necked stork (Ciconia episcopus), demoiselle crane (Grus virgo) and <b>bar-headed</b> <b>goose</b> (Anser indicus). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.|$|E

25|$|The fauna of Ladakh {{has much}} in common with that of Central Asia in general and that of the Tibetan Plateau in particular. Exceptions to this are the birds, many of which migrate from the warmer parts of India to spend the summer in Ladakh. For such an arid area, Ladakh has a great {{diversity}} of birds— a total of 225 species have been recorded. Many species of finches, robins, redstarts (like the black redstart), and the hoopoe are common in summer. The brown-headed gull is seen in summer on the river Indus and on some lakes of the Changthang. Resident water-birds include the brahminy duck also known as the ruddy sheldrake and the <b>bar-headed</b> <b>goose.</b> The black-necked crane, a rare species found scattered in the Tibetan plateau, is also found in parts of Ladakh. Other birds include the raven, Eurasian magpie, red-billed chough, Tibetan snowcock, and chukar. The lammergeier and the golden eagle are common raptors here specially in Changthang region.|$|E

40|$|While <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> are {{renowned for}} {{migration}} at high altitude over the Himalayas, previous work on captive birds suggested that these geese {{are unable to}} maintain rates of oxygen consumption while running in severely hypoxic conditions. To investigate this paradox, we re-examined the running performance and heart rates of <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> and barnacle geese (a low altitude species) during exercise in hypoxia. <b>Bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> (n = 7) were able to run at maximum speeds (determined in normoxia) for 15 minutes in severe hypoxia (7 % O 2; simulating the hypoxia at 8500 m) with mean heart rates of 466 Â± 8 beats minâ�� 1. Barnacle geese (n = 10), on the other hand, were unable to complete similar trials in severe hypoxia and their mean heart rate (316 beats. minâ�� 1) was significantly lower than <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese.</b> In <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese,</b> partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in both arterial and mixed venous blood were significantly lower during hypoxia than normoxia, both at rest and while running. However, measurements of blood lactate in <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> suggested that anaerobic metabolism was not a major energy source during running in hypoxia. We combined these data with values taken from the literature to estimate (i) oxygen supply, using the Fick equation and (ii) oxygen demand using aerodynamic theory for <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> flying aerobically, and under their own power, at altitude. This analysis predicts that the maximum altitude at which geese can transport enough oxygen to fly without environmental assistance ranges from 6, 800 m to 8, 900 m altitude, depending on the parameters used in the model but that such flights should be rare...|$|R

50|$|The main {{physiological}} {{challenge of}} <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> is extracting oxygen from hypoxic air and transporting it to aerobic muscle fibres {{in order to}} sustain flight at high altitudes. Flight is very metabolically costly at high-altitudes because birds need to flap harder in thin air to generate lift. Studies have found that <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> breathe more deeply and efficiently under low oxygen conditions, which serves to increase oxygen uptake from the environment. The haemoglobin of their blood has a higher affinity for oxygen compared to low-altitude geese, which {{has been attributed to}} a single amino acid point mutation. This mutation causes a conformational shift in the haemoglobin molecule from the low oxygen affinity form to the high oxygen affinity form. The left-ventricle of the heart, which is responsible for pumping oxygenated blood to the body via systemic circulation, has significantly more capillaries in <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> compared with lowland birds, maintaining oxygenation of cardiac muscle cells and thereby cardiac output. Compared to lowland birds, mitochondria (the main site of oxygen consumption) in the flight muscle of <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> are significantly closer to the sarcolemma, decreasing the intracellular diffusion distance of oxygen from the capillaries to the mitochondria.|$|R

40|$|<b>Bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> (Anser indicus) fly {{at up to}} 9, 000 m {{elevation}} {{during their}} migration over the Himalayas, sustaining high metabolic rates in the severe hypoxia at these altitudes. We investigated the evolution of cardiac energy metabolism and O 2 transport in this species {{to better understand the}} molecular and physiological mechanisms of high-altitude adaptation. Compared with low-altitude geese (pink-footed geese and barnacle <b>geese),</b> <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> had larger lungs and higher capillary densities in the left ventricle of the heart, both of which should improve O 2 diffusion during hypoxia. Although myoglobin abundance and the activities of many metabolic enzymes (carnitine palmitoyltransferase, citrate synthase, 3 -hydroxyacyl-coA dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase) showed only minor variation between species, <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> had a striking alteration in the kinetics of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the heteromeric enzyme that catalyzes O 2 reduction in oxidative phosphorylation. This was reflected by a lower maximum catalytic activity and a higher affinity for reduced cytochrome c. There were small differences between species in messenger RNA and protein expression of COX subunits 3 and 4, but these were inconsistent with the divergence in enzyme kinetics. However, the COX 3 gene of <b>bar-headed</b> <b>geese</b> contained a nonsynonymous substitution at a site that is otherwise conserved across vertebrates and resulted in a major functional change of amino acid class (Trp- 116 / Arg).
