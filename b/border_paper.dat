Therefore, the Rejsekort system was prepared {{to work with the}} Scanian, so as to allow passengers to easily travel over the Oresund Bridge. The current cross <b>border</b> <b>paper</b> tickets are also accepted on local traffic, and should do so also in the future. Skånetrafiken did in 2009 introduce a different electronic card system, which is incompatible with Rejsekort. The new Skånetrafiken system is electronic only for buses, while for trains a paper ticket must be printed. Neighbour counties in north introduced the same system but under own names.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} diverse {{factors that can}} affect {{the health of a}} population. Competing theorists tend to focus on the {{biological}} view that health problems are genetically determined and influenced by personal factors versus the structural notion that social and economic forces primarily determine population health. Numerous American studies reflect the prevalence of health care disparities affecting minority Americans. These disparities are similar to the experiences of Canadian immigrants and aboriginals as both are rooted in historical and contemporary inequities that {{can be traced back to}} legalized segregation and oppression. Much of American social and economic life remains ordered by race and ethnicity. Within the context of American health outcomes, cancer survival studies have demonstrated that people of colour experience poorer prognosis. Breast cancer, a sentinel health outcome, is a disease known to result in successful prognosis when prevention/education, adequate screening, treatment and follow up are provided. A comparison of retrospective and prospective Canadian and American breast cancer studies reveal great variability in health delivery and outcomes. In particular, American studies show differences of female breast cancer based on race, and socioeconomic variables. Much is yet to be learned with respect to minority breast cancer survival outcomes in Canada. Research has shown that Canada 2 ̆ 7 s universal single payer health care system may explain survival advantages when compared to the American managed care system, where cost containment and welfare reform has had a tremendous impact on the accessibility of medical care and treatment for minorities. Social policies could solve racial inequities in health outcomes on both sides of the <b>border.</b> <b>Paper</b> copy at Leddy Library: Theses 2 ̆ 6 Major Papers - Basement, West Bldg. / Call Number: Thesis 2005.

40|$|Incidents in {{the road}} {{transport}} system can have large negative consequences for the society and the business community. The basic aim of vulnerability analysis is to identify scenarios that i) would lead to severe consequences, and ii) have some likelihood of being realized in the future. The Thesis proposes two main approaches to vulnerability analysis. The first significant component of the analysis is to identify important links {{in the road}} network, i. e., links where a disruption would lead to severe consequences. The second component is to identify exposed users, i. e., users for which {{the consequences of a}} disruption would be particularly severe. Paper I introduces the concepts of importance and exposure and how they can be operationalized in terms of increased travel time when road links are closed. The measures are applied to the road network of northern Sweden. Among other things, we find that the most important road links from a socio-economic efficiency perspective are sections of the main roads in the region going through the main population centres. The most exposed users, on the other hand, live in the sparsely populated municipalities in the northwest along the Norwegian <b>border.</b> <b>Paper</b> II studies the geographic patterns of exposure and importance in Sweden and identifies properties of the geography, road network and travel patterns that to a large extent explain the observed spatial differences. We find that the municipalities around Stockholm have the most important road networks, and that people in the southern parts of Sweden are considerably less exposed than in the northern parts. We also find that the sparsity of the road network, the travel times of the users and the traffic load on the links provide good explanatory variables for the regional variations in exposure and importance. Paper III proposes a link importance measure that incorporates both efficiency considerations, i. e. the total increase in travel time, and equity considerations, i. e. the unevenness of the distribution among users. We show analytically that there is a strong inverse relationship between the two components. In a case study of the Swedish road network we find that when only efficiency is considered, links in many of the main roads are among the most important. With more weight put on equity, importance is gradually shifted to smaller local roads with poor or no alternative routes. QC 2010110...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the nature}} of the <b>border.</b> The <b>paper</b> poses the question of whether a border, in this case the national border between Finland and Russia in the Finnish Karelian border region, can have its own distinctive identity[ies], and if so, could the border itself be or become a hybrid - a border subject. To examine the hybridization process of the <b>border,</b> this <b>paper</b> draws on individual experiences of the border that are illustrated using interview material. In addition, by analysing historical documents, literature and historiography, the paper shows how the border has affected people's relationship with the border itself and also their perception of regional landscapes, regional memories and identity. On the other hand, this process can be reversed by exploring how people have changed and embodied the <b>border.</b> The <b>paper</b> utilises the framework of John Perry's theory of "reflective knowledge", where both conscious experience and the knowledge it yields differ from physical knowledge that is explicitly characterized in terms of empirical facts. Exploring these relationships enhances our understanding of the role of "private knowledge" and its contribution to the understanding of borders...|$|R

This battle apparently ended the revolution. The capitulation of President Diaz followed shortly, and there was a feeling of relief among ranchers on the border from Texas to California. Nothing more was heard of Gene Stewart until April, when a report reached Stillwell that the cowboy had arrived in El Cajon, evidently hunting trouble. The old cattleman saddled a horse and started post-haste for town. In two days he returned, depressed in spirit. Madeline happened to be present when Stillwell talked to Alfred.|$|R

40|$|The {{thickening}} of the Canada-US {{border in}} response to post 9 / 11 security challenges has created new obstacles to cross-border trade and investment. However, preclearance of people and goods before they arrive at the physical border offers {{one of the best}} ways to address crossborder obstacles while ensuring public safety. Preclearance has a track record of success where it has been applied. It has proven to be a cost-effective way to provide air travelers with an economical way to clear customs and immigration before entering the United States from Canada. EU members are satisfied that they have succeeded in guarding their security, while promoting an integrated single market, by relying on a perimeter approach to preclearance. Canada and the United States currently rely on preclearance for trusted traveler and shipper programs. Building on these successful models, Canada and the United States should proceed to designing and implementing ambitious programs that use preclearance to cost-effectively ensure a secure and economical border crossing, for most travelers and shippers. <b>Border</b> <b>Papers.</b> Canada, United States, Canada-US border, cross-border trade, preclearance...|$|R
