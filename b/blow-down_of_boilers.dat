The results indicated that in term of pH the sodium phosphate solutions were close to sodium hydroxide solution with temperature raising and the molar ratio of sodium to phosphate {{was not a significant}} factor in controlling pH of bulk water at boiler water temperature. This means that there is little need to perform the <b>blow-down</b> <b>of</b> <b>boiler</b> water and reinject di-sodium hydrogen phosphate, even though the hide-out occured, as long as the concentration of phosphate species in boiler water is kept above the lowest level for prevention of hardness ion precipitation...|$|R

Based on the heat balance method,the main factors <b>of</b> influencing <b>boiler</b> efficiency was analysed deeply and the artificial neural network on-line monitoring model <b>of</b> <b>boiler</b> efficiency was established to predict boiler efficiency accurately and constantly in this paper. After precise analysis and tracking, the input variable for the artificial neural network on-line monitoring model <b>of</b> <b>boiler</b> efficiency was selected, {{so as to avoid}} larger error caused by the rough selection of input variable in the previous artificial neural network. At last,based on a 600 MW boiler,the borler efficiency was predicted in this paper. we can easily know from the prediction result that the artificial neural network on-line monitoring model <b>of</b> <b>boiler</b> efficiency can predict the boiler efficiency accurately and constantly at a wide range condition...|$|R
