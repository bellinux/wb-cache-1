40|$|The {{incidence}} and persistence of <b>bovine</b> <b>infectious</b> keratoconjunctivit is, or “pink-eye ”, was investigated over three drafts in Hereford, Simmental and Africander-Hereford heifers. Incidence of infection was greatest in Herefords (43. 1 %), intermediate in Simmentals (21. 4 %) and least in Africander-Herefords (7. 2 %). Persistence of infection {{was related to}} breed, with Herefords retaining more signs of infection than Simmentals or Africander-Herefords. Infected animals had lower average daily weight gains (479 g/d) than uninfected animals (516 g/d). No relationship was found between eyelid pigmentation, the incidence or persistence of infection and average daily weight gain.
