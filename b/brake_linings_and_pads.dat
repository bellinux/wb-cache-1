50|$|Due to its efficacy, {{chrysotile}} asbestos {{was often a}} component in brake linings. However, studies such as a 1989 National Institutes of Health item showed an uncommonly high proportion of brake mechanics were afflicted with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, {{both of which are}} linked to chrysotile and asbestos exposure. Public health authorities generally recommend against inhaling brake dust, chrysotile has been banned in many developed countries, such as Australia in late 2003, and chrysotile has been progressively replaced in most <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> <b>and</b> <b>pads</b> by other fibers such as the synthetic aramids.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} the wear properties of four brands of brake pad {{available in the}} Nigerian market. In particular, we assessed the tribo performance and service life of the brake pads. We purchased four commercial brands of brake pads used in light duty cars and coded them as AU, SN, TY and SM, respectively. A small piece of the brake pad lining materials was carefully chiseled from the back plates to obtain samples for the experiments. We conducted Brinell hardness tests using a tensometer and a pin-on-disc test rig to determine the coefficient of friction and the wear characteristics of the materials. We then correlated the wear on each set of brake pads with the running time and used Weibull’s equation to determine average service life. Sample TY exhibited the highest hardness value (29.09) and sample SN the lowest (10.05). The determined coefficients of friction ranged between 0.3 – 0.36, with sample AU exhibiting the lowest value and sample SM the highest. Sample SN showed the lowest wear rate of 3.53 × 109 g/min, while the wear rates of samples TY, AU, and SM were 5.64 × 108, 8.19 × 109, and 2.10 × 108 g/min, respectively. The relative service life of samples SN, TY, and AU were similar, with average values of 2778.09, 2725.41, and 2717.34 min, respectively, and SM had a relatively low service life (2017.82 min). We conclude that the overall performances of Nigerian brake pads do not meet all the specifications for friction materials used in road vehicle <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> <b>and</b> <b>pads.</b>|$|E
40|$|Asbestos is a naturally-occurring {{mineral fiber}} with a silky texture whose {{distinctive}} properties-high mechanical strength, even at high temperatures; incombustibility; good insulating qualities; durability; flexibility; indestructibility; and low cost- have caused its widespread use in industry. 4 Brazil {{is among the}} world's five greatest producers of asbestos and {{is also an important}} consumer of the mineral.

50|$|Dry-ground mica {{is used in}} the {{production}} of rolled roofing and asphalt shingles, where it serves as a surface coating to prevent sticking of adjacent surfaces. The coating is not absorbed by freshly manufactured roofing because mica’s platy structure is unaffected by the acid in asphalt or by weather conditions. Mica is used in decorative coatings on wallpaper, concrete, stucco, and tile surfaces. It also is used as an ingredient in flux coatings on welding rods, in some special greases, and as coatings for core and mold release compounds, facing agents, and mold washes in foundry applications. Dry-ground phlogopite mica is used in automotive <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> <b>and</b> clutch plates to reduce noise and vibration (asbestos substitute); as sound-absorbing insulation for coatings and polymer systems; in reinforcing additives for polymers to increase strength and stiffness and to improve stability to heat, chemicals, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation; in heat shields and temperature insulation; in industrial coating additive to decrease the permeability of moisture and hydrocarbons; and in polar polymer formulations to increase the strength of epoxies, nylons, and polyesters.|$|R
40|$|In {{phase of}} vehicle braking system designing, besides of {{mechanical}} characteristics, {{it is also}} necessary to take under consideration the system’s thermal features.

40|$|Asbestos {{possesses}} {{properties that}} are ideally {{suitable for use}} as a friction material in automotive {{and a number of other}} applications. Animal and human studies carried out since the early 1900 s have established that asbestos is carcinogenic and that exposure to especially asbestos dust causes a large number of diseases. The search is, therefore, still on to find suitable substitutes for asbestos. A brake lining containing 14 ingredients was investigated to study the effect of ingredients on various aspects of friction properties. The composite was developed for a nonasbestos organic based friction material for an automotive brake system and contained typical ingredients for commercial brake friction materials. Two types of friction materials with different combinations were developed: (1) flyash range (10 %- 60 %), and (2) without flyash based friction materials were investigated to study the effect of ingredients on the friction characteristics and wear. The main focus on the average normal coefficient, hot coefficient (Fade and recovery), wear loss, mechanical, as the function of the relative amount of the ingredient. The results also showed that the friction coefficient of fly-ash was better in the range of 0. 35 to 0. 48 when compared barites based <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> <b>and</b> asbestos based <b>brake</b> <b>linings.</b> The materials such as potassium titanate (terraces), wollastonite, friction dust powder have strongly influence on friction coefficient.

50|$|However, the X-body {{developed}} a poor reputation for quality, due to engineering defects and related safety problems. Several running {{changes were made}} to the car's braking system during the first months of manufacture in 1979. Initial automobile magazine articles about the new car in the autumn of 1979 cited a dangerous tendency for the car to lock the rear wheels upon braking; then hundreds of complaints involving this behavior, including dozens of accidents, over a dozen injuries and one death triggering a lawsuit, were reported {{in the first year of}} manufacture, leading the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to pressure General Motors for some remedial action. Despite there being over a million of these automobiles on the road at that point, GM issued a voluntary recall of only the earliest manual transmission models, less than 50,000, declaring no safety involvement, and declining to publicize the recall. Internal documents, which eventually were leaked, revealed that GM's engineering staff were dubious that this modification to the brake proportioning valve would be sufficient, even for the cars which were subject to the recall, and that further changes to the <b>brake</b> <b>linings</b> <b>and</b> <b>brake</b> drums would be required; that would have raised the cost from $70 a vehicle to $150, in addition to greatly increasing the number of cars involved.|$|R

The antibacterial activity was delayed by the inclusion of Mg 2 + ions in the AlcellRTMlignin filtrate or in the enumeration medium (BHIA). Addition of bile salts to the enumeration medium (BHIA) enhanced the culturability loss of E. coli cells suspended in the filtrate of AlcellRTMlignin. Using FTIR methodology, it appears, that compounds of AlcellRTMlignin affect phospholipid-phospholipid and/or phospholipid-protein interactions in bacterial membranes, causing the patching of membrane phospholipids and proteins.
