40|$|This work {{presents}} an approach for the modeling and numerical optimization of <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> within a Marker-less Motion Capture (MoCap) framework. In skeleton based approaches, kinematic chains {{are commonly used}} to model 1 DoF revolute joints. A 3 DoF joint (e. g. a shoulder or hip) is consequently modeled by concatenating three consecutive 1 DoF revolute joints. Obviously such a representation is not optimal and singularities can occur. Therefore, we propose to model 3 DoF <b>joints</b> with <b>spherical</b> <b>joints</b> or <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> using the representation of a twist and its exponential mapping (known from 1 DoF revolute joints). The exact modeling and numerical optimization of <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> requires additionally the adjoint transform and the logarithm of the exponential mapping. Experiments with simulated and real data demonstrate that <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> can better represent arbitrary rotations than the concatenation of 3 revolute joints. Moreover, we demonstrate that the 3 revolute joints representation {{is very similar to}} the Euler angles representation and has the same limitations in terms of singularities. 1...|$|R

Four sets of constraints, covering strut lengths, platform <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> angles, base <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> angles, and strut collisions, are formulated using inverse kinematics.

30|$|Discussion: In general, a {{kinematic}} joint possesses {{more than}} one constraint reaction, for example, there exist 5, 4, 4 and 3 constraint reactions for an R joint, universal joint (U), cylindrical <b>joint</b> (C), and <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> (S), respectively. If we adopt traditional methods to build the force and moment equilibrium equations of all movable bodies and complementary equations, the rank of the coefficient matrix of those equations will be very large. This method, {{which is based on}} resultant constraint wrenches, can avoid the high-rank matrix, reduce a certain number of unknowns, and ensure that the number of simultaneous equilibrium equations is not more than six each time. However, it is only suitable for solving the driving forces/torques and constraint forces/moments of passive overconstrained PMs with collinear constraint forces or coaxial constraint moments.|$|R

40|$|Under an interagency {{agreement}} with the Department of Energy, the NASA Lewis Research Center manages a Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine Technology (HDET) research program. The overall program objectives are {{to reduce fuel consumption}} through increased engine efficiency, reduce engine exhaust emissions, and provide options for the use of alternative fuels. The program is administered with a balance of research contracts, university research grants, and focused in-house research. The Cummins Engine Company participates in the HDET program under a cost-sharing research contract. Cummins is researching and developing in-cylinder component technologies for heavy-duty diesel engines. An objective of the Cummins research is to develop technologies for a low-emissions, 55 -percent thermal efficiency (LE- 55) engine. The best current-production engines in this class achieve about 46 -percent thermal efficiency. Federal emissions regulations are driving this technology. Regulations for heavy duty diesel engines were tightened in 1994, more demanding emissions regulations are scheduled for 1998, and another step is planned for 2002. The LE- 55 engine emissions goal is set at half of the 1998 regulation level and is consistent with plans for 2002 emissions regulations. LE- 55 engine design requirements to meet the efficiency target dictate a need to operate at higher peak cylinder pressures. A key technology being developed and evaluated under the Cummins Engine Company LE- 55 engine concept is the <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> piston and connecting rod. Unlike conventional piston and connecting rod arrangements which are joined by a pin forming a hinged <b>joint,</b> the <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> piston and connecting rod use a ball-and-socket joint. The ball-and-socket arrangement enables the piston to have an axisymmetric design allowing rotation within the cylinder. The potential benefits of piston symmetry and rotation are reduced scuffing, improved piston ring sealing, improved lubrication, mechanical and thermal load symmetry, reduced bearing stresses, reduced running clearances, and reduced oil consumption. The <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> piston is a monolithic, squeeze-cast, fiber-reinforced aluminum piston. The connecting rod has a ball end that seats on a spherical saddle within the piston and is retained by a pair of aluminum bronze holder rings. The holder rings are secured by a threaded ring that mates with the piston. As part of the ongoing research and development activity, the Cummins Engine Company successfully completed a 100 -hr test of the <b>spherical</b> <b>joint</b> piston and connecting rod at LE- 55 peak steady-state engine conditions. In addition, a 100 -hr transient cycle test that varied engine conditions between LE- 55 no-load and LE- 55 full-load was successfully completed...|$|R

40|$|Demand on high {{precision}} motion {{has been increasing}} in recent years. Since performance of today's many mechanical systems requires high stiffness and accurate positioning capability, parallel manipulators gained popularity. Their superior architecture provides better load capacity and positioning accuracy over the serial ones. In this work, a popular parallel manipulator, Stewart Platform, has been studied. Stewart Platform is a positioning system that consists of a top plate (moving platform), a bottom plate (fixed base), and six extensible legs connecting the top plate to the bottom plate. This work includes design, analysis, control and testing of a complete positioning system. In order to achieve better accuracy over commonly used universal <b>joints,</b> magnets and <b>spherical</b> <b>joints</b> have been employed in the architecture. Flexure joints have been also analyzed to achieve higher precision levels. Because they eliminate friction and backlash, flexure joints would give better results than universal and <b>spherical</b> <b>joints.</b> Therefore, a parametric study for optimum hyperbolic flexure joints has been also presented. Desired performance of the proposed platform is {{six degrees of freedom}} with 500 nm minimum incremental motion. System uncertainties and inherent nonlinearities have been eliminated using sliding mode control. This type of control methodology allows stability in the presence of parametric uncertainties and external disturbances. Although analyses indicate system capability of less than 1 nm resolution, real performance is typically lower due to manufacturing imperfections and measurements errors.
