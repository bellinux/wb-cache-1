5|$|Beginning in the 1580s, {{a number}} of churches {{patterned}} after the Church of the Gesù in Rome had been built. Gothic and other older churches were increasingly being supplemented with Baroque style architectural additions, sculptures, wall paintings and other ornaments, which is conspicuous in many Polish churches today. The Royal Castle in Warsaw, after 1596 the main residence of the monarchs, was enlarged and rebuilt around 1611. The Ujazdów Castle (1620s) of the Polish kings {{turned out to be}} architecturally more influential, its design having <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> {{a number of}} Baroque magnate residencies.|$|E
5|$|Bolt got {{his first}} {{victories}} of the deployment on 23 September {{when he was with}} a flight of 15 VMF-214 aircraft escorting B-24 Liberators back from a raid on Kahili.

His wingman, Ed Harper, also claimed a victory. For the next several weeks, the squadron operated out of Munda in the Solomon Islands.|$|E
5|$|Drakengard, {{known as}} Drag-On Dragoon in Japan, {{is a series}} of action {{role-playing}} video games. The eponymous first game in the series was released in 2003 on the PlayStation 2, and has since <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a sequel, a prequel and a spin-off. It was conceived by Takamasa Shiba and Takuya Iwasaki as a gameplay hybrid between Ace Combat and Dynasty Warriors 2. The story was created by Shiba, Iwasaki, Yoko Taro and Sawako Natori, who were influenced by European folklore and popular anime series and movies of the day. Shiba, Yoko and Sawako have had involvement in every entry of the series since its debut.|$|E

5|$|During the Shuttle-Mir programme, {{a series}} of American Space Shuttle {{missions}} visited Mir between 1995 and 1998 {{in preparation for the}} construction of the International Space Station. After the construction of the International Space Station began in 1998, Russian resources were split between the two stations. In 2000, Rosaviakosmos signed an agreement with MirCorp to lease the station for commercial use, with the Soyuz TM-30 mission, intended to prepare the station for future use and conduct some commercial research, being flown in later that year. This was to have <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> more missions, including flights with space tourists, however due to the Russian government being concerned about MirCorp's ability to fund these missions, Rosaviakosmos decided against funding the continued operation of Mir.|$|E
5|$|However, in a {{field study}} {{published}} in 1987, researchers Cristina Ramo and Benjamin Busto found evidence of interbreeding in a population where the ranges of the scarlet and white ibises overlap along the coast and in the Llanos region of Colombia and Venezuela. They observed individuals of the two species mating and pairing, as well as hybrid ibises with pale orange plumage, or white plumage with occasional orange feathers; their proposal that these birds be classified as a single species, has <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> least one field guide. Hybrid ibises have also been recorded in Florida, where the scarlet ibis has been introduced into wild populations of American white ibis. Birds of intermediate to red plumage have persisted for generations.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, Rupert {{appears to}} have been {{involved}} in a plot to assassinate Oliver Cromwell, an event that would then have <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a coup, the landing of a small army in Sussex, and the restoration of Charles II. Charles himself is understood to have rejected the assassination proposal, but three conspirators—who implicated Rupert in the plan—were arrested and confessed in London. Rupert's presence at the royal court continued to be problematic; as in 1643, he was regarded by Edward Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon) and others as a bellicose figure and an obstacle to peace negotiations; in 1655 Rupert left for Germany.|$|E

5|$|In recent decades, South Dakota {{has been}} {{transformed}} from a state dominated by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps on interest rates.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the incident, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and USAF conducted an investigation, the results of which were released on 19 October 2007. The investigation concluded that nuclear weapons handling standards and procedures had not <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> numerous USAF personnel involved in the incident. As a result, four USAF commanders were relieved of their commands, numerous other USAF personnel were disciplined or decertified to perform certain types of sensitive duties, and further cruise missile transport missions from—and nuclear weapons operations at—Minot Air Force Base were suspended. In addition, the USAF issued new nuclear weapons handling instructions and procedures.|$|E
5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum, {{commonly}} known as the spiny puffball or the spring puffball, is a type of puffball mushroom in the genus Lycoperdon. The saprobic species has been found in Africa, Europe, Central America, and North America, where it grows on soil in deciduous woods, glades, and pastures. It has been proposed that North American specimens be considered a separate species, Lycoperdon americanum, but this suggestion has not <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> most authors. Molecular analysis indicates that L.echinatum is closely related to the puffball genus Handkea.|$|E

5|$|On August 13, 1898, the Spanish–American War {{ended with}} Spain ceding Puerto Rico to the United States. The Banco Español de Puerto Rico was renamed Bank of Porto Rico and issued bills {{equivalent}} to the United States dollar, creating the Puerto Rican dollar. In 1902, the First National Bank of Porto Rico issued banknotes in a parallel manner. Two more series were issued until 1913. After Puerto Rico's economy and monetary system was fully integrated into the United States' economic and monetary system, the Puerto Rican dollars were redeemed for those issued by the United States Treasury. The peso and dollar have <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> other contemporary issues, including commemorative banknotes, private currency, and a quarter coin designed with Fort San Felipe del Morro in the face.|$|E
5|$|Radirgy was ported in 2006 to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, and GameCube {{exclusively}} in Japan—of which {{the latter two}} featured exclusive gameplay modes. O~3 Entertainment planned to localize the GameCube version in North America under the title Radio Allergy, but the release was canceled. The game was later localized for the Wii in a compilation of MileStone shooters, Ultimate Shooting Collection. Critics found the game challenging and unique, but overall an average experimental shooter. Radirgy has <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> two titles, Radirgy Noa and Radirgy De Gojaru.|$|E

5|$|The astronauts planned {{placement}} of the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package (EASEP) and the U.S. flag by studying their landing site through Eagle twin triangular windows, which gave them a 60° field of view. Preparation required longer than the two hours scheduled. Armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his Portable Life Support System (PLSS). According to veteran Moon-walker John Young, a redesign of the LM to incorporate a smaller hatch had not <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a redesign of the PLSS backpack, so {{some of the highest}} heart rates recorded from Apollo astronauts occurred during LM egress and ingress.|$|E
5|$|The hairpin banksia is pollinated by and {{provides}} {{food for a}} wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. Its floral display and fine foliage have made it a popular garden plant with many horticultural selections available.
