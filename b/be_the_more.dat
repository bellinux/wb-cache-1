5|$|After the {{financial}} success of Dr. No, United Artists doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions to $2 {{million for the}} company's next film, From Russia with Love. The film was shot in Europe, which {{had turned out to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> profitable market for Dr. No. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who went to work on Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by Robert Brownjohn.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 8th {{century as}} {{architectural}} styles evolved, new elements were added as is evident in kasuga-zukuri (Kasuga Shrine and Hakusandō/Kasugadō at Enjō-ji), the flowing roof or nagare-zukuri (Shimogamo Shrine), hachiman-zukuri (Usa Shrine) and hiyoshi-zukuri (Hiyoshi Taisha). The nagare-zukuri continues to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> popular style, followed by the kasuga-zukuri. The honden of Ujigami Shrine dates to this period. At {{the end of the}} Heian period torii and fences were commonly replaced with two-storied gates and grand colonnades copied from temple architecture. The influence of the residential shinden-zukuri style of palaces and mansions is apparent in shrines such as Itsukushima Shrine.|$|E

5|$|Of the two, lateral {{dynamics}} {{has proven}} to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> complicated, requiring three-dimensional, multibody dynamic analysis {{with at least two}} generalized coordinates to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions. Exact solutions are not possible, and numerical methods must be used instead. Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found in print and online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis can be accomplished simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate.|$|E

The sea lions may {{respond to the}} dorsal fin of a killer whale and remain vigilant, even when encountering resident fish-eating pods. Sea lions are also common prey for white sharks. They have been found with scars made by attacks from both white sharks and shortfin mako sharks. Sharks attack sea lions by ambushing them while they are resting at the surface. Sea lions that are attacked in the hindquarters {{are more likely to}} survive and make it to the shore.|$|E

5|$|Strontium {{commonly}} {{occurs in}} nature, being the 15th most abundant element on Earth (its heavier congener barium being the 14th), estimated to average approximately 360parts per {{million in the}} Earth's crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral celestine (SrSO4) and the carbonate strontianite (SrCO3). Of the two, celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form, strontianite would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development.|$|E
5|$|The {{family moved}} to Berlin in 1811, leaving Hamburg in {{disguise}} fearing French revenge for the Mendelssohn bank's role in breaking Napoleon's Continental System blockade. Abraham and Lea Mendelssohn sought to give their children– Fanny, Felix, Paul and Rebecka– the best education possible. Fanny became a well-known pianist and amateur composer; originally Abraham had thought that she, rather than Felix, would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> musical. But at that time, it was not considered proper, by either Abraham or Felix, {{for a woman to}} have a career in music, so Fanny remained an active but non-professional musician. Abraham was also disinclined to allow Felix to follow a musical career until it became clear that he seriously intended to dedicate himself to it.|$|E
5|$|Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army (the renamed 16th Army) was tasked to {{take part}} in the {{offensive}} and was given an additional three infantry divisions and two tank corps, a force composed of fifteen divisions. Bagramyan, however, argued to STAVKA that its planning was too audacious in the hopes of repeating a successful encirclement like that in Uranus. He claimed that his forces would be overstretched and would have difficulty in attacking the entrenched German positions in Bolkhov. To avoid a repetition of the failure in Kharkov the previous year, he instead asked that the 61st Army from the Bryansk Front aid his 11th Guards in destroying the German forces in Bolkhov, thus eliminating the Ninth Army's protection from the north. He appealed to his front commander Vasily Sokolovsky as well the Bryansk's M. A. Reyter, both of whom rejected his proposal. In April, STAVKA recalled the main commanders of the Fronts and Armies to Moscow on a briefing of the preparations for the battle. Against the protestations of Sokolovsky and Reyter, Bagramyan proposed his alternative plan to Stalin, who agreed that it would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> correct course to follow. Bagramyan was given twenty days to prepare the 11th Guards Army and on 24 May reported that his forces were ready. The 11th Guards now was composed of 135,000 men, 280 armored fighting vehicles, 2,700 artillery pieces and several hundred planes to lend air support for the ground forces. Stalin, however, felt it necessary to further wear thin the fighting abilities of the German forces and delayed the offensive.|$|E

5|$|In February 1936, the Roeriches {{and their}} {{associates}} {{had attempted to}} obtain an injunction to prevent these actions. When the attempt failed, they sued Horch to regain what they believed to be their rightful authority {{to participate in the}} operation of the building and its component organizations. This case was settled on February 9, 1938, in favor of Horch. George Frankenthaler, the referee who decided the case, found that the Roeriches never possessed the authority they claimed. Horch alone administered the corporation that had the building constructed, ran the organizations that it housed, and obtained all the needed financing. In addition, he donated {{more than a million dollars}} of his own, while the Roeriches and their associates had contributed no money at all. Regarding allegations of deception, he found Horch to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> creditable witness.|$|E
5|$|The Louisiana Maneuvers pitted Krueger's Third Army against Lieutenant General Ben Lear's Second Army. The {{maneuvers}} were a test {{ground for}} doctrine and equipment, and gave senior commanders experience in maneuvering their formations. In the first phase, Krueger quickly proved himself to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> modern general. He responded adroitly to a changed battle situation by re-orienting his front from northeast to northwest, {{and was able}} to inflict a series of reverses on Lear's forces. In the second phase, Krueger had a superior force, and had to advance on Shreveport, Louisiana. Lear's forces conducted a stubborn withdrawal, demolishing bridges in order to slow Krueger down. Krueger responded by sending Major General George S. Patton, Jr.'s 2nd Armored Division on a wide flanking maneuver through Texas. Afterwards, Eisenhower became the head of the War Plans Division, and was replaced by Colonel Alfred M. Gruenther. After he too was transferred, Krueger replaced him with Colonel George B. Honnen.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} fiercest rivalry is with Millwall. The {{two sides are}} local rivals, having both formed {{originally}} around local companies, with players {{living in the same}} localities. The early history of both clubs are intertwined, with West Ham proving to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> successful in a number of meetings between the two teams at the time, resulting in West Ham being promoted at the expense of Millwall. Millwall later declined to join the fledgling Football League while West Ham went on to the top division and an FA Cup final. Later in the 1920s, the rivalry was intensified during strike action which Isle of Dogs-based companies (i.e., Millwall fans) refused to support, breeding ill will between the two camps, the bitterness of this betrayal enduring for years. In 1972, a Millwall supporter died at New Cross station after falling out of a train during a fight with West Ham fans.|$|E

5|$|Sega {{released}} the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994, {{at a price}} of JP¥44,800. Virtua Fighter, a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan.s 3D characters have a presence that 2D sprites just can't match. The characters really do seem 'alive', whether they're throwing a punch, unleashing a special move or reeling from a blow... The Saturn version of Virtua Fighter is an exceptional game in many respects. It's arguably the first true 'next generation' console game, fusing the best aspects of combat gameplay with groundbreaking animation and gorgeous sound (CD music and clear samples). In the arcades, Virtua Fighter made people stop and look. On the Saturn, it will make many people stop, look at their bank balance and then fork out for Sega's new machine. Over to you, Sony. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210173015/http://www.edge-online.com/reviews/virtua-fighter-review/ |archivedate=December 10, 2014 }} The only other first-party title available on launch day was Wan Chai Connection. Sega had wanted the launch to include both Clockwork Knight and Panzer Dragoon, but the latter was not ready in time. Fueled by the popularity of Virtua Fighter, Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>more</b> popular system. Meanwhile, Sega {{released the}} 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at {{less than half of}} the Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.|$|E
