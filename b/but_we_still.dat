The episode was originally scheduled to air in its regular half-hour time slot, but NBC later announced it would be expanded to fill an hour time slot beginning a half hour early, although it still counts as one official episode, similar to the earlier season episode [...] "Moving On". Rogers noted that [...] "we knew the last two episodes would be hour-longs, and The Finale might even end up running longer, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> {{had a lot of}} great storytelling to do leading up to them, and 'Livin' the Dream' was one that ultimately deserved to be an hour long episode as well!" ...|$|E

However, Jesse Rankins explained that they later decided to put the instrumental for [...] "Why Don't You Love Me" [...] in the email because they knew that Solange likes weird records, but, they made sure to send it last. Out of all the mainstream-inspired attempts The Bama Boyz sent to Solange, she eventually chose that last and most unexpected track and penned [...] "Why Don't You Love Me".

Toni Kroos, who was chosen as Man of the Match, added that as the Germans felt that in [...] "no game of the Cup, [...] played their best", the squad entered with the tactical knowledge on how to counter Brazil: [...] "we took all the balls, and scored the goals". Löw also declared the team had [...] "no euphoria" [...] during or after the game, as they knew that the 7–1 win meant nothing for the upcoming final, saying [...] "We didn't celebrate.

The notion of combining these two great passions in my life—cars and animation—was irresistible. When Joe (Ranft) and I first started talking about this film in 1998, we knew we wanted to do something with cars as characters. Around that same time, we watched a documentary called 'Divided Highways,' which dealt with the interstate highway and how it affected the small towns along the way. We were so moved by it and began thinking about what it must have been like in these small towns that got bypassed. That's when we started really researching Route 66, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> hadn't quite figured out what the story for the film was going to be. I used to travel that highway with my family as a child when we visited our family in St. Louis." ...|$|E

500|$|However Gardner's {{increasing}} {{desire for}} publicity, {{much of it}} ending up negative, caused conflict with Valiente {{and other members of}} his coven like Ned Grove and Derek Boothby. She felt that in repeatedly communicating with the press, he was compromising the coven's security. She was also not enthusiastic about two young people whom Gardner brought into the coven, Jack L. Bracelin and his girlfriend 'Dayonis', stating that [...] "a more qualid pair of spivs {{it would be hard to}} find indeed". Two factions emerged within the coven; Valiente led a broadly anti-publicity group, while Gardner led a pro-publicity one. In 1957, Valiente and Grove drew up a list of [...] "Proposed Rules of the Craft" [...] which were partly designed to curtail Gardner's publicity seeking. From his home in the Isle of Man, he responded that this was not necessary as a series of rules already existed, at which point he produced the Wiccan Laws. These laws limited the control of the High Priestess, which angered Valiente, who later realised that Gardner had simply made them up in response to her own Proposed Laws. In summer 1957, the coven split. According to Valiente, she and her followers [...] "had had enough of the Gospel according to St. Gerald; <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> believed that the real traditional witchcraft lived". According to Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White, [...] "Wicca had experienced its first great schism".|$|E
500|$|In the United States, {{the first}} three films in the Die Hard series were rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. Live Free or Die Hard, however, was edited to obtain a PG-13 rating. In some cases, {{alternate}} profanity-free dialogue was shot and used or swearing was cut out in post-production to reduce profanity. Director Len Wiseman commented on the rating, saying [...] "It was about three months into it , and I hadn't even heard that it was PG-13... But in the end, it {{was just trying to}} make the best Die Hard movie, not really thinking so much about what the rating would be." [...] Bruce Willis was upset with the studio's decision, stating, [...] "I really wanted this one {{to live up to the}} promise of the first one, which I always thought was the only really good one. That's a studio decision that is becoming more and more common, because they’re trying to reach a broader audience. It seems almost a courageous move to give a picture an R rating these days. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>still</b> made a pretty hardcore, smashmouth film." [...] Willis said he thought that viewers unaware that it was not an R-rated film would not suspect so due to the level and intensity of the action as well as the usage of some profanity, although he admitted these elements were less intense than in the previous films. He also said that this film was the best of the four: [...] "It's unbelievable. I just saw it last week. I personally think, it's better than the first one." ...|$|E
