500|$|The {{emotional}} {{tracks were}} considered the strongest {{part of the}} score, and were praised {{for their ability to}} musically reflect the various locales and characters seen in the game. The opening track [...] "Dark Dawn" [...] was similarly lauded for showcasing all the influences of the soundtrack in a single composition. The battle themes were described as a weaker area and were called either effective or repetitive, with Square Enix Music Online noting that [...] "Mitsuda has never <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> at composing interesting battle tracks". The final boss theme [...] "The One Who Bares Fangs at God" [...] received the most diverse comments, ranging from praises to criticism, due to its reliance on synth choral sound effects rather than a clear melody.

500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} split about Lazenby; {{he has been}} {{considered}} {{to have been the}} worst Bond, and has variously been described as [...] "laconic and humourless", [...] "a little stiff" [...] and [...] "annoying and smug". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a good actor and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache". The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement". Pauline Kael called Lazenby [...] "quite a dull fellow" [...] in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker. However, Peter R. Hunt, director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying [...] "he would have made a very credible Bond and <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> indeed".|$|E
500|$|She {{lived for}} a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but {{returned}} to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> friends for millions of years and I thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life". Cynthia recalled, [...] "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." [...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't do that in those days". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] about an affair he was having, but rendered it in [...] "gobbledegook" [...] so Cynthia would not know.|$|E

500|$|Grey's Anatomy {{has been}} well {{received}} among critics. The show holds an average of 71% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and 7.7/10 score at IMDB site. The A.V. Club gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows {{in the quality of}} the hit medical drama saying, [...] "The quality arc for the show is all over the place, starting with a steady build in the first season, then skyrocketing into phenomenon in season two, then leveling off and dipping in season three, before having some seriously bumpy moments in seasons four (interrupted by the writers’ strike) and five. The climb begins again in season six" [...] Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly in a review wrote, [...] " [...] I believe the show’s best season to date is season 2. Let me make it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season." [...] adding, [...] "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey’s Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as [...] "McDreamy.", the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods when it seems as if Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." [...] The site lauded the show saying, [...] "On average, it’s <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a good soap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family." ...|$|E

2500|$|Where {{languages}} {{are derived from}} a very distant ancestor, and are thus more distantly related, the comparative method becomes impracticable. In particular, attempting to relate two reconstructed proto-languages by the comparative method has not generally produced results that have met with wide acceptance. The method has also not <b>been</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> at unambiguously identifying sub-families and different scholars have produced conflicting results, for example in Indo-European. A number of methods based on statistical analysis of vocabulary {{have been developed to}} try and overcome this limitation, such as lexicostatistics and mass comparison. The former uses lexical cognates like the comparative method but the latter uses only lexical similarity. The theoretical basis of such methods is that vocabulary items can be matched without a detailed language reconstruction and that comparing enough vocabulary items will negate individual inaccuracies. [...] Thus they can be used to determine relatedness but not to determine the proto-language.|$|E

Haygarth adds that Tufton was the first player ever to be recorded as being given out leg before wicket (lbw). This happened in a match at Moulsey Hurst in August 1795, when Tufton played for an England XIII versus a Surrey XI. The bowler was John Wells. In his notes about that game, Haygarth says: [...] "In this match, [...] "leg before wicket" [...] is found scored for the first time. In Britcher's printed score-book, Mr J. Tufton is in this match put down as bowled merely, and the leg before wicket added in a note. At first, when any one was got out in this way, it was marked down as simply bowled, and the leg before wicket omitted".|$|E
