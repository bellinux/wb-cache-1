The bill <b>of</b> <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> Natural Persons in Lithuania was proposed as early as in spring 2009 (No. XIP- 450, 24. 03. 2009). The bill met with a considerable amount of criticism and was postponed for further improvement. By decree No. 413 of April 7, 2010, the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approved the concept <b>of</b> the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons of the Republic of Lithuania. The principal goal of the concept was to consolidate the main provisions of the future law. The Law <b>of</b> <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> Natural Persons of the Republic of Lithuania has come into effect since March 1, 2013. The authors of the article overview the concept and models <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons and introduce the advantages and shortcomings of the institute <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons. Based on scientific sources of Lithuanian and foreign authors, the article offers a theoretically systemized version of the main reasons determining the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons. The reasons fall into two categories – economic and social. The article is mainly targeted at defining the reasons that determine the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons in Lithuania. To achieve this goal, a quantitative survey of the questionnaires of natural persons affected by bankruptcy has been taken for the basis. In their questionnaires, the natural persons affected by bankruptcy have been asked to evaluate the reasons <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> The results have been analyzed with the help of factor analysis and statistically processed using the SPSS statistical software package. Key words: <b>bankruptcy,</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons, reasons for the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural person...|$|R

Second, how is the attitude of the Supreme Court towards the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> solvable companies in Indonesia? Third, how is the ideal concept of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s corporate bankruptcy law in the future? This was a normative research. This research concludes, first, there is a relationship between the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> solvable and viable (prospective) companies in the Commercial Court and liquidation concept implemented in Bankruptcy Law. Second, related to the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> solvent companies in the Commercial Court, the Supreme Court calls off the adjudication of the Commercial Court according to several considerations, including the fact that the companies are still prospective and deserve an opportunity to continue their business and the bankruptcy proposal cannot be proven in a simple way. Third, the ideal concepts of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s bankruptcy law in the future are (i) Separating the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> corporate and individual. (ii) Insolvent becomes a standard <b>of</b> corporate <b>bankruptcy.</b> (iii) Implementing the principles of business continuity which becomes a concept of corporate rescue in the norm <b>of</b> Corporate <b>Bankruptcy</b> Law or Limited Liability Company Acts. (iv) There is a stricter regulation <b>of</b> revocation <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> companies which no longer own their assets...|$|R
