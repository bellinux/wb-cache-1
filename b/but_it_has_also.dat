5|$|Oryzomys nelsoni is an extinct rodent of María Madre Island, Nayarit, Mexico. Within {{the genus}} Oryzomys {{of the family}} Cricetidae, {{it may have been}} most closely related to the {{mainland}} species O.albiventer. Since its first description in 1898, most authors have regarded it as a distinct species, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been classified as a mere subspecies of the marsh rice rat (O.palustris).|$|E

5|$|The Polish {{cochineal}} {{lives on}} herbaceous plants growing in sandy and arid, infertile soils. Its primary host plant is the perennial knawel (Scleranthus perennis), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> {{been known to}} feed on plants of 20 other genera, including mouse-ear hawkweed (Hieracium pilosella), bladder campion (Silene inflata), velvet bent (Agrostis canina), Caragana, smooth rupturewort (Herniaria glabra), strawberry (Fragaria), and cinquefoil (Potentilla).|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow {{appears to}} be {{abundant}} in most habitats across most of its very large range, and in the some areas it {{is among the most}} common birds. In Southeast Asia, its range has contracted at lower elevations due to global warming, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> moved higher at high elevations and it remains common. Although its global population has not been quantified, it is assessed for the IUCN Red List as least concern for global extinction.|$|E
5|$|Warriors have {{received}} mostly positive reviews, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been criticised for being confusing {{due to its}} large number of characters. Critics have compared it to the Redwall series, though one reviewer commented that the series is less elegantly written. Although nominated for several awards, Warriors has yet to receive any major literary prizes. The series has reached the New York Times Bestseller List and has found popularity in many countries, including Trinidad, Germany and China.|$|E

5|$|Amanita rubrovoltata {{mushrooms}} grow {{in groups}} on the ground. Amanita species form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The original Japanese collections were made in forests dominated by Japanese beech (Fagus crenata), <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been found growing near Quercus luecotrichophora, Rhododendron arboreum, and Myrica esculenta in India, in Castanopsis-Schima forest in Nepal, and in Castanopsis indica plantations in the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|Hanna-Barbera {{dismissed}} creator Peter Lawrence in 1996 {{and hired}} new producers {{to finish the}} show. John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti completed Lawrence's work; David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston wrote new episodes with reworked character designs akin to those of classic Quest. Each team produced half of the show's fifty-two episodes. While Lawrence's team crafted stories of real-world mystery and exploration, later writers used science fiction and paranormal plots. Turner supported the show through a massive marketing campaign with thirty-three licensees. Real Adventures debuted with an unprecedented wide release on Cartoon Network, TBS, and TNT, airing twenty-one times per week. Critics have debated {{the merits of the}} show's animation, writing, and spirit compared to classic Quest, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> received praise in those categories.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{implies that}} this {{occurred}} {{more or less}} directly after Labraunda, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been suggested that Pedasus occurred the following year (496 BC), giving the Carians time to regroup. The Persians arrived at Pedasus during the night, and the ambush was sprung to great effect. The Persian army was annihilated and Daurises and the other Persian commanders were slain. The disaster at Pedasus seems to have created a stalemate in the land campaign, and there was apparently little further campaigning in 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E
5000|$|The letter, {{which was}} sent on July 16, 1941, {{is one that}} functionalists arguing the {{bottom-up}} approach utilize as evidence. Aly goes deeper and explains that the letter had not only been written by Höppner, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> been discussed at a lower level. Götz Aly writes, [...] "Thus it was the lowest ranks of the resettlement apparatus that thought up things which, it was said, sometimes sounded fantastic." ...|$|R

[...] There was {{something}} in the way he said it that made, between them, more of an equality than she <b>had</b> yet imagined; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> more the effect of raising her up than of letting him down, and what it did with her was shown by the sound of her assent.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the merger}} of the schools in 1992, the school was {{referred}} to officially on its main outdoor signage as [...] "Turner Fenton Secondary School," [...] <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> adopted a secondary brand name [...] "Turner Fenton Campus" [...] used on school letterhead. In the early 2000s (decade), the school board forced Turner Fenton to standardize its name, because the school had not filed the proper forms upon its creation in 1992.|$|R
5|$|Mindaugas and his {{antagonist}} Daniel {{reached a}} reconciliation in 1255; the Black Ruthenian lands {{were transferred to}} Roman, Daniel's son. Afterwards Mindaugas's son Vaišvilkas received baptism {{as a member of}} the Orthodox faith, becoming a monk and later founding a convent and monastery. Tautvilas's antagonism was temporarily resolved when he recognized Mindaugas's superiority and received Polatsk as a fiefdom. A direct confrontation with the Mongols occurred in 1258 or 1259, when Berke Khan sent his general Burundai to challenge Lithuanian rule, ordering Daniel and other regional princes to participate. The Novgorod Chronicle describes the following action as a defeat of the Lithuanians, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been seen as a net gain for Mindaugas.|$|E
5|$|Such issues made {{attempts}} to codify the compositions {{in a uniform}} manner impossible. An example of this could be found among the Maguindanao where the word binalig is used by contemporary musicians as a name for one of the rhythmic modes associated with kangungudan <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been used as a term designating a “new” style. Another example concerns the discrepancy among “old” and “new” genres. With “new pieces” continuously proliferating even up till now, pieces only created decades ago are now considered “old” even though this is considered a tradition spanning many centuries. These differences could sometimes make discussing this repertoire and the modes and styles within it a bit confounding.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} {{different}} circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues produced by British artists was very different in tone from that created by African Americans, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world {{and in some cases}} American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. In order to sustain their careers most British R artists soon moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music. Many from the 60s helped pioneer psychedelic, and eventually progressive, hard rock and heavy metal, mixing in elements of world, folk and classical music. Others from the 1970s and 1980s, helped shape new wave and post-punk music and had a major impact on later genres, including Britpop. As a result, British rhythm and blues has been a major component of the sound of rock music.|$|E
50|$|When the Cold War ended, IIASA’s {{sponsoring}} {{countries could}} have said “mission accomplished” and disbanded the Institute. IIASA had certainly helped foster mutual understanding among scientists from East and West. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> done more than this. IIASA had shown the scientific benefits of bringing together different nationalities and disciplines to work toward common goals. Indeed, this approach has been widely imitated, for example, in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme.|$|R

5|$|Daedaleopsis confragosa is a lignicolous fungus that {{produces}} a decay of sapwood. It causes white rot, a type of wood decay in which lignin is degraded and cellulose remains as a light-colored residue. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups, sometimes in tiers, in the wounds of living trees. Its preferred host is willow, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been found on birch and other hardwoods. Fruiting usually occurs from June to December, but the hard shelves can persist year-round. In North America, the species is most common in eastern locales, but rare in western regions. It is common in Europe, {{and is one of}} the 100 most common fungi in the United Kingdom. Its European range extends east to the Urals. In Asia it is widely distributed, having been recorded from China, western Maharashtra (India), Iran, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion. The piers {{to the south and}} north were somewhat lower than those to the east and west. The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the south and north, each again featuring a vaulted roof. The relation of the Church of Christ Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself. It is known that the chapel was placed atop an elevated platform, and 18th-century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E
5|$|The puffball {{is widely}} distributed, {{and has been}} {{recorded}} in Africa (Zimbabwe), Asia (China, India, Iran, Mongolia, and Yemen), South America (Argentina, Chile and Uruguay), North America, Australia, and New Zealand. In Europe it is found in southern Scandinavia and is widespread {{to the south of}} the continent. Although it was reported in Scotland in 2010 (its first appearance on the British mainland), the grassland habitat where it was found has since become heavily eroded, and may be unsuitable for future appearances of the species. Mycenastrum corium is a threatened species in Europe, and is listed as vulnerable in the Regional Red List of Poland. In North America, it is most common in western regions of the United States and Canada, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been recorded in eastern Canada. Poorly known in Mexico, it has been recorded from Baja California, Chihuahua, Nuevo León, San Luis Potosi, Sonora, Mexico City. The variety M.corium var. diabolicum occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa, tropical Asia, the Caribbean, and South America.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} the {{evidence}} as {{to the character of}} the prisoners went to show that they were men of unimpeachable integrity and respectability. An impression unfavorable to Paradise might have been created {{by the fact that he}} was a professional pugilist and a man of hasty temper; <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> transpired that he had on several occasions rendered assistance to the police, thereby employing his skill and strength in the interests of law and order. As to his temper, it accounted for the quarrel which the police--knowing his profession--had mistaken for a prize-fight.|$|R

50|$|In 1934 the {{prototype}} was built and on 22 June transported to Puck - {{a base of}} the Naval Aviation Squadron (MDLot). It appeared there, that it was tail-heavy on water, and it demanded some modifications, like lengthening engine nacelles towards front. It first flew on 8 April 1935 (some sources: 10 April). Initially the plane was kept in secret. The design was found satisfactory, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>also</b> faults, like moving of centre of gravity during flight and low fuselage rigidity. The prototype was modified then and returned from the factory for further trials on 30 October 1935.|$|R
