5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> whale {{and most}} other {{characters}} are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size {{compared to the other}} characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able to shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs' residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole.|$|E

King Candy hacks the game's code, obtaining Ralph's medal, which he offers {{to him in}} exchange for preventing Vanellope from racing. He explains that if Vanellope wins and becomes playable, her glitches would {{be brought to the}} attention of players, their game would be unplugged and Vanellope would die, unable to leave the game <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> glitch. A reluctant Ralph agrees, trashing Vanellope's kart. He returns to his own game, but notices Vanellope's image on the side of the Sugar Rush cabinet, and realizes she was meant to be a playable character.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} to include girls as full {{members of the}} BSA was put into the public spotlight most notably by Sydney Ireland. Ireland, age 16 in 2017, had unofficially been participating in Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts with her brother for twelve years, completing merit badges and the Arrow of Light, {{but none of this}} was officially recognized <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> girl. Ireland and her family started a Change.org petition to the BSA leadership calling for equal membership. Ireland's petition gained media attention and utilized an email campaign for supporters to contact BSA leadership. It was supported by Scouts for Equality and endorsed by the National Organization for Women. The BSA leadership was receptive and unanimously approved new programs allowing girls and young women into Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts.|$|E

25|$|In Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, Lacus Clyne is the {{daughter}} of PLANT Supreme Council Chairman Siegel Clyne. Often seen with Haro machines, Lacus is one of the genetically enhanced humans known as Coordinators whose career as an idol singer has brought her enormous popularity. When she is dispatched to the ruins of Junius Seven, her vessel is attacked by an Earth Alliance battleship, a faction composed of Natural that oppose PLANT. Her lifepod is subsequently rescued by the mobile suit GAT-X105 Strike and brought to the Earth Alliance ship Archangel. There Lacus befriends the Strike pilot Kira Yamato while most of the others remain indifferent <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Coordinator. In the following battle, ZAFT forces attacking the Archangel are forced to retreat after Lacus is used as a hostage by Natarle Badgiruel. Disgusted by this action, Kira escorts Lacus back to ZAFT in secret. He hands her over to Athrun Zala, who is engaged to Lacus. Late in the war, a wounded Kira is brought to Lacus home by her friend Reverend Malchio. As Kira is nursed back to health, he resolves to keeping fighting in order {{to find a way to}} end the war. In response, Lacus helps Kira steal the mobile suit ZGMF-X10A Freedom. Because of this, Lacus and her father Siegel are declared as traitors and the latter is killed by ZAFT soldiers. Lacus steals the ship Eternal and joins the Orb Union-owned Kusanagi and the recently defected Archangel to form the Three Ships Alliance, a group dedicated to stopping the war. Before the last battle to stop both the Earth Alliance and ZAFT, Lacus gives Kira a ring, asking him to come back safely to her.|$|E

In reply, journalist Peter Hartcher wrote, [...] "She was a woman when she was popular; she can't be unpopular now because she's a woman.

In addition, one woman {{has served as the}} Lieutenant Governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, under Gov. Parris Glendening from 1995 to 2003. Another woman, Kristen Cox, who was the Secretary of Disabilities, unsuccessfully ran for Lieutenant Governor as the running mate of the incumbent Governor Robert Ehrlich, when the Lieutenant Governor at that time, Michael Steele, left office to run for the U.S. Senate.

500|$|Röhrl {{inherited}} the win {{and became the}} first two-time world champion in rallying. Having lost her father, Mouton did not dwell on losing the title. Röhrl had earlier conceded that he [...] "would have accepted second place in the championship to Mikkola", but not to Mouton: [...] "This is not because I doubt her capabilities as a driver, but <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> woman." [...] He believed that defeat would have devalued his performances. At the RAC, Mouton edged out Toivonen to take second place behind Mikkola. This result made Audi the first German marque to win the manufacturers' world title. At the inaugural Autosport Awards gala, Mouton won the International Rally Driver of the Year award.|$|E

But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure and didn't come back. It is a huge mystery, it is something people can identify with." [...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case.

500|$|As a {{displaced}} girl, Maya's pain is worsened by {{an awareness}} of her displacement. [...] She is [...] "the forgotten child", and must {{come to terms with}} [...] "the unimaginable reality" [...] of being unloved and unwanted; she lives in a hostile world that defines beauty in terms of whiteness and that rejects her simply <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Black girl. Maya internalizes the rejection she has experienced – her belief in her own ugliness was [...] "absolute". McPherson believes that the concept of family, or what she calls [...] "kinship concerns", in Angelou's books must be understood {{in the light of the}} children's displacement at the beginning of Caged Bird. Being sent away from their parents was a psychological rejection, and resulted in a quest for love, acceptance, and self-worth for both Maya and Bailey.|$|E

500|$|Despite being {{popular with}} many, the {{character}} of Ruth has also gained much criticism over the years. In 2007, Karen Price from the Western Mail called Ruth a [...] "much-loved character" [...] and The Scotsman's Fordyce Maxwell called Ruth [...] "the archetype of common sense and forward planning". Victoria Summerley from The Independent noted the character was [...] "instantly recognisable" [...] <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Geordie and bemoaned the fact [...] "poor inoffensive Ruth" [...] was disliked {{by some of the}} more hardcore fans because of this. Nicholas Lezard from the same publication disliked Ruth, branding her [...] "highly irritating". He later thought the scriptwriters had created in David and Ruth [...] "the only couple in the Western Hemisphere who are delighted that their parents are coming for Christmas." [...] Ruth and David were described by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as [...] "the series' golden couple — the future Phil and Jill".

500|$|According to Warren French {{from the}} University of Wales, Godwin's works {{are most often}} seen as having two primary themes: gender roles and {{southern}} settings. French said Godwin herself disapproves of being categorized, which she feels creates [...] "externally imposed limitations" [...] on the themes she covers. However scholars continue to attempt to put her work into a distinctive literary category. In her early works Godwin {{was seen as a}} [...] "woman" [...] writer, because her books appealed to a mostly female audience and <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> woman. After publishing A Southern Family she began being identified as a southern writer. According to The Times (London), Godwin has a [...] "pesky resistance to categorisation" [...] and she often changes themes even after being commercially successful with one. Academic Lihong Xie said Godwin could be identified with the literary tradition of the Bildungsroman, which focuses on the moral and psychological development of a character. Many other critics posit that a quest for meaning and self-identification are Godwin's primary themes.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} Tennyson's other poems, {{there is a}} strong {{connection}} between the character Mariana and Tennyson's other female characters. Both [...] "Mariana" [...] and [...] "Oriana" [...] have characters that experience a mental imprisonment, which are revealed in the poetic refrains. However, Oriana is able to have control over her own story when she serves as narrator of it while Mariana is denied control by Tennyson's use of a third-person narrative structure. The difference is further compounded by Oriana's imprisonment coming from her own memories while Mariana's is the external results of her lover having not returned. The character Fatima of Fatima is connected to [...] "Mariana" [...] simply <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reversal of Mariana's character: Fatima, like Mariana, waits for her lover but suffers from an intense passion that causes her to lose control over her mind while also being able to experience the world around her. The character Oenone of [...] "Oenone" [...] is a combination of aspects from both Mariana's and Fatima's characters. In the revised version Mariana in the South, the second Mariana is similar to the Lady of Shalott in that they both live in a world between fantasy and reality.|$|E
