Methods: Sixty-two RVO patients treated in our hospital between Jan. 2013 and Oct. 2014 were randomly divided into Control Group (30 patients; Benda-zol tablets) and Treatment Group (32 patients, <b>Bendazol</b> tablets + SS injections), each with a fol-low-up period of 6 months. Statistical analysis was then performed on changes in visual acuity, central retinal thickness (CRT) and retinal circulation time (RCT) before and after the treatment. Results: After treatment, both Control Group and Treatment Group witnessed an improvement on visual acuity (Control Group: t = 2. 103, p = 0. 044; Treatment Group: t = 8. 021, p = 0. 000). Visual acuity could be greatly improved in Treatment Group when compared with Control Group, with sig-nificant differences (p < 0. 01). Macular edema could be greatly relieved in Treatment Group meas-ured by CRT (t = 2. 571, p = 0. 007) while the difference was of no statistical significance in Control Group (t = 1. 016, p = 0. 070). RCT were remarkably shortened in both groups (Control Group: t = 43. 83, p = 0. 000; Treatment Group: t = 27. 34, p = 0. 000), and when compared with Control group, the changes in Treatment Group were more significant (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: SS injection coul...|$|E
