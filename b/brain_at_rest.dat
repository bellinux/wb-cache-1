Freeman [6] provides a rare exception to this, describing a hierarchy of attractors, from point attractor dynamics under deep anaesthesia, to chaos in perception. Nonetheless, the importance of attractor dynamics in cortical activity is well documented, with significant implications for the <b>brain</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and while performing tasks [7 – 10].|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of a structured pattern of neuronal activity in the <b>brain</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> has been consistently reported in the neuroscience literature. Multiple techniques, such as fMRI, MEG and EEG, showed that spontaneous, slow fluctuations of cerebral activity are temporally coherent within distributed functional networks resembling those evoked by sensory, motor, and cognitive paradigms. Among these networks, the Default Mode network gained large interest because of its anatomical and functional architecture. In fact, this network seems to reflect the default brain activity at rest {{and it has been}} associated with internal mentation, autobiographical memory, thinking about one's future, theory of mind, self-referential and affective decision making. What processing demands are shared in common across such a variety of tasks is presently unclear, and to disentangle such high level tasks into component processes is challenging. Here, we address some of these aspects by reviewing the current MEG studies on this network. In fact, while MEG data confirm the observed fMRI spatial topography, some new intriguing temporal and frequency properties of this network are revealed. Such findings enrich the original fMRI scenario on the DMN functional roles in terms of internal coupling and cross-network communication in the <b>brain</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest.</b> The Default Mode Network's internal coupling seems to be characterized by slow frequencies in the alpha and beta range and the cross-network interaction reveals that the DMN plays {{a central role in the}} communication across many different resting state networks...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the functional patterns of the brain observed at rest using fMRI are sustained by a structural architecture of axonal fiber bundles. As neuroimaging techniques advance with time, the relationship between structure and function has become the object of many studies in neuroscience. As recently suggested, the well defined connectivity structure found in the brain can be used to understand the self organization of the <b>brain</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> as well as to infer the functional connectivity patterns of the brain using different models, such as the Kuramoto model which studies synchronization, and the 2 -dimensional classical Ising model, which studies the global dynamics of the brain at the critical temperature. These models were successful in capturing the underlying properties of the brain. To extend this understanding, our objective is to develop the generalized Ising model following the lesson from the 2 -dimensional Ising model, as it could be simulated using the anatomical structure of the brain. This model can then be used to study functional information integration and segregation in the <b>brain</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest.</b> Thus the primary research question would be: can the generalized Ising model explain the functional behaviour of the resting brain at the critical temperature ? Preliminary analyses were carried out to determine the critical temperature of the models and to compare the correlation distributions. Further analyses were carried out using graph theory considering the brain as a network. By observing the results obtained from our simulations, it can be inferred that there is a temperature that is different from the critical temperature of the model at which the generalized Ising model shows a match with the empirical functional connectivity. At that temperature, the generalized Ising model could be used to study the global dynamics, as well as the local dynamics of the brain...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMultivariate pattern {{analysis}} and statistical machine learning techniques are attracting increasing interest from the neuroimaging community. Researchers and clinicians are also increasingly {{interested in the}} study of functional-connectivity patterns of <b>brains</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and how these relations might change in conditions like Alzheimer's disease or clinical depression. In this study we investigate the efficacy of a specific multivariate statistical machine learning technique to perform patient stratification from functional-connectivity patterns of <b>brains</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest.</b> Whilst the majority of previous approaches to this problem have employed support vector machines (SVMs) we investigate the performance of Bayesian Gaussian process logistic regression (GP-LR) models with linear and non-linear covariance functions. GP-LR models can be interpreted as a Bayesian probabilistic analogue to kernel SVM classifiers. However, GP-LR methods confer a number of benefits over kernel SVMs. Whilst SVMs only return a binary class label prediction, GP-LR, being a probabilistic model, provides a principled estimate of the probability of class membership. Class probability estimates are a measure of the confidence the model has in its predictions, such a confidence score may be extremely useful in the clinical setting. Additionally, if miss-classification costs are not symmetric, thresholds can be set to achieve either strong specificity or sensitivity scores. Since GP-LR models are Bayesian, computationally expensive cross-validation hyper-parameter grid-search methods can be avoided. We apply these methods to a sample of 77 subjects; 27 with a diagnosis of probable AD, 50 with a diagnosis of a-MCI and a control sample of 39. All subjects underwent a MRI examination at 3 T to obtain a 7 minute and 20 second resting state scan. Our results support the hypothesis that GP-LR models can be effective at performing patient stratification: the implemented model achieves 75 % accuracy disambiguating healthy subjects from subjects with amnesic mild cognitive impairment and 97 % accuracy disambiguating amnesic mild cognitive impairment subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, accuracies are estimated using a held-out test set.

Hence, activity associated with high-dimensional strange attractors could occur more frequently than so far assumed. This aspect has also relevance as regards multistable behavior, given that Liley’s model can support multistable dynamics induced by different attractors [15]. Multistability has in fact been shown to capture aspects of brain activity in a variety of important neurological settings, including perceptual decision making and critical behavior of the <b>brain</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> [23 – 25].

Synesthetic experiences are involuntary, idiosyncratic, and consistent over time (Rouw et al., 2011).

While better cognitive functioning is predicted by low theta power in the <b>brain</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> resting state (RS) theta power declines with age, but sentence comprehension deteriorates in old age. We resolve this paradox showing that sentence comprehension declines due to changes in RS theta power within domain-general brain networks known to support successful sentence comprehension, while low RS theta power within the left-hemispheric dorso-frontal language network predicts intact sentence comprehension. The two RS theta networks were also found to functionally decouple relative to their independent internal coupling. Thus, both temporally and spatially distinct RS theta oscillations dissociate a language-specific from a domain-general processing mechanism...|$|E

Despite this hypothesis, many rest state paradigms {{do not act}} directly upon the rest state and therefore cannot confirm hypotheses about its mechanisms. To address this challenge, we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) to study brain's relaxation toward rest following a transient perturbation. Specifically, TMS targeted either the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), i. e. part of the Default Mode Network (DMN) or the superior parietal lobule (SPL), involved in the Dorsal Attention Network. TMS was triggered by a given brain state, namely an increase in occipital alpha rhythm power. Following the initial TMS-Evoked Potential, TMS at MPFC enhances the induced occipital alpha rhythm, called Event Related Synchronisation, with a longer transient lifetime than TMS at SPL, and a higher amplitude. Our findings show a strong coupling between MPFC and the occipital alpha power. Although the rest state is organized around a core of resting state networks, the DMN functionally takes a special role among these resting state networks...|$|E

Comparing the connectomes of C. elegans, cats, macaques and humans to surrogate networks in which either modules or hubs are destroyed, we find that functional complexity always decreases in the perturbed networks. A comparison between simulated and empirically obtained resting-state functional connectivity indicates that the human <b>brain,</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest,</b> lies in a dynamical state that reflects the largest complexity its anatomical connectome can host. Last, we generalise the topology of neural connectomes into a new hierarchical network model that successfully combines modular organisation with rich-club forming hubs.

The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the role of spontaneous brain activity at rest in individual differences in reading skills in a large sample of participants (N = 263). Specifically, we correlated individuals’ word-reading skill with their fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) of the whole <b>brain</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and found that the fALFFs of both the bilateral precentral gyrus (PCG) and superior temporal plane (STP) were positively associated with reading skills.

A cross-validation confirmed that the individual differences in word-reading skills were reliably correlated with the fALFF values of the bilateral PCG and STP. A follow-up task-based fMRI experiment revealed that the reading-related regions overlapped with regions showing a higher response to sentences than to pseudo-sentences (strings of pseudo-words), suggesting the resting-state brain activity partly captures the characteristics of task-based brain activity.

Functional brain {{networks}} produce connected {{low frequency}} patterns of activity when the <b>brain</b> is <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> {{which can be}} analyzed with resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) by fitting general linear models for signals acquired at a pre-defined seed region and other regions of interest (ROIs).

Spatio-temporal or spatio-spectral models can incorporate the spatial correlations in fMRI data. To date, these models have not targeted rs-fMRI connectivity analysis. Herein, we expand a spatio-spectral model from fMRI analysis based on several ROIs to whole brain rs-fMRI connectivity analysis. Our model captures distance-dependent local correlation (within an ROI), dis-tance-independent global correlation (between ROIs), and temporal correlations for whole brain rs-fMRI connectivity analysis with or without confounders.

Aerobic glycolysis {{is present in the}} normal human <b>brain</b> <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and increases locally during increased neuronal activity; yet its many biological functions have received scant attention because of a prevailing energy-centric focus on the role of glucose as substrate for oxidative phosphorylation. As an initial step in redressing this neglect, we measured the regional distribution of aerobic glycolysis with positron emission tomography in 33 neurologically normal young adults at rest. We show that the distribution of aerobic glycolysis in the brain is differentially present in previously well-described functional areas. In particular, aerobic glycolysis is significantly elevated in medial and lateral parietal and prefrontal cortices. In contrast, the cerebellum and medial temporal lobes have levels of aerobic glycolysis significantly below the brain mean. The levels of aerobic glycolysis are not strictly related to the levels of brain energy metabolism. For example, sensory cortices exhibit high metabolic rates for glucose and oxygen consumption but low rates of aerobic glycolysis. These striking regional variations in aerobic glycolysis in the normal human brain provide an opportunity to explore how brain systems differentially use the diverse cell biology of glucose in support of their functional specializations in health and disease...|$|E

This work involves the analysis of low frequency magnetoencephalographic recordings of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and controls performing both attentional as well as perceptual tasks. Single channel independent component analysis is used to isolate low frequency brain signals within the data in the presence of higher frequency brain activity and artifacts. Phase synchrony analysis is then carried out between the components of channels of interest to quantify any interaction between distant brain regions within the default-mode network. Preliminary results show variations in the phase locking between ADHD and controls, and indicate a corresponding change in phase synchrony between the corresponding <b>brain</b> regions <b>at</b> periods of <b>rest</b> and when tasks are being performed...|$|R
40|$|NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{was used}} to test recent proposals that the additional energy required for brain activation is provided through nonoxidative glycolysis. Using localized NMR spectroscopic methods, the rate of C 4 -glutamate isotopic turnover from infused [1 -(13) C]glucose was measured in the somatosensory cortex of rat <b>brain</b> both <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> and during forepaw stimulation. Analysis of the glutamate turnover data using a mathematical model of cerebral glucose metabolism showed that the tricarboxylic acid cycle flux [(V(TCA) ] increased from 0. 49 +/- 0. 03 <b>at</b> <b>rest</b> to 1. 48 +/- 0. 82 micromol/g/min during stimulation (P < 0. 01). The minimum fraction of C 4 -glutamate derived from C 1 -glucose was approximately 75 %, and this fraction was found in both the resting and stimulated rats. Hence, the percentage increase in oxidative cerebral metabolic rate of glucose use (CMRglc) equals the percentage increases in V(TCA) and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO 2). Comparison with previous work for the same rat model, which measured total CMRglc [Ueki, M., Linn, F. & Hossman, K. A. (1988) J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 8, 486 - 4941, indicates that oxidative CMRglc supplies the majority of energy during sustained brain activation...|$|R
