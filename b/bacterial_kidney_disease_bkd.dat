40|$|Abstract. –In recent years, {{a decline}} in chinook salmon Oncorhyncus tshawytscha {{abundance}} in Lake Michigan {{has been attributed to}} declining forage availability, increased incidence of <b>bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (<b>BKD),</b> as well as an interaction between these factors. Concern has also been expressed about the alewife Alosa pseudoharengus population's ability to support higher stocking levels of salmonines in the lake. Given these concerns, and the potential biases involved in evaluating chinook salmon diet using sport-caught fish, we conducted a study to evaluate the diet of chinook salmon in eastern Lake Michigan. Graded-mesh nylon gill nets were used to sample chinook salmon. Sampling was designed to determine the influence of chinook salmo...|$|E

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (BRD) {{has been}} and remains a chronic {{contributory}} problem limiting the productivity of salmon of the Columbia River Basin. Control of this disease will not come easily, but {{it would lead to}} a tremendous increase in the health and numbers of salmon populations. Vaccination of salmon of Renibacterium salmoninarum (KDB) is a potentially successful method of controlling this disease. To date, however, no successful vaccine has been developed for general use. A possible solution to this problem,and thus the goal of this research, is to isolate the antigenic components of KDB and enhance their ability to activate the host defenses. This will be accomplished by the chemical modification of these antigens with potent immunomodulatory substances. These modified antigens will then be tested for their effectiveness in inducing immunity to BKD and thereby preventing the disease. The goal of the project's third year was to test the immunogenicity and prophylactic value in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) of various chemical conjugates of Renibacterium salmoninarum cells and major antigens. This was accomplished by assessing the serum antibody response, the cellular immune response (cellular proliferation), and the kinetics of mortality after Lethal injections of the bacterium.

Protection from F. columnaris was first detected among fish immunized for 3 months and {{exposed to the}} lowest level of challenge used (- 0. 9 x 10 ⁵ cells/ml). All challenges of fish immunized for 4 months indicated that the vaccine had induced an immune response against columnaris disease. Two polyvalent vaccine studies were conducted to investigate the effect that combining of parenterally administered antigens had on immune responses of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri). Serum aglutinin titers were measured for indication of immune responses. In one study, formalin-killed cells of F. columnaris, Aeromonas salmonicida, and the causative agent (bacterium) of redmouth disease were mixed in all possible combinations and administered to different groups of fish. Responses of fish to antigens administered in the trivalent vaccine and the three divalent vaccines were monitored monthly for 3 months and compared with responses of fish injected with the corresponding monovalent vaccines. Comparisons indicated that responses to the combined antigens were not affected by either F. columnaris or the causative agent of redmouth disease. However, interference from A. salmonicida antigen suppressed responses to F. columnaris and the causative agent of redmouth disease. In the second study, formalin-killed cells of A. salmonicida, A. hydrophila, two strains of F. columnaris, and the causative agent of <b>bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> were combined and injected into rainbow trout brookstock at the Oregon Wildlife Commission's Leaburg Trout Hatchery. Serum agglutinin titers of samples taken before vaccination and 3 and 12 months after vaccination were measured for each entigen. Excellent responses to A. salmonicida antigen and slight responses to the causative agent of <b>bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> occurred. The fish did not respond to antigens of either strain of F. columnaris or A. hydrophila...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a survey of the}} health and physiological condition of juvenile fall-run Chinook salmon in the San Joaquin River and three tributaries (Stanislaus, Tuolumne and Merced Rivers) during the spring of 2001. This was an expansion of a study in the San Joaquin River and Delta conducted during the spring of 2000. The incidence of pathogen infection was higher in this study than in the 2000 survey. Renibacterium salmoninarum (the causative agent of <b>Bacterial</b> <b>Kidney</b> <b>Disease)</b> was detected in naturally produced fall Chinook juveniles from the Stanislaus, Tuolumne and mainstem San Joaquin Rivers. Proliferative <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (PKD) was detected in both natural and hatchery fall Chinook juveniles from the Merced and mainstem San Joaquin Rivers. Proliferative <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> could be a significant contributor to mortality in natural smolts. We recommend monitoring the incidence of BKD and PKD in the San Joaquin River basin to determine the impact of these diseases to the natural fish population. Physiological measurements were not significantly different than expected from juveniles undergoing smoltification. Measures of energy stores and fish condition declined while smoltification progressed at most sites. Fish underwent smoltification earlier in the Tuolumne River than in the Stanislaus or Merced River...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A randomized, blinded {{clinical}} trial {{was performed to}} assess the relative effectiveness of five commercial and one experimental vaccine in a population of farmed fish experiencing a <b>bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (<b>BKD)</b> outbreak that occurred in one study cage {{that was part of}} a larger clinical field trial. A total of 6000 uniquely identified Atlantic salmon S 1 presmolts were randomly assigned to vaccine groups in the hatchery and transferred to a commercial marine aquaculture site. Repeated sampling events to evaluate growth, inherent physical conditions and health status were carried out over the entire production cycle. During the second summer at sea, the study cage developed an outbreak of BKD that lasted approximately 240 days. The effectiveness of the selected vaccines was evaluated using survival analysis methods. The sole vaccine group offering protection for BKD was found to significantly decrease the hazard of dying (hazard ratio, HR = 0. 68, P = 0. 018) during the outbreak, compared to the industry standard, vaccine group. Additionally, during the outbreak, fish with a shortened operculum had a significantly decreased hazard (HR = 0. 38, P = 0. 033) compared to those fish with a normal operculum, while fish with jaw deformities had a significantly increased hazard (HR = 2. 55, P = 0. 001) compared to fish with normal jaw status.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2001 <b>Bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (<b>BKD)</b> is endemic in Snake River spring {{chinook salmon}} (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) stocks of both wild and {{hatchery}} origin, {{and may be}} partially responsible for their poor returns in recent years. BKD is particularly difficult to control due to the chronic nature of the disease. Renibacterium salmoninarum, the causative agent of BKD, can survive and reproduce intracellularly within the host, thus avoiding the humoral immune system. Numerous factors and processes are important in determining the survivorship or mortality of individual salmon infected with R. salmoninarum. Here, {{a number of these}} are explored using mathematical models and statistical techniques applied to data from the published literature. Antigen density, an important factor as the p 57 antigen of R. salmoninarum has immunosuppressive properties, is related to bacterial load, and possible explanations for the observed relationship are suggested. The likelihood of vertical transmission of the disease (from spawner to offspring) or of in-ovum antigen inclusion induced immunotolerance is related to ovarian fluid infection levels. The effects of temperature on the ability of the immune system to fight off the disease and on the growth rate of the bacteria are explored. These factors are then brought to bear on the results of a broodstock segregation study, suggesting that immunotolerance and temperature effects likely account for many of the observed results...|$|E
40|$|The neural {{pathology}} {{associated with}} spontaneous cases of <b>bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> (<b>BKD),</b> in five species of commercially reared salmonids, was investigated histopathologically and with immunofluorescence. Patterns of localisation of the causative organism of BKD within {{the central nervous}} system suggest that haematogenous spread to the meninges, particularly the tela choroidea posterior, the tela choroidea and vascularised capsule of the saccus dorsalis and epiphysis of the epithalamus, and the saccus vasculosus of the hypophysis, appears to be a frequent route by which {{the central nervous system}} becomes infected. Retrograde extension from the posterior uvea {{to the floor of the}} diencephalon along the epineurium and perineurium of the optic nerve also may be a mechanism of neural invasion. Extension appeared to occur from these sites into adjacent areas of the meninges, the neural parenchyma and ventricles. Demonstration of bacteria within salmonid ependymal cells, as well as the apparent ability of salmonid ependymal cells to respond metaplastically suggest a similarity to mammalian type III ependymal cells (tanycytes). Based on this study, it is apparent that teleosts can survive protracted severe brain damage. This, combined with the apparent similarities of neural response to infection between the salmonids used in this study and higher vertebrates, suggests that teleosts may be a useful lower vertebrate model for studying the pathogenesis and sequelae of bacterial meningitis.

40|$|A PCR {{protocol}} (McIntosh et al., 1996. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 62, 3929 - 2932), {{designed to}} detect the P 57 gene of Renibacterium salmoninarum, causative agent of <b>Bacterial</b> <b>Kidney</b> <b>Disease,</b> was modified slightly by redesign of the forward primer and recommended conditions to prevent possible false positives observed when tested against pure cultures of Yersinia ruckeri. The modified PCR, in combination with an improved DNAzol™-based DNA extraction technique, was very specific and sensitive (detecting between 5 and 72 R. salmoninarum cfu per mg head kidney tissue). It could detect infected fish using only 50  mg head kidney material, making the technique suitable for sampling small fish. It was also shown that samples could be pooled from up to five rainbow trout prior to PCR without noticeably affecting {{the sensitivity of the}} assay, providing at least 50  mg head kidney tissue was included from each of the fish that were pooled.

40|$|The efficacies of 21 {{chemotherapeutic}} {{agents for}} controlling <b>bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease</b> were evaluated. The bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic {{effects of these}} drugs were tested against 11 Renibacterium salmoninarum strains with different origins. The most effective compounds displaying both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity for all the isolates were tetracycline and erythromycin, with MICs ranging from less than 0. 62 to 10. 95 micrograms/ml for tetracycline and from less than 0. 62 to 5. 47 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. Whereas tetracycline showed identical MICs and MBCs, erythromycin showed bactericidal effects at concentrations of 5. 47 to 21. 87 micrograms/ml. Similarly, cefazolin and tiamulin proved to be very effective bactericidal compounds against the majority of R. salmoninarum isolates, with MBCs for 90 % of the strains tested of 21. 87 and 10. 95 micrograms/ml, respectively. Neither nitrofuranes, quinolones, nor sulfonamides showed inhibitory effects on {{the growth of the}} strains...|$|R
40|$|An immunofluorescent {{antibody}} test (IFAT) {{developed for the}} diagnosis for plasmacytoid leukemia was evaluated against histology under field conditions. Previously published results from a laboratory evaluation indicated that the IFAT had a much higher sensitivity than did histology. One hundred seventy-seven moribund chinook salmon from 3 farms located in British Columbia were sampled. Sensitivity, specificity and their respective quality indices were estimated for the IFAT relative to histology. The IFAT was shown to be unreliable, {{particularly with respect to}} sensitivity. Cohen's kappa was also calculated and revealed that the agreement between the 2 tests was no better than random. In contrast to previously published results the IFAT did not perform better than histology in the presence of <b>bacterial</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>disease.</b> The results emphasize the importance of evaluating tests in the field conditions in which they are to be used. The possible reasons for the shortcomings of the IFAT are discussed. LR: 20061115; PUBM: Print; JID: 8607793; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|R
