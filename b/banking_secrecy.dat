A further referendum {{will be needed to}} approve 300 million francs to support Romania and Bulgaria and their recent admission. The Swiss have also been under EU and sometimes international pressure to reduce <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> and to raise tax rates to parity with the EU. Preparatory discussions are being opened in four new areas: opening up the electricity market, participation in the European GNSS project Galileo, cooperating with the European centre for disease prevention and recognising certificates of origin for food products.|$|E

Hildebrand denied accusations of insider trading, claimed to be the [...] "victim of a smear campaign" [...] and said that his political foes endangered the secrecy laws and [...] "the interests of Switzerland" [...] with the accusations. Blocher had called for Hildebrand's resignation in 2011 in the wake of SNB's foreign exchange-related losses and continued strong calls after the FX-trades story grew, before Hildebrand ultimately resigned.|$|E
2500|$|The Lebanese {{banking system}} is endowed with several {{characteristics}} that promote {{the role of}} Beirut as a regional financial center, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. The Lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. Moreover, no restrictions are put on {{the free flow of}} capital and earnings {{into and out of the}} Lebanese economy. The passing of the <b>banking</b> <b>secrecy</b> law on 3 September 1956, subjected all banks established in Lebanon as well as foreign banks' branches to the [...] "secret of the profession". Both article 16 of law No. 282 dated 30 December 1993 and article 12 of decree No. 5451 dated 26 August 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in Lebanese banks. On the first of April 1975, decree No. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the Lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents' deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the Banque Du Liban by virtue of article 76 of the Code of Money and Credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the National Deposit Guarantee Institution.|$|E

30|$|International {{pressure}} on Swiss <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> {{had already been}} mounting for some time. Before the U.S. came into play, {{there had been a}} series of initiatives led by the OECD to increase transparency and induce cooperation among countries on taxation. With respect to <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy,</b> the OECD tried to establish the free exchange of information between tax authorities, or ideally the automatic exchange of information on tax subjects. This amounts to abolishing <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> for tax purposes. The strategy of the OECD relied mainly on blacklisting non-cooperative jurisdictions, thereby hoping that this public shaming would prove effective. In successive negotiations between Switzerland and the EU, a withholding tax on interest income was introduced, and the distinction between tax evasion and tax fraud was removed, thereby easing the way for an EU tax authority to request information on bank accounts in Switzerland about which they were suspicious. However, in all these negotiations, <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> itself was fully preserved.|$|R

In this comment, Prof. Cohen asks whether states like Switzerland, which provide <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> for the offshore accounts of wealthy citizens of developing countries, violate internationally recognized human rights. The United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights explicitly recognizes rights to adequate food, clothing, housing, health care, clean water, sanitation, and education. <b>Bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> has a significant human rights impact if it deprives developing countries of tax revenues needed to meet basic rights guaranteed by the Covenant. The annual tax gap for developing countries caused by <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> is estimated to range from over $ 100 billion to several times that amount. Thus, it seems indisputable that <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> impedes the ability of developing countries to fulfill internationally recognized human rights...|$|R

Two alternative regimes are considered. A first, {{in which there is}} strict <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> and a second, where there is international information exchange for tax purposes. In particular, we show that sharing tax information with onshore countries can be a dominant strategy for an OFC if there is enough scope for providing tax planning. Moreover, a partial reduction of tax liabilities can already prompt OFCs to voluntarily exchange relevant tax information. We also discuss the conditions under which the possible removal of <b>bank</b> <b>secrecy</b> may reduce or increase the onshore country's tax revenue...|$|R
