500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the origin}} of the name Prufrock is not certain, and Eliot never remarked on its origin other than to claim he was unsure of how he came upon the name. [...] Many {{scholars}} and indeed Eliot himself have pointed towards the autobiographical elements in the character of Prufrock, and Eliot at the time of writing the poem was in the habit of rendering his name as [...] "T.Stearns Eliot," [...] very similar in form to that of J. Alfred Prufrock. It is suggested that the name [...] "Prufrock" [...] came from Eliot's youth in St. Louis, Missouri, where the Prufrock-Litton Company, a large furniture store, occupied one city block downtown at 420â€“422 North Fourth Street. In a 1950 letter, Eliot said, [...] "I did not have, at the time of writing the poem, and have not yet recovered, any recollection of having acquired this name in any way, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> must be assumed that I did, and that the memory has been obliterated." ...|$|E

Also the place has another name, which means 'where the water springs out of the rock,' because from between two of the ridges, those that are like the thumb and first finger, flows a stream which comes from the heart of the mountain." ...|$|E
