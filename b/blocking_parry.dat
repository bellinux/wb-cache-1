5000|$|Bend Bow Shoot Tiger (The form {{is close}} out by step up, <b>block,</b> <b>parry</b> and punch {{followed}} by Apparent Close-up, Cross Hands and Close) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{arms and}} legs are also used for various <b>blocks</b> and <b>parries.</b> These include the upper <b>block,</b> middle outside <b>parry,</b> lower <b>parry,</b> shin <b>block,</b> and foot stop.|$|R
50|$|Pisau {{refers to}} a short-bladed knife of any shape, {{although}} {{it can also be}} used to mean sword. It comes from the Chinese term bishou or pengsau and is used in some form in every style of silat. The wooden sheaths of most edged weapons can be used for <b>blocking,</b> <b>parrying</b> or striking.|$|R
50|$|Stick - Gon bong (Hangul: 곤봉, Hanja: 棍棒) This chapter {{describes}} {{how to use}} the long stick in battle. Staff techniques entail strike, stab, <b>block,</b> <b>parry</b> etc. These techniques are fundamentals of all weapon techniques. After mastering staff skills, the study of other pole arms such as spear, sword, trident, moon sword etc. is accessible.|$|R

50|$|The sai is {{typically}} used in pairs, with {{one in each}} hand. Five kata are commonly taught, including two kihon kata. The style includes a variety of <b>blocks,</b> <b>parries,</b> strikes, and captures against attackers from all directions and height levels. Use of the point, knuckle and central bar is emphasized, as well as rapid grip changes for multiple strikes and blocks.|$|R
50|$|The large, {{characteristic}} guard {{helps to}} <b>block</b> and <b>parry</b> other cutting attacks. However, its openings leave the hands vulnerable to thrusting attacks.|$|R
5000|$|Ronove, {{similar to}} Shannon, is a defense-oriented fighter {{who specializes in}} <b>blocking</b> and <b>parrying</b> his opponents' attacks. His ability, [...] "Counter Boost", {{increases}} the damage dealt by the player's counters.|$|R

50|$|Many of the {{principles}} of the Sabaki method were developed by Ashihara. The Sabaki method aims to employ all of these strikes, <b>block,</b> <b>parries,</b> grabs, sweeps, throws, and takedowns in a way that puts the opponent on the ground as quickly and efficiently as possible. Once on the ground, the opponent is “finished-off” or knocked-out with a strike to a vulnerable part of the body such as the neck or head (finish-off moves are simulated in Enshin training or tournament competition). Sabaki strategy combines rhythm, timing, position, and distance to parry and counterattack in one continuous motion. The ability to turn defense into offense by using an opponent’s power and momentum against him {{lies at the heart of}} the Sabaki method.|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} requirements per belt {{depending on the}} school. Parker's IKKA schools stayed with the 24 techniques-per-belt syllabus, though some schools today have adopted a 16-20-24 technique syllabus as their standard. The 24 and the 16-20-24 technique syllabuses contain exactly the same techniques, but the latter groups them differently so fewer techniques are found at lower belt levels, {{and there are more}} belt levels to be found. In addition to self-defense techniques, Parker set specific criteria required for proficiency at each level. The criteria included basics categorized by stances, <b>blocks,</b> <b>parries,</b> punches, strikes, finger techniques, kicks, and foot maneuvers as well as the much neglected Specialized Moves and Methods category which includes joint dislocations, chokes, take-downs, throws and other grappling components.|$|R
50|$|Sikaran {{utilizes}} {{only the}} feet {{as a rule}} for sport, and the hands are only used for blocking. The player uses his legs 90% {{of the time and}} his hands 10%, and only for <b>blocking</b> or <b>parrying</b> blows. Violation of this injunction, especially in tournaments, is ground for disqualification.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the strikes, silambam also {{has a variety of}} locks called poottu. A fighter must always be careful while wielding the stick or they will be grappled and lose the fight. Locks can be used to disable the enemy or simply capture their weapon. Techniques called thirappu are used to counter the locks but these must be executed before being caught in a lock. Silambam also has many different types of avoiding an attack like <b>blocking,</b> <b>parrying,</b> enduring, rotary parrying, hammering, kolluvuthal (attacking and blocking simultaneously) and evasive moves such as sitting or kneeling, moving out, jumping high, etc. Against multiple attackers, silambam exponents do not hold out their sticks as they do in single combat. Instead they assume one of the numerous animal stances which makes it difficult for opponents to predict the next attack.|$|R
50|$|The maru is a {{primarily}} {{defensive weapon}} favouring a low stance, {{in which the}} wielder strives to stay lower than the opponent thereby reducing any openings to the body's vital points. Typically, the maru-wielder will <b>block</b> or <b>parry</b> attacks before countering with a thrust, choke, lock or disarm. Offensively the maru is treated similarly to a dagger, used for stabbing.|$|R
50|$|Likewise, on hip throws, some systems grab {{around the}} waist (or in ignorance, the belt), and some systems prefer to wrap tori’s right arm under the uke's left. One should never grip the opponent’s belt; modern attire may not include a belt. In fact, {{grabbing}} the belt is not necessary. Simply grabbing {{around the waist}} (so long as the grip is {{all the way around}} the waist) works better anyway. One should note that it feels easier to grab your opponent’s waist with your right arm than it does wrapping your right arm around their left arm. Biomechanically, grabbing the opponent higher up the back (such as at the shoulder) can allow the opponent to bend at the waist making the hip throw more difficult. The sequence of actions required for the hip throw is: <b>block,</b> <b>parry</b> or deflect the opponent's punch if necessary, effect kuzushi, bend the knees and turn whilst pulling the opponent over your hip.|$|R
50|$|The {{techniques}} or kihon of Enshin {{include many}} of the same or similar kicks, punches, strikes, <b>blocks,</b> and <b>parries</b> found in most other karate styles. However, in contrast to many other karate styles, Enshin also includes sweeps, grabs, throws, and takedowns most often found in judo, Jujutsu, and other grappling styles. The core emphasis in applying all of these techniques is through the Sabaki Method.|$|R
50|$|Sita Dewi: Mimics Sita's coyness and femininity. The {{specialty}} {{of this form}} is a technique where the thumb touches the first two fingers {{which can be used}} to <b>block</b> and <b>parry</b> as well as attack. Movements are short and economical, allowing for easy retreat. Attacks are aimed at the vital points. Sita's style is epitomised by the kerambit, a claw-like knife that Malay women would wear in their hair.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} for Bujingai has been generally above-average among both print and online sources. The game has accrued aggregate scores of 73% on GameRankings and 72 out of 100 on Metacritic. Critics {{have found the}} combat gameplay enjoyable and rewarding, positively comparing it to other titles in its genre including the Devil May Cry series, Shinobi, Nightshade, Otogi: Myth of Demons, and Ninja Gaiden. GamesTM summarized, [...] "Spend time mastering the figting system, powering up your various attacks and revisiting stages to improve your combo scores and the game becomes {{so much more than}} just a basic hack-and-slash romp - it's a feast of replayable swordplay." [...] GamePro stated the gameplay is [...] "both surprisingly deep and unfortunately simple", lamenting that <b>blocking,</b> <b>parrying,</b> and counterattacking belies the ability to button mash one's way through most battles. IGN's Jeremy Dunham also noted Bujingai to have a simplistic gameplay model beneath its stylized visual presentation, but still celebrated it as [...] "challenging, fast, and easy to learn". Reviewers have criticized the game's camera system and its jumping and gliding gameplay, referring to these mechanics as [...] "simplistic", unresponsive, [...] "impossible", [...] "awkward", and [...] "purely frustrating".|$|R
50|$|The {{hard method}} is {{characterized}} by the direct application of counter-force to an opposing force. In practice, this may be a direct attack, consisting of movement directly towards the opponent, coinciding with a strike towards the opponent. A defensive technique where the defender stands their ground to <b>block</b> or <b>parry</b> (directly opposing the attack by stopping it or knocking it aside) would be an example of a hard method of defense. Hard method techniques are generally conceptualized as being linear.|$|R
50|$|For {{defensive}} and offensive maneuvers for superior position, various beats, <b>parries,</b> <b>blocks,</b> slaps, dodges, steps and jumps {{to stay out}} of range or spring into range are employed. Once superior striking position is achieved, the fighter will thrust or strike home and finish the fight.|$|R
50|$|Named after Canon Parry, {{a former}} head of the college, the <b>Parry</b> <b>Block</b> {{contained}} a variety of teaching facilities which were used largely by the University's School of Justice and Social inclusion and School of Creative Arts. These included large classrooms and smaller art studios.|$|R
50|$|The {{main library}} of the {{university}} campus was constructed in 1995 to accommodate the growing diversity of subjects on the campus and is located opposite the <b>Parry</b> <b>Block.</b> It {{is dedicated to the}} poet Raymond Garlick, who was a principal lecturer in Trinity's Welsh department.|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} Asian martial arts, bando schools start off by {{teaching}} the basic stances and footwork. This preliminary stage of training traditionally lasts for several months, although many instructors today avoid doing so. In {{the second stage}} of training, a series of <b>blocking</b> and <b>parrying</b> techniques is taught. Bando prioritises defense over offense so that the student will be able to protect themselves should the need arise. The defensive approach is also meant to discourage aggression and teach students to apply their skills with care. Offensive moves are taught in the third stage.|$|R
50|$|Parry, an {{advanced}} new addition, allow an open counter-attack after a successful <b>parry</b> <b>block.</b> A player can assume a standing defensive position and cause the attacker to temporarily freeze if the parry is successful, {{and from there}} either perform a special stunning technique or a 3-hit variant of a Special Move.|$|R
5000|$|In Japan the shakujō {{became a}} {{formidable}} {{weapon in the}} hands of a practiced Buddhist monk. It could be used as a staff to <b>block</b> and <b>parry</b> attacks and the metal rings at the tip could be slammed into an opponent's face to momentarily blind him. At the very tip of the metal finial is a sharp point which can be used to attack weak points of the body. The bottom end of the khakkhara has a metal butt which can be used to thrust and hit an opponent. An opponent's weapons can also be easily deflected.|$|R
50|$|In The Karate Kid, Mr. Miyagi makes Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) {{paint the}} fences and walls, and wipe the floors and the cars, with two {{specific}} arm-movements day after day, {{and only when}} Mr. Miyagi tests (by mock attacks) and finds that those movements have become spontaneous and unconscious reactions from Daniel, does he give the boy respite from that toil. It was then that Daniel too realizes, why after all his master had made him do that for days—in spite of him becoming tired, aching and fed-up—for those are actually <b>blocking</b> and <b>parrying</b> techniques, which his master by his experience, had ingrained into him without his being aware of it.|$|R
50|$|Ikkaku-ryū {{applies the}} jutte, either {{alone or in}} tandem with the tessen, in {{response}} of an attack made by a swordsman armed with a katana. The jutte is made of iron and it can <b>block</b> and <b>parry</b> swordattacks either on its own or {{in tandem with the}} tessen. The jutte can be used to catch a sword between the main shaft and the tine thus controlling the sword or even snapping it in two if applicable. After deflecting or avoiding the sword, the wielder gets within arms-length of the opponent in order to successfully strike at any part of the opponents body such as hands, wrists and head.|$|R
50|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to EA Chicago's Fight Night: Round 3, {{featuring}} a focus on up-close brawling, mixing up high and low attacks, <b>blocks,</b> throws, and <b>parries,</b> and using the right analog stick to deliver stronger attacks. Also, like Round 3, there is no in-game heads up display by default, encouraging the player to observe physical cues on in-game characters to determine their health, such as ripped and burned clothing, bruises, and an overall look of exhaustion of the opponent.|$|R
50|$|As a {{practical}} weapon, the scythe-part of the IR-kusarigama {{is used to}} strike, slash or thrust at various parts of an opponent's body, including neck, hands, wrists and solar plexus. The scythe {{is also used to}} catch an opponent's sword between the blade and the handguard. A strength of the IR-kusarigama is that it can be wielded in the normal manner, with the scythe up, or it can be used upside down. The handle itself, being made of hardwood, is used to strike, thrust, <b>block</b> and <b>parry.</b> The chain can be swung as a flail and used to ensnare the opponent's sword, limbs or even the body itself making it difficult for the swordsman to maneuver or using his weapon effectively. In some forms (kata) the weight is deployed to strike the opponent's body, including the head, back and hands.|$|R
50|$|In Bakti Negara, the opponent's body {{is seen as}} a {{rectangular}} section and attacks are concentrated along a line with their shoulders. Another common target is the opponent's front leg or foot. If an enemy charges forward, the Bakti Negara exponent would use the ground-sitting sempok or depok stance and kick or sweep the advancing leg. <b>Blocking</b> and <b>parrying</b> is always done with the open hands. If the attacking limb is grabbed, the grabbing hand would be countered with a slap. The tricky nature of Bakti Negara favours a range of about two yards from the opponent. Grappling and infighting is limited, consisting mainly of joint locks on the elbows and shoulders, but these techniques were never developed as highly on Bali as in other parts of Indonesia. Rather, striking is preferred, particularly punches and kicks.|$|R
50|$|Risen is {{an action}} RPG {{with a strong}} focus on combat. The combatants, {{including}} the player and enemies, has access to different attack moves, as well as <b>parries,</b> <b>blocks,</b> and dodges. Whether an attack connects depend on the positioning of the combatants, the usage of shields (without shields, player cannot block projectiles or attacks from shorter creatures) {{as well as the}} nature of the attack (stronger attacks can knock aside shields, leaving the target open for follow up strikes; magic attacks cannot be blocked, etc).|$|R
50|$|In Allods Online {{tanks are}} Paladins and Champions (Warriors). While both tanks are quite {{effective}} {{at any given}} tanking needs, one specializes in some areas more than the other. Paladin focuses on single-target tanking and dealing considerable damage {{in the process of}} tanking. Paladins rely on specific 'barrier' feature and skill of the paladin archetype to mitigate large amounts of damage with ease vs single target. And having strong Strength values, since it affects and empowers paladin barrier skills and abilities altogether. Warrior focuses in multi-target tanking and controlling the enemy, mostly through the use of stun locks. Warriors rely on having solid Stamina/Vitality/Hit points, and strong Agility which reduces magic damage taken and affects dodge, <b>block,</b> and <b>parry</b> chances, which greatly reduces physical/melee damages. Apart from being able to tank effectively, both of the tanks have various skills which help protect and defend, or otherwise support their group members.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{new feature}} {{is the ability to}} [...] "parry" [...] an opponents attack. <b>Parrying</b> (<b>blocking</b> in the Japanese version) is the ability to deflect an {{incoming}} attack without receiving damage. At the exact moment an opponent's attack is about to hit his or her character, the player can move the controller toward or down to Parry the attack without receiving damage, leaving the opponent vulnerable for a counterattack. Additionally, this also allows the player to defend against Special Moves and even Super Arts without sustaining the normal minor damage that blocking normally would incur. However, parrying requires precise timing.|$|R
50|$|The {{main library}} of the {{university}} Campus was constructed in 1995 to accommodate the growing diversity of subjects on the campus and was located opposite the <b>Parry</b> <b>Block.</b> It was dedicated to the poet Raymond Garlick, who was a principal lecturer in Trinity's Welsh Department. It contained a total of 110,000 books along with academic journals and DVDs. It also housed public computers, printing and photocopying facilities. The first floor contained {{the bulk of the}} main collection as well as specialist collections, IT spaces and larger collections. The second floor contained quieter working spaces {{and the rest of the}} main collection.|$|R
5000|$|The {{experience}} of World War I prompted a complete reversal in {{opinion on the}} relative value of long rifles and bayonets in typical infantry combat operations. Whether in the close confines of trench warfare, night time raiding and patrolling, or attacking across open ground, soldiers of both sides soon recognized the inherent limitations {{of a long and}} ungainly rifle and bayonet when used as a close-quarters battle weapon. [...] Once Allied soldiers had been trained to expect the throw point or extended thrust-and-lunge attack, the method lost most of its tactical value on the World War I battlefield. It required a strong arm and wrist, was very slow to recover if the initial thrust missed its mark, and was easily parried by a soldier who was trained to expect it, thus exposing the German soldier to a return thrust which he could not easily <b>block</b> or <b>parry.</b> [...] Instead of longer bayonets, infantry forces on both sides began experimenting with other weapons as auxiliary close-quarter arms, including the trench knife, pistol, hand grenade, and entrenching tool.|$|R
