5|$|People were {{purchasing}} bulbs {{at higher}} and higher prices, intending to re-sell them for a profit. However, such a scheme could not last unless someone was ultimately willing to pay such high prices and take possession of the bulbs. In February 1637, tulip traders could no longer find new buyers willing to pay increasingly inflated prices for their bulbs. As this realization set in, the demand for tulips collapsed, and prices plummeted—the speculative <b>bubble</b> <b>burst.</b> Some were left holding contracts to purchase tulips at prices now ten times greater than those on the open market, while others found themselves in possession of bulbs now worth {{a fraction of the}} price they had paid. Mackay claims the Dutch devolved into distressed accusations and recriminations against others in the trade.|$|E
5|$|Spain had a {{comparatively}} low debt level among advanced economies {{prior to the}} crisis. Its public debt relative to GDP in 2010 was only 60%, more than 20 points less than Germany, France or the US, and more than 60 points less than Italy, Ireland or Greece. Debt was largely avoided by the ballooning tax revenue from the housing bubble, which helped accommodate a decade of increased government spending without debt accumulation. When the <b>bubble</b> <b>burst,</b> Spain spent {{large amounts of money}} on bank bailouts. In May 2012, Bankia received a 19 billion euro bailout, on top of the previous 4.5 billion euros to prop up Bankia. Questionable accounting methods disguised bank losses. During September 2012, regulators indicated that Spanish banks required €59 billion (US$77 billion) in additional capital to offset losses from real estate investments.|$|E

Since 2000, the nominal value of his Microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in Microsoft's stock price after the dot-com <b>bubble</b> <b>burst</b> and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. In a May 2006 interview, Gates commented that he wished that he were not {{the richest man in}} the world because he disliked the attention it brought. In March 2010, Gates was the second wealthiest person behind Carlos Slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires List. Carlos Slim retook the position again in June 2014 (but then lost the top position back to Gates). Between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from 40billion to more than 82billion. Since October 2017, Gates was surpassed by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world.|$|E
40|$|Cetaceans {{produce a}} variety of bubble displays, ranging from bubble streams to very large bursts of air. Previous {{research}} has indicated that different types of bubbles serve different functions. Using archival video data, we investigated the frequency and function of bubble behavior for four beluga mother-calf pairs housed at Sea World San Antonio (SWSA, 2007 - 2010). <b>Bubble</b> <b>bursts,</b> large,forceful bursts of air released underwater, were the most frequent form of bubbles produced. The mothers primarily produced <b>bubble</b> <b>bursts</b> while swimming with their calves whereas the calves produced the majority of their <b>bubble</b> <b>bursts</b> during solitary activities. These results suggest that mothers may use their <b>bubble</b> <b>bursts</b> as a protective behavior or warning to threatening stimuli (e. g., other belugas) whereas when threatening stimuli are not present calves may produce <b>bubble</b> <b>bursts</b> as a form of play. Additional research is necessary to better understand if these bubble displays areunder the intentional control of the animals producing them...|$|R
40|$|The near orifice spray breakup at low GLR (gas to liquid ratio by mass) {{values in}} an effervescent {{atomizer}} is studied experimentally using {{water as a}} simulant and air as atomizing gas. From the visualizations, the near orifice spray structures are classified into three modes: discrete bubble explosions, continuous bubble explosions and annular conical spray. The breakup of the spray is quantified {{in terms of the}} mean <b>bubble</b> <b>bursting</b> distance from the orifice. The parametric study indicates that the mean <b>bubble</b> <b>bursting</b> distance mainly depends on airflow rate, jet diameter and mixture velocity. It is also observed that the jet diameter has a dominant effect on the <b>bubble</b> <b>bursting</b> distance when compared to mixture velocity at a given airflow rate. The mean <b>bubble</b> <b>bursting</b> distance is shown to be governed by a nondimensional two-phase flow number consisting of all the aforementioned parameters. The location of <b>bubble</b> <b>bursting</b> is found to be highly unsteady spatially, which is influenced by flow dynamics inside the injector. It is proposed that this unsteadiness in jet breakup length is a consequence of varying degree of bubble expansion caused due to the intermittent occurrence of single phase and two-phase flow inside the orifice...|$|R

Furthermore, in the aim of decoupling experimentally the effects of bubble collapse and jet dynamics on the drop detachment, we propose a new scaling providing the top drop size only as a function of the jet velocity and liquid parameters. In particular, this allows us to untangle the intricate roles of viscosity, gravity and surface tension in the end-pinching of the <b>bubble</b> <b>bursting</b> jet...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen {{a bubble}} reaches an air-liquid interface, it ruptures, {{projecting}} {{a multitude of}} tiny droplets in the air. Across the oceans, an estimated 1018 to 1020 <b>bubbles</b> <b>burst</b> every second, and form the so called sea spray, {{a major player in}} earth's climate system. At a smaller scale, in a glass of champagne about a million bubbles nucleate on the wall, rise towards the surface and burst, giving birth to a particular aerosol that holds a concentrate of wine aromas. Based on the model experiment of a single <b>bubble</b> <b>bursting</b> in simple liquids, we depict each step of this effervescence, from <b>bubble</b> <b>bursting</b> to drop evaporation. In particular, we propose simple scaling laws for the jet velocity and the top drop size. We unravel experimentally the intricate roles of bubble shape, capillary waves, gravity, and liquid properties in the jet dynamics and the drop detachment. We demonstrate how damping action of viscosity produces faster and smaller droplets and more generally how liquid properties enable to control the <b>bubble</b> <b>bursting</b> aerosol characteristics. In this context, the particular case of Champagne wine aerosol is studied in details and the key features of this aerosol are identified. We demonstrate that compared to a still wine, champagne fizz drastically enhances the transfer of liquid into the atmosphere. Conditions on bubble radius and wine viscosity that optimize aerosol evaporation are provided. These results pave the way towards the fine tuning of aerosol characteristics and flavor release during sparkling wine tasting, a major issue of the sparkling wine industry...|$|R

25|$|McCulley {{writes that}} the {{progression}} through Minsky's three borrowing stages was evident as the credit and housing bubbles built through approximately August 2007. Demand for housing was both a cause and effect of the rapidly expanding shadow banking system, which helped fund the shift to more lending of the speculative and ponzi types, through ever-riskier mortgage loans at higher levels of leverage. This helped drive the housing bubble, as the availability of credit encouraged higher home prices. Since the <b>bubble</b> <b>burst,</b> {{we are seeing the}} progression in reverse, as businesses de-leverage, lending standards are raised and the share of borrowers in the three stages shifts back towards the hedge borrower.|$|E
