5|$|Hayes {{kept his}} {{pledge not to}} run for re-election, retired {{to his home in}} Ohio, and became an {{advocate}} of social and educational reform. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom said his greatest achievement was to restore popular faith in the presidency and to reverse the deterioration of executive power that had set in after Abraham Lincoln's death. Although supporters have praised his commitment to civil service reform and defense of civil rights, Hayes is generally listed among the high-end of the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> in historians' rankings of U.S. presidents.|$|E

5|$|Stela 39 is {{the broken}} <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of a stela {{that was found}} inside Temple 5D-86, on the east-west axis running through the East Platform from the Lost World Pyramid. The {{monument}} is sculpted {{on the front and}} back faces and was deliberately broken in ancient times and was moved inside the temple in order to save it. The front of the stela shows the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of a person, who is identified as a ruler by his costume; the back features two columns of hieroglyphs. The king depicted on the stela is ChakTokIch'aakI, who governed in the 4th century AD. This king is standing over a bound captive; the bearded captive appears to be a noble since he retains his clothing. The stela celebrates an event in AD 376 and appears to have been moved to the Mundo Perdido in relation to a funerary ceremony. The stela was possibly moved to the temple by king YaxNuunAyiinII to celebrate the changing of the 20-year k'atun Maya calendrical cycle in AD 771 and thereby link himself to ChakTokIch'aakI. It was placed directly over the most important of the late 4th century elite tombs. The stela continued to be worshipped in the Terminal Classic, as evidenced by the presence of polychrome ceramic offerings and incense burners.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{has participated}} in {{biathlon}} at every Olympics since 1984 except for 2002; Kerryn Rim's eighth place in 1994 in the 15km individual event was their best result. Cameron Morton represented Australia in 2006 and finished in the bottom 10% {{in each of his}} two races. In 2010, Australia's sole representative Alexei Almoukov came second last in his event—one competitor did not finish. Rim's result remains the only top-20 finish by an Australian in the discipline, and more than 80% of Australian entrants have finished in the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the field, including many in the bottom fifth.|$|E

Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt in the seventh inning. He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E

5|$|In {{their first}} season since {{the return of}} the Football League, Cardiff {{finished}} the 1946–47 season as champions of the Third Division South under new manager Billy McCandless and returned to the Second Division. McCandless left the club soon after and was replaced by Cyril Spiers who led the side to promotion in the 1951–52 season, returning to the top tier of English football {{for the first time in}} 23 years. However, despite spending five seasons in the First Division, the team continually struggled in the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the table and were eventually relegated in 1957. They returned to the First Division for two seasons between 1960 and 1962 before again suffering relegation.|$|E

The control panel shows planes crucial data, {{including}} speed, altitude, thrust, fuel, roll/pitch indicators and a compass. The panel {{also features a}} radar that provided an overview of important nearby objects. An onboard screen displays various flight information and warning messages, and features a speech synthesizer that occasionally announces dangers, such as approaching enemies or missile attacks. Finally, a small rear-view camera allows the player to observe enemies and missiles on their tail. The game also features a two player mode, where one player flies the plane and the other aims and fires the guns.|$|E
5|$|Like Vishnu's {{first two}} avatars - Matsya (fish) and Kurma (turtle), the third avatar Varaha is {{depicted}} either in zoomorphic form as an animal (a wild boar), or anthropomorphically. The main {{difference in the}} anthropomorphic form portrayal {{is that the first}} two avatars are depicted with a torso of a man and the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> as animal, while Varaha has an animal (boar) head and a human body. The portrayal of the anthropomorphic Varaha is similar to the fourth avatar Narasimha (portrayed as a lion-headed man), who is the first avatar of Vishnu that is not completely animal.|$|E

5|$|Shankly {{began his}} {{managerial}} {{career at the}} club where his professional playing career had started. Carlisle in the 1948–49 season were struggling in the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the Third Division North and finding it difficult to attract southern-based players because of the town's geographic remoteness in the far north of England. Shankly's work ethic transformed the team who finished 15th in 1948–49 {{after he had been}} in charge for only the last few matches. They improved to ninth in 1949–50 and then to third in 1950–51, almost gaining promotion.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season a {{new ground}} {{was built for}} Hull City {{across the road from}} the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in {{the top half of the}} table. They came close to promotion in the 1909–10 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in the top half of the table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.|$|E
5|$|The promotional cinema {{poster for}} the film {{featured}} a woman holding a crossbow; she was photographed from behind, and her outfit left the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of her buttocks exposed. The effect was achieved by having the model wear a pair of bikini bottoms backwards, so that the part seen on her backside is actually {{the front of the}} suit. The poster caused some furore—largely in the US—with The Boston Globe and the Los Angeles Times considering the poster so unsuitable they edited out everything above the knee, whilst the Pittsburgh Press editors painted a pair of shorts over the legs. There was significant speculation as to the identity of the model before photographer Morgan Kane identified her as Joyce Bartle.|$|E

5|$|This was {{repeated}} the following season, {{and so in}} 1971 Andover took another step up and joined the Southern League. Now competing against teams from an even wider area spanning almost the entire width of the country (ranging from Bideford {{in the west to}} Bury Town in the east) and in some cases with a larger budget and fanbase, competition was always tough with the club generally finishing in the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the table. The highest position the club reached at this level was the sixth place reached in 1987–88 and again in 1991–92.|$|E
5|$|Wealth, like {{income and}} taxes, is highly concentrated; the richest 10% {{of the adult}} {{population}} possess 72% of the country's household wealth, while the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> claim only 2%. According to a September 2017 report by the Federal Reserve, the top 1% controlled 38.6% of the country's wealth in 2016. Between June 2007 and November 2008 the global recession led to falling asset prices around the world. Assets owned by Americans lost about a quarter of their value. Since peaking {{in the second quarter of}} 2007, household wealth was down $14trillion, but has since increased $14trillion over 2006 levels. At the end of 2014, household debt amounted to $11.8trillion, down from $13.8trillion at the end of 2008.|$|E
5|$|York mostly {{occupied}} the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> {{of the table}} {{before the turn of}} the year, and dropped as low as 23rd in September 2013. During February 2014 the team broke into the top half of the table and with one match left were in sixth-place. York's defensive record was the third best in League Two with 41 goals conceded, bettered only by Southend (39) and Chesterfield (40). Davies made the highest number of appearances over the season, appearing in 47 of York's 52 matches. Fletcher was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 10 league goals and 13 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Jarvis with nine goals.|$|E

5|$|A B {{movie or}} B {{film is a}} low-budget {{commercial}} movie, but one {{that is not an}} arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of a double feature (akin to B-sides for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased {{by the end of the}} 1950s, the term B movie continues to be used in its broader sense to this day. In its post–Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies display a high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|After {{a single}} and a stolen base from Andrus, Ríos {{doubled in the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the sixth to cut the score to 4–2. A small {{controversy}} arose {{in the top of}} the seventh inning. Longoria and Myers were on first and second base respectively with two outs when Young hit a line drive to center field. Replays showed that the ball bounced into Leonys Martín's (the Rangers' center fielder) glove after hitting the ground, making it a trap and therefore should have been a hit. However, the umpires ruled the play an out, ending the inning without a run scoring. Ultimately, the issue did not affect the outcome. The Rays added onto their lead in the ninth inning when Sam Fuld stole third and a scored on a throwing error from Rangers reliever Tanner Scheppers, extending their lead to 5–2. Price closed the game in the ninth, recording three straight outs and finishing off a complete game.|$|E
5|$|Bradford {{had just}} 13 players when McCall took over, {{and he made}} a number of summer signings {{including}} defender Darren Williams, midfielders Kyle Nix, Alex Rhodes and Scott Phelan, and strikers Barry Conlon, Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu and Peter Thorne. McCall recorded his first win as a manager against Wrexham on 25 August 2007 after substitute Luke Medley scored a late winner, but despite his pre-season target his team spent much {{of the first half of}} the season in the <b>bottom</b> <b>half</b> of the table. After going unbeaten in January, the club were still 15th in League Two, and McCall told the Telegraph & Argus he did not regret his pre-season target but was carried away with the euphoria at the time. City's form continued to improve during the second half of the season, and McCall led his side to 10th place in League Two.|$|E
60|$|Here, Roswell Gardiner {{manifested}} {{a weakness}} that {{lies at the}} <b>bottom</b> of <b>half</b> our blunders. He did not like to be outdone by a competitor, even in his mistakes. If the Sea Lion of Holmes' Hole could hold on, on that tack, why might not the Sea Lion of Oyster Pond do the same? It is by this process of human vanity that men sustain each other in wrong, and folly obtains the sanction of numbers, if not that of reason. In this practice we see one of the causes of the masses becoming misled, and this seldom happens without their becoming oppressive.|$|R
