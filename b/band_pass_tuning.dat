40|$|Zheng et al The {{temporal}} {{contrast sensitivity}} of human infants is reduced {{in comparison to}} adults. It is not known which neural structures of our visual brain sets limits on the early maturation of temporal vision. In this study we investigated how individual neurons in the primary visual cortex (V 1) and visual area 2 (V 2) of infant monkeys respond to temporal modulation of spatially optimized grating stimuli {{and a range of}} stimulus contrasts. As early as 2 weeks of age, V 1 and V 2 neurons exhibited <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> temporal frequency <b>tuning.</b> However, the optimal temporal frequency and temporal resolution of V 1 neurons were much lower in 2 -and 4 -week-old infants than in 8 -week-old infants or adults. V 2 neurons of 8 -week-old monkeys had significantly lower optimal temporal frequencies and resolutions than adults. Onset latency was longer in V 1 at 2 and 4 weeks of age and was slower in V 2 even at 8 weeks of age than in adults. Contrast threshold of V 1 and V 2 neurons was substantially higher in 2 - and 4 -week-old infants but became adult like by 8 weeks of age. For the first 4 weeks of life, responses to high contrast stimuli saturated more readily in V 2. The present results suggest that although the early development of temporal vision and contrast sensitivity may largely depend on the functional maturation of pre-cortical structures, it is also likely to be limited by immaturities that are unique to V 1 and V 2...|$|R
40|$|A noise removal {{method for}} <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> signals based on {{anisotropic}} diffusion {{algorithm is proposed}} in this paper. This anisotropic smoothing algorithm is for <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> signals with a constant frequency and {{is an extension of}} the anisotropic diffusion method proposed by Perona and Malik. <b>Band</b> <b>pass</b> signals are considered as complex valued vectors here.

An appropriate linear operator is considered here for such complex valued signals to form an anisotropic diffusion algorithm. A partial differential equation to smooth <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> noisy signals is therefore driven. The propagator of this differential equation is a complex valued Gabor filter.

40|$|Trabajo presentado a The First European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP 2006). Niza, 2006. In this paper, {{the design}} of a planar meta-surface based on dipoles and wires is presented. The unit cell is formed by three {{independent}} layers, which contain two parallel dipoles and one wire. The behaviour of these elements have been analysed separately as an independent unit cell, i. e., the one dipole unit cell, the two dipoles unit cell and the two dipoles and wire unit cell, by means of the transmission response and the dispersion diagrams. For a normal incident plane wave with the E field parallel to the wires and the H field axial to the dipoles, the electric and magnetic responses are excited producing a <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> behaviour which exhibit negative refractive index. This cell has been used to create meta-surfaces for antenna applications. Two configurations have been analysed; the first one is a superstrate of a dipole antenna with the <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> <b>tuned</b> to the resonant frequency of the dipole. It has been observed that the power goes through the meta-surface and is radiated mainly in boresight direction, which increases the directivity up to 8 dBi and the aperture efficiency of the whole configuration. In the second case, a substrate with the stop <b>band</b> <b>tuned</b> to the <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> of the superstrate and the resonant frequency of the dipole has been added. A directivity higher than 9 dBi with a back radiation of - 20 dBi have been obtained. The research presented in this paper has been financially supported by METAMORPHOSE NoE funded by E.

The active inductor <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> filter {{has a better}} performance than the passive <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> filter in on-chip circuit design, due to small area, larger gain and tunable frequency. However, process variation makes the active inductor <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> filter hard to be used widely in many applications.

To drive the peak detector, two analog buffers are designed with f-dB over 6 GHz, and one has 0 dB gain at low frequency region, another one would emphasize 0 dB gain on 6 GHz.

40|$|With the {{completion}} of tests of the prototype cathode-follower, {{it was decided to}} produce three more models. These have been constructed and pass the same pulse as that of the prototype. Drawings are being made of these units. By the time these units had been completed, the amplifier of the scaler was modified so that its frequency response was essentially flat up to 4. 5 megacycles. Using this amplifier and the cathode-follower, a study of the pulse shapes was made and four different pulse shapes were found to be obtainable. A <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> network between the B-wall tube and the input of the cathode-follower provided a very substantial improvement over the shunt peaking network with a <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> of 1. 8 to 6. 5 megacycles and provided clean, uniform pulses.
