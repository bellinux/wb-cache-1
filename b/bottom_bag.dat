[...] The ironworker’s work pliers {{is the main}} tool of a reinforcing bar ironworker. [...] The pliers cuts soft annealed rebar tie wire and twists the wire into place. [...] The pliers have a hook bend handle, and a spring in between the handles for self-opening of the pliers. [...] The pliers cut ACSR, screws, nails and most hardened wire.

5000|$|Hash is a THC {{concentrate}} {{containing the}} extracted {{heads of the}} marijuana plant's trichomes that contain primarily all of the plant's psychoactive THC. The [...] "trim leaf" [...] (small leaves surrounding the flowers) are usually coated in {{a large amount of}} trichomes which are collected by various means to make hash. One simple method of collection is to separate the trichomes from the trim leaf using a basic screen; plant matter containing trichomes is run over or beat against the screen to separate the trichomes. Another method involves freezing the trim and then agitating it with ice to separate the trichomes, the mixture then is filtered through screen bags of decreasing screen sizes ranging from 25-200 µm which capture the plant matter and allow the trichomes to pass to the <b>bottom</b> <b>bag</b> where they collect into a wet paste. The paste is pressed to extract most of the water and pressed into cakes and dried. In a dry-ice sifting process the trim leaf is placed in a filter bag with dry ice and shaken to allow a very pure concentration of trichomes to pass through which can be kept as powder or pressed into cakes.|$|E
40|$|Selecting the {{appropriate}} manufacturing machine {{is a very}} important and complex problem for firms which usually have to deal with both qualitative and quantitative criteria and involve different decision makers whose knowledge is often vague and imprecise. This paper proposes a peer-based modification to intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria group decision making with TOPSIS method (peer IF-TOPSIS) and applies it to a packaging machine selection problem. Intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) operator has been selected both to obtain the group opinion on the relevance of the single decision makers and to aggregate individual opinions of decision makers for rating the importance of criteria and alternatives. A case study illustrates the application of the modified IF-TOPSIS method in order to select a Vertical Form Fill and Seal (VFFS) for Double Square <b>Bottom</b> <b>Bag</b> (DSBB) machine in food packaging. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Lene Schneider-Kainer, (16 May, 1885, Vienna, Austria - 15 June, 1971, Cochabamba, Bolivia), was a Jewish-Austrian artist, daughter of the painter Sigmund Schneider. She studied art throughout Europe, and married Ludwig Kainer in 1910. Schneider-Kainer made her debut as an artist in 1917 with an exhibition at the Galerie Gurlitt, and through the 1920 s she became renowned as painter and illustrator. In 1926 Lene left Berlin after her divorce and for two years accompanied the poet Bernhard Kellermann on an extended odyssey retracing the steps of Marco Polo. She painted, photographed and sketched her impressions, and these contributions appeared regularly in the Berliner Tageblatt. Due {{to the rise of}} the Nazis she settled in Mallorca in 1932, and later Ibiza. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, she left for New York. She continued to exhibit successfully around the world, and in 1954 she settled in Bolivia, where she assisted her son in establishing a textile factory. digitizedDigital imag...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{summarizes the}} results of the Phase 2 acceptance test of the 241 -SY- 101 Flexible Receiver System (FRS). The FRS is one of six major components of the Equipment Removal System, which has been designed to retrieve, transport, and store the test mixer pump currently installed in Tank 241 -SY- 101. The purpose of this acceptance test is to verify the strength of the containment <b>bag</b> and <b>bag</b> <b>bottom</b> cinching mechanism. It is postulated that 68 gallons of waste could be trapped inside the pump internals. The bag must be capable of supporting this waste if it shakes loose and drains to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>bag</b> after the <b>bag</b> <b>bottom</b> has been cinched closed. This acceptance test was performed at the Maintenance and Storage Facility (MASF) Facility in the 400 area on January 23, 1995. The bag assembly supported the weight of 920 kg (2, 020 lbs) of water with no leakage or damage to the bag. This value meets the acceptance criteria of 910 kg of water and therefore the results were found to be acceptable. The maximum volume of liquid expected to be held up in the pump internals is 258 L (68 gallons), which corresponds to 410 kg. This test weight gives just over a safety factor of 2. The bag also supported a small shock load while it was filled with water when the crane hoisted the bag assembly up and down. Based on the strength rating of the bag components, the bag assembly should support 2 [...] 3 times the test weight of 910 kg...|$|R
