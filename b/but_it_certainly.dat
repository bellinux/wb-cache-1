5|$|The kingdom {{ruled by}} Kenneth's descendants—older works used the name House of Alpin to {{describe}} them but descent from Kenneth was the defining factor, Irish sources referring to Clann Cináeda meic Ailpín ("the Clan of Kenneth MacAlpin")—lay {{to the south}} of the previously dominant kingdom of Fortriu, centred in the lands around the River Tay. The extent of Kenneth's nameless kingdom is uncertain, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> extended from the Firth of Forth in the south to the Mounth in the north. Whether it extended beyond the mountainous spine of north Britain—Druim Alban—is unclear. The core of the kingdom was similar to the old counties of Mearns, Forfar, Perth, Fife, and Kinross. Among the chief ecclesiastical centres named in the records are Dunkeld, probably seat of the bishop of the kingdom, and Cell Rígmonaid (modern St Andrews).|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the coat of arms of Póvoa de Varzim is unknown, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> has local traits and symbolism. The coat of arms {{consists}} of a golden sun and a silver moon; in the middle a golden cross completed by two anchor silver arms, representing safety at sea. Over the cross, a ring, of which falls a golden rosary that interlaces with the anchor arms, representing faith and divine protection. The crest is made of five silver towers due to its city status. The flag is broken in blue and white. Between 1939 and 1958, a different coat of Arms and flag were used, which the population criticized; it consisted of a golden shield, covered by a red net, the sea and a black Poveiro boat; the flag was plain red. The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored.|$|E

25|$|Immediately at the war's end, in 1945–1946, Allis-Chalmers {{endured a}} {{crippling}} 11-month labor strike. Buescher {{was convinced that}} the corporation never entirely recovered from the effects of this strike. This seems debatable given the various successes that Allis-Chalmers did have during the next 30 years, including prosperity in the farm equipment business in the 1950s and 1960s. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> gave competitors a chance to grab market share.|$|E
25|$|The Asian whiting {{are another}} smelt whiting, {{distributed}} along the Asian coastline from the Gulf of Thailand to Taiwan. A number of smelt-whiting species are present throughout {{the range of}} the Asian whiting and are taken as food for local consumption.

25|$|In {{shellfish}} and algae farms, biofouling species tend {{to block}} nets and cages and ultimately outcompete the farmed species for space and food. Bacterial biofilms start the colonization process by creating microenvironments that more favorable for biofouling species. In the marine environment, biofilms {{could reduce the}} hydrodynamic efficiency of ships and propellers, lead to pipeline blockage and sensor malfunction, and increase the weight of appliances deployed in seawater. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} biofilm can be a reservoir for potentially pathogenic bacteria in freshwater aquaculture. As mentioned previously, biofilms can be difficult to eliminate even when antibiotics or chemicals are used in high doses.

25|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that as a {{consequence}} of the above Orange Book definition, the boundaries of the TCB depend closely upon the specifics of how the security policy is fleshed out. In the network server example above, even though, say, a Web server that serves a multi-user application is not part of the operating system's TCB, it has the responsibility of performing access control so that the users cannot usurp the identity and privileges of each other. In this sense, it definitely is part of the TCB of the larger computer system that comprises the UNIX server, the user's browsers and the Web application; in other words, breaching into the Web server through e.g. a buffer overflow may not be regarded as a compromise of the operating system proper, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> constitutes a damaging exploit on the Web application.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{referred}} to the people living on the middle St. Johns – the former center of the Utina chiefdom – as the Agua Dulce or Agua Fresca, the Freshwater tribe. Their territory {{was known as the}} Agua Dulce Province. By 1595 Chief Utina appears to have been succeeded, at some remove or another, by the Christian chief Antonico, who ruled from a village also known as Antonico southeast of the old main village. Its precise location is unclear, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> would have been part of Utina's confederacy if it existed at the time. Most of the northern villages, including the main town, were evidently abandoned, and the number of villages in the chiefdom were reduced to about six, situated between the Palatka area and Lake George. In 1595 the Spanish founded a mission in Antonico village; by 1616 they had founded another, Mission San Antonio de Enacape, in the village of Enacape (perhaps the Mount Royal site near Lake George).|$|E

In All Music Guide to Hip-Hop, Jason Birchmeier wrote that Judgement Day, Vol. 1 [...] "may not be his most well-crafted work, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> stands as his most inspired {{work of the}} '90s", while Vol. 2 [...] "isn't quite {{as strong as the}} first volume, suffering mostly from a number of weak tracks [...] the first volume doesn't rely quite so much on cheap shock, instead focusing on evocative horror motifs, making Judgement Day, Vol. 2 the less important of the two." ...|$|E
500|$|Joseph Brannigan Lynch from Entertainment Weekly was {{disappointed}} with the track and called it underwhelming.

[...] However, he praised the chorus line calling it Madonna's [...] "unnerring knack for writing charmingly frivolous lyrics."

500|$|It is possible, therefore, that a {{historical}} king named Ælle existed, who {{arrived from the}} continent in the late 5th century, and who conquered {{much of what is}} now Sussex. [...] He may have been a prominent war chief with a leadership role in a federation of Anglo-Saxon groups fighting for territory in Britain at that time. [...] This may be the origin of the reputation that led Bede to list him as holding overlordship over southern Britain. [...] The battles listed in the Chronicle are compatible with a conquest of Sussex from west to east, against British resistance stiff enough to last fourteen years. [...] His area of military control may have extended as far as Hampshire and north to the upper Thames valley, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> did not extend across all of England south of the Humber, as Bede asserts.|$|E

500|$|Riegels {{sent letters}} to athletes who made similar mistakes. For example, Riegels {{sent a letter}} to Paramount High School's Jan Bandringa in 1957, who had intercepted a pass only to run it 55 yards into his own end zone, {{resulting}} in a safety for Centennial High, who won the game 9–7. Riegels wrote in the letter: [...] "For many years I've had to go along and laugh whenever my wrong-way run was brought up, even though I've grown tired listening and reading about it. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> wasn't the most serious thing in the world. I regretted doing it, even as you do, but you'll get over it." [...] In addition, during an NFL game in 1964 between the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers, Minnesota defensive end Jim Marshall ran a recovered fumble 66 yards into his own end zone (resulting in a safety, but the Vikings won 27–22). Riegels reportedly later sent Marshall a letter reading [...] "Welcome to the club".|$|E
500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "The Job" [...] 8.2/10. He {{believed}} that the episode [...] "pulled off some rather brilliant turns" [...] with the storylines concerning Jan and Jim, Karen, and Pam. Fickett opined however that the episode was at its weakest during the Dwight's take-over scenes in Scranton, as he knew Michael would be returning. He concluded his review on a more positive note by commenting that Ryan's selection [...] "makes for some interesting scenarios for next season. All in all this was a funny episode that wrapped up some key story lines while still leaving open some questions to be answered next season. It wasn't a home run finale, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> has us eagerly await the fall premiere." [...] AOL TV contributor Jay Black highlighted scenes he found humorous, including Dwight's preferred choice of an assistant and Michael's reaction to Jan's implants. He gave the episode [...] "7 Shrute Bucks out of 7." [...] Various cast members were also lauded for their performances, including Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski, and Melora Hardin.|$|E
500|$|Dave Golder of SFX {{gave the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars, {{describing}} it as [...] "slight and fluffy and silly, with the occasional creaky bit of plotting ... but enormously entertaining". He was pleased that the guest characters were played [...] "straight" [...] rather than for comedy, and found the dinosaur effects [...] "great" [...] and the Silurian twist [...] "enriching continuity". However, he felt that the teaser was too fast-paced, Nefertiti was [...] "rather bland", and wrote that it was unlikely the Doctor would have a friendship with a big game hunter. IGN's Matt Risley rated [...] "Dinosaurs on a Spaceship" [...] 7 out of 10, noting that it [...] "isn't going to win any awards for scriptwriting or pathos, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> succeeded on a family-friendly level full of whimsy". Though he wrote that Brian was [...] "brilliant", he overall criticised the [...] "gang", feeling that they [...] "served little purpose other than to inject some conveniently timed plot devices when needed". He also did not like the [...] "bickering Marvin the Paranoid Android-lite" [...] robots. However, Neela Debnath of The Independent enjoyed the gang, writing, [...] "the more companions there are the more variety it adds to the show because each one has their own flaws and backstory".|$|E

500|$|MTV writer Josh Wigler {{thought the}} episode [...] "nearly put [...] to sleep," [...] {{as it was}} [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "a bit of a dud". The episode however did lead Wigler to [...] "start dig" [...] Sam Weiss, and also to enjoying Olivia's subplot, but {{believed}} the episode's monster-of-the-week {{could have been used}} to actually parallel her trauma; Wigler appreciated how the Fringe case tied into Walter and Peter's backstories. He concluded, [...] "It wasn't bad enough to make me concerned for the future of Fringe or anything, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> didn't keep me {{on the edge of my}} seat waiting for the next crazy twist like last week. I'm still loving this season, but tonight's episode was one of the weaker outings." [...] Newsarama's Chanel Reeder stated [...] "Dream Logic" [...] "certainly put the brakes on the speed that Fringe had gained in the previous" [...] episode, but praised the connection with Peter's past as [...] "one of the most interesting underlying parts". Reeder's favorite part was Sam Weiss, calling him [...] "a fantastic dimension to the show". Josie Kafka of Open Salon was more positive than other reviewers, and in particular highlighted the episode's humor, [...] "Almost all of the Cambridge scenes were funny: Astrid and Walter have a great rapport, especially when there's a rube in the room for them to play with." [...] She concluded [...] "I liked this one, more for the great Peter/Olivia and Walter/Astrid stuff than the plot of the week," [...] and gave the episode [...] "Three out of four anagrams".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'Orison' rises above {{its origins in}} the depressing, hackneyed genre of serial-killer dramas. The episode combines a fast pace with a richly gloomy mood, and even serves to blur the all-too-sharp distinction between standalone X-Files stories and the series' 'mythology arc.'" [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4.5 out of 5 stars and called the episode [...] "creepy, dark and wonderful". Rosell argued that the episode [...] "adds fuel to the fiery argument that it is , and not Mulder, that the real heart of the series was built on." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review, writing [...] " [...] was a journey filled with horror, mystery, and self-analysis. It {{was also one of}} the most exhilarating journeys the seventh season has produced thus far." [...] Furthermore, Kessenich defended Scully's actions at the end of the episode writing that [...] "what we saw at the end of 'Orison' was a human being pushed beyond the breaking point by a man [...] it doesn't make what she did right, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> wasn't a difficult thing to understand." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B" [...] and felt that the episode, despite its faults, had elements that were particularly interesting. He noted that the titular chaplain was a [...] "potentially fascinating figure" [...] who was never explored to his full extent, and that the ending was effective in that it [...] "helps transform the episode’s climax into something more than a simple regurgitation". Finally, he positively compared the mood and thematic elements of the episode to Carter's other series Millennium.|$|E
500|$|... 2008: In early March, Favre {{announces that}} he is {{retiring}} from the Green Bay Packers. At a news conference he said [...] "I know I can play, but I don't think I want to. It's been a great career for me, but it's over. As they say, all good things must come to an end. I look forward to whatever the future may hold for me." [...] Later in the month Favre has second thoughts and wants to return. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Favre backed out of a meeting with Packers management two days before re-entry talks were to begin. In April, Sam Farmer from the Los Angeles Times reported that Favre's agent Bus Cook was making inquiries to other teams about Favre. Favre responded by saying [...] "I {{have no idea where}} that came from, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>certainly</b> didn't come from me. I'm happy about my decision and I haven't once said 'I wonder if I made the wrong decision.' I know it's the right one. It's kind of funny. Even when I'm retired, they won't let me stay retired." [...] Also in April, the Packers placed Favre on the Reserve-Retired list and planned to have Favre's number retired during the season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. In June, Favre said he told head coach Mike McCarthy he wanted {{to come back to the}} team. He said [...] "When he picked up the phone again after he dropped it, he said, 'Oh, God, Brett. You're putting us in a tight spot. He said, 'Brett, playing here is not an option.' Those were his exact, exact words." [...] In July, Favre sent a letter requesting his release from the Packers. A couple months earlier Favre contacted Mike McCarthy about coming out of retirement and was [...] "rebuffed" [...] according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel report. Then a report came in from ESPN that said that Favre had wanted to come out of retirement but the Packers were reluctant to take him back. The Packers refused to give Favre an unconditional release. A few days later, Favre had an interview with Greta Van Susteren of Fox News where he accused general manager Ted Thompson of forcing him to make a decision on his return to the team too quickly. Two days after the interview, the Packers filed tampering charges with the NFL front office charging that the Minnesota Vikings had inappropriate contact with Favre. The Packers then offered Favre a retirement package of $25 million marketing agreement to remain retired. This offer was rejected and Favre was subsequently traded to the New York Jets.|$|E
