These chemicals have evolved to affect the biochemistry of insects in very specific ways.

5|$|Two {{types of}} {{analysis}} {{are used in}} the <b>bioprospecting</b> of metagenomic data: function-driven screening for an expressed trait, and sequence-driven screening for DNA sequences of interest. Function-driven analysis seeks to identify clones expressing a desired trait or useful activity, followed by biochemical characterization and sequence analysis. This approach is limited by availability of a suitable screen and the requirement that the desired trait be expressed in the host cell. Moreover, the low rate of discovery (less than one per 1,000 clones screened) and its labor-intensive nature further limit this approach. In contrast, sequence-driven analysis uses conserved DNA sequences to design PCR primers to screen clones for the sequence of interest. In comparison to cloning-based approaches, using a sequence-only approach further reduces the amount of bench work required. The application of massively parallel sequencing also greatly increases the amount of sequence data generated, which require high-throughput bioinformatic analysis pipelines. The sequence-driven approach to screening is limited by the breadth and accuracy of gene functions present in public sequence databases. In practice, experiments make use of a combination of both functional and sequence-based approaches based upon the function of interest, the complexity of the sample to be screened, and other factors.|$|E

The weeds species barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli), wild poinsettia (Euphorbia heterophylla) and morning glory (Ipomoea grandifolia) were used. The effects of the aqueous leaf extract of R. umbellata at concentrations of 10 % and 5 % (g mL- 1) were compared to the control (distilled water) and to the synthetic herbicide oxyfluorfen. The average weed germination time was significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in control than in extract and herbicide treatments. The herbicide had more significant effects than the extract on the initial growth of the aerial part.

Biomimicry is the applied science that derives inspiration for solutions to human problems through the study of nature’s designs, processes, and systems. The article evaluates, promotes and encourages the use of biomimetic materials in the South Africa construction industry. An extant literature review was conducted on biomimetic materials, applications and their roles in the achievement of sustainability in the South African construction industry. The study shows {{that there is a}} misconception of <b>bioprospected</b> and biopirated materials as biomimetic materials, also, the study found that there are already existing materials that were designed based on biomimicry principles. The paper offers a new approach and strategy to achieving a sustainable construction industry in the South African construction industry through the use and incorporation of biomimetic materials into construction activities. Hence, it is envisaged that new ideas and innovations will be proffered which requires an interdisciplinary collaboration between biologists and other stakeholders in the industry.

The present study aimed to <b>bioprospect</b> the potential use of the curculigoside-cinnamic acid-rich fraction from Molineria latifolia rhizome as an antioxidant therapeutic agent. The ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) isolated from M. latifolia rhizome methanolic extract (RME) contained the highest amount of phenolic compounds, particularly curculigoside and cinnamic acid. EAF demonstrated glycation inhibitory activities in both glucose- and fructose-mediated glycation models. In addition, in vitro chemical-based and cellular-based antioxidant assays showed that EAF exhibited high antioxidant activities and a protective effect against oxidative damage in 3 T 3 -L 1 preadipocytes. Although the efficacies of individual phenolics differed depending on the structure and concentration, a correlational study revealed strong correlations between total phenolic contents and antioxidant capacities.

Seven databases were systematically searched for clinical trials, in situ, in vivo and in vitro studies addressing the topic published up to date. Most of the knowledge in the literature is based on in vitro studies assessing the effects of EOs on caries-related streptococci (mainly Streptococcus mutans) and lactobacilli, and on a limited number of clinical trials.

In some cases, the major phytochemical compounds determine the biological properties of EOs. Menthol and eugenol were considered outstanding compounds demonstrating an antibacterial potential.

However, the availability of suitable cellulolytic enzymes has been restricted by the limited number of cellulolytic microbial strains in which these enzymes can be procured. One approach to increase efficiency has been to <b>bioprospect</b> novel thermophilic microbial strains, the logic being that an increase in production temperature will result in increased rates of lignocellulosic hydrolysis. Unfortunately, microbiologists have had limited success in cultivating cellulolytic thermophiles with {{only a small number of}} strains isolated. The goal of this project was to circumvent the need to cultivate cellulolytic thermophiles by applying a metatranscriptomic approach to discover new thermostable cellulases commonly referred to as glycoside hydrolases (GH-enzymes that hydrolyze the glycosidic linkages between sugar molecules). This was achieved by employing a novel in situ enrichment technique to enrich for thermostable GHs directly from a geothermal environment. These GHs were being actively expressed by the resident microbial population to hydrolyse lignocellulose. This approach not only eliminated the need for cultivation, but also selected for the actively expressed GHs unregulated in response to the lignocellulosic material feedstock.
