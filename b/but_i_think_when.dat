The European leg of the tour began approximately one month after the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Guitarist DJ Ashba discussed a potential follow up to Chinese Democracy in a 2012 interview, stating [...] "I've written and demoed up probably about 12 songs, I think.

[...] "We went into season {{with the sense of}} talking about decisions in the team members' lives, and there have been elements of things Tony has been reflecting on all season, which is really why we wanted to do a story with Wendy", executive producer Gary Glasberg told TV Guide.

That's personal to me in terms of my feelings about it. And it was not a casual comment.

Malcolm David Kelley, the child actor who portrayed Walt, had appeared in various film and television projects since a young age before earning a casting call on Lost. A week after his audition, Kelley was told he had won the part. As he was near the age of 12 when cast, series co-creator Damon Lindelof knew the actor's puberty was eventually {{going to be a problem}} and discussed it with J.J. Abrams during filming of the pilot episode. Lindelof recalled in 2014, [...] "There was an inevitability to Malcolm. In fact, casting an actor who... was sort of right on the cusp of blooming, we were in dangerous territory". Once they reached the middle of the season, Lindelof and Carlton Cuse decided to resolve the problem by having Walt be abducted in the season finale.|$|E

So we broke that out early on but kept the original idea. I was thrilled with the changes. I was very thrilled with how emotional it was. Some of that was Network president John Landgraf who felt very strongly that Kit needed to go back in and get Sister Jude out not for himself but for his children. That dialogue was all sort of John's that I thought was very beautiful. Tim Minear did a breath-taking script. It just all came together." ...|$|E

I was pretty new with ARPA and these two guys by the name of Don Thompson and this guy he had gotten to, Hike Buckley from the Air Force Materials Laboratory, came in with blazing six guns. They painted such a picture that I was putty in their hands. So we started this program. I went out on thin ice for it with a pretty sizeable sum of money. I have found that 1 t has been worth it over these three years. There have been, however, over these three years so ambivalent feelings on my part. How do you measure success? What am I going to say to myself 10 - 20 years from now; was this program successful or not?
