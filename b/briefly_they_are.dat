6000|$|The {{confession}} of Herbert de Lernac, now lying under {{sentence of death}} at Marseilles, has thrown a light upon {{one of the most}} inexplicable crimes of the century--an incident which is, I believe, absolutely unprecedented in the criminal annals of any country: Although there is a reluctance to discuss the matter in official circles, and little information has been given to the Press, there are still indications that the statement of this arch-criminal is corroborated by the facts, and that we have at last found a solution for a most astounding business. As the matter is eight years old, and as its importance was somewhat obscured by a political crisis which was engaging the public attention at the time, it may be as well to state the facts as far as {{we have been able to}} ascertain them. They are collated from the Liverpool papers of that date, from the proceedings at the inquest upon John Slater, the engine-driver, and from the records of the London and West Coast Railway Company, which have been courteously put at my disposal. <b>Briefly,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|With {{millions}} of users, Online Social Networks (OSNs) are a huge cultural phenomenon. Put <b>briefly,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> characterized by: i) an intrinsic sharing of personal information, ii) a {{rich set of}} features to publish, organize and retrieve contents, especially for emphasizing their social organization, iii) the in- teraction with a heterogeneous set of devices, e. g., ranging from desktops to mobile appliances, and iv) the mix of Web-based paradigms and sophisticated methodologies for processing data. However, if not properly implemented, or without effective security policies, i) – iv) could lead to severe risks in terms both of privacy and security. In this perspective, this chapter analyzes the major peculiarities of OSN platforms, the preferred development methodologies, and usage patterns, also by taking into account how personal information can be exploited to conduct malicious actions. Then, a graph-based modeling approach is introduced to reveal possible attacks, {{as well as to}} elaborate the needed countermeasures or (automated) checking procedures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis is {{the first}} of a short series of papers {{intended}} to provide one common semantics for several different types of specification language, in order to allow comparison and translations. The underlying idea is that a specification describes the behaviour of a system, depending on parameters. We can represent this behaviour as a functor which acts on structures representing the parameters, and which yields a structure representing the behaviour. We characterise in domain-theoretic terms the class of functors which could in principle be specified and implemented; <b>briefly,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> the functors which preserve directed colimits and whose restriction to finitely presented structures is recursively enumerable. We also characterise those functors which allow specification by initial semantics in universal Horn classes with finite vocabulary; these functors consist of a free functor (i. e. left adjoint of a forgetful functor) followed by a forgetful functor. The main result is that these two classes of functor are the same up to natural isomorphism...|$|E

30|$|Mechanisms {{related to}} central drive such as {{cortical}} output, spinal reflexes and muscle afferents {{have also been}} shown to be influenced by the localised changes in muscle metabolite concentrations (e.g. H+) associated with exercise [99 – 101]. The complex interaction between these mechanisms as they contribute to skeletal muscle fatigue has been previously reviewed [99]. <b>Briefly,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> often categorised as supraspinal (e.g. output of descending motor cortical and corticospinal pathways to the motoneurons) and sub-spinal (e.g. muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, small diameter group III/IV afferents) mechanisms [99] and their relative contribution to skeletal muscle fatigue associated with the intensity of the exercise task. The degree to which H+ accumulation in the periphery affects central mechanisms, particularly during intense exercise, has been related specifically to the central projection of the mechanically and chemically sensitive small diameter group III/IV afferents located within the skeletal muscle [102, 103]. It is believed that the exercise-induced actions of these afferent fibres inhibit the excitability and net output of corticospinal cells in the central nervous system, as well as effect alpha motor neuron excitability [104 – 107].|$|E
40|$|Focal lesions {{and brain}} atrophy {{are the most}} {{extensively}} studied aspects of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the image acquisition and analysis techniques used can be further improved, especially those for studying within-patient changes of lesion load and atrophy longitudinally. Improved accuracy and sensitivity will reduce the numbers of patients required to detect a given treatment effect in a trial, and ultimately, will allow reliable characterization of individual patients for personalized treatment. Based on open issues {{in the field of}} MS research, and {{the current state of the}} art in magnetic resonance image analysis methods for assessing brain lesion load and atrophy, this paper makes recommendations to improve these measures for longitudinal studies of MS. <b>Briefly,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> (1) images should be acquired using 3 D pulse sequences, with near-isotropic spatial resolution and multiple image contrasts to allow more comprehensive analyses of lesion load and atrophy, across timepoints. Image artifacts need special attention given their effects on image analysis results. (2) Automated image segmentation methods integrating the assessment of lesion load and atrophy are desirable. (3) A standard dataset with benchmark results should be set up to facilitate development, calibration, and objective evaluation of image analysis methods for MS. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|Trusts {{were first}} created in England many centuries ago by {{settling}} property upon protective Trusts whereby the income {{was paid to}} successive generations whilst the corpus was maintained intact thereby avoiding death duty. To prevent this, rules were formulated some 250 years ago to prevent the indefinite "tying-up" of property and these still apply today and are generally {{referred to as the}} Rules Against Perpetuity. In New Zealand these Rules have recently been amended but <b>briefly</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> to the effect that property may be placed in Trust for the period of a life in being plus 21 years thereafter or for 80 years. Similarly until the Perpetuities Act, 1964, it was permissible to accumulate income only for a very restricted period and as a result the compilers of Trust Deeds had to be wary that they did not infringe this law which became known as the rule against accumulations. This, however, was abolished with the Perpetuities Act, 1964, and it is now permissible to accumulate income for the full period of the Trust. Many notable authorities have upheld the right of the individual to order his affairs {{in such a way as}} to preserve as much as possible of his funds intact for transmission to his beneficiaries. The classical dictum which has been quoted in many subsequent cases was that of Lord Tomlin in the Duke of Westminister v Inland Revenue Commissioners # 1936 # when he said, "every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so that the Tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be". Planning an Estate and the introduction of a Trust into that plan requires a careful consideration of many varied, and often conflicting objectives. It also involves assessing existing problems and visualising those that may develop in future...|$|E
