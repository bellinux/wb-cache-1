5000|$|<b>Barracouta</b> Ridge (...) {{is a long}} jagged ridge which terminates on {{the north}} in Webster Knob. The ridge is an {{extension}} {{from the base of}} Mount Fridtjof Nansen into the head of Strom Glacier, Queen Maud Mountains. It was discovered and visited in 1929 by the geological party under Laurence Gould of the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, 1928 - 30, and was climbed by geologists of the Southern Party of the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition, 1963 - 64. The descriptive name applied by the Southern Party derives from the appearance of the toothlike pinnacle along the crest of the ridge, reminiscent of a <b>Barracouta.</b>|$|R

5000|$|On 23 October, British {{operations}} {{began with}} the attack on four forts known as the Barrier Forts in the Pearl River. The Coromandel and <b>Barracouta</b> captured the forts with slight opposition, the first shot in the war being fired from the Coromandel. Rear-Admiral Michael Seymour, commander-in-chief of British forces in China, reported no British casualties and four or five Chinese killed due to an [...] "ill-judged resistance". Afterwards, Seymour proceeded to Canton, where he found the Encounter moored off the city near the Canton Factories. He sent the Sampson and <b>Barracouta</b> to secure the free navigation of Blenheim Reach along the river. Both ships took possession of the Blenheim and Macao Forts without resistance. British sailor William Kennedy described {{the scene at the}} city: ...|$|R

40|$|Three {{species of}} underutilised fish: silver warehou, <b>barracouta</b> and Australian salmon, sampled {{in summer and}} winter, fresh and frozen, were cooked as fillets, {{subjected}} to simulated gastrointestinal digestion and bioactive enzymes extracted. Peptide profiles released by in vitro digestion varied with season and fresh or frozen state with seasonal variation most prominent. All peptides released from fish produced high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition with warehou and <b>barracouta</b> more (p < 0. 05) potent than salmon. Low levels of α-amylase inhibition and no α-glucosidase inhibition were observed from all fish. Trypsin inhibition was comparable among all fish with fresh fish having a greater effect than frozen. Allergenicity varied between fresh and frozen and remained relatively constant between seasons {{with the exception of}} silver warehou. The proximate nutrient composition of all species was similar...|$|R

50|$|HMS <b>Barracouta</b> was a Royal Navy Ballahoo-class {{schooner}} of four 12-pounder carronades and {{a crew of}} 20. The {{prime contractor}} for the vessel was Goodrich & Co., in Bermuda, and she was launched in 1804. Like many of her class and the related Cuckoo-class schooners, she succumbed to the {{perils of the sea}} relatively early in her career.|$|R
50|$|HMS <b>Barracouta</b> was {{the last}} paddle sloop built for the Royal Navy. She was built at Pembroke Dockyard and {{launched}} in 1851. She served in the Pacific theatre of the Crimean War, in the Second Opium War and in the Anglo-Ashanti wars. She paid off {{for the last time}} in 1877 and was broken up in 1881.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Barracouta</b> was {{designed}} as a second-class paddle sloop and ordered from Pembroke Dockyard on 25 April 1847. She was armed with two 10-inch (84 cwt) pivot guns and four 32-pounder (25 cwt) guns. Her two-cylinder direct-acting steam engine was provided by Miller, Ravenhill & Salkeld at a cost of £18,228, and produced 300 nominal horsepower, or [...]|$|R
50|$|In 1810, the Kingdom of Holland was a vassal of Napoleonic France {{and hence}} in {{conflict}} with Britain. The French and British were each seeking to control lucrative Indian Ocean trade routes. On 10 May 1810, a squadron consisting of the 36-gun frigate HMS Caroline, formerly French frigate HMS Piedmontaise, 18-gun sloop HMS <b>Barracouta,</b> and the 12-gun transport HMS Mandarin left Madras with money, supplies and troops to support the garrison at Amboyna, recently captured from the Dutch. The frigates and sloop carried a hundred officers and men of the Madras European Regiment, while the Mandarin carried supplies. The squadron was commanded by Captain Christopher Cole, with Captain Charles Foote on the Piedmontaise and Captain Richard Kenah aboard the <b>Barracouta.</b> After departing from Madras, Cole informed Foote and Kenah of Cole's plan to capture the Bandas; Foote and Kenah agreed. In Singapore, Captain Spencer informed Cole that over 700 regular Dutch troops may {{be located in the}} Bandas.|$|R
50|$|Through the 19th century Portland {{developed}} {{to become an}} important fishing port providing for the town and later, with the connection of the railway, to the region as far afield as Ballarat and eventually Melbourne. <b>Barracouta,</b> Australian salmon and crayfish (now southern rock lobster) were the main catches with many fishermen working the bay, around the Lawrence Rocks and in the season, Bridgewater Bay.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1859 the governor-general of eastern Siberia, Nikolay N. Muravyov, visited the {{peninsula}} and bay (somewhat similar to the Bay of the Golden Horn in Constantinople) on the steam corvette Amerika. The peninsula was named Muravyov-Amursky in his honor. The first Europeans to visit the bay, later named the Golden Horn Bay, were the crews of the British warships HMS Winchester and HMS <b>Barracouta</b> in 1855.|$|R
50|$|On August 3, 1865, Waddell finally {{learned of}} the war's end when he met at sea the Liverpool barque <b>Barracouta,</b> which was bound for San Francisco. He {{received}} the devastating news of the surrender of General Joseph E. Johnston's army on April 26, Kirby Smith's army's surrender on May 26, and crucially the capture of President Davis {{and a part of}} his cabinet. Captain Waddell then knew the war was over.|$|R
5000|$|The boats would {{head out}} to the grounds before dawn, most often out through the {{entrance}} to Port Phillip, the infamous and often treacherous The Rip, {{which is where the}} couta boats’ qualities of seaworthiness were proven. Once their quota of <b>barracouta</b> was met, the fishermen turned their efforts to sailing back to port {{as fast as they could}} — the first boat back got the best prices.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Myxosporidiosis of the {{skeletal}} muscle was diagnosed in a pearl scale butterfly fish (Chaerodon). On {{the basis of}} light and electron microscopy, the infectious agent was though to be a Kudoa. The muscle had fusiform cysts containing myxosporidian organisms within hypertrophied fibers. Ultrastructural features of the kudoa organisms were four external shell valves joined by sutural planes. Internally, four pyriform polar capsules with polar filaments were anterior to the sporoplasm. Myxosporidia of the genus Kudoa {{have been reported to}} cause infections in a number of species of both marine and freshwater fish. Although some species of Kudoa infect skeletal muscle [7], others have been reported to infect the gills [6], kidneys [l l], blood 111, and fins [lo] of fish. One species, Kudoa thrysites [15], causes commercially significant losses in newly caught <b>barracouta.</b> This species causes a liquefactive condition of the muscle known as “milky <b>barracouta</b> ” or “pap snoek. ” In affected organs the parasites commonly produce cysts containing thousands of spores. Cysts in muscle are typically fusiform and occupy central areas of the sarcoplasm of individual muscle fibers...|$|R
