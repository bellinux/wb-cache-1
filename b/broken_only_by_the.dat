25|$|The Compromise proved widely popular politically, {{and both}} parties {{committed}} {{themselves in their}} platforms to the finality of the Compromise on sectional issues. The strongest opposition in the South occurred in the states of South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, but Unionists soon prevailed, spearheaded by Georgians Alexander Stephens, Robert Toombs, and Howell Cobb {{and the creation of}} the Georgia Platform. The peace was <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> divisive Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854 introduced by Stephen Douglas, which had the effect of repealing the Missouri Compromise and led directly to the formation of the Republican Party, whose capture of the national government in 1860 led directly to the secession crisis of 1860–1861.|$|E

25|$|The English Electric Canberra is a {{twin-engine}} bomber aircraft, {{capable of}} conducting high-altitude flights and {{making use of}} jet propulsion. The overall design {{has been described as}} being of a simple nature, somewhat resembling a scaled-up Gloster Meteor fighter, except for its use of a mid-wing. The Canberra principally differed from its preceding piston-powered wartime bombers via its twin Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet engines. The fuselage was circular in cross section, tapered at both ends and, cockpit aside, entirely without protrusions; the line of the large, low-aspect ratio wings was <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tubular engine nacelles. The Canberra had a two-man crew under a fighter-style cabin which was furnished with a large blown canopy, but delays {{in the development of the}} intended automatic radar bombsight resulted in the addition of a bomb aimer's position housed within the nose. The pilot and navigator were positioned in a tandem arrangement on Martin-Baker ejection seats.|$|E

500|$|There {{are various}} names for this {{topographic}} feature. The Metacomet Ridge {{is described by}} some sources as a traprock ridge beginning on the Holyoke Range in Belchertown, Massachusetts, and ending at the Hanging Hills in Meriden, Connecticut. A 2004 report conducted for the National Park Service extends that definition to include the entire traprock ridgeline from Greenfield, Massachusetts, to Long Island Sound. The Sierra Club has referred to the entire range in Connecticut as [...] "The Traprock Ridge". Geologically and visually, the traprock ridgeline exists as one continuous landscape feature from Belchertown, Massachusetts, to Branford, Connecticut at Long Island Sound, a distance of , <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> river gorges of the Farmington River in northern Connecticut and the Westfield and Connecticut Rivers in Massachusetts. [...] Until January 2008, the United States Board on Geographic Names (USBGN) did not recognize Metacomet Ridge, Traprock Ridge or any other name, although several sub-ranges were identified. Geologists usually refer to the overall range generically as [...] "the traprock ridge" [...] or [...] "the traprock mountains" [...] or refer to it with regard to its prehistoric geologic significance in technical terms. Further complicating the matter {{is the fact that}} traprock only accounts for the highest surface layers of rock strata on the southern three–fourths of the range; an underlying geology of related sedimentary rock is also a part {{of the structure of the}} ridge; in north central Massachusetts it becomes the dominant strata and extends the range geologically from the Holyoke Range another [...] through Greenfield to nearly the Vermont border. This article describes the entire Metacomet Ridge and all geologic extensions of it.|$|E

2500|$|Scallon's {{debut album}} All Kinds of Everything, {{recorded}} at Decca Studios in West Hampstead {{on the weekend}} of 25 April 1970, was released in June and included four tracks co-written by the singer, {{as well as a}} new recording of the album's title track.

2500|$|The {{principal}} facade is {{the long}} West {{facade of the}} corps de logis and its flanking pavilions. Built of Bath stone, the three-storied rectangular corps de logis has a rusticated ground floor, with a piano nobile above and a bedroom floor above this. This block is of seven bays; the central three bays are behind a recessed Ionic portico. Entrance to the mansion is by three segmented arches under the portico, or more formally, by climbing a double curved staircase behind the three arches. The stairs rise to an open loggia beneath the portico which gives access to the mansion's principal entrance. The [...] is designed to indicate the status of their floor. Thus, small windows indicate the domestic ground floor and secondary upper floor, while {{the windows of the}} first floor piano nobile are tall and large.

2500|$|Perhaps Hall's {{greatest}} {{performance of}} the English summer was in the second Test at Lord's. On {{the final day of}} the Test, Hall bowled unchanged for 200 minutes, <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tea interval. As in the Tied Test in Brisbane three years earlier, Hall found himself bowling the final over of the match with both sides still capable of winning. In the innings as a whole Hall bowled 40 overs for a return of 4/93 but despite Hall's brave efforts, England managed to hold on for a draw—the England batsman Colin Cowdrey returned to the crease with a broken arm to help save the match. The Times said of Hall that day, [...] "His energy was astonishing, his stamina inexhaustible, his speed awesome, from the first ball to the last". Hall himself claimed that it was his [...] "finest hour". There was a sour note in the final Test at The Oval when Hall was informally warned about intimidatory bowling. Hall bowled two successive bouncers to the England opening batsman Brian Bolus, prompting umpire Syd Buller to speak with West Indies captain Worrell saying, [...] "We don't want this sort of bowling to get out of hand otherwise I will have to speak to the bowler." [...] Later than innings, Griffith was formally warned by the same umpire.|$|E
2500|$|The bottom {{fell out}} in the 1972–73 season. For all intents and purposes, the season ended when Cunningham bolted to the ABA, leaving the Sixers with a roster of Greer and little else. The 76ers lost their first 15 games of the season, and {{a few months later}} set a then-record 20-game losing streak in a single season. Their record {{following}} the 20-game losing streak was 4–58, and the team at that point had just lost 34 of 35 games. The 76ers finished the season with a 9–73 record, leading the skeptical Philadelphia press to call them the [...] "Nine and 73-ers". Under coach Roy Rubin the 76ers went 4–47. It was his first and, as it turned out, his last NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach Kevin Loughery, who went 5–26 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. The nine wins by the 1972–73 squad is the fourth fewest in NBA history, and remains the fewest for a full 82 game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remains the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers’ 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and is still the second lowest in NBA history, <b>broken</b> <b>only</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 2011–12 Charlotte Bobcats, who finished 7–59 for a [...]106 winning percentage in a season shortened due to a lockout. Only six seasons earlier, the 76ers had set the NBA record for most wins in a season. The 76ers of 1972–73 are generally considered to be the worst team an NBA franchise has ever put on the court – although NBA historian Kyle Wright argued in a 2007 study that owing to weaker schedules the 1992–93 Mavericks and 1997–98 Nuggets, both of whom won eleven games, plus the inaugural Cleveland Cavaliers who played an extremely weak schedule, were actually poorer teams.|$|E
