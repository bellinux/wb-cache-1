40|$|If {{a strong}} {{sinusoidal}} signal {{is sent to}} a vented <b>bass</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> we do not only hear the fundamental frequency, but also higher harmonics not present in the original signal. This nonlinear distortion is partially due to {{the response of the}} electro-mechanical components and partially due to the transfer behavior of the enclosed air. Here, we investigate the latter effect. In particular, we show how to design a reflex tube {{in order to reduce the}} induced first overtone to a minimum. Obviously, the problem cannot be formulated in the framework of linear acoustics. On the other hand, solving the full Euler equations in each step of a shape optimization is impracticable. Therefore, we propose a correction to the linear Helmholtz equation. In contrast to the classical second order equation of nonlinear acoustics it consists just in a second inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation for the first harmonic and an algebraic equation for the radiation pressure. The system of linear PDEs may be solved sequentially. A Lagrangian description takes into account moving boundaries in a natural way and pressure is chosen as unknown rather than the velocity potential, which cannot be measured...|$|E
40|$|Data on {{the effect}} on mucociliary {{clearance}} of oral high frequency oscillation is conflicting. By means of a technique to superimpose high frequency oscillation on tidal breathing, changes in mucociliary clearance during high frequency oscillation were studied in seven normal non-smokers by monitoring the clearance of inhaled radiolabelled aerosol from the lungs. After inhalation of 5 microns technetium 99 m labelled particles under controlled conditions, whole lung clearance was monitored by scintillation counters half hourly for six hours with a final count at 24 hours, from which tracheobronchial deposition and clearance could be calculated. Control and high frequency oscillation studies were performed on separate days in random order. Oral high frequency oscillation was applied by a <b>bass</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> through a mouthpiece to superimpose sinewave oscillations (RMS input pressure 1. 2 cm H 2 O, mean pressure zero) on normal breaths. On high frequency oscillation days 30 minutes of oscillation alternated with 30 min of rest. Between 3 and 4. 5 hours mucociliary clearance with high frequency oscillation exceeded control by about 10 % (p less than 0. 05). The mean time taken to eliminate 90 % of deposited radioaerosol from the tracheobronchial tree fell from 4 hours 50 minutes (range 1 h 52 min- 6 h 50 min) during control to 3 hours 43 minutes (range 2 hr 28 min- 5 hr 54 min) during the high frequency oscillation run (p less than 0. 05). Possibly this comfortable, simple technique would be of therapeutic benefit to patients with chronic sputum retention and merits further investigation...|$|E
40|$|In {{the thesis}} the author {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} which describes the behaviour of the acoustical pressure (sound), produced by a <b>bass</b> <b>loudspeaker.</b> The underlying physical propagation of sound is described by the non [...] linear isentropic Euler system in a Lagrangian description. This system is expanded via asymptotical analysis up to third order in the displacement of the membrane of the loudspeaker. The differential equations which describe the behaviour of the key note and the first order harmonic are compared to classical results. The boundary conditions, which are derived up to third order, {{are based on the}} principle that the small control volume sticks to the boundary and is allowed to move only along it. Using classical results of the theory of elliptic partial differential equations, the author shows that under appropriate conditions on the input data the appropriate mathematical problems admit, by the Fredholm alternative, unique solutions. Moreover, certain regularity results are shown. Further, a novel Wave Based Method is applied to solve appropriate mathematical problems. However, the known theory of the Wave Based Method, which {{can be found in the}} literature, so far, allowed to apply WBM only in the cases of convex domains. The author finds the criterion which allows to apply the WBM in the cases of non [...] convex domains. In the case of 2 D problems we represent this criterion as a small proposition. With the aid of this proposition one is able to subdivide arbitrary 2 D domains such that the number of subdomains is minimal, WBM may be applied in each subdomain and the geometry is not altered, e. g. via polygonal approximation. Further, the same principles are used in the case of 3 D problem. However, the formulation of a similar proposition in cases of 3 D problems has still to be done. Next, we show a simple procedure to solve an inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation using WBM. This procedure, however, is rather computationally expensive and can probably be improved. Several examples are also presented. We present the possibility to apply the Wave Based Technique to solve steady [...] state acoustic problems in the case of an unbounded 3 D domain. The main principle of the classical WBM is extended to the case of an external domain. Two numerical examples are also presented. In order to apply the WBM to our problems we subdivide the computational domain into three subdomains. Therefore, on the interfaces certain coupling conditions are defined. The description of the optimization procedure, based on the principles of the shape gradient method and level set method, and the results of the optimization finalize the thesis...|$|E

40|$|At the Laboratory of Acoustic Imaging and Sound Control, much {{research}} {{is done in}} the field of room acoustics. The impulse response is widely regarded as the most meaningful characteristic in room acoustics. For a certain combination of source and receiver position, the impulse response is the sound pressure at the receiver position as a function of time generated by an acoustic pulse emitted at the source position. A major requirement for the source is omnidirectionality: the source must radiate acoustic energy equally in all directions. In 1980, Beentjes [2] has developed an acoustic source consisting of a 32 -face source sphere and a separate <b>bass</b> <b>loudspeaker.</b> This source radiates omnidirectionally from 60 to 2800 Hz. Taking in account that the range of interest is from 50 to 5000 Hz, a successor is desirable. In the present research, the utility of a rotating loudspeaker for room response measurements is investigated. In theory, reproducing a linear frequency sweep with a rotating source results in decomposition of the directivity of the source. The contributions of the mono-pole, dipole and higher order pole terms to the directivity pattern of the source are separated. A monopole is omnidirectional, thus the response to an omnidirectional source can be calculated. Simulations confirm the theory, the directivity is decomposed. Use of a ‘normal’ linear frequency sweep results in a required measuring time of at least 100 minutes, which is not acceptable. Use of parallel linear frequency sweeps reduces the required time to a couple of minutes. A disadvantage of parallel sweeps is that the position of the turntable at the beginning must be the same as the position at the ending of the measurement. This requires a very constant angular velocity of the turntable. Doppler effects have a large influence on the impulse response. Doppler effects result in a complex directivity, resulting in many higher order pole contributions to the impulse response. In addition, the power spectrum gets the shape of a sinc-function, with a smaller central peak for a higher angular velocity. Experiments confirm the results of the simulation. The impulse response of a rotating loudspeaker under anechoic conditions shows many peaks at the positions corresponding to monopole, dipole and higher order poles. The S/N ratio in room measurements is 65 dB at best and 40 dB at worst, which is a very promising result. Using better equipment, the S/N ratio can become even higher. The rotating source in combination with a frequency sweep is a promising tool for impulse response measurements in rooms. The idea of creating a monopole with one loudspeaker is elegant and the achieved S/N ratio is very good. A negative point is the high demand on the measuring equipment (a very constantly rotating turntable is necessary). A problem that has not been investigated in this research, is the extension to 3 D. A rotating speaker has only a monopole directivity component in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. Radiation {{in the direction of the}} rotation axis is not influenced by the rotation. Therefore, a loudspeaker rotating on one axis does not radiate isotropically.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{explores the}} use of <b>bass</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> as both {{acoustic}} sources and broadband absorbers. We develop the theory for a point active absorber immersed in the anechoic field from a point source. This will apply to normal loudspeakers used as either sources or absorbers at frequencies below about 300 Hz, where they act much like points. The result extends the theory of Nelson and Elliott for a point absorber interacting with a plane wave. An extra oscillatory interference term occurs which should largely cancel in rooms due to the varying distances between all the source images and the absorber. Responses were measured in several small rooms from source and absorber loudspeakers to both a few listening microphones and microphones mounted very near the absorber diaphragms. Boundary element calculations are needed to allow optimal absorber signals {{to be derived from}} the absorber microphones. We use precomputed absorber signals to avoid the serious stability issues of self-actuated active absorbers.

40|$|International audienceSome years ago, the LAUM, {{together}} with the CTTM developed a new impedance sensor based on a controlled volume velocity source. The impedance of a measured system was easily and accurately obtained from 20 to 5000 Hz. Due to {{the low level of}} the generated volume velocity, this sensor is mainly devoted to laboratory studies (musical acoustics, porous material characterization [...] .). For this measurement principle to be applied to engineering topics, a new device is conceived, using a recently developed electrodynamic transducer.

To illustrate the capabilities of this new impedance sensor, the characterization and tuning of a <b>loudspeaker</b> <b>bass</b> reflex enclosure is performed. The sensor measures the low frequency acoustic impedance of the enclosure seen from the loudspeaker location. The measured impedance is then compared with a lumped element model.

50|$|The {{acoustic}} suspension woofer {{provided an}} elegant {{solution to the}} age-old problem of <b>bass</b> distortion in <b>loudspeakers</b> caused by non-linear, mechanical suspensions in conventional loudspeakers. The acoustic suspension woofer (sometimes known as “air suspension”) used the elasticity of air within a small, sealed enclosure of about 1.7 cuft L to provide the restoring force for the woofer cone. The entrapped air of the sealed-loudspeaker enclosure -— unlike the mechanical springs of conventional speakers—provided an (almost) linear spring for the woofer's diaphragm, enabling it to {{move back and forth}} great distances (“excursion”) in a linear fashion, a requirement in the reproduction of deep bass tones. The disadvantage of this arrangement is low efficiency; since the restoring force is large with a large woofer in a small cabinet, the cone must be massive to keep the resonant frequency in the required low bass region. The AR-1s were about a factor of 10 less efficient than other (physically much larger) existing speakers with the same bass response, but since higher power amplifiers were becoming available about the same time, this was a reasonable trade-off to get good bass response from a relatively small speaker.|$|R
