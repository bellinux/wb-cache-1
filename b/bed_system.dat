40|$|It is {{essential}} that design of bed clothes in healthcare and other industries e. g. hospitality are suitable for the personnel when they perform bedding tasks. The bed clothes are important not just for patients’ experience of healthcare service, but also for serving as tools for nurses satisfaction and performance in the bed making task. Ergonomics and work load of the nurses are directly affected from design and development of product characteristics (material, weight etc.) and related tasks to make the bedding. Still, {{there is a question}} of how bed making can be improved considering from aspects related to work (e. g. time), ergonomics and emotional satisfaction for nursing personnel. This study focuses on affective and ergonomic effects of making patient beds for nursing personnel, by using an Affective (Kansei) Engineering approach comparing a new <b>bedding</b> <b>system</b> with the conventional bedding. In principle, the main objective is to understand the nurses´ perceptions towards the bed making task with the new product compared with conventional bed clothes (conventional bedding material), based on affective, ergonomics and discomfort criteria. Fourteen female nurses (N= 14) employed at the heart intensive care unit of a hospital in western Sweden participated in the study. Qualitative and quantitative methods were employed to investigate the <b>bedding</b> <b>systems.</b> All participants performed three trials with the new and the conventional bedding in randomized order. Affective evaluation included measurement of subjective responses with Kansei words (expressing feelings), measurement of overall experiences and comparison between the two <b>bedding</b> <b>systems.</b> Productivity related measurements included task descriptions and measurement of work cycle times. Measurements of physical load included calculation of static compression forces for the postures of forward bending and hand elevation above shoulders, related time durations and frequencies and as well as discomfort evaluations.   In order to examine participants’ affective responses paired samples t- test was employed. Correlation analysis was applied to test associations between Kansei words. Independent sample t-test was used to analyze the bedding time durations. Paired samples t- tests were performed to compare the new and the conventional system regarding compression forces in forward bending, hand elevation above shoulders, frequencies and time durations for the two postures and to evaluate overall experiences. Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to investigate participants’ perceived levels of discomfort for different body parts. For statistical analysis of data SPSS 15. 0 (SPSS, 2006) and Minitab 15. 0 were used. For the analysis of physical loads, the University of Michigan's 3 D Static Strength Prediction Program (3 DSSPP) (6. 0. 2) was used to compute static compression forces on lower back for forward bending on the chosen each test condition.     Study conclusions are as follows: Affective preferences were significantly positive towards the new bedding. For the new <b>bedding</b> <b>system,</b> Kansei word "quality" was positively correlated to "nice to touch". For the conventional <b>bedding</b> <b>system,</b> "quality" was positively correlated to "comfort" and "soft". The time analysis showed that significantly less time was needed to make a patient bed with the new <b>bedding</b> <b>system.</b> Results have shown significantly decreased workloads with the new <b>bedding</b> <b>system.</b> One person is able to do the new bedding with fewer tasks. The new bedding required higher compression forces on the lower back compared to conventional bedding. However, all compression forces were below the limits according to the NIOSH guidelines. Frequency and time durations of forward bending are decreased with the new bedding compared to the conventional bedding. Moreover, hand elevation above shoulders is not needed with the new <b>bedding</b> <b>system</b> while it is necessary with the conventional bedding. The discomfort evalutions indicate that the new bedding gave significantly less neck and shoulder discomfort. The participants´ overall preferences were found significantly positive for the new <b>bedding</b> <b>system.</b> Further overall comparisons on the same scale confirmed that the new <b>bedding</b> <b>system</b> is preferred compared to the conventional <b>bedding</b> <b>system.</b> To conclude, the current study showed that the new bedding product was found more functional and aesthetically appealing and satisfying as well ergonomically designed compared with conventional bedding by the nursing personnel. ...|$|R

The {{remediation}} {{effects of}} a real urban river water body was studied using four floating <b>bed</b> <b>systems,</b> in which Caldesia parnassifolias, Sagittaria sagittifolia, Cyperus alternifolius, Ipomoea aquatica Forsk. were planted. A compared system without plant was also carried out. The results showed that all the 4 planted floating systems had obvious removal rates of TN and TP. After 7 days, both the TN and TP were removed speedily in the C. parnassifolias system and their levels were below “environmental surface water quality standards ” class II, for which the concentration of TN and TP were 0. 5 mg/L and 0. 1 mg/L respectively. However, concentrations of TN and TP changed little in control. Further, TN and TP contents in the plants increase gradually, while TN and TP in the water reducing, because the nitrogen and phosphorus were necessary elements for plant growth. This research showed that building floating <b>bed</b> <b>systems</b> to purify water was effective. Since the effect of C. parnassifolias was significant and C. alternifolius has remarkable low temperature adaptability, they were more fitting for building the floating <b>bed</b> <b>systems</b> for urban river remediation...|$|R

50|$|The {{reaction}} {{between the}} oils and the enzyme causes the fatty acids of the triglycerides to exchange positions to the -1 and -3 glycerides, thereby altering the chemical composition and physical {{properties of the}} fat. Using a 1,3-specific enzyme, only the fatty acids in the 1,3 positions are shifted around, and the 2-position is untouched. Unsaturated fatty acids in the 2-position are more often found naturally in plant lipids or vegetable oil sources. Allowing the rearrangement of the saturated fatty acids {{to occur in the}} 1-position and 3-position increases the amount of bioavailable unsaturated fatty acids. Enzymes most suitable for this process are esterase; acylase; those enzymes that facilitate acidolysis reactions, transesterification reactions, ester synthesis or ester interchange reactions; enzymes having phospholipase or protease activity, including thermostable and thermotolerant hydrolase activity; and polynucleotides. From the two original fats, six different structures are produced during enzymatic Interesterification. A fixed <b>bed</b> <b>system</b> is the most common commercial process used for enzymatic interesterification.
