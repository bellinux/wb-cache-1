[...] Mike Thomas from Chicago Sun-Times said that [...] "Filled with private details from Madonna's life, Taraborrelli gives us the first in-depth look at the Material Girl in more than a decade. The following outtakes from friends, former friends, Taraborrelli and Madonna herself were hand–picked for your perusing pleasure. Or displeasure. Madonna, as with all pop icons, is an acquired taste." ...|$|E

She has been called [...] "intelligent, compassionate, hard-working, oftentimes outspoken, easily distracted, and indecisive" [...] by Grey's Anatomy executives. Pompeo says she is unaware if her {{character}} knows how to have fun, adding: [...] "All of my scenes with [...] are the same—we're either breaking up or having sex."

2500|$|Goodfellas {{is based}} on New York crime {{reporter}} Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy. Martin Scorsese {{did not intend to}} make another mob film until he saw a review of Pileggi's book, which he then read while working on the set of Color of Money in 1986. He had always been fascinated by the Mob lifestyle and was drawn to Pileggi's book because it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read. After reading Pileggi's book, the filmmaker knew what approach he wanted to take: [...] "To begin Goodfellas like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer. I think it's {{the only way you can}} really sense the exhilaration of the lifestyle, and to get a sense of why a lot of people are attracted to it." [...] According to Pileggi, Scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> book my entire life", to which Pileggi replied, [...] "I've <b>been</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> phone call my entire life".|$|E
