[...] In 1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die, Tom Moon described OK Computer as a [...] "prescient... dystopian essay on the darker implications of technology... oozing [...] a vague sense of dread, and a touch of Big Brother foreboding that bears strong resemblance to the constant disquiet of life on Security Level Orange, post-9/11." [...] Chris Martin of Coldplay remarked that, [...] "It would <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the world would be different if Dick Cheney really listened to Radiohead's OK Computer.

500|$|In February 2006, {{four months}} before the release of Superman Returns, Warner Bros. {{announced}} a summer 2009 theatrical release date for a sequel, with Bryan Singer returning as director. Brandon Routh, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Sam Huntington, Frank Langella, and Tristan Lake Leabu were expected to reprise their roles, however, {{with the release of}} Superman Returns in July 2006, Warner Bros. was hesitant on moving forward with development. Warner Bros. President Alan F. Horn explained that Superman Returns was a very successful film, but that it [...] "should have done $500million worldwide. We should have had perhaps a little more action to satisfy the young male crowd." [...] Singer reacted incredulously to the studio complaints, saying, [...] "That movie made $400million! I don't know what constitutes under-performing these days..." [...] Filming was supposed to start in March 2008; no screenplay was ever written, but Singer would have titled it Man of Steel, with an interest in Darkseid as the main villain. Singer stressed {{that it would have been}} more action-packed than Superman Returns. while writer Michael Dougherty was interested in using Brainiac. [...] "In my mind, if the Kryptonians really were a space-faring race... it would only make sense that there would've been colonies and off-planet missions... other Kryptonians making their way to Earth seemed like a pretty big one. It wouldn't necessarily be evil right off the bat. That's too easy and cliché... I think it'd <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> these other Kryptonians show up, land and have all these powers and [...] how to adapt to them." ...|$|E

[...] Loeb, who was familiar with driving on nighttime stages in the French Rally Championship, said, [...] "In the dark you have to drive like you can when you have only two passes on the recce, and then you also start with the fastest stage.

2500|$|In May 2012, writer Cullen Bunn {{stated that}} the concept of the series came to him while {{scripting}} the fifth or sixth issue of , which also starred Valkyrie. Bunn said he was campaigning for the book following the conclusion of Fear Itself: The Fearless, when an editor pitched the idea of doing it as a Defenders title. However Bunn explained that beyond the name there is [...] "little connection" [...] to the Defenders. In November 2012, Marvel Comics teased the announcement of The Fearless Defenders by releasing an image of the word [...] "Fearless" [...] with the creative team of Bunn and artist Will Sliney. A week later, Marvel made the full announcement. Bunn said, [...] "The basic idea of the book is that Valkyrie is choosing a new team of Valkyrior, and she's been asked to choose all these women from the heroes of Midgard (Earth), instead of from Asgard". Bunn also said that Misty Knight co-stars in the series, [...] "They're our co-leads, {{and the rest of the}} team will build around them. I think it'll <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> the two of them see things differently. You've got Misty, who's a very street-level character. And you've got Valkyrie, who's a goddess". Dani Moonstar was revealed as the third member of team. Bunn said, [...] "She has such a connection to the Valkyrie. She was on the top of my list when I started putting together who I thought would be the core roster".|$|E

2500|$|When Dyer's casting in {{the series}} was announced, Daniel Kilkelly from {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy expected reactions to be mixed, as comments made by the website's readers about Dyer {{in the past have}} included both praise and derision, and felt the announcement would spark debate. Kilkelly felt positive about the casting, saying: [...] "Dyer has a strong screen presence {{which is going to be}} crucial when it comes to taking over such an important role in EastEnders. Recent new characters to join the show have seemed to stay on the sidelines with no clear direction, while the plan for Mick is for him to join the Square and take on his new job straight away. Dyer should definitely be up to the task of hitting the ground running." [...] He was relieved that Dyer would not be playing another hardman character, saying that [...] "it should <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> he rises to the challenge." [...] However, he opined that casting a well-known actor who divides opinions could be a risk, as fans of the show may see Dyer, rather than his character, moving into the show, and hoped that the actor's profile would not lead to him leaving the series after only a short stint. Alex Fletcher from the site said, [...] "Danny Dyer. In EastEnders. The two things together still don't quite seem believable, but it really is happening", and predicted he would be [...] "awesome".|$|E
2500|$|Non-video game {{publications}} gave {{high praise}} for the game also. [...] The Digital Fix gave it nine out of ten, saying that it [...] "marks a new direction for the series and one that deserves your attention. Not only does it provide top notch visuals, a fantastic summer soundtrack and a wealth of racing options, it makes a traditionally sterile racing simulator just down right [...] fun." [...] The Daily Telegraph gave it a score of four stars out of five, calling it [...] "a thrilling, charismatic, feel-good racer. They are the definitions that matter." [...] The Globe and Mail also gave it a score of eight out of ten, calling it [...] "a refreshing take on the racing genre that successfully straddles the line between serious car porn simulation and arcade-like bang 'em up games (including its voracious hunger for your [...] "quarters")." [...] Digital Spy similarly gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "It will <b>be</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> Forza Horizon fares against , Criterion's new open world racer that is out next month. But {{in the absence of}} that review, it is clear that Playground Games has seriously raised the bar in all areas for the non-linear racing genre with Forza Horizon, and others will now have to play catchup." [...] The Guardian likewise gave it four stars out of five, stating, [...] "The game's most compelling aspect is its almost RPG-like popularity engine, which encourages you to see every slight kink in the road as a means to show off. If driving like a hooligan without having to face any consequences – in cars you'll never be able to afford – sounds appealing, then you'll love Forza Horizon. Whether by accident or design, Microsoft has hit upon a format that gives its flagship driving franchise the credibility it previously lacked." ...|$|E
