40|$|The present {{research}} {{is focused on}} the behavior of a <b>type</b> of <b>joint</b> between hollow sections. A theoretical model is created with the finite element method simulating a beam to column joint. The member which acts as the beam or as the brace of the joint (bi) is the same type of section with the other one act as the column or the chord (bo). Both members are square hollow sections. Firstly, the effect of the shear force due to the bending moment is examined with additionally the effect or the geometric ratio (β = bi/bo) and the thickness ratio (τ = ti/to) in the resistance of normal <b>type</b> <b>joint.</b> According to the parametric analysis followed, the design resistances of these <b>types</b> of <b>joints</b> are compared to those mentioned to EC 3 and those proposed of the research study worldwide in the same <b>type</b> of <b>joints</b> under axial loads. Joints are classified according the pre-mentioned limits for open sections and the resultant moment-rotation curves. An experimental study of these normal joints is made. <b>Joints</b> of “X” <b>type</b> in scale 1 : 1 and geometric ratios β = 0. 66 and β = 1. 0 are examined including 4 moment <b>type</b> <b>joints.</b> In sequence, the previous <b>type</b> of <b>joints</b> are examined with the chord-column member rotated by 45 o consisting a “bird-beak” joint. With the same parametric analysis the effect the geometric ratio (β = bi/bo) and the thickness ratio (τ = ti/to) in the resistance of this new <b>type</b> of <b>joint</b> is examined. The results obtained are compared to those for normal joints and classified according to their strength and rotational stiffness. A formula is proposed for the design resistance of these <b>types</b> of <b>joints.</b> The behavior of these theoretical models which are created with fem is also compared with the experimental results of “b-b” “X” <b>type</b> <b>joints</b> in scale 1 : 1 and geometric ratios β = 0. 66 and β = 1. 0 including 4 new moment <b>type</b> <b>joints.</b> ...|$|R

Aims: We conducted a cohort study to describe the clinical manifestations, incidence of persistent arthralgia, and the associated risk factors among patients with CHIK identified during an outbreak {{in a suburb of}} Chennai, India. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cum prospective cohort study in Gowripet, Avadi, Chennai. We included all adult CHIK case patients identified during the outbreak. We conducted a nested case-control study to identify the risk factors for persistent arthralgia defined as a CHIK case experiencing arthralgia for more than 15 days from the date of onset of illness. We included all 81 patients and 81 randomly selected controls. Results: All 403 case patients had joint pain. Approximately 40 % suffered joint pain for up to 1 month and 7 % had it beyond 1 year. The most commonly affected <b>types</b> of <b>joints</b> were knee (96 %), wrist (80 %), and ankle (77 %) joints.

These structures have to fulfil two main criteria: firstly, an allowable stress distribution for safety and secondly, a maximum horizontal displacement for serviceability. To realize a stabilising façade, the framework and glass panes have to be structurally bonded. A proper technique is a circumferentially glued <b>joint.</b> Three <b>joint</b> <b>types</b> and two adhesives are investigated. <b>Joint</b> <b>type</b> 1 is a polyurethane joint on end. <b>Joint</b> <b>type</b> 2 is a two-sided epoxy <b>joint</b> and <b>joint</b> <b>type</b> 3 is a one-sided epoxy joint. The square annealed single glass pane and a <b>joint</b> <b>type</b> are placed in a frame which is horizontally loaded at the right top corner (deformation controlled). The load-displacement relation of a system with <b>joint</b> <b>type</b> 1 is bi-linear. The first part has a low stiffness without cracking, because the pane shifts and rotates within the flexible joint. The second part has a large stiffness, because the displaced pane is activated mechanically accompanying with cracking at the corners of the compression strut.
