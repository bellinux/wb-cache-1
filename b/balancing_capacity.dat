Previous works are limited on cutting down the power consumption of datacenters to defuse such a concern. In this paper, we show how the spatial and temporal variabilities of the electricity carbon footprint can be fully exploited to further green the cloud running on top of geographically distributed datacenters. Specifically, we first verify that electricity cost minimization conflicts with carbon emission minimization, based on an empirical study of several representative geo-distributed cloud services. We then jointly consider the electricity cost, service level agreement (SLA) requirement, and emission reduction budget. To navigate such a three-way tradeoff, we take advantage of Lyapunov optimization techniques to design and analyze a carbon-aware control framework, which makes online decisions on geographical load <b>balancing,</b> <b>capacity</b> right-sizing, and server speed scaling. Results from rigorous mathematical analysis and real-world trace-driven evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in reducing both electricity cost and carbon emission.

30|$|The rapid {{aging of}} society has {{recently}} become more prominent in first world countries. In order to prolong not only average life spans, but also healthy life expectancy, {{it is important}} to maintain and/or improve motor functions. Since muscle strength and <b>balancing</b> <b>capacity</b> decrease with age, the risk of falls may be avoided by exercise interventions that improve these functions. A systematic review presented by Sherrington et al.

40|$|High {{incidence}} of falls and {{increased risk of}} fall-related injuries are seen in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) is a reliable instrument for balance assessment in the population of (older) adults with ID. The aims {{of this study were}} to assess the <b>balance</b> <b>capacities</b> of a large group of older adults with ID with the BBS and look for gender and age effects, as well as reasons for drop-out on separate items, and to identify feasible subtests for subgroups in which the complete BBS is not feasible. The <b>balance</b> <b>capacities</b> of 1050 older clients with borderline to profound ID of three Dutch care-provider services (mean age 61. 6 [sd = 8. 0]) were assessed with the BBS. The participants who completed all items of the BBS (n = 508) were the functionally more able part of the study sample. Results showed that even this functionally more able part had poor <b>balance</b> <b>capacities,</b> with a mean BBS score of 47. 2, 95 % CI [46. 3, 48. 0], similar to adults in the general population aged around 20 years older. <b>Balance</b> <b>capacities</b> decreased with increasing age and females had poorer <b>balance</b> <b>capacities</b> than males. Difficulties understanding the task and physical limitations were most often the reasons for drop-out. Feasible subtests were identified for the subgroups with very low cognitive levels and wheelchair users. Low <b>balance</b> <b>capacities</b> of older adults with ID show the need for regular screening and the urge for fall prevention programs for individuals with ID. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Germany's current {{efforts to}} decarbonize its {{electricity}} system are analysed. As nuclear power and fossil power plants equipped with {{carbon capture and storage}} were ruled out in 2011, renewable electricity generation (RES) together with electricity savings {{are the primary}} focus for achieving decarbonization. Germany aims to have RES account for at least 80 % of its electricity by 2050. Achieving renewable generation needs strong political support and regulatory provisions for its market integration. Four main technical and regulatory challenges are the maintenance of a steady and efficient expansion of RES, the provision of <b>balancing</b> <b>capacities,</b> the realization of the targeted electricity savings, and the smart adaptation of the transport and distribution grid. An overview of the existing and planned regulatory provisions for decarbonization are described, and some gaps identified, particularly with regard to the overall management of the process, the inclusion of electricity savings and the interference of Germany's decarbonization strategies with neighbouring countries. Policies that both accelerate grid expansion and direct RES expansion should immediately be put in place and can be supported by a targeted mobilization of <b>balancing</b> <b>capacities.</b> Electricity savings are a significant and cost-efficient strategy for low-carbon electricity. Policy relevance: Germany is actively converting its national electricity system towards a fully renewable one. As renewable electricity has reached about a quarter of total consumption, a number of technical and regulatory challenges arise. Current discussions and plans are described for the four main challenges: maintaining and optimizing high investment rates into RES generation technologies, providing <b>balancing</b> <b>capacities,</b> reducing demand, and adapting the grid to the changing needs. Policy recommendations for these four tasks highlight the need to intensify electricity demand reduction and also consider the potential interactions between the German electricity system and its neighbouring countries...|$|R

We conduct a techno-economic case study of Switzerland, using a cost optimization model. We explore a range of electricity costs, comparing scenarios in which gas is used as a source of base-load power, a source of <b>balancing</b> <b>capacity,</b> and not used at all.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a conception for the mitigation of wind power fluctuations by cutting off production chart peaks. The {{rapid growth of}} wind energetics has been induced by several factors. Although the government support may be the main incentive, other important motives include the increasing network access fees and strict requirements set for ensuring the <b>balancing</b> <b>capacity</b> of production. However, such capacity has the tendency of being underdeveloped. The possibilities of the operating oil-shale plants for providing the capacity to balance the wind parks are running out. Sudden changes in the oil-shale plant output contribute to additional CO 2 emissions, increased fuel consumption and decreased boiler efficiency. Under the circumstances, the transmission system operator (TSO) can face the need to reduce the power output of the wind parks. The operators of the wind parks integrated into the transmission network are responsible for presenting to TSO a 24 h forecast of their output power. The forecast error is mainly specified in terms of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which for Estonian wind parks is about 20 % on average. For forecast error estimation w...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the risk of}} being fearful or fearless of falls in older people. Methods. Using a force plate, postural control in different sensory and rhythmic conditions was measured in 263 community-dwelling older people. Other assessments included fear of falling, and handgrip strength. Fall incidence was assessed at baseline and during a one-year follow-up period. Results. Logistic regression analysis revealed that increased lateral sway in near-tandem stance with eyes open (OR = 5. 33; p < 0. 01) and a worse performance on anteroposterior rhythmic weight shifts (OR 0. 65; p < 0. 05) were related to falls. Univariate analyses revealed that older people with inappropriate high fear of falling according to their fall incidence had worse <b>balance</b> <b>capacities</b> on the rhythmic weight shifts (p < 0. 05) but had similar static <b>balance</b> and physical <b>capacities.</b> Older people with inappropriate low fear of falling had a better hand grip (p < 0. 05) but equally worse <b>balance</b> <b>capacities</b> than the comparison group. Conclusions. The results indicate the importance of lateral stability in relation to falls. They also suggest a substantial impact of inappropriate fear of falling on physical performance. Inappropriate high fear of falling may result in worse performance during dynamic balance tests, whereas older people with inappropriate low fear seem to overrate their capacities because of higher strength...|$|R

40|$|Many {{applications}} are inherently rotational in nature. These applications range from industrial products to consumer products. As {{seen in a}} traditional frequency response plot, the motion of a rotating imbalance does not approach zero as the forcing frequency is increased. Unlike a traditional forced mass spring oscillator, {{the motion of the}} rotating imbalance approaches some non-zero value. To account for this residual motion, some systems utilize a balancing device to reduce this motion. These balancing devices can be passive or active, depending on the design considerations. This paper will focus on the traditional, passive ball-type balancer due to its simplicity and extensive use in application. This paper derives the equations of motion for a vertically oriented ball-type balancing system. Due to the high non-linearity of these equations, a fourth order Runge-Kutta numerical integration method is used. The ball balancer equations of motion contain the proper physics needed for full operation such that the ball balancer can translate horizontally, vertically and rotate angularly in the presence of gravity. Acceleration terms are included such that a wide range of operating conditions can be tested. Additionally, n number of balls are present, which are affected by rolling friction and viscous fluid drag. Unlike many numerical models published in the past, the ball-to-ball interactions are not neglected within this model. These interactions include collisions, and train formations and separations. An application of the method presented by (Henon 1982) is utilized where the equations of motion are altered such that an exact integration step can be solved. This is based on the need for a displacement step (collision) or a force step (separation). Although the model presented can accommodate n number of balls, only a maximum ball count of two is considered. It is shown how the behavior of the balls affect the motion response of the ball balancer at rotational velocities above the translational resonance of the system. It is seen that a critical transition is reached; the operating point at which the ball balancer becomes effective at offsetting an eccentric mass. It is also seen that ball balancer displacement decreases until a point of saturation, after which ball balancer displacement increases. Also for the two ball case, it is shown that the spatial characteristics of the balls do affect steady state motion. The angle that separates two contacting balls alters the center of gravity of the train of balls such that the <b>balancing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the system is reduced. Although this effect is shown to be small for a two ball case, the <b>balancing</b> <b>capacity</b> is further reduced as the angle between two contacting balls becomes larger...|$|E
