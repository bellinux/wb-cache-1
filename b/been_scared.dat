5|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, leading English batsman Len Hutton had been dropped. The reason {{was said to}} be Hutton's struggles with Lindwall's short-pitched bowling in the {{previous}} Test, during which he scored 20 and 13. Observers noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers. The English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the sidewhich was not in good batting formas it was a poor example from a key player. According to journalist and retired Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, Hutton's second innings at Lord's had been the worst of his career and gave the impression he had <b>been</b> <b>scared</b> of the Australian pace attack. The omission generated considerable controversy, and pleased the Australians, who felt Hutton was England's best batsman, and thought he had been treated poorly by the selectors. Former Australian batsman Jack Fingleton pointed out that while Hutton had batted erratically and appeared uncomfortable in the previous Test, he also had a strong track record against the tourists, having made 52 and 64 for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Australia in the lead-up matches, and 94, 76 and 122 retired ill in his last three Test innings during the previous Ashes series of 1946–47. O'Reilly regarded Hutton's omission as punitive and vindictive. He said if Hutton needed to be shielded from the new ball attack, then England should have reshuffled their batting order to place their beleaguered opener down the order. O'Reilly said that as Hutton had a large range of attacking strokes, he was not a stereotypical, defensive opener who was mainly used to wear down the opening bowlers, and could be used in the middle order as an aggressor.|$|E

[...] Soderbergh said that Orantes [...] "gets dropped into situations and has to deal with cultural as well as scientific issues that are sometimes at odds", and notes that she has a [...] "professional" [...] yet stubborn, [...] "remote", and [...] "dispassionate" [...] demeanor, though [...] "something happens to her {{in the course of the}} story that causes a significant emotional shift." ...|$|E

500|$|Davey was {{initially}} uncomfortable with being {{described as a}} singer-songwriter but is now more accepting of the term. She describes her songwriting style: I write in short quick spurts of manic creativity, which are followed by spells of borderline writer's block where the writing comes really painfully and laboriously. I’m sure it's a universal experience for anyone who writes, but it's difficult to get out of, you can't just wish it away—it just disappears when it's had enough. It’s completely independent of whether I’m happy or blue, up or down. It tends to lift as soon as I stop fixating on it—I remember thinking my house was the problem, and I'd {{need to go to}} France in order to write, and I would have <b>been</b> <b>scared</b> without Rex [...] I got through it.

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Steven Moffat {{announced in}} 2011 {{that he intended}} to give a [...] "rest" [...] to the Daleks. The reason for the rest was that Moffat felt their frequent appearances made them the [...] "most reliably defeatable enemies in the universe". Moffat recalled that the Daleks were remembered for being scary, but due to their legacy as British icons they had become [...] "cuddly" [...] over the years and their true menace forgotten; with [...] "Asylum" [...] he intended to make them scary again, reminding the audience of their intentions. He thought {{the best way to do}} this would be to show Daleks that were considered even madder than usual. Gillan admitted that she had not <b>been</b> <b>scared</b> of the Daleks before working on the episode. It is also the first Dalek story Moffat has written for the show; he stated that he [...] "couldn't resist" [...] the opportunity.|$|E

He described the force as [...] "reinforced camps of international troops attempting to defend the delivery of humanitarian aid, and often themselves". Smith's belief was that none of the governments that contributed soldiers to UNPROFOR had any intention of committing them to fight—that they had decided [...] "to deploy forces with no intention to employ their force", having <b>been</b> <b>scared</b> into inaction by inaccurate reporting and a lack of understanding of the war.|$|E

But then on the cherry tree would be this pitch oozing out, some of it black, some of it yellow, and there were millions and millions of red ants racing all over the sticky pitch, all over the tree. So you see, there's this beautiful world and you just look a little bit closer and it's all red ants".|$|E

2500|$|Writing {{began in}} December 1976, with a first draft {{completed}} by mid-1977. The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following [...] "a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in Barbados". The film {{would not have}} been made without Python fan former Beatle George Harrison, who set up HandMade Films to help fund it at a cost of £3million. Harrison put up the money for it as he [...] "wanted to see the movie" [...] (this was later described by Terry Jones as the [...] "world's most expensive cinema ticket"). The original backers, EMI Films, had <b>been</b> <b>scared</b> off at the last minute by the subject matter, particularly Bernard Delfont. The very last words in the film are: [...] "I said to him, 'Bernie, they'll never make their money back on this one'", teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project. Terry Gilliam later said, [...] "They pulled out on the Thursday. The crew was supposed to be leaving on the Saturday. Disastrous. It was because they read the script ... finally." [...] As a reward for his help, Harrison appears in a cameo appearance as Mr. Papadopoulos, [...] "owner of the Mount", who briefly shakes hands with Brian in a crowd scene (at 1:09 in the film). His one word of dialogue (a cheery but out of place Scouse [...] "'ullo") had to be dubbed in later.|$|E

Larey was taken home the next evening by sheriff's deputies. She stated she did not know why the attacker did not chase after her or kill her. She learned that the injured Hollis made his way to Richmond Road and flagged down a passing motorist, who contacted a local funeral home ambulance. Larey thought the attacker may have <b>been</b> <b>scared</b> off by headlights. In her interview with Lucille Holland, she stated that she had told the attacker to kill her because she would rather have been dead than to be touched or abused. She also explained that she did not understand why officers did not believe her when she told them the attacker was black and that she did not know who he was. She said officers attempted to coerce her into stating that she knew the assailant. Larey described him as a man with a white mask over his head, with cutout places for his eyes and mouth. Because Hollis was blinded by the flashlight before being beaten, he did not notice a mask. Although Hollis believed he was a dark-tanned white man, Larey believed he was a light-skinned African American [...] "because of the way he pronounced the curse words he growled."
