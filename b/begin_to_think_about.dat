2500|$|The USA {{considers}} {{support from}} India – {{which is on}} 35-member board of Governors at the International Atomic Energy Agency – crucial in getting a sizeable majority for its proposal to refer the matter to the Security Council for positive punitive action against Iran. Greg Schulte, US ambassador to the IAEA, said [...] "India's voice will carry particular weight...I hope India joins us in making clear our collective concerns about Iran's nuclear programme". Schulte did not deny that the Indo-US nuclear deal was conditional to India supporting the US on the Iran issue. Appraising of the situation vis-a-vis Iran, a senior US official told the New York Times that The Indians are emerging from their non-aligned status and becoming a global power, {{and they have to}} <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> their responsibilities. They have to make a basic choice.. The Bush administration, however, recognised India's close relations with Iran and tempered its position, stating that India can [...] "go ahead with a pipeline deal involving Iran and Pakistan. Our beef with Iran is not the pipeline." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fox Atomic {{stated in}} June 2007 {{that they would}} {{consider}} producing a third film if DVD sales of the film did well. In July 2007, while promoting Sunshine, Boyle {{said he had a}} possible story for the next film. [...] "There is an idea for the next one, something which would move the story on. I've got to think about it, whether it's right or not." [...] In October 2010, when Alex Garland was asked what was happening with 28 Months Later, he declared: [...] "I'll answer that completely honestly. When we made 28 Days Later, the rights were frozen between {{a group of people who}} are no longer talking to each other. And so, the film is never going to happen unless those people start talking to each other again. There is no script as far as I'm aware." [...] In January 2011, Danny Boyle said, [...] "There is a good idea for it, and once I've got [...] Frankenstein open, I'll <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it a bit more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Yearwood {{has found}} major {{influences}} {{in a variety}} of musical artists. She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice that made you believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how it makes me feel, even before I made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I have to catch ourselves if we <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> recording a song we don't believe in just because we think it might be a hit." [...] She also stated that even though she does not record any of her own material, she has written music that still has yet to be recorded.|$|E

6000|$|But {{that night}} he drawled, with the casualness {{of a man who}} wishes to be {{surprising}} and delightful, [...] "Carrie, don't know but what we might <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> building a new house, one of these days. How'd you like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, then,' said Herbert {{with a shrug}} almost of despair, 'then {{begins the}} weary tramp back. One by one drop off the truisms, and the Grundyisms, and the pedantries, and all the {{stillborn}} claptrap of the marketplace sloughs off. Then one can seriously <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> saving one's soul.' ...|$|E

60|$|I am {{inclined}} {{to think that this}} swamping of {{a large part of the}} world's press by calculated falsehood and partisan propaganda is a temporary phase in the development of the print nexus: nevertheless, it is a very great inconvenience and danger to the world. It stands very much in the way of that universal adult education which is our present concern. Reality is horribly distorted. Men cannot see the world clearly and they cannot, therefore, <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it rightly.|$|E

But all this is far away and for the present I am glad that neither she nor the thieves have got those pearls, though perhaps they might be safer here than where they are. And now, my son, go rest for you need it, and dream of nothing, not even Amada, who for her part will dream of Isis, if at all. I will wake you before the dawn." ...|$|E
50|$|Tippett <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> {{writing a}} symphony while {{in prison in}} 1943. He had already written one symphony (in B flat) but {{rejected}} it as immature and over-influenced by Sibelius.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is a {{long way}} from that, Matteo," [...] Francis laughed. [...] "Still, I hope we may manage it somehow. I have the {{greatest}} horror of a Genoese prison, for it is notorious that they treat their prisoners of war shamefully, and I certainly do not mean to enter one, if there is the slightest chance of avoiding it. But for today, Matteo, I shall not even <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it. In the first place, my head aches with the various thumps it has had; in the second, I feel weak from loss of blood; and in the third, my wounds smart most amazingly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Everything else {{comes from}} outside ourselves. Very good. If {{we sit down}} quietly to work out notions that are sent to us, we may or we may not do {{something}} that isn't bad. A great deal depends on being master of the bricks and mortar of the trade. But the instant we <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> success {{and the effect of}} our work--to play with one eye on the gallery--we lose power and touch and everything else. At least that's how I have found it. Instead of being quiet and giving every power you possess to your work, you're fretting over something which you can neither help no hinder by a minute. See?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What I {{wanted to}} say was, don't you keep sendin' so much o' your money home, child. It's yours, and I want you should have it; most of it goes for patent medicines, anyway, when it gets here; we can't keep Reuben from buying 'em, and he's always changin' doctors. And I want you should hold {{yourself}} high, Lem. You're as good as anybody. And don't you go with any girls, especially, that ain't of the best. You're gettin' to that time o' life when you'll <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> 'em; but don't you go and {{fall in love with}} the first little poppet you see, because she's got pretty eyes and curly hair." ...|$|E
6000|$|Oakes laughed tolerantly. [...] "Oh, I {{never really}} {{believed}} that preposterous theory for one moment. I {{just put it}} in to round out my report. I hadn't <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the case then--not really think." ...|$|R
50|$|Upon {{learning}} that reality he <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> building a synagogue and took initiative in 1923, by officially registering the Jewish Community of the Porto and the Israelite Theological Center in the City Council of Porto.|$|R
6000|$|She nodded. [...] "There was {{something}} very strange in it. It was a night or two after I had tasted it that I had what just now I called my awakening, and <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> Africa." ...|$|R
6000|$|Harvey {{announced}} that he never felt better in his life; {{but it was not}} till he saw the [...] "We're Here", fresh from the lumper's hands, at Wouverman's wharf, that he lost his all-overish feelings in a queer mixture of pride and sorrowfulness. Other people--summer boarders and such-like--played about in cat-boats or looked at the sea from pier-heads; but he understood things from the inside--more things than he could <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> None the less, he could have sat down and howled because the little schooner was going off. Mrs. Cheyne simply cried and cried every step of the way, and said most extraordinary things to Mrs. Troop, who [...] "babied" [...] her till Dan, who had not been [...] "babied" [...] since he was six, whistled aloud.|$|E
60|$|Another way of beguiling the tedious hours, {{is to get}} a cosy seat somewhere, {{and fall}} into as snug a little reverie as you can. Or if a seat is not to be had--which is {{frequently}} the case--then get a tolerably comfortable stand-up against the bulwarks, and <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> home and bread and butter--always inseparably connected to a wanderer--which will very soon bring delicious tears into your eyes; for every one knows what a luxury is grief, when you can get a private closet to enjoy it in, and no Paul Prys intrude. Several of my shore friends, indeed, when suddenly overwhelmed by some disaster, always make a point of flying to the first oyster-cellar, and shutting themselves up in a box with nothing but a plate of stewed oysters, some crackers, the castor, and a decanter of old port.|$|E
60|$|In good time, or in bad time, as {{the reader}} likes to take it--for Mrs Nickleby's impatience went {{a great deal}} faster than the clocks at that end of the town, and Kate was dressed to the very last {{hair-pin}} a full {{hour and a half}} before it was at all necessary to <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it--in good time, or in bad time, the toilet was completed; and it being at length the hour agreed upon for starting, the milkman fetched a coach from the nearest stand, and Kate, with many adieux to her mother, and many kind messages to Miss La Creevy, who was to come to tea, seated herself in it, and went away in state, if ever anybody went away in state in a hackney coach yet. And the coach, and the coachman, and the horses, rattled, and jangled, and whipped, and cursed, and swore, and tumbled on together, until they came to Golden Square.|$|E
