5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} had fallen into {{disrepair}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 20th century.

5|$|As the Allies {{advanced}} towards Japan, conditions became steadily {{worse for}} the Japanese people. Japan's merchant fleet declined from 5,250,000 gross tons in 1941 to 1,560,000 tons in March 1945, and 557,000 tons in August 1945. Lack of raw materials forced the Japanese war economy into a steep decline after the middle of 1944. The civilian economy, which had slowly deteriorated throughout the war, reached disastrous levels <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of 1945. The loss of shipping also affected the fishing fleet, and the 1945 catch was only 22% of that in 1941. The 1945 rice harvest was the worst since 1909, and hunger and malnutrition became widespread. U.S. industrial production was overwhelmingly superior to Japan's. By 1943, the U.S. produced almost 100,000 aircraft a year, compared to Japan's production of 70,000 for the entire war. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of 1944, the U.S. had almost a hundred aircraft carriers in the Pacific, far more than Japan's twenty-five for the entire war. In February 1945, Prince Fumimaro Konoe advised the Emperor Hirohito that defeat was inevitable, and urged him to abdicate.|$|E

5|$|By 1879, English law {{began to}} {{distinguish}} between suicide and homicide, although suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate.

The term suicide first emerged shortly before 1700 to replace expressions on self-death which were often characterized as a form of self-murder in the West.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s the {{influence}} of the Sheffield FA started to wane. Internal troubles began to surface with disputes between the SFA and a new rival association, Hallamshire F.A.

The southern end of US131 was moved to another location on the state line. Instead of running concurrently with US112 between White Pigeon and Mottville, US131 ran directly south of White Pigeon to the state line. In the process, the M-103 designation was swapped with US131.|$|E
