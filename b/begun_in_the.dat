5|$|Bullfrog {{released}} the Populous: The Beginningâ€” Undiscovered Worlds in 1999. The expansion was only made {{available in the}} UK and US.

5|$|In 1629, {{work was}} {{interrupted}} by flooding, over two metres in depth. Parts of the city were damaged, especially around the main plaza or Zocalo.

5|$|In 1990, Zappa was {{diagnosed}} with terminal prostate cancer. The disease had been developing unnoticed for ten years and was considered inoperable. After the diagnosis, Zappa devoted most of his energy to modern orchestral and Synclavier works.

5|$|Significant {{settlement}} {{appears to}} have <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mesolithic era, with Star Carr in North Yorkshire generally considered the most significant monument of this era.

5|$|The first {{computer-controlled}} {{search for}} supernovae was <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s at Northwestern University. They built a 24-inch telescope at Corralitos Observatory in New Mexico {{that could be}} repositioned under computer control. The telescope displayed a new galaxy each minute, with observers checking the view on a television screen. By this means, they discovered 14 supernovae {{over a period of}} two years.|$|E

5|$|Calakmul {{has a long}} {{occupational}} {{history and}} excavations have revealed evidence from the Middle Preclassic right through to the Postclassic. The causeway network that linked Calakmul with the cities of El Mirador, Nakbe and El Tintal suggest strong political links between the four cities that may have <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Preclassic, when both Calakmul and El Mirador were important cities, and continued into the Classic period when Calakmul itself was the most powerful city in the region. Calakmul {{was one of the}} largest and most powerful ancient cities ever uncovered in the Maya lowlands.|$|E
5|$|Defining {{themselves}} as both Swedish and American, the Swedish-American community retained a fascination {{for the old}} country {{and their relationship to}} it. The nostalgic visits to Sweden which had <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1870s continued well into the 20th century, and narratives from these trips formed a staple of the lively Swedish-American publishing companies. The accounts testify to complex feelings, but each contingent of American travellers were freshly indignant at Swedish class pride and Swedish disrespect for women. It was with renewed pride in American culture that they returned to the Midwest.|$|E
50|$|Production of Brussels sprouts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, when French {{settlers}} {{brought them}} to Louisiana. <b>The</b> first plantings <b>in</b> California's Central Coast <b>began</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1920s, with significant production <b>beginning</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s. Currently, several thousand acres are planted in coastal areas of San Mateo, Santa Cruz, and Monterey counties of California, which offer an ideal combination of coastal fog and cool temperatures year-round. The harvest season lasts from June through January.|$|R

5|$|During {{the chaotic}} years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered {{a decade of}} {{economic}} crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Rica Erickson wrote Triggerplants, {{describing}} habitat, distribution, {{and plant}} forms (ephemeral, creeping, leafy-stemmed, rosette, tufted, scale-leaved, and tropical). It was Erickson that began placing certain species into these morphologically-based groups, {{which may or}} may not resemble true taxonomic divergences. It was not until the 1970s and 1980s that research of the trigger physiology was <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lab of Dr. Findlay of Flinders University. Douglas Darnowski added to the growing library of knowledge on Stylidium when he published his book Triggerplants in 2002, describing an overview of habitat, plant morphology, carnivory, and research done to date. Following its publication, he co-founded the International Triggerplant Society.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1660s, a {{building}} program was initiated {{to expand the}} fleet and replace old capital ships. A new flagship was needed to replace the old Kronan from 1632. The felling of vast quantities of timber that were required for the new admiral's ship had already <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter of 1664â€“65. Swedish historian Kurt Lundgren has estimated that 7â€“10 hectares (17â€“25 acres) of hundred-year-old oak forest was required for the hull and several tall, stout pines for the masts and bowsprit.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} by the family that a new and far grander house would be built, using the money that the Wrights had earned through their inventions and business. Called affectionately Hawthorn Hill, {{building}} had <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dayton suburb of Oakwood, Ohio, while Wilbur was in Europe. Katharine and Orville oversaw the project in his absence. Wilbur's one known expression upon {{the design of the}} house was that he have a room and bathroom of his own. The brothers hired Schenck and Williams, an architectural firm, to design the house, along with input from both Wilbur and Orville. Wilbur did not live to see its completion in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in {{domestic}} cricket, the Beaumont Cup had been renamed the Texaco Cup, and both {{it and the}} Shell Shield continued to feature at the Queen's Park Oval. The first one-day cricket matches had <b>begun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Indies, and the Queen's Park Oval hosted its inaugural Gillette Cup match between Trinidad and Tobago and the Windward Islands in February 1976. Several of these games would be hosted at the ground each season.|$|E
