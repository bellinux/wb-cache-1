5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar has noted the format would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E
5|$|The Pipe rolls are {{the records}} of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually {{conducted}} at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records of the audit of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> modern accountants; for instance {{until the end of the}} 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{the term}} orthopedics meant the {{correcting}} of musculoskeletal deformities in children. Nicolas Andry, a French {{professor at the}} University of Paris coined the term in the first textbook written on the subject in 1741. He advocated the use of exercise, manipulation and splinting to treat deformities in children. His book was directed towards parents, and while some topics would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> orthopedists today, it also included 'excessive sweating of the palms' and freckles.|$|E

25|$|Rowling {{invented a}} great number of words and phrases for the books such as spells, incantations, magical words, items, and place names. Many of these words involve wordplay, rhyming, and {{historical}} references that are difficult to translate. A large number of spells are drawn from or inspired by Latin, and have a certain resonance with English speakers due to its relatively large proportion of Latinate-derived vocabulary. For example, priori incantatem (a spell which causes the last spells performed by a wand to be reproduced in reverse order) would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> many English-speaking readers as the words prior (previous) and incantation (spell, charm). To create a similar effect in the Hindi version, the Sanskrit, typical in mantras, has been used for the spells. Some translators have created new words themselves; others have resorted to transliteration.|$|E
500|$|The {{novel is}} written in a similar style to the Warriors series. Holly Koelling from Booklist notes that [...] "Despite the change in species, much will <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> readers.

Nancy Gilson from the Columbus Dispatch praised how easily the separate stories are handled and noticed how many chapters end on a cliffhanger.|$|E

He completed the lyrics when the group moved the sessions to Studio Miraval, located in Le Val, Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. The band completed the song quickly, {{and at the time}} Smith considered it to be the most obvious potential single from the songs the band had recorded during their two-week stay at Miraval.|$|E

500|$|Derrickson chose Nepal as a {{location}} to feature an [...] "Eastern city" [...] {{that would not}} <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> most audiences. After scouting and deciding on locations in the country, many of those areas were destroyed by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. Rather than choosing another country, Derrickson and Cumberbatch felt that bringing attention and tourism to Nepal following the event [...] "was {{all the more reason}} to shoot there". Cumberbatch said that shooting in Nepal was [...] "absolutely vital to this film, I think not least because it’s so based in something that is exotic. It was a magical way to start the shoot. It’s important to a film like this—which has a profound gearshift into a spiritual and otherworldly dimension—that the portal for that be in a place that actually happens in itself to be incredibly spiritual and marvelous." [...] The eventual filming locations around the Kathmandu Valley included the Pashupatinath and Swayambhunath Temples; Thamel and New Road in Kathmandu; and the Patan Durbar Square in Patan.|$|E
500|$|Development on Secret of Evermore {{began in}} early 1994 at Square Soft, the Redmond, Washington {{office of the}} Japanese parent company Square. The concept of a boy {{traveling}} with his dog through a world based on cheesy B movies was dictated from overseas, whereupon Square Soft began work on the detailed storyline. This resulted in popular culture references and dialog that are distinctly American for a mainstream console RPG. The game's associate producer and writer, George Sinfield, decided that making such references would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> American players. The working title for the game was [...] "Vex and the Mezmers." [...] Producer Alan Weiss originally had {{the concept of a}} group of magic users who [...] "could tell dream stories and transport the listeners into the experience, virtually. During one of these storytelling sessions, Vex got trapped in one of these worlds and started to corrupt the dreams. The game was going to be about finding Vex and defeating him." [...] But when George Sinfield asked the name be changed, the studio had a naming competition which resulted in Secret of Evermore.|$|E
500|$|... 12 Days {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Caroline Ryder of The Advocate, a LGBT-interest magazine, highlighted 12 Days as [...] "a dark, deeply emotional graphic novel." [...] Brienza complimented Kim's artistic {{attention to the}} background and setting's details, and summed up the comic as [...] "a sensitive depiction of lesbians that strives for literariness". While not personally enjoying the comic, Friedman considered it [...] "excellent and well worth reading." [...] Noting the potentially confusing flashblacks, Martin stated: [...] "12 Days doesn't easily fall {{into any of the}} normal manga (or manga-like) categories. It avoids any kind of sensationalism in providing a mature piece about a difficult topic, which may limit its appeal but certainly makes it worth reading." [...] While Deppey praised it as [...] "an ambitious and partly satisfying work that very nearly succeeds," [...] he considered it not [...] "as daring or complex a work" [...] as Fun Home. Although Dacey disliked the backgrounds and the [...] "self-consciously literary" [...] ashes-in-beverages aspect, she enjoyed the plot and Kim's use of naturalism in her artwork. She later placed it on her list of the top ten global manga. Draper Carlson recommended it, commenting: [...] "The emotions the book carries will <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> anyone who's suffered a loss in love. It's a work to meditate on." [...] Conversely, A. E. Sparrow of IGN wrote that the story sacrificed its coherency in its attempt [...] "for a deeper level of understanding"; Sparrow concluded: [...] "12 Days is simply trying too hard, burying some absolutely beautiful illustrations in a sea of chaotic storytelling." ...|$|E

500|$|There were a {{large number}} of changes made to the game. Additional stages and {{divisions}} between battle and exploration were created; defense and dodge actions were added for characters; extensive vertical plains were added to environments; enemy and boss AI was redesigned and refined; additional enemies and subbosses were included; a new difficulty level was added; and the POW gauge, inventory and Psypher systems were redesigned. At the time Odin Sphere was made, it was fully intended to be a successor to Princess Crown, but Vanillaware had since become better known for fast-paced action over simple side-scrolling combat. The gameplay was thus adjusted so that it would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> players of the later and more refined [...] and Dragon's Crown. [...] Kamitani later commented that he would have made extensive changes such as removing the alchemy system, but other staff members—who were fans of Odin Sphere and were employed after the game's release—successfully pushed to retain and improve rather than remove the original features. According to Ohnishi, how to adjust the gameplay was difficult for the team to decide: elements included the way health and magic energies were raised separately, and how the alchemy system worked. With this in mind, these systems were adjusted so they would be more accessible for people with varied playing styles. The revamped system drew from the team's work on Dragon's Crown. There was no original story content created, although additional text archives were created and the existing text was rewritten in places. The ability to skip story sequences, unavailable in the original release, was included. It was also decided not to have the different sections be playable out of order, as that would negatively impact the story.|$|E

2500|$|Another line {{asserts that}} the {{audience}} is interested in [...] "the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable", probably assuming that the film's audience will have a fascination with the paranormal.

The lines seem to emulate the style of sensational headlines in newspapers, and promise the audiences access to [...] "lurid secrets" [...] as if following the example of True Confessions and other similar magazines. The notion that a film or show could be based on true incidents and testimony would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> a 1950s audience, because it was used in contemporary police procedurals such as Dragnet.|$|E

2500|$|The {{account of}} Matthew uses {{language}} from the Old Testament. The imagery would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> Matthew's contemporary readers. In the Septuagint Greek version of Zechariah 3 the name Iesous and term diabolos are {{identical to the}} Greek terms of Matthew 4. Matthew presents the three scriptural passages cited by Jesus ( [...] , , and [...] ) not in their order in the Book of Deuteronomy, but in the sequence of the trials of Israel as they wandered in the desert, as recorded in the Book of Exodus. Luke's account is similar, though his inversion of {{the second and third}} temptations [...] "represents a more natural geographic movement, from the wilderness to the temple". Luke's closing statement that the devil [...] "departed from him until an opportune time" [...] may provide a narrative link to the immediately following attempt at Nazareth to throw Jesus down from a high place, or may anticipate a role for Satan in the Passion (cf. Luke 22:3).|$|E
2500|$|Revisiting Zarifopol's moralizing {{essays in}} 2007, critic Henri Zalis found {{him to be}} [...] "chaste and meticulous, and in this unmatched." [...] Din registrul ideilor gingașe, is, {{according}} to Lovinescu, an [...] "interesting intellectual spectacle of deliberate originality". This is one of several essays containing Zarifopol's Junimea-like satire of inauthentic mofturi ("trifles" [...] or [...] "coquetries", a term echoing Caragiale), including wholesale borrowings of foreign customs that respond to bourgeois tastes. The eponymous [...] "tender ideas" [...] were defined by Zarifopol as [...] "those which should <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> any man wishing to pass for cultured, and also those that said man must be careful to speak about just so, lest he insult the views of society"; the book was addressed to those skeptics who, rejecting cultural crazes, [...] "still value consistency". As Ralea notes, Zarifopol's anti-ideological critique, continuing the work of Caragiale, was specifically deriding philosophers and philosophies that were the height of fashion: mystical, Bergsonian, Japonist; other such hobbyhorses were Nietzscheism and psychoanalysis.|$|E
2500|$|Armatrading first {{performed}} in a concert at Birmingham University for her brother {{at the age of}} about 16. She only knew her own songs, but her brother asked her to perform something that would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> the audience; she chose [...] "The Sound of Silence". She then performed her own songs around the local area with a friend from school, and played bass and rhythm guitar at local clubs. In 1968, Armatrading joined a repertory production of the stage musical Hair. There she met the lyricist Pam Nestor in 1970, and they worked together on Armatrading's debut album Whatever's for Us, released by Cube Records in 1972. Nestor wrote the lyrics to 11 of the 14 songs on the album, while Armatrading wrote the lyrics to three of them, performed all the vocals, wrote all the music and played an array of instruments on the album. Although Nestor was credited as co-lyricist, Cube considered Armatrading to be the more likely star material. These events produced a tension that broke up the partnership.|$|E

2500|$|The Revised Standard Version of the Bible, {{which first}} {{appeared}} in 1946, retained the pronoun thou exclusively to address God, using you in other places. This was done to preserve the tone, at once intimate and reverent, that would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> those who knew the King James Version and read the Psalms and similar text in devotional use. The New American Standard Bible (1971) made the same decision, but the revision of 1995 (New American Standard Bible, Updated edition) reversed it. Similarly, the 1989 Revised English Bible dropped all forms of thou that {{had appeared in the}} earlier New English Bible (1970). The New Revised Standard Version (1989) omits thou entirely and claims that it is incongruous and contrary to the original intent of the use of thou in Bible translation to adopt a distinctive pronoun to address the Deity. When referring to God, [...] "thou" [...] is often capitalized for clarity and reverence. While Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic (the languages of the Bible) do not have a special orthography (such as capitalization) for indicating that the Deity is being referred to, their grammars are more successful than English in making noun/pronoun agreement unambiguous.|$|E
2500|$|The {{emergence}} of the new organizational strategies {{can be seen in}} the politics of Connecticut around 1806, which have been well documented by Cunningham. The Federalists dominated Connecticut, so the Republicans had to work harder to win. In 1806, the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections. Every town manager was told by state leaders [...] "to appoint a district manager in each district or section of his town, obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty". Then the town manager was instructed to compile lists and total the number of taxpayers and the number of eligible voters, find out how many favored the Republicans and how many the Federalists and to count the number of supporters of each party who were not eligible to vote but who might qualify (by age or taxes) at the next election. These highly detailed returns were to be sent to the county manager and in turn were compiled and sent to the state manager. Using these lists of potential voters, the managers were told to get all eligible people to town meetings and help the young men qualify to vote. The state manager was responsible for supplying party newspapers to each town for distribution by town and district managers. This highly coordinated [...] "get-out-the-vote" [...] drive would <b>be</b> <b>familiar</b> <b>to</b> modern political campaigners, but was the first of its kind in world history.|$|E
