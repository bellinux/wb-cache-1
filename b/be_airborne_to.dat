5000|$|Tin {{whiskers}} don't have to <b>be</b> <b>airborne</b> <b>to</b> damage equipment, as {{they are}} typically already growing {{in an environment where}} they can produce short circuits. At frequencies above 6 GHz or in fast digital circuits, tin whiskers can act like miniature antennas, affecting the circuit impedance and causing reflections. In computer disk drives they can break off and cause head crashes or bearing failures. Tin whiskers often cause failures in relays, and have been found upon examination of failed relays in nuclear power facilities. Pacemakers have been recalled due to tin whiskers. Research has also identified a particular failure mode for tin whiskers in vacuum (such as in space), where in high-power components a short-circuiting tin whisker is ionized into a plasma that is capable of conducting hundreds of amperes of current, massively increasing the damaging effect of the short circuit. [...] The possible increase in the use of pure tin in electronics due to the RoHS directive drove JEDEC and IPC to release a tin whisker acceptance testing standard and mitigation practices guideline intended to help manufacturers reduce the risk of tin whiskers in lead-free products.|$|E
40|$|During winter {{extension}} meetings, {{three of}} the most common questions asked about Asian soybean rust were: when will soybean rust show up in the northern United States; how early should a spray application be made; and how many sprays would be needed. It is incorrect that once soybean rust outbreaks occur in coastal regions of the Gulf of Mexico, the disease can <b>be</b> <b>airborne</b> <b>to</b> Iowa within 2 to 3 days and defoliate soybeans in a week or two if no chemical is applied immediately after the spores arrive. Another recent question is whether spraying at the vegetative growth stage is needed. To address all these questions, we need to know the most likely stage of soybean rust when it appears in the United States...|$|E

5000|$|The {{scent of}} game birds <b>is</b> <b>airborne</b> so <b>to</b> pick up this scent the setter carries its head well up and should never follow foot scent.

50|$|The {{inner screen}} {{emphasis}} is on AAW. The central task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> engage any <b>airborne</b> threats that penetrate that far. This means the threat is almost certainly a missile so AAW rate of fire is important. The more defensive firepower in the air the more enemy threats will be destroyed. For ASW the inner screen needs good active sonar. Any threat this close is too serious for passive sonar as immediate targeting is needed. Checking the area around and under HVUs for submarines is called 'delousing'. If possible at least one ASW helicopter <b>is</b> always <b>airborne,</b> <b>to</b> target detected contacts as quickly as possible.|$|R

50|$|Just at {{this time}} a {{training}} flight of Fw 190s from JG 26 <b>was</b> <b>airborne</b> <b>to</b> the north of Amiens. It was redirected to investigate a raid heading towards them. Leading the German formation was Oberleutnant Waldemar Radener, who ordered his men to drop below the cloud layer {{to look for the}} raiders. At 12.04 hours Radener and Feldwebel Wilhelm Mayer descended out of the cloud layer and spotted several Mosquitos and Typhoons beneath them. Radener quickly slipped unseen behind the Typhoon of Flying Officer Renaud of 174 Squadron and shot it down without the other RAF pilots even noticing. Mayer, meanwhile, slipped in behind six Mosquitos below him and attacked the last aircraft in the formation. Pickard apparently saw the tracer shells fly past him as he immediately put his Mosquito into a hard banking turn to the left. Meyer followed. Regaining a firing position, he let go with a second burst. This time the rear of Pickard's wooden fuselage was caught in a stream of cannon shells. The fuselage shattered and the tail section broke clean away, causing the Mosquito to flip over onto its back and crash into the ground. The combat was over less than a minute after Meyer had broken cloud cover.|$|R

2500|$|A dancer may {{transition}} to en pointe {{by any of}} three possible methods: relevÃ©, sautÃ© or piquÃ©. In the relevÃ© method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the toe box remains {{in contact with the}} floor, thus [...] "rolling up" [...] on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with {{feet flat on the floor}} or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sautÃ© method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer <b>is</b> briefly <b>airborne.</b> <b>To</b> {{transition to}} en pointe via piquÃ©, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.|$|R
