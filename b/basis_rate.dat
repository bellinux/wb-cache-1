50|$|Despite the {{shutdown}} of the IgT design center in Gaithersburg {{in the aftermath}} of the telecom bubble, IgT was a fair investment for PMC-Sierra. The substantial rate of return from IgT is due to the combination of the moderate price paid by PMC, the strong financial return provided by the AAL1gator family of products, and the contribution of the remaining San Jose team to several successful PMC projects, including the strong selling Arrow2xGE Ethernet over SONET mapping device. When evaluated on a rate of ROI <b>basis</b> (<b>rate</b> of Return on Investment), IgT likely ranks second amongst the 14 Sierra/PMC-Sierra acquisitions, behind the acquisition of PMC by Sierra Semiconductor.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between vivid visual mental images and unexpected recall (incidental recall) was replicated, refined and extended. In Experiment 1, {{participants were asked}} to generate mental images from imagery-evoking verbal-cues (controlled on several verbal properties) and then, on a trial-by-trial <b>basis,</b> <b>rate</b> the vividness of their images; thirty minutes later, participants were surprised with a task requiring free recall of the cues. Higher vividness ratings predicted better incidental recall of the cues than individual differences (whose effect was modest). Distributional analysis of image latencies through ex-Gaussian modeling showed an inverse relation between vividness and latency. However, recall was unrelated to image latency. The follow-up Experiment 2 showed that the processes underlying trial-by-trial vividness ratings are unrelated to the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ), as further supported by a meta-analysis of a randomly selected sample of relevant literature. The present findings suggest that vividness may act as an index of availability of long-term sensory traces, playing a non-epiphenomenal role in facilitating the access of those memories...|$|E

Recently reorientation was found even {{at very low}} temperatures, when I. V. dipoles have absorbed light, i. e. {{when they are in}} the electronic excited state (e. e. s.). The effect is due to the lowering of the ionic energy barrier induced by the excitation of the electronic system (diffusion model).

40|$|A {{dynamical}} {{picture of}} phylogenetic evolution {{is given in}} terms of Markov models on a state space, comprising joint probability distributions for character types of taxonomic classes. Phylogenetic branching is a process which augments the number of taxa under consideration, and hence the rank of the underlying joint probability state tensor. We point out the combinatorial necessity for a second-quantised, or Fock space setting, incorporating discrete counting labels for taxa and character types, {{to allow for a}} description in the number <b>basis.</b> <b>Rate</b> operators describing both time evolution without branching, and also phylogenetic branching events, are identified. A detailed development of these ideas is given, using standard transcriptions from the microscopic formulation of nonequilibrium reaction-diffusion or birth-death processes. These give the relations between stochastic rate matrices, the matrix elements of the corresponding evolution operators representing them, and the integral kernels needed to implement these as path integrals. The `free' theory (without branching) is solved, and the correct trilinear `interaction' terms (representing branching events) are presented. The full model is developed in perturbation theory via the derivation of explicit Feynman rules which establish that the probabilities (pattern frequencies of leaf colourations) arising as matrix elements of the time evolution operator are identical with those computed via the standard analysis. Simple examples (phylogenetic trees with 2 or 3 leaves), are discussed in detail. Further implications for the work are briefly considered including the role of time reparametrisation covariance.

The importance of the results of this experiment relate to the general development of cattle feeding systems based on the use of high levels of molasses/urea, in that they offer the perspective for achieving high levels of animal performance without the need to use conventional protein supplements which have become increasingly scarce and expensive during the last few years...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the rate enhancements produced by representative kinases and their thermodynamic <b>basis,</b> <b>rate</b> constants were determined {{as a function}} of changing temperature for 1) the spontaneous methanolysis of ATP and 2) reactions catalyzed by kinases to which different mechanisms of action have been ascribed. For each of these enzymes, the minor effects of changing viscosity indicate that kcat/Km is governed by the central chemical events in the enzyme-substrate complex rather than by enzyme-substrate encounter. Individual Arrhenius plots, obtained at intervals between pH 4. 8 and 11. 0, yielded ΔH‡ and TΔS‡ for the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP 2 −, ATP 3 −, and ATP 4 − in the absence of Mg 2 +. The addition of Mg 2 + led to partly compensating changes in ΔH‡ and TΔS‡, accelerating the nonenzymatic methanolysis of ATP 11 -fold at pH 7 and 25 °C. The rate enhancements produced by yeast hexokinase, homoserine kinase, and N-acetylgalactosamine kinase (obtained by comparison of their kcat/Km values in the presence of saturating phosphoryl acceptor with the second order rate constant for methanolysis of MgATP) ranged between 1012 - and 1014 -fold. Their nominal affinities for the altered substrates in the transition state were 2. 1 × 10 − 16 m for N-acetylgalactosamine kinase, 7. 4 × 10 − 17 m for homoserine kinase, and 6. 4 × 10 − 18 m for hexokinase. Compared with nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer, all three kinases were found to produce major reductions in the entropy of activation, in accord with the likelihood that substrate juxtaposition and desolvation play prominent roles in their catalytic action...|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} data, analyses, {{and conclusions}} {{from a series}} of tests that were conducted at the Vitreous State Laboratory of The Catholic of America (VSL) to determine the processing rates that are achievable with AZ- 101 HLW simulants and corresponding melter feeds on a DuraMelter 100 (DM 100) vitrification system. One of the most critical pieces of information in determining the required size of the RPP-WTP HLW melter is the specific glass production rate in terms of the mass of glass that can be produced per unit area of melt surface per unit time. The specific glass production rate together with the waste loading (essentially, the ratio of waste-in to glass-out, which is determined from glass formulation activities) determines the melt area that is needed to achieve a given waste processing rate with due allowance for system availability. Tests conducted during Part B 1 (VSL- 00 R 2590 - 2) on the DM 1000 vitrification system installed at the Vitreous State Laboratory of The Catholic University of America showed that, without the use of bubblers, glass production rates with AZ- 101 and C- 106 /AY- 102 simulants were significantly lower than the Project design <b>basis</b> <b>rate</b> of 0. 4 MT/m{sup 2 }/d. Conversely, three-fold increases over the design <b>basis</b> <b>rate</b> were demonstrated with the use of bubblers. Furthermore, an un-bubbled control test using a replica of the melter feed used in cold commissioning tests at West Valley reproduced the rates that were observed with that feed on the WVDP production melter. More recent tests conducted on the DM 1200 system, which more closely represents the present RPP-WTP design, are in general agreement with these earlier results. Screening tests conducted on the DM 10 system have provided good indications of the larger-scale processing rates with bubblers (for both HL W and LAW feeds) but significantly overestimated the DM 1000 un-bubbled rate observed for C- 106 /AY- 102 melter feeds. This behavior is believed to be a consequence of the role of heat transfer in rate attainment and the much greater role of wall effects in heat transfer when the melt pool is not agitated. The DM 100 melter used for the present tests has a surface area of 0. 108 m{sup 2 }, which is approximately 5 times larger than that of the DM 10 (0. 021 m{sup 2 }) and approximately 11 times smaller than that of the DM 1000 (1. 2 m{sup 2 }) (the DM 1000 has since been replaced by a pilot-scale prototypical HLW melter, designated the DM 1200, which has the same surface area as the DM 1000). Testing on smaller melters is the most economical method for obtaining data over a wide range of operating conditions (particularly at extremes) and for guiding the more expensive tests that are performed at pilot-scale. Thus, one objective of these tests was to determine whether the DM 100 melters are sufficiently large to reproduce the un-bubbled melt rates observed at the DM 1000 scale, or {{to determine the extent of}} any off-set. DM 100 -scale tests can then be used to screen feed chemistry variations that may serve to increase the un-bubbled production rates prior to confirmation at pilot scale. Finally, extensive characterization data obtained on simulated HLW melter feeds formed from various glass forming additives indicated that there may be advantages in terms of feed rheology and stability to the replacement of some of the hydroxides by carbonates. A further objective of the present tests was therefore to identify any deleterious processing effects of such a change before adopting the carbonate feed as the baseline. Data from the WVDP melter using acidified (nitrated) feeds, and without bubbling, showed productions rates that are higher than those observed with the alkaline RPP feeds at the VSL. Therefore, the effect of feed acidification on production rate also was investigated. This work was performed under Test Specification, 'TSP-W 375 - 00 - 00019, Rev 0, 'HLW-DM 10 and DM 100 Melter Tests' dated November 13, 2000 and the corresponding Test Plan. It should be noted, however, that the RPP-WTP Project directed a series of changes to the Test Plan as the results from previous tests were reported. As a result, the test matrix that was executed differs from that in the Test Plan...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} on grazing preference of sheep used two experimental methods; rate of intake by penned sheep and field grazing observations. Ewe hoggets were fed fresh cut leaf {{to examine the}} rate of intake of six pasture grasses of differing nutrient status. Sheep exhibited no specific preference in rate of intake trial one during autumn and {{it was concluded that}} sheep appetite may have influenced the result. Phalaris leaf in rate of intake trial two during autumn was consumed at the greatest rate (43. 2 g WM/min - 8. 7 g DM/min) with timothy leaf being least preferred (17. 4 g WM/min - 4. 8 g DM/min). Both on a wet and dry matter basis cocksfoot leaf in rate of intake trial three during spring increased when nitrogen levels increased from 2. 83 to 5. 22 % N. In contrast Yatsyn ryegrass showed no relationship (2. 16 to 4. 48 % N) on a wet matter basis, but on a dry matter <b>basis</b> <b>rate</b> of intake decreased with increasing nitrogen levels (11. 02 - 6. 36 g DM/min). Ryegrass endophyte (Acremonium lollii) hyphae concentrations were doubled at high nitrogen levels and this may have caused the reduction in intake. Field grazing trials measured the rate of decline in height of six pasture species of differing nutrient status. Phalaris was the preferred species in field trial one during autumn, being reduced in height at a fast rate and to a low residual height (1. 45 cm). With field trial two during autumn there appears to be more than one preferred species as tall fescue, timothy/Marsden ryegrass mixture and Marsden ryegrass over the first two days were reduced at similar rates to phalaris. In field trial three during spring there was no preferred species. After nitrogen fertilisation at equivalent rates to a urine patch, sheep in field trial one showed no strong preference for fertilised herbage and in field trial two there was an init preference as leaf heights were rapidly reduced in the first day (6 - 13 cm), but there after, rate of decline was similar between treatments. Phalaris in field trial three after nitrogen fertilisation was clearly preferred and reduced in height at a fast rate with cocksfoot also being reduced severely over the first two days. Therefore it was concluded that high nutrient herbage levels will not always overcome differences in preferences between species. Also fertilisation can mask preference of less preferred species such as cocksfoot. It was also suggested that presence of legumes in plots may have reduced the ability of sheep to discriminate between species and treatments in field trials one and three. Rate of intake trials did not in all cases correlate well with preference observed in the field such as in rate of intake trials two and three...|$|E
