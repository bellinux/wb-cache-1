In one, 960 Medium White poults were fed 0, 2, 3, or 4 mg <b>bambermycins</b> per kg from day-old to 12 wk of age. In the other, 264 male and 408 female Large White poults were fed 0, 2, 5, or 10 mg <b>bambermycins</b> per kg from day-old to IS (females) or 18 (males) wk of age. Response of Medium White poults increased with age, with significantly greater weight gain from 8 to 12 wk of age as well as final weights when the diet was supplemented with <b>bambermycins.</b> Large White poults responded with highly significant increases in gains from 0 to 4 and 4 to 8 wk of age, and a highly significant linear response to <b>bambermycins</b> in final weights. Although feed efficiency of Large White poults from 0 to 4 wk of age increased with <b>bambermycins,</b> overall efficiency in both trials decreased when the diets were supplemented. The earlier and greater response of Large White poults in comparison with birds of a Medium White strain {{may be related to}} the differing growth characteristics of those strains.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} twenty Holstein heifers {{weighing}} approximately 450 lb {{at the beginning of}} the study were used to evaluate the impact of <b>bambermycins</b> (Gainpro®), monensin (Rumensin®), and lasalocid (Bovatec®) on performance when included in high forage diets fed ad libitum. Heifers were housed in 24 pens (5 hf/pen) containing a super hutch. Pens were blocked (3 pens/block) from heaviest to lightest and randomly assigned within blocks to <b>bambermycins,</b> lasalocid, or monensin treatment. <b>Bambermycins,</b> lasalocid, and monensin were mixed with fine ground corn and fed as topdressing to deliver 20. 25, 150, and 150 mg/hd daily, respectively. Diets were formulated (NRC 2001) to support body weight gains of less than 2 lb/hd daily using a mix of chopped alfalfa hay and corn silage (lighter weight heifers) or chopped alfalfa hay, chopped prairie hay, and corn silage (heavier weight heifers) supplemented with a mineral/vitamin premix. All heifers were fed a common total mixed ration, differing only in topdressing. Diets were fed once daily for ad libitum intake. The study continued until the average bodyweight exceeded 800 lbs. (140 days on study) at which time they were inseminated and first service conception rate determined. Heifers fed monensin consumed less dry matter (DMI) (P< 0. 05) than those fed <b>bambermycins</b> and lasalocid during the periods d 29 to 56, 57 to 84, and 113 to 140 but DMI was similar across treatments during the 140 - day study.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the addition of sheep blood to Mueller-Hinton II agar {{and the effects of}} aerobic incubation with or without CO 2 and of anaerobic incubation were tested with bacitracin, tylosin, avoparcin, virginiamycin, avilamycin, narasin, and flavomycin on enterococci. The antibacterial activity of <b>bambermycin</b> (Flavomycin) was strongly inhibited by the addition of blood, except with the species Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus casseliflavus, and Enterococcus gallinarum, which were not susceptible to this antibiotic on blood-free medium. With all other antimicrobials except avoparcin and tylosin, the presence of blood resulted in MIC increases of 1 to 3 log 2 differences. Incubation in aerobic or anaerobic atmospheres enriched with CO 2 lowered the susceptibility of enterococci to tylosin and increased their susceptibility to avilamycin, narasin, and avoparcin. This effect was most pronounced in tests on blood-free media. Results of susceptibility tests incubated under anaerobiosis and in a CO 2 -enriched atmosphere did not differ. For all enterococcal species, the preferred conditions for testing the susceptibility are Mueller-Hinton II medium supplemented with blood and incubation in a CO 2 -enriched atmosphere.

Flavomycin increased milk yields and milk fat and protein yields in multiparous cows (P <. 05). Although dry matter intake (DMI) was increased in cows receiving Flavomycin, efficiency of milk production was also increased. Primiparous cows receiving 60 or 90 mg/d Flavomycin had fewer days open and a shorter calving interval than cows not fed Flavomycin (controls). Body condition score (BCS) and body weight (BW) of all cows were not affected significantly by feeding Flavomycin. Acetate:propionate ratios were significantly lower for cows fed Flavomycin compared to controls. Digestibilities of dry matter, crude protein, and acid detergent fiber were not affected significantly by Flavomycin.

40|$|During {{the past}} 50 years, the {{livestock}} and poultry industries have developed {{in several areas}} including nutrition, genetics, engineering, management, and communications to maximizing the efficiency of growth performance and meat yield. Now these industries must focus more attention on how animal agriculture affects the environment and food safety. As in many other industries, the global paradigm is shifting from an emphasis on productive efficiency to one of public security. Nothing demonstrates this paradigm shift more clearly than the issues concerning the use of antibiotic growth promoters. For the past 4 decades, antibiotics {{have been used in}} animal agriculture to improve the growth performance and protect animals from the adverse effects of pathogenic and non-pathogenic enteric microorganisms. Now, antibiotics have come under increasing scrutiny because of the potential development of antibiotic-resistant human pathogenic bacteria after long use (Phillips, 1999; Ratcliff, 2000). In response to this “apparent threat”, the European Union banned the use of sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics to prevent disease or promote growth, starting with a ban on avoparcin in 1997 and a ban on virginiamycin, bacitracin, spiromycin, and tylosin in 1999.

All isolates showed some degree of multiple antibiotic resistance. Resistance to tetracycline (68. 5 %), amoxicillin (61. 4 %), ceftiofur (51. 3 %), spectinomycin (47. 2 %), and sulfonamides (42 %) was most frequent. The levels of resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin were 33. 5, 35. 5, and 25. 3 %, respectively. The overall resistance levels decreased from day 7 to day 35 (P < 0. 001). Comparing treatments, the levels of resistance to ceftiofur, spectinomycin, and gentamicin (except for resistance to bacitracin treatment) were significantly higher in isolates from chickens receiving feed supplemented with salinomycin than from the other feeds (P < 0. 001). Using a DNA microarray analysis capable of detecting commonly found antimicrobial resistance genes, we characterized 104 tetracycline-resistant E. coli isolates from 7 - to 28 -day-old chickens fed different growth promoters. Results showed a decrease in the incidence of isolates harboring tet(B), blaTEM, sulI, and aadA and class 1 integron from days 7 to 35 (P < 0. 01). Of the 84 tetracycline-ceftiofur-resistant E. coli isolates, 76 (90. 5 %) were positive for blaCMY- 2. The proportions of isolates positive for sulI, aadA, and integron class 1 were significantly higher in salinomycin-treated chickens than in the control or other treatment groups (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{impact of}} feed supplementation with <b>bambermycin,</b> monensin, narasin, virginiamycin, chlortetracycline, penicillin, salinomycin, and {{bacitracin}} {{on the distribution}} of Escherichia coli pathotypes in broiler chickens was investigated using an E. coli virulence DNA microarray. Among 256 E. coli isolates examined, 59 (23 %) were classified as potentially extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), while 197 (77 %) were considered commensal. Except for chlortetracycline treatment, the pathotype distribution was not significantly different among treatments (P > 0. 05). Within the 59 ExPEC isolates, 44 (75 %) were determined to be potentially avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC), with the remaining 15 (25 %) considered potentially “other” ExPEC isolates. The distribution within phylogenetic groups showed that 52 (88 %) of the ExPEC isolates belonged to groups B 2 and D, with the majority of APEC isolates classified as group D and most commensal isolates (170, 86 %) as group A or B 1. Indirect assessment of the presence of the virulence plasmid pAPEC-O 2 -ColV showed a strong association of the plasmid with APEC isolates. Among the 256 isolates, 224 (88 %) possessed at least one antimicrobial resistance gene, with nearly half (107, 42 %) showing multiple resistance genes. The majority of resistance genes were distributed among commensal isolates. Considering that the simultaneous detection of antimicrobial resistance tet(A), sulI, and blaTEM genes and the integron class I indicated a potential presence of the resistance pAPEC-O 2 -R plasmid, the results revealed that 35 (14 %) of the isolates, all commensals, possessed this multigene resistance plasmid. The virulence plasmid was never found in combination with the antimicrobial resistance plasmid. The presence of the ColV plasmid or the combination of iss and tsh genes in the majority of APEC isolates supports the notion that when found together, the plasmid, iss, and tsh serve as good markers for APEC. These data indicate that different resistant E. coli pathotypes can be found in broiler chickens and that the distribution of such pathotypes and certain virulence determinants could be modulated by antimicrobial agent feed supplementation...|$|E
