Sullivan {{described}} Artie as [...] "consistently awesome", and Slezak said it was [...] "one of Artie’s more appealing musical moments this season" [...] {{and gave it a}} [...] "B". Lynch characterized the song as a [...] "spunky diversion" [...] and gave it a [...] "B+", but he noted it was [...] "not a good song for marriage proposals <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the imagination", a point also made by Rolling Stone Erica Futterman, who said the number would have [...] "fared much better as a stand-alone performance". While Chaney liked Will and Mike's [...] "moves", she felt there was [...] "far too much quick cutting to shots of Morrison in a tank top" [...] and gave the song a [...] "B–"; Slezak and VanDerWerff were also critical of these shots.|$|E

[...] Michael Sauter of Entertainment Weekly gave the first season a B+ and spoke highly of Alba, saying that [...] "for a while [...] TV's hottest kick-butt heroine". Elka Karl of Common Sense Media gave the entire series 3 out of 5 stars, saying: [...] "While the {{dialogue}} sometimes falls flat, overall the show is well-scripted and well acted, and Alba does an excellent job of carrying the series. Dark Angel isn't perfect <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the imagination, but it is compelling television that teen sci-fi fans will enjoy." [...] While praising the first season, Randy Dankievitch of TVOvermind labelled the second season [...] "silly", criticizing [...] "dumb stories" [...] like Max's dream episode [...] "Boo", the virus that prevents Logan and Max having physical contact, and the various half-animal Manticore experiments that are revealed.|$|E

McAlpine noted that [...] "some {{evidence}} of range would be welcomed at this point, [...] there's a whole other side to her that you'd never know if you just listened to the singles" [...] commenting that her persona was the [...] "boozy floozy card" [...] and that the power ballads on her album could have been better for a release. He went on to conclude [...] "even though her 'act' is to be far too revealing about her dirty habits, she has still managed to create something of a mystique cloud around herself". Billboard magazine's Monica Herrera was impressed with the song, calling it [...] "blissful". She went on to compliment the song for its strong chorus that has the ability to [...] "stick with the listener for days". Sara Anderson of AOL Radio called the song [...] "a playful take on a teen love obsession", complimenting [...] "Kesha's signature auto-tuned vocals and casual chatty ad-libs". Anderson commented on the chorus of the song calling it [...] "a modern Cyndi Lauper-inspired chorus". Nate Adams of No Ripcord was positive in his review of the song, calling it [...] "a fun little disco tune", and wrote that the singer [...] "isn't reinventing the wheel <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the imagination, but she has her share of catchy would-be hits." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were positive, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club calling it [...] "an episode of Family Guy that rewards every viewer who liked the show in the past." [...] McFarland also gave high praise to the episode, writing, [...] "At first, I was simply pleased that 'Back to the Pilot' didn't screw things up at the beginning, but as the episode went, I kept looking at the clock and being amazed that it hadn't dropped the ball yet. It used short cutaways and a plethora of self-referential jokes the writers must have stockpiled for years about the animation quality, voice quality, {{and structure of the}} pilot to every possible advantage." [...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius". He added, [...] "Not only was the episode hilarious with amazing Brian and Stewie moments, but it was genuinely quite clever in the time-travel stakes, which is impressive on a nerd level." ...|$|E

The empathy the film extends to its characters may be evenly distributed, but it isn't all-embracing.

Woods made par on the first sudden-death hole; Mediate subsequently missed his par putt, giving Woods his 14th major championship. After the tournament, Mediate said [...] "This guy does things that are just not normal <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the imagination," [...] and Kenny Perry added, [...] "He beat everybody on one leg."

Aimed at a popular audience, Stargate SG-1 emphasized its present-day-Earth story frame by frequently referencing popular culture, like The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer had done before. Jonathan Glassner had written The Wizard of Oz references into his own scripts since the first season, which the other writers imitated after Richard Dean Anderson began referencing the film on his own. O'Neill references Richard Dean Anderson's favorite television series, The Simpsons, throughout the show.
