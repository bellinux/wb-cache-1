60|$|By {{one o'clock}} the last <b>bale</b> of <b>cargo</b> was stowed, and the hatches put on. The landsmen {{who had been}} {{employed}} went on shore, and Frank went forward to the forecastle, with the men, to dinner.|$|R
50|$|Gross {{register}} tonnage (GRT) represents the total internal volume of a vessel, where one register ton {{is equal to}} a volume of 100 cubic feet (2.83168 m3), a volume that, if filled with fresh water, would weigh around 2,800 kg or 2.8 tonnes. The definition (and calculation) of the internal volume is complex; for instance, a ship's hold may be assessed for bulk grain (accounting for all the air space in the hold) or for bales (omitting the spaces into which bulk, but not <b>baled</b> <b>cargo,</b> would spill). If V stands for the total internal volume in m3, then the GRT equals V / 2.83168, so for a ship of 10,000 m3 total internal volume, the gross {{register tonnage}} is 10,000 / 2.83168 = 3531.47 GRT. Gross register tonnage was replaced by gross tonnage in 1994 under the Tonnage Measurement convention of 1969, {{and is no longer}} a widely used term in the industry.|$|R
60|$|The {{schooner}} Falcon {{was ready}} for sea. The last <b>bale</b> of general <b>cargo</b> had just been shipped, and a few hairy, unkempt seamen were busy putting on the hatches under the able profanity of the mate.|$|R
5000|$|The cargo {{specifications}} {{for the seven}} ships were a <b>bale</b> <b>cargo</b> capacity of [...] of which [...] was cargo cold storage with separate meat and vegetable compartments insulated by layers of wood and cork. Under tropical conditions meat compartment was to maintain a temperature of 20 F and the vegetable compartment at 40 F. Five large hatches 25 ft by 17 ft, two 20 ft by 19 ft hatches, one 18 ft by 15 ft hatch and one 15 ft by 17 ft hatch served general cargo spacees. Refrigerated spaces were served by two 8 ft by 15 ft hatches. Cargo service was by means of thirty-two six ton booms and one thirty ton boom with ten kingpost.|$|E
5000|$|It later {{appeared}} that the pilot, chief mate, first and second engineers were Union sympathizers. Mr. Lewis, after running Florida aground twice and jettisoning 30 <b>bales</b> of <b>cargo,</b> found [...] "it was impossible to bring her out without {{the assistance of the}} engineers, pilot, and mate; so rather than burn her he considered it prudent to bargain with them, and gave his word that they would receive $500.00 each. They were faithful." ...|$|R
5000|$|That night Tom and Goldie sneak {{aboard the}} ship and find raw silk hidden among the <b>bales</b> of hemp <b>cargo.</b> Returning to the Marshall house, the little girl tells Tom, that Joan has left to meet her [...] "secret lover" [...] on Telegraph Hill. Tom observes the {{rendezvous}} with Joan and DeForrest, who Tom thinks is really Duke Monette, confessing that he used a secret identity to protect his daughters, Joan and Annie.|$|R
60|$|The sister-panel {{hangs in}} the Indian Ocean and tells a story, but is none the worse for that. Here you have hot {{tropical}} sunlight and a foreshore clothed in stately palms running out into a still and steamy sea burnished steel blue. Along the foreshore, questing as a wounded beast quests for lair, hurries a loaded steamer never built for speed. Consequently, she tears and threshes the water to pieces, and piles it under her nose and cannot put it under her cleanly. Coir-coloured <b>cargo</b> <b>bales</b> are stacked round both masts, and her decks are crammed and double-crammed with dark-skinned passengers--from the foc's'le where they interfere with the crew to the stern where they hamper the wheel.|$|R
