25|$|Henry rejects materialism, which admits only {{matter as}} reality, because {{the manifestation of}} matter in the {{transcendence}} of the world always presupposes life's self-revelation, whether in order to accede to it, or to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> or touch it. He equally rejects idealism, which reduces being to thought and is in principle incapable of grasping the reality of being which it reduces to an unreal image, to a simple representation. For Michel Henry, the revelation of the absolute resides in affectivity and is constituted by it.|$|E
25|$|Vette's DC-10 was not {{carrying}} any instruments designed for search and rescue, {{so the two}} pilots were forced to get creative. The captain could roughly estimate Prochnow's position relative to his plane by comparing their relative headings when facing the sun and solar angles of elevation. Next, Vette began to triangulate the Cessna's location using the 200-mile range of its VHF radio. Vette also tried dumping 24,000 pounds of fuel from his own aircraft {{in the hope that}} Prochnow might <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> but this proved to be unsuccessful. Prochnow and Vette then compared the time at which each of them observed the sun to set, and the addition of this new information finally made it possible for the Cessna's position to be calculated. After 23 hours of flying, and almost out of fuel—having used cruise control to stretch out the Cessna's usual 22 hours of fuel—Prochnow landed safely at Norfolk Island.|$|E

Conversely, a squad of {{soldiers}} atop the hill may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> both tanks, though the tanks may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them (since the tank's upward line of sight is limited).|$|R

500|$|The filming {{took place}} in an {{aircraft}} hangar, with the scene designed to re-create a typically smog-ridden Los Angeles. Music journalist Kit O'Toole writes that the smoke surrounding Harrison [...] "almost engulf him, mimicking the 'fog' described in the lyrics". Through the use of prismatic photography, the [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] segment also shows Harrison's [...] "image refracted as if seen through a fly's eye", according to author Alan Clayson, who describes the scene as mirroring [...] "the requisite misty atmosphere" [...] suggested by the recording. In its preview of Magical Mystery Tour in 1967, the NME highlighted the segment {{as one of the}} film's [...] "extremely clever" [...] musical sequences, saying: [...] "For 'Blue Jay Way' George is seen sitting cross-legged in a sweating mist which materialises into a variety of shapes and patterns. It's a pity that most TV viewers will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> only in black and white." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed critical reception. An anonymous {{review in}} the Batavia-based Doenia Film praised the film's picture (especially its colour) and both Krohn and Boekebinder's acting. A {{review in the}} Surabaya-based De Indiesche Courant likewise praised the film, stating that it [...] "fascinates from beginning to end" [...] and showed {{that even in the}} Indies a [...] "grand" [...] film could be made. However, the review criticised the censorship bureau's failure to catch scenes of Frederick drinking alcohol, which the reviewer found [...] "dangerous to the prestige [...] " [...] considering the large native audiences. Kwee Tek Hoay, writing in Panorama, criticised the film extensively, writing that it seemed meant exclusively for Dutch audiences in the Netherlands, as those living in the Indies would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> did not reflect reality and was in places illogical. He found the colouring one extension of this lack of logic, writing that a violet tinge indicated that the farmers were harvesting rice at sunset– something that never happened.|$|E
2500|$|CP/M 2.2 had no sub-directories in {{the file}} structure, but {{provided}} 16 numbered user areas to organize files on a disk. To change user one had to simply type [...] "User X" [...] at the command prompt, X being {{the number of the}} user wanted; security was non-existent and not believed to be necessary. The user area concept was to make the single-user version of CP/M somewhat compatible with multi-user MP/M systems. A common patch for the CP/M and derivative operating systems was to make one user area accessible to the user independent of the currently set user area. A USER command allowed the user area to be changed to any area from 0 to 15. User 0 was the default. If one changed to another user, such as USER 1, the material saved on the disk for this user would only be available to USER 1; USER 2 would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> or access it. However, files stored in the USER 0 area were accessible to all other users; their location was specified with a prefatory path, since the files of USER 0 were only visible to someone logged in as USER 0. The user area feature arguably had little utility on small floppy disks, but it was useful for organizing files on machines with hard drives. The intent of the feature was to ease use of the same computer for different tasks. For example, a secretary could do data entry, then, after switching USER areas, another employee could use the machine to do billing without their files intermixing.|$|E
5000|$|Being three-dimensional, we <b>are</b> only <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{the world}} with our eyes in two dimensions. A four-dimensional being would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world in three dimensions. For example, it would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all six sides of an opaque box simultaneously, and in fact, what is inside the box at the same time, just {{as we can see}} the {{interior}} of a square on a piece of paper. It would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> all points in 3-dimensional space simultaneously, including the inner structure of solid objects and things obscured from our three-dimensional viewpoint. Our brains receive images in two dimensions and use reasoning to help us [...] "picture" [...] three-dimensional objects.|$|R

60|$|I must on {{my arrival}} in England remodel {{altogether}} the Fixed Period, and name a day so far removed that even Jack's children would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> It was with sad grief of heart that I so determined. All my {{dreams of a}} personal ambition were at once shivered to the ground. Nothing would remain of me but {{the name of the}} man who had caused the republic of Britannula to be destroyed, and her government to be resumed by her old mistress. I must go to work, and with pen, ink, and paper, with long written arguments and studied logic, endeavour to prove to mankind that the world should not allow itself to endure the indignities, and weakness, and selfish misery of extreme old age. I confess that my belief in the efficacy of spoken words, of words running like an electric spark from the lips of the speaker right into the heart of him who heard them, was stronger far than my trust in written arguments. They must lack a warmth which the others possess; and they enter only on the minds of the studious, whereas the others touch the feelings of the world at large. I had already overcome in the breasts of many listeners the difficulties which I now myself experienced. I would again attempt to do so with a British audience. I would again enlarge on the meanness of the man who could not make so small a sacrifice of his latter years {{for the benefit of the}} rising generation. But even spoken words would come cold to me, and would fall unnoticed on the hearts of others, when it was felt that the doctrine advocated could not possibly affect any living man. Thinking of all this, I was very melancholy when I was summoned down to tea by one of the stewards who attended the officers' mess.|$|E
