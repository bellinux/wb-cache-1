5|$|By {{this time}} work {{had already begun}} on MAR-II on Kwajalein; built by General Electric, it {{differed}} in form and in its beam steering system. The prototype MAR-II was built on reclaimed land {{just west of the}} original Zeus site. MAR-II was built into a pyramid with its back half removed. Like MAR-I, to save money MAR-II would be equipped with only one set of transmitter and receiver elements, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> wiring in place in case it had to be upgraded in the future. Nike-X was canceled before MAR-II was complete, and the semi-completed building was instead used as a climate-controlled storage facility.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a typhus epidemic in the women's camp, Mengele cleared one block of 600 Jewish women {{and sent them to}} the gas chamber. The building was then cleaned and disinfected, and the occupants of a neighboring block were bathed, de-loused, and given new clothing before being moved into the clean block. The process was repeated until all the barracks were disinfected. Similar disinfections were used for later epidemics of scarlet fever and other diseases, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sick prisoners being sent to the gas chambers. For his efforts, Mengele was awarded the War Merit Cross (Second Class with Swords) and was promoted in 1944 to First Physician of the Birkenau subcamp.|$|E

500|$|Adams {{describes}} version 1.0 {{having an}} Adventure mode {{that would be}} a regular role-playing game, with changing plots and ordering subordinates to perform various tasks. Fortress mode would have a closer relationship with the outside generated world through war, trade and diplomacy. The world being bigger; he envisions the game to have many more features like magic, a tutorial, and a better interface. According to him, a tutorial is a burden because of the additional need of updating it and interface improvement is not a major priority till then—citing numerous existing fan-made applications for improving the game's interface. He said of version 1.0, [...] "sitting down with a fresh DF world would be like sitting down to read a middling fantasy author you haven't read before, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> extras that being a video game provides, including the ability to write your own sequels." [...] Modern in-game technologies and 3D graphics were fan requests Adams said he would never implement, yet showing ambivalence about the latter if the task was easy enough.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2006 Straw {{attracted}} controversy {{by suggesting}} {{to a local}} newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles {{in the past and}} it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: [...] "Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> caveats, yes, I would rather." [...] He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider uncovering their noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 Alan Canfora, one of {{the wounded}} students, located a static-filled copy of an {{audio tape of the}} shootings in a Yale library archive. The {{original}} 30-minute reel-to-reel audio tape recording was made by Terry Strubbe, a Kent State communications student who turned on his recorder and put its microphone in his dormitory window overlooking the campus. At that time, Canfora asserted that an amplified version of the tape reveals the order to shoot, [...] "Right here! Get Set! Point! Fire!". Lawrence Shafer, a guardsman who admitted he fired during the shootings and was one of those indicted in the 1974 federal criminal action with charges subsequently dismissed, told the Kent-Ravenna Record-Courier newspaper in May 2007: [...] "I never heard any command to fire. That's all I can say on that." [...] Referring to the assertion that the tape reveals the order, [...] Shafer went on to say, [...] "That's not to say there may not have been, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> racket and noise, I don't know how anyone could have heard anything that day." [...] Shafer also said that [...] "point" [...] would not have been part of a proper command to open fire.|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea for}} Pan's Labyrinth came from Guillermo del Toro's notebooks, {{which he says}} are filled with [...] "doodles, ideas, {{drawings}} and plot bits". He had been keeping these notebooks for twenty years. At one point during production, he left the notebook in a taxi in London and was distraught, but the cabbie returned it to him two days later. Though he originally wrote {{a story about a}} pregnant woman who {{falls in love with a}} faun, Sergi López said that del Toro described the final version of the plot a year and a half before filming. Lopez said that [...] "for two hours and a half he explained to me all the movie, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> details, it was incredible, and when he finished I said, 'You have a script?' He said, 'No, nothing is written'". López agreed to act in the movie and received the script one year later; he said that [...] "it was exactly the same, it was incredible. In his little head he had all the history with a lot of little detail, a lot of characters, like now when you look at the movie, it was exactly what he had in his head".|$|E

2500|$|Left unimpressed, Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote, [...] "You {{really have}} to feel for Alex Proyas. This guy wears bad luck like the grimy trenchcoats of his protagonists, only his zipper's stuck and he can't seem to shake the damn thing off." [...] In expressing his negativity, he {{believed}} [...] "Dark City looks like a million bucks (or rather, a million bucks gone to compost), but at its dark heart it's a tedious, bewildering affair, lovely to look at <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> substance of a dissipating dream." [...] Left equally disappointed was John Anderson of the Los Angeles Times. Commenting on the directing, he thought [...] "If you had to guess, {{you might say that}} Proyas came out of the world of comic art himself, rather than music videos and advertising. Dark City is constructed like panels in a Batman book, each picture striving for maximum dread." [...] He went on to say, Proyas was [...] "trying simultaneously to create a pure thriller and sci-fi nightmare along with his tongue-in-cheek critique of artifice. And this doesn't work out quite so well." [...] Author TCh of Time Out, felt the development of the Murdoch character was [...] "surprisingly engrossing" [...] and thought production wise, the [...] "art direction is always striking, and unlike most contemporary sci-fi, the movie does risk a cerebral approach, tapping a vein of postmodern paranoia." ...|$|E

30|$|Given {{an input}} image, our {{comparative}} approach compares it <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> k baseline samples, <b>but</b> not <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> N training samples.
