In this paper we present an improved WEB implementation of statistical physics algorithms to perform the text mining component of citation mining. In particular we use an entropic like distance between the compression of text as an indicator of the similarity between them. Finally, we have included the recently proposed index h to characterize the scientific production.

Both collections are operated like specialized search engines, they crawl the web with little human intervention and analyse the documents to classifiy them and to extract some metadata from the full texts. On the other hand there are traditional <b>bibliographic</b> <b>data</b> <b>bases</b> like INSPEC for engineering and PubMed for medicine. For the field of computer science the DBLP service evolved from a small specialized bibliography to a digital library covering most subfields of computer science. The collections of the second group are maintained with massive human effort. On the long term this investment is only justified if data quality of the manually maintained collections remains much {{higher than that of}} the search engine style collections. In this paper we discuss management and algorithmic issues of data quality. We focus on the special problem of person names. ...|$|R
40|$|Bibliometrics are an {{important}} research area within information and library science, which provides valuable insights about relationships between authors, publications, and knowledge domains. This study examined the geographic aspects of literature involving the visualization of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>data</b> published by authors residing in the contiguous United States. It determined where visualization of bibliometric research occurred and explored the spatial relationships among its contributors via institutional affiliation. The study involved five aspects: (1) cited publications, (2) citing publications, (3) cited-citing publication networks, (4) co-author networks and distances, and (5) hypothesis testing of average co-author distances over time. Using 102 publications identified from Thomson Reuters? Web of Science {{in the field of}} visualization of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>data,</b> it demonstrated that spatial aspects of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>data</b> can be represented in ArcGIS as both points (institutions) and networks (cited-citing pairs).

Average co-author distances were calculated for the co-author networks and temporal changes were explored formally using a nonparametric hypothesis test. The average nearest neighbor analysis found that both cited and citing publications involving visualization of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>data</b> were clustered.

40|$|Abstract—The {{popularity}} and rapid {{development of cloud computing}} {{in recent years}} has led to a huge amount of publications containing the achieved knowledge of this area of research. Due to the interdisciplinary nature and high relevance of cloud computing research, it becomes increasingly difficult or even impossible to understand the overall structure and development of this field without analytical approaches. While evaluating science has a long tradition in many fields, we identify a lack of a comprehensive scientometric study in the area of cloud computing. Based on a large <b>bibliographic</b> <b>data</b> <b>base,</b> this study applies scientometric means to empirically study the evolution and state of cloud computing research with a view from above the clouds. By this, we provide extensive insights into publication patterns, research impact and research productivity. Furthermore, we explore the interplay of related subtopics by analyzing keyword clusters.
