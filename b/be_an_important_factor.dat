5|$|Mercia was the {{dominant}} kingdom in southern England {{in the eighth}} century, and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by King Egbert of Wessex at the Battle of Ellandun in 825. Egbert briefly conquered Mercia, but it recovered its independence in 830, and thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> in English resistance to the Vikings. The Mercians traditionally held overlordship over Wales, and in 853 King Burgred of Mercia obtained the assistance of King Æthelwulf of Wessex in an invasion of Wales in order to reassert their hegemony. The same year, Burgred married Æthelwulf's daughter.|$|E
5|$|The song {{along with}} the album Diva are {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> to reggaeton's mainstream exposure in 2004 alongside Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino and Tego Calderon's El Enemy de los Guasibiri. The song became the first Spanish-language song to reach #1 on Miami's WPOW Rhythmic Top 40 while reaching the Top 10 of the Billboard Latin Rhythm Airplay chart. An accompanying music video was filmed for the song. It features cameos from her ex-husband Omar Navarro, known artistically as Gran Omar.

5|$|One of {{the initial}} {{characterizations}} of tsunami earthquakes came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.0 when analyzing short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to have a moment magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of the slip of the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a lubrication effect at the plate interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E

5|$|Implementing the {{deception}} operation {{did not go}} through entirely without incident. Initially the Soviets were {{kept in the dark}} about Egyptian intentions to go to war. Instead, on October 2, they were told that an Israeli raid was expected. Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service, General Fouad Nassar, informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer, General Samakhodsky, that the raid was expected to be a large-scale attack, coupled with an air strike. Though Samakhodsky appeared at first to believe Nassar's story, it became clear to the Egyptians that the Soviets were suspicious. In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by October 3 reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to go to war on October 3. Promptly, the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt, and both leaders reluctantly agreed. Egyptian commanders were taken completely by surprise, when, beginning late evening on October 4, Soviet experts serving with field units, embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated. By October 5, the evacuation was complete. This incident would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> in convincing the Israelis that war was likely.|$|E

25|$|New {{research}} in the related field entomotoxicology is currently studying the effects of drugs {{on the development of}} insects who have fed on the decomposing tissue of a drug user. The effects of drugs and toxins on insect development are proving to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> when determining the insect colonization time. It has been shown that cocaine use can accelerate the development of maggots. In one case, Lucilia sericata larvae that fed in the nasal cavity of a cocaine abuser, grew over 8mm longer than larvae of the same generation found elsewhere on the body. Other researchers in entomotoxicology are developing techniques to detect and measure drug levels in older fly pupae. This research is useful for determining cause of death for bodies that are found during later stages of decay. To this date, bromazepam, levomepromazine, malathion, phenobarbital, trazolam, oxazepam, alimemazine, clomipramine, morphine, mercury, and copper have been recovered from maggots.|$|E
25|$|RCA and its {{partners}} soon faced an economic crisis, as the costs of providing programming threatened to exceed the funds available from equipment profits. The problem was resolved in 1926 when AT unexpectedly decided to exit the radio broadcasting field. RCA purchased, for $1,000,000, AT two radio stations, WEAF and WCAP in Washington, D.C., {{as well as its}} network operations. These assets formed the core for the creation of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), with ownership divided between RCA (50%), General Electric (30%), and Westinghouse (20%) until 1930, when RCA assumed 100% ownership. This purchase also included the right to begin commercial operations. NBC formed two radio networks that eventually expanded nationwide: the NBC-Red Network, with flagship station WEAF, and NBC-Blue, centered on WJZ. Although NBC was originally promoted as expecting to just break even economically, it soon became very profitable, which would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> in helping RCA survive the economic pressures of the Great Depression that began in 1929.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of HPV within the tumour has been realised to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>factor</b> for predicting survival since the 1990s. Tumor HPV status is {{strongly associated with}} positive therapeutic response and survival compared with HPV-negative cancer, independent of the treatment modality chosen and even after adjustment for stage. While HPV+OPC patients {{have a number of}} favourable demographic features compared to HPV-OPC patients, such differences account for only about ten per cent of the survival difference seen between the two groups. Response rates of over 80% are reported in HPV+ cancer and three-year progression free survival has been reported as 75–82% and 45–57%, respectively, for HPV+ and HPV- cancer, and improving over increasing time. It is likely that HPV+OPC is inherently less maligant than HPV-OPC, since patients treated by surgery alone have a better survival after adjustment for stage. In one study, less than 50% of patients with HPV-OPC were still alive after five years, compared to more than 70% with HPV+OPC and an equivalent stage and disease burden.|$|E
