40|$|Abstract—The {{literature}} on queueing systems with finite <b>buffers</b> <b>addresses</b> mostly asymptotic performance metrics on an aggregate flow, and/or generally {{relies on a}} convenient, but provably inaccurate, approximation of the loss probability by the overflow probability in an infinite size <b>buffer.</b> This paper <b>addresses</b> non-asymptotic per-flow metrics in a multi-flow queue-ing system with finite buffer and FIFO scheduling. The analysis dispenses with the above approximation, and lends itself to several interesting insights {{on the impact of}} finite buffers on per-flow metrics. Counterintuitively, the per-flow delay distribution is not monotonous in the buffer size, and such an effect is especially visible in high burstiness regimes. Another observation is that buffer dimensioning becomes insensitive to the type of SLA constraint, e. g., fixed violation probability on either loss or delay, in high multiplexing regimes. In the particular case of aggregate scheduling, the results on the aggregate input flow significantly improve upon existing results by capturing the manifestation of bufferless multiplexing in regimes with many flows.

40|$|In 2009, {{security}} researchers {{discovered a}} new, very powerful rootkit environment on x 86 platforms [1]. That environment {{is based on}} Intel's Active Management Technology (iAMT) [2], which is completely isolated from the host. One part of iAMT is implemented as an embedded my-controller in the platform's memory controller hub. That my-controller is called Manageability Engine (ME) and includes a processor (ARCtangent-A 4), read-only memory (ROM), {{static random access memory}} (SRAM) and direct memory access (DMA) engines. Furthermore, iAMT provides an isolated network channel (out-of-band (OOB) communication). To illustrate the power of the stealth enviroment, [1] called the iAMT environment in conjunction with rootkits "ring - 3 ", following the x 86 ring protection model. For our evaluation we implemented a prototype in form of a USB keyboard keystroke logger [3]. 1 Since we were unable to get an Intel developer board providing the "ring - 3 " environment, we had to use the exploit discovered by [1] to infiltrate our target platform. We monitor the keyboard buffer of the Linux based target platform via DMA. To find the physical address of the keyboard buffer we apply a search algorithm, that finds the USB product string and follows some pointers to the structure containing the <b>buffer</b> <b>address.</b> To exfiltrate captured keystrokes our prototype uses iAMT's OOB communication capabilities. [1] discussed countermeasures against "ring - 3 " rootkits, but they also provide approaches to defeat such countermeasures. Furthermore, it is doubtful if all the proposed countermeasures can be applied in practice. 2 The goal of our evaluation is to find a reliable detection mechanism for "ring - 3 " rootkits. We assume that we can provoke delays when accessing the same resources as our prototype. For example, our prototype has to scan the host memory to find certain data structures and it also has use the network interface card to send keystroke codes. Another possibility is to initiate various DMA transfers using multiple devices. Only one device can be the bus master at a certain point in time. The next step is to design an experimental set-up that allows the measurement of delays and finally derive a reliable detection mechanism for "ring - 3 " rootkits...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Communication latencies {{have been}} {{identified}} as one of the performance limiting factors of message passing applications in clusters of workstations/multiprocessors. On the receiver side, message-copying operations contribute to these communication latencies. Recently, prediction of MPI messages has been proposed as part of the design of a zero message-copying mechanism. Until now, prediction was only evaluated for the next message. Predicting only the next message, however, may not be enough for real implementations, since messages do not arrive in the same order as they are requested. In this paper, we explore long-term prediction of MPI messages for the design of a zero message-copying mechanism. To achieve long-term prediction we evaluate two prediction schemes, the first based on graphs, and the second based on periodicity detection. Our experiments indicate that with both prediction schemes the <b>buffer</b> <b>addresses</b> and message sizes of several future MPI messages (up to + 10) can be predicted successfully. ...|$|R
