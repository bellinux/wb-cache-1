500|$|On 8 August 2010, Robinson {{retired from}} {{international}} football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. He said about his retirement, [...] "Only now have I {{been able to}} make this decision as previously I haven't been in contention for selection, I don't see myself as a number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating," [...] while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, [...] "As my player, I support him <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> him week in, week out and know how well he has performed. It's a big decision he's made, but I understand it." [...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E
500|$|After {{being hired}} by Jive Records {{to create a}} remix for [...] "Oveprotected", Rodney Jerkins {{revealed}} that the label [...] "needed a remix that's crazy." [...] Jerkins said the remix has [...] "an old-school-type rhythm, which I think is kinda cool because it's an element [...] never had, but I still gave it her edge. I was up all night rocking that joint. [...] same lyrics, I just reproduced the track." [...] "The Darkchild Remix" [...] was initially being sent to radio stations in the United States in mid-March 2002 and then became the opening track of the compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 10 later that year; however, it was only released on April 1, 2002. The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, since [...] " [...] reinvented herself. Everybody thought she was gonna come back with another 'Oops!... I Did It Again', but she went left and came with the 'I'm a Slave 4 U' joint, which is basically a club banger. You gotta big up people who reinvent themselves. I always said she was gonna {{be one of the}} people that's gonna be around for a minute, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> that in her." [...] Finnish musician and record producer Jaakko Salovaara also created two remixes for the track, titled [...] "JS16 Dub" [...] and [...] "JS16 Remix". The latter was included on the promotional soundtrack of Spears' debut movie, Crossroads (2002).|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E

500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

"It saddens me that {{official}} Israel so doggedly {{refuses to}} allow Wagner {{to be performed}} – as was the case, once again, at the University of Tel Aviv two weeks ago – <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it as {{a symptom of a}} disease. The words I'm about to use are harsh, but I choose them deliberately: There is a politicization of the remembrance of the Holocaust in Israel, and that's terrible." [...] He also argued that after the trial of Adolf Eichmann and the Six-Day War, [...] "a misunderstanding also arose…namely that the Holocaust, from which the Jews' ultimate claim to Israel was derived, and the Palestinian problem {{had something to do with}} each other." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton {{also saw}} the {{potential}} political changes in the Mideast {{as an opportunity for}} an even more fundamental change to take place, that being the empowerment of women (something Newsweek magazine saw as Clinton's categorical imperative). She made remarks to this effect in countries such as Egypt – [...] "If a country doesn't recognize minority rights and human rights, including women's rights, you will not have the kind of stability and prosperity that is possible" [...] – as well as in Yemen, where she spoke of the story of the present Nujood Ali and her campaign against forced marriage at a young age. At home, Clinton was even more expansive, looking on a worldwide basis: [...] "I believe that the rights of women and girls is the unfinished business of the 21st century. We see women and girls across the world who are oppressed and violated and demeaned and degraded and denied so much of what they are entitled to as our fellow human beings." [...] She also maintained that the well-being of women in other countries was a direct factor in American self-interest: [...] "This is a big deal for American values and for American foreign policy and our interests, {{but it is also a}} big deal for our security. Because where women are disempowered and dehumanized, you are more likely to see not just antidemocratic forces, but extremism that leads to security challenges for us." [...] She subsequently elaborated upon this theme, saying [...] "A lot of the work I do here in the State Department on women's or human-rights issues is not just because I care passionately – which I do – but <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it as [...] to increase security to fulfill American interests. These are foreign-policy and national-security priorities for me." ...|$|E
