5|$|Sarah {{was about}} fifteen when Churchill {{returned}} from the Continent in 1675, and {{he appears to have}} been almost immediately captivated by her charms and considerable good looks. Churchill's amorous, almost abject, missives of devotion were, it seems, received with suspicion – his first lover, Barbara Villiers, was just moving her household to Paris, feeding doubts that he may well have been looking at Sarah as a replacement mistress rather than a fiancée. However, his persistent courtship over the coming months eventually won over the beautiful, if relatively poor, Maid of Honour. Although Winston wished his son to marry the wealthy Catherine Sedley (if only to ease his own <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt),</b> Colonel Churchill married Sarah sometime in the winter of 1677–78, possibly in the apartments of the Duchess of York.|$|E
5|$|After the consulship {{had been}} {{opened to the}} plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the {{dictatorship}} and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse {{between the end of}} his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.|$|E

25|$|Albert V patronised art extensively. Artists of {{all kinds}} flocked to his court in Munich, and splendid {{buildings}} arose in the city, while Italy and elsewhere contributed to the collection of artistic works. The expenses of a magnificent court led the duke to quarrel with the Landschaft (the nobles), to oppress his subjects, and to leave a great <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> {{when he died in}} October 1579.|$|E
25|$|The {{liquidation}} of debt {{could not}} keep up with the fall of prices which it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed. This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{movement}} originally began {{in order to}} oppose the increasing <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> carried by Romania's peasants during the Great Depression and because the National Peasants' Party's couldn't help the poorest peasants, by 1944 the organization was essentially under Communist control. The Communist Party wished to seize power but {{was too weak to}} seize it alone—in 1944 it had only about a thousand members. Accordingly, the Romanian communist leaders {{had no choice but to}} have the party join a broad coalition of political organizations.|$|E

25|$|On 1 September 1715 Louis XIV died, {{bringing}} {{an end to}} {{his long}} reign that had made France the supreme power in Europe. Louis's five-year-old great-grandson and heir survived his precarious childhood and, including the eight-year regency of the Duke of Orléans, reigned in France as Louis XV {{until his death in}} 1774. Louis XIV had ended the war with some minor adjustments along France's eastern borders, but the final settlement had been far more favourable than what the Allies had offered in 1709/10: France had resisted the Allied demand of 'no peace without Spain', and Louis XIV could claim dynastic victory in Spain, thereby avoiding Habsburg encirclement. In North America France lost territory, and the French settlers were vastly outnumbered by the British in their colonies. Nevertheless, the French held on to Canada, Louisiana, Cape Breton Island, and Prince Edward Island, and thus control of the St Lawrence; thousands more remained in Acadia, and they still held the vast territory to the west between French Canada and Louisiana in the south. However, the war had stretched Louis XIV's finances beyond its limits, and France was left with a massive <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> The kingdom remained inherently strong, but it could not maintain its former dominance and suffered a relative decline in military and economic terms.|$|E

In February 1974, {{at the age of}} 68, he retired from the House of Commons with the intention of writing his memoirs. Still short of income, he first completed a biography of his fellow-journalist Hannen Swaffer, which was indifferently received—"a feeble potboiler", according to [...] Davenport-Hines. Friends organised an elaborate 70th birthday party for him on 21 May 1975; [...] "one duke, two dukes' daughters, sundry lords, a bishop, a poet laureate—not bad for an old left-wing MP", Driberg observed to a guest.|$|E

2500|$|Roosevelt's {{advisers}} {{believed that}} excessive competition and technical progress {{had led to}} overproduction and lowered wages and prices, which they believed lowered demand and employment (Deflation). He argued that government economic planning was necessary to remedy this. New Deal economists argued that cut-throat competition had hurt many businesses and that with prices having fallen 20% and more, [...] "deflation" [...] exacerbated the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and would delay recovery. They rejected a strong move in Congress to limit the workweek to 30 hours. Instead their remedy, designed in cooperation with big business, was the NIRA. It included stimulus funds for the WPA to spend, and sought to raise prices, give more bargaining power for unions (so the workers could purchase more) and reduce harmful competition.|$|E

50|$|A {{government}} deficit increases government debt. In many countries the government borrows by selling bonds rather than borrowing from banks.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} self-control, financial literacy and over-indebtedness on consumer credit debt among UK consumers. Lack of self-control and financial illiteracy are positively associated with non-payment of consumer credit and self-reported excessive financial <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt.</b> Consumers who exhibit self-control problems are shown to make greater use of quick-access but high cost credit items such as store cards and payday loans. We also find consumers with self-control problems {{are more likely to}} suffer income shocks, credit withdrawals and unforeseen expenses on durables, suggesting that lack of self-control increases exposure to a variety of risks. In most specifications we find a stronger role for lack of self-control than for financial illiteracy in explaining consumer over-indebtedness. We discuss the policy implications of these findings...|$|R
