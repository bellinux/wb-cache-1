5|$|In economics, the {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} {{is a theory}} of the market interest rate. According to this approach, the interest rate {{is determined by the}} demand for and supply of loanable funds. The term loanable funds includes all forms of credit, such as loans, <b>bonds,</b> <b>or</b> savings deposits.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 2010, the 27 EU {{member states}} agreed {{to create the}} European Financial Stability Facility, a legal {{instrument}} aiming at preserving financial stability in Europe by providing financial assistance to eurozone states in difficulty. The EFSF can issue <b>bonds</b> <b>or</b> other debt instruments on the market {{with the support of}} the German Debt Management Office to raise the funds needed to provide loans to eurozone countries in financial troubles, recapitalise banks or buy sovereign debt.|$|E
5|$|The IFC {{fulfills}} a treasury role {{by borrowing}} international capital to fund lending activities. It is usually {{one of the}} first institutions to issue <b>bonds</b> <b>or</b> to do swaps in emerging markets denominated in those markets' local currencies. The IFC's new international borrowings amounted to $8.8 billion in 2010 and $9.8 billion in 2011. The IFC Treasury actively engages in liquidity management in an effort to maximize returns and assure that funding for its investments is readily available while managing risks to the IFC.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the fourteenth century, in {{addition}} to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, money contracts of <b>bonds</b> <b>or</b> bands of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period, were being used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred. These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill in 1333 and Humbleton Hill in 1402.|$|E
5|$|While Sherman {{stood against}} {{printing}} additional greenbacks, {{as late as}} 1872 he remained a proponent of keeping existing greenbacks backed by bonds in circulation. Over the next two years, Sherman worked to develop what became the Specie Payment Resumption Act. The Act was a compromise. It required gradual reduction of the maximum value of greenbacks allowed to circulate to $300 million and, while earlier drafts had allowed the Treasury the choice between paying in <b>bonds</b> <b>or</b> coin, {{the final version of}} the Act required payment in specie, starting in 1879. The bill passed on a party-line vote in the lame duck session of the 43rd Congress, and President Grant signed it into law on January 14, 1875.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, Scottish armies were still largely {{assembled}} {{on the basis}} of common service and feudal obligations, with the addition of troops maintained by money contracts of <b>bonds</b> <b>or</b> bands of manrent. Common service theoretically called all men between the ages of 16 and 60 for a maximum of 40 days in one year. Such troops were expected to serve at their own expense and to bring their own supplies, a factor that severely limited the ability of Scottish armies to take part in sustained campaigning. Feudalism had been introduced to Scotland in the twelfth century, meaning that knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis, particularly heavily armed noble cavalry. Bonds of manrent were similar to English indentures of the same period, used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. Scotland relied on these systems longer than was the case in England. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and major Scottish lords continued to bring contingents from their kindred. In 1513 for the Flodden campaign these systems were successful in producing a large and formidable force, but in the religious and politically divided mid-sixteenth century there is evidence that the authorities were experiencing increasing difficulty in recruitment.|$|E

25|$|Corporate {{transactional}} events generally {{fit into}} three categories: distressed securities, risk arbitrage, and special situations. Distressed securities include such events as restructurings, recapitalizations, and bankruptcies. A distressed securities investment strategy involves {{investing in the}} <b>bonds</b> <b>or</b> loans of companies facing bankruptcy or severe financial distress, when these <b>bonds</b> <b>or</b> loans are being traded at a discount to their value. Hedge fund managers pursuing the distressed debt investment strategy aim to capitalize on depressed bond prices. Hedge funds purchasing distressed debt may prevent those companies from going bankrupt, as such an acquisition deters foreclosure by banks. While event-driven investing in general tends to thrive during a bull market, distressed investing works best during a bear market.|$|E

25|$|The {{empirical}} formula for benzene was long known, but its highly polyunsaturated structure, {{with just one}} hydrogen atom for each carbon atom, was challenging to determine.

25|$|In 1992, Ronald Gillespie and Edward A. Robinson {{suggested}} {{that the value of}} 71pm was too large because of the unusual weakness of the F-F bond in F2.

However, there are two variations on this predicted value: if they have either long <b>bonds</b> <b>or</b> short bonds.|$|E
