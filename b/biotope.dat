25|$|In England, {{farmers have}} been lauded by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds because {{the five most}} {{threatened}} bumblebees have made a comeback to the English nature due to the agri-environmental schemes. In Germany, support for extensive farming and <b>biotope</b> management helps maintain habitat for rare species such as orchids and butterflies. In Hungary, a special scheme was launched to protect the great bustard, maybe the world's heaviest flying bird, which needs areas with minimal disturbance and an abundant supply of insects to breed. In Cyprus, agri-environment schemes support the maintenance of traditional trees and bushes that are a natural habitat for the island's and likely to be of benefit to farmland birds in Cyprus.|$|E

25|$|Sea birds (magnificent frigatebird, brown booby, masked booby, terns, double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus), pelican, petrels) nest on the cliffs and uninhabited islands. In particular, on Grand-Îlet, a natural reserve of the archipelago which houses species of booby found nowhere else on les Saintes: red-footed booby (Sula sula) and blue-footed booby (Sula nebouxii). But {{in the context}} of global warming and invasive foreign species implanted by the humans (e.g. red lionfish), the environment and the biodiversity of these islands are considered to be very vulnerable and to be protected. It is therefore recommended that visitors do not take plants or capture animals to avoid disturbing the species in their natural <b>biotope,</b> and do not pollute the ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|In the United States during Revolutionary times, American artists trained abroad applied European {{styles to}} American {{portrait}} painting and still life. Charles Willson Peale founded {{a family of}} prominent American painters, and as major leader in the American art community, also founded a society for the training of artists {{as well as a}} famous museum of natural curiosities. His son Raphaelle Peale was {{one of a group of}} early American still-life artists, which also included John F. Francis, Charles Bird King, and John Johnston. By the second half of the 19th century, Martin Johnson Heade introduced the American version of the habitat or <b>biotope</b> picture, which placed flowers and birds in simulated outdoor environments. The American trompe-l'œil paintings also flourished during this period, created by John Haberle, William Michael Harnett, and John Frederick Peto. Peto specialized in the nostalgic wall-rack painting while Harnett achieved the highest level of hyper-realism in his pictorial celebrations of American life through familiar objects.|$|E
500|$|Central to the {{ecosystem}} concept {{is the idea}} that living organisms interact with every other element in their local environment. Eugene Odum, a founder of ecology, stated: [...] "Any unit that includes all of the organisms (ie: the [...] "community") in a given area interacting with the physical environment so that a flow of energy leads to clearly defined trophic structure, biotic diversity, and material cycles (i.e.: exchange of materials between living and nonliving parts) within the system is an ecosystem." [...] Within {{the ecosystem}}, species are connected and dependent upon one another in the food chain, and exchange energy and matter between themselves {{as well as with the}}ir environment. The human ecosystem concept is grounded in the deconstruction of the human/nature dichotomy and the premise that all species are ecologically integrated with each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their <b>biotope.</b>|$|E
40|$|Bodies of {{waters in}} caves and in crevices of rocks are {{distinguished}} from the other subsoil water ecosystems (“eustygon”, “stygorhithron”, “stygopotamon”) under the names “troglostygon” and “petrostygon”. The colonisation of subsoil water <b>biotopes</b> involves a fundamental principle which controls {{the development of the}} main <b>biotopes</b> for the stygobiont undergroundwater organisms. According to this ecological rule, which is described in detail and formulated, the several interstitial <b>biotopes</b> (for example “eustygopsammal,” “rhithrostygopsammal,” “potamostygopsephal”) are to be considered as the real <b>biotopes</b> of the stygobiont subsoil water organisms; waters in caves, on the contrary, are secondary <b>biotopes</b> of these animals. Caves which contain marine water are described as ecostystem “Thalassotroglon” in their relation to “limnotroglon” (= “stygotroglon”). In this why the contact between “limnospeology” and “thalassospeology” is established, and the limnic and marine microcavernal <b>biotopes</b> - ”thalassopsammal” and “thalassopsephal” - are also taken in consideration. “Limnospeology” and “thalassospeology” as limnological and thalassological investigations of subsoil water are characterized as biological fields of work, which serve for the investigation of an ecological unit...|$|R

500|$|The {{habitat of}} a species {{describes}} the environment over which a species is known to occur {{and the type of}} community that is formed as a result. More specifically, [...] "habitats can be defined as regions in environmental space that are composed of multiple dimensions, each representing a biotic or abiotic environmental variable; that is, any component or characteristic of the environment related directly (e.g. forage biomass and quality) or indirectly (e.g. elevation) to the use of a location by the animal." [...] For example, a habitat might be an aquatic or terrestrial environment that can be further categorized as a montane or alpine ecosystem. Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population {{of a species}} of tropical lizards (Tropidurus hispidus) has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental life history of amphibians, and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. <b>Biotope</b> and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas the latter applies to a species' environment.|$|E
2500|$|Another popular {{setup is}} the <b>biotope</b> {{aquarium}}. A <b>biotope</b> aquarium is a recreation {{of a specific}} natural environment. Some {{of the most popular}} biotopes are the freshwater habitats of the Amazon and Rio Negro rivers, the African rift lake environments of Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika, and saltwater coral reefs of Australia, the Red Sea, and the Caribbean. The fish, plants, substrate, rocks, wood, coral, and any other component of the display should completely match that of the local natural environment. It can be a challenge to recreate such environments, and most [...] "true" [...] biotopes will only have a few (if not only one) species of fish and invertebrates.|$|E

40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} of river monitoring using macroinvertebrate communities to assess environmental quality in Europe. A promising alternative is the use of species life-history traits. Both methods, however, have relied on the time-consuming identification of taxa. River <b>biotopes,</b> 1 - 100 m** 2 'habitats' with associated species assemblages, have long been seen as a useful and meaningful way of linking the ecology of macroinvertebrates and river hydro-morphology and can be used to assess hydro-morphological degradation in rivers. Taxonomic differences, however, between different rivers had prevented a general test of this concept until now. The species trait approach may overcome this obstacle across broad geographical areas, using <b>biotopes</b> as the hydro-morphological units which have characteristic species trait assemblages. We collected macroinvertebrate data from 512 discrete patches, comprising 13 river <b>biotopes,</b> from seven rivers in England and Wales. The aim was to test whether river <b>biotopes</b> were better predictors of macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition (genera, families, orders) in rivers, independently of the phylogenetic effects and catchment scale characteristics (i. e. hydrology, geography and land cover). We also tested whether species richness and diversity were better related to <b>biotopes</b> than to rivers. River <b>biotopes</b> explained 40 % of the variance in macroinvertebrate trait profiles across the rivers, largely independently of catchment characteristics. There was a strong phylogenetic signature, however. River <b>biotopes</b> were about 50 % better at predicting macroinvertebrate trait profiles than taxonomic composition across rivers, no matter which taxonomic resolution was used. River <b>biotopes</b> were better than river identity at explaining the variability in taxonomic richness and diversity (40 % and <= 10 %, respectively). Detailed trait-biotope associations agreed with independent a priori predictions relating trait categories to near river bed flows. Hence, species traits provided a much needed mechanistic understanding and predictive ability across a broad geographical area. We show that integration of the multiple biological trait approach with river <b>biotopes</b> at the interface between ecology and hydro-morphology provides a wealth of new information and potential applications for river science and management...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{importance}} of semi-natural <b>biotopes</b> for the carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and benefits of these beetles {{for the production of}} the oilseed rape. Evaluation was done by measuring the diversity of communities of carabid beetles by pitfall trapping followed by the evaluation of total abundance, Shannon´s diversity index and the Shannon´s evenness index in the field oilseed rape and in the adjacent semi-natural <b>biotopes.</b> Diversity was measured at two locations (location A, B). Monitored <b>biotopes</b> of the location A were the meadow, the field, the unmanaged field boundary and the forest. At the site B, monitored <b>biotopes</b> were the meadow and the field. Carabid beetles were captured in one-week intervals continuously from May to September 2013. In total 3076 individuals represented by 78 species were captured. The most numerous species in samples were Poecilus cupreus, Pterostichus melanarius, Poecilus versicolor, Pseudoophonus rufipes and Loricera pilicornis, which formed together 72 % of the total numbers. The monitored <b>biotopes</b> of location A did not differ significantly in total abundance (p = 0. 13) nor in the Shannon´s eveness (p = 0. 43). They differed by the diversity index (p = 0. 03), but this accounted for difference between the field boundary and the forest <b>biotopes</b> (p = 0. 04). No difference in the three measured parameters were found by the comparison the field sites and next semi-natural sites at locality A (i. e. meadow A/field A 1, forest/field A 2), nor by comparing the <b>biotopes</b> field and meadow in both the localities (A, B) in one model (p < 0. 05).
