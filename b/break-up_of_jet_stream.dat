40|$|This paper {{describes}} recent {{variations of}} the North Atlantic eddy-driven <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> and analyzes the mean response <b>of</b> the <b>jet</b> to anthropogenic forcing in climate models. <b>Jet</b> <b>stream</b> changes are analyzed both using a direct measure of the near-surface westerly wind maximum and using an EOF-based approach. This allows <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> changes {{to be related to}} the widely used leading patterns of variability: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and East Atlantic (EA) pattern. Viewed in NAO-EA state space, isolines <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> latitude and speed resemble a distorted polar coordinate system, highlighting the dependence <b>of</b> the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> quantities on both spatial patterns. Some differences in the results of the two methods are discussed, but both approaches agree on the general characteristics of the climate models. While there is some agreement between models on a poleward shift <b>of</b> the <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> in response to anthropogenic forcing, there is still considerable spread between different model projections, especially in winter. Furthermore, the model responses to forcing are often weaker than their biases when compared to a reanalysis. Diagnoses <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> changes can be sensitive to the methodologies used, and several aspects of this are also discussed. © 2012 American Meteorological Society...|$|R

40|$|Polar front <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> {{variability}} {{is responsible}} for instances of extreme weather and is crucial for regional climate change. The North Atlantic Polar Front <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> is <b>of</b> particular significance to the heavily populated areas of western Europe and eastern North America as storm track variability, atmospheric modes of variability such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), temperature and rainfall are all intimately linked with <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> changes. Although seasonal and interannual variability are often attributed to internal variability, there are several possible drivers <b>of</b> polar front <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> changes that are reviewed in this study. Cryospheric effects from sea-ice extent and snow cover, oceanic effects from North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures and tropical influences such as the El-NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation, and stratospheric effects due to stratospheric circulation variability, solar variability, volcanic eruptions and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation are all identified in the literature as factors that impact on the Atlantic Polar Front <b>jet</b> <b>stream.</b> These drivers <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> variability can oppose or reinforce one another, {{and there are some}} indications of possible nonlinear interactions between them. We also review the modelling <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> variability. While a consensus has now been reached that some observed drivers can be reproduced in climate models, we conclude that improved understanding of more recently identified drivers of the Atlantic extratropical <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> is crucial for making progress in regional climate predictions on all timescales from months to decades ahead.

Together with the biased distribution of near-resonant asteroids, the depletion across the Kirkwood gaps could be understood.

40|$|<b>Jet</b> <b>streams</b> are regions <b>of</b> {{sustained}} {{high wind}} speeds {{in the upper}} atmosphere and are seen {{by some as a}} substantial renewable energy resource. However, <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> are nearly geostrophic flow, that is, they result from the balance between the pressure gradient and Coriolis force in the near absence <b>of</b> friction. Therefore, <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> motion is associated with very small generation rates of kinetic energy to maintain the high wind velocities, and it is this generation rate that will ultimately limit the potential use <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> as a renewable energy resource. Here we estimate the maximum limit <b>of</b> <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> wind power by considering extraction of kinetic energy as a term in the free energy balance of kinetic energy that describes the generation, depletion, and extraction of kinetic energy. We use this balance as the basis to quantify the maximum limit of how much kinetic energy can be extracted sustainably from the <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> the global atmosphere as well as the potential climatic impacts of its use. We first use a simple thought experiment of geostrophic flow to demonstrate why the high wind velocities <b>of</b> the <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> are not associated with a high potential for renewable energy generation. We then use an atmospheric general circulation model to estimate that the maximum sustainable extraction from <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> <b>of</b> the global atmosphere is about 7. 5 TW. This estimate is about 200 -times less than previous estimates and {{is due to the fact}} that the common expression for instantaneous wind power &frac 12 &rho; v 3 merely characterizes the transport of kinetic energy by the flow, but not the generation rate of kinetic energy. We also find that when maximum wind power is extracted from the <b>jet</b> <b>streams,</b> it results in significant climatic impacts due to a substantial increase of heat transport across the <b>jet</b> <b>streams</b> in the upper atmosphere. This results in upper atmospheric temperature differences of > 20 °C, greater atmospheric stability, substantial reduction in synoptic activity, and substantial differences in surface climate. We conclude that <b>jet</b> <b>stream</b> wind power does not have the potential to become a significant source of renewable energy...|$|R
