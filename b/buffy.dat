5|$|At the Magic Box, Giles {{recognizes that}} he must stand aside if <b>Buffy</b> is to face her {{responsibilities}} in caring for Dawn instead of relying on him ("Standing") and Tara finds {{a picture of the}} forget-me-not flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively <b>Buffy</b> and Willow — Giles wants to leave <b>Buffy</b> for her own good, while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow’s magical manipulation of their relationship ("Under Your Spell / Standing—Reprise"). Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet’s minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for <b>Buffy</b> to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist <b>Buffy,</b> so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if <b>Buffy</b> was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that <b>Buffy</b> is drawn to danger ("Walk Through the Fire").|$|E
5|$|On patrol, Riley notices {{shadows in}} the belfry and goes to investigate. <b>Buffy</b> finds two of The Gentlemen's minions, kills one and runs after the other. Riley fights {{his way into the}} belfry and while he's embattled, <b>Buffy</b> crashes through a window, fighting. He turns to attack and finds himself face to face with <b>Buffy.</b> She fights while he stares, unmoving. When a minion pins her down she sees and recognizes the box from her dream and gesticulates wildly for Riley to destroy it. When he does so, the stolen voices escape. <b>Buffy</b> screams until the heads of The Gentlemen and their minions explode.|$|E
5|$|The credits appear over a {{flashback}} to a Christmas dinner {{where all the}} Scoobies are present, having a typical lighthearted conversation as Joyce and <b>Buffy</b> discuss a pie that drops on the floor. The scene snaps back to <b>Buffy</b> in the living room, shaking Joyce and screaming at her. She calls for an ambulance and attempts CPR, accidentally snapping a rib in the process, but to no avail. <b>Buffy</b> calls Giles. The paramedics arrive and work on Joyce and she revives, the paramedics declare it a miracle in the ambulance, and Joyce, <b>Buffy,</b> and Dawn rejoice in the hospital. The scene snaps back {{to the living room}} where the paramedics continue to work on Joyce until they stop and tell <b>Buffy</b> that Joyce is dead. They leave, and <b>Buffy</b> goes into the hall and vomits. Giles arrives and <b>Buffy</b> tells him not to move the body, shocking herself by using that word.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the first}} time Giles is officially <b>Buffy's</b> Watcher since season 3's [...] "Helpless". Additionally, the last time Quentin Travers {{appeared}} was near <b>Buffy's</b> eighteenth birthday; this episode is very close to <b>Buffy's</b> twentieth.|$|R

5|$|Although <b>Buffy</b> and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of <b>Buffy</b> and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. <b>Buffy</b> must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the <b>Buffy</b> series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{where the}} {{previous}} episode left off, <b>Buffy</b> arrives home {{and sees the}} flowers sent from Joyce's suitor. She calls out {{to her mother and}} hears no answer. <b>Buffy</b> sees Joyce lying lifeless on the sofa, staring at the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|<b>Buffy</b> {{died at the}} end of {{the fifth}} season ("The Gift"), sacrificing herself in place of her younger sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) in order to save the world. In the first episode of the sixth season, Willow, believing <b>Buffy</b> to be in Hell, used magic to bring her back from the grave. <b>Buffy</b> was in fact at peace, in what she thinks was heaven, but she has kept this a secret from her friends. Since her resurrection, <b>Buffy</b> has been lost and without {{inspiration}} to perform her duties as a Slayer. Willow is romantically involved with Tara Maclay (Amber Benson), a powerful but ethical witch. Tara has previously expressed concern at Willow's use of her emergent magical powers for trivial or personal matters. In the preceding episode ("All the Way"), Willow cast a spell to make Tara forget an argument about her abuse of magic. In the same episode, Dawn, who has been stealing from stores, including Anya's magic shop, lies to <b>Buffy</b> and goes on a clandestine and almost deadly date. Left to take care of Dawn after the death of their mother Joyce Summers (Kristine Sutherland) in the fifth season ("The Body"), <b>Buffy</b> has come to depend more heavily on Giles. Following Dawn's date, <b>Buffy</b> asks Giles to shoulder responsibility for disciplining her, much to his discomfort.|$|E

5000|$|Season five {{introduces}} <b>Buffy's</b> younger [...] "sister", Dawn, {{who suddenly}} appears in <b>Buffy's</b> life. Although she {{is new to}} the series, to the characters {{it is as if}} she has always been there.|$|R
50|$|Jesse's {{death and}} {{transformation}} would cause Xander to develop resentment towards vampires, which {{leads him to}} openly dislike <b>Buffy's</b> subsequent vampire love interests Angel and Spike, and favor Riley Finn, <b>Buffy's</b> first human love interest.|$|R
5|$|Cordelia Chase is {{a fictional}} {{character}} created by Joss Whedon for the television series <b>Buffy</b> the Vampire Slayer; she also appeared on Buffy's spin-off series, Angel. Portrayed by Charisma Carpenter, the character {{appears as a}} series regular {{in the first three}} seasons of <b>Buffy,</b> before exiting the show and becoming a series regular during the first four seasons of Angel. The character made her last television appearance in 2004, appearing as a special guest star in Angels one hundredth episode. Cordelia also appears in both canonical and apocryphal <b>Buffy</b> and Angel material such as comic books and novels.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} dream sequence, <b>Buffy</b> is woken by Anya in her dorm room. She then finds {{herself in her}} room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, <b>Buffy</b> talks to her mother, {{who lives in the}} walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been {{promoted}} to Surgeon General and is drawing up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam start to make a pillow fort. When <b>Buffy</b> finds her weapons bag, the only thing in it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells <b>Buffy</b> that she cannot have friends and must work alone, which <b>Buffy</b> rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy's living room next to her dying friends until <b>Buffy</b> realizes that she can stop the fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up.|$|E
5|$|In {{the waiting}} room outside the morgue, the doctor tells <b>Buffy</b> that Joyce died of an {{aneurysm}} suddenly and painlessly. Left alone with <b>Buffy,</b> Tara tells her that her own mother {{died when she was}} 17 and she went through something similar. Dawn goes alone to the morgue to see Joyce's body. While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, <b>Buffy</b> goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As <b>Buffy</b> fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek.|$|E

5000|$|The Scoobies find <b>Buffy's</b> body on {{the ground}} below {{the point where the}} portal had opened, and grieve.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{under the}} streets of Sunnydale, The Master (Mark Metcalf), an ancient and {{powerful}} vampire king, is woken by lesser vampires from a long sleep {{to prepare for the}} Harvest. He sends Luke (Brian Thompson) to fetch young blood. Willow's new acquaintance takes her to a crypt in a cemetery, where they are joined by Darla and Jesse, whom she has bitten. <b>Buffy</b> and Xander arrive. <b>Buffy</b> kills Willow's vampire. Xander and Willow help the weakened Jesse to flee. Luke takes Darla's place in the fight so she can help catch the kids. Luke throws <b>Buffy</b> in a stone coffin and is about to move in for the kill.|$|E
5|$|Small details became significant: {{to protect}} her dignity <b>Buffy</b> pulls the hem of Joyce's skirt down after it rode up when she {{attempted}} CPR; the camera focuses on a breeze through wind chimes while <b>Buffy</b> vomits; to emphasize Buffy's isolation, the scene has no exterior establishing shots of the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode is}} a tribute to the silent films that were played in theaters with musical accompaniment, and 27 minutes of it are entirely dialogue-free. Several types of music are used to express what is not being said; music acts as the narrator. During Giles' {{overhead}} presentation he plays a recorded version of Camille Saint-Saëns' Danse Macabre. <b>Buffy</b> and Riley's love theme is presented for the first time when they kiss in this episode. This composition by Christophe Beck—who composed scores for <b>Buffy</b> regularly—pleased Joss Whedon more than the <b>Buffy</b> and Angel love theme. He considered the Buffy-Riley theme more adult, but a bit more strange and blue than the Buffy-Angel theme: a prediction of where the relationship between <b>Buffy</b> and Riley would go.|$|E

5|$|At school, Dawn {{is crying}} in the {{bathroom}} upset that a girl called her a freak. In art class she talks with a boy as they sketch, and the two share a moment of understanding about being troubled. <b>Buffy</b> arrives and pulls Dawn out of class into the hall. Through {{the windows of the}} art room, the class watches <b>Buffy</b> tell her that Joyce has had an accident. The rest of the conversation is muffled. Dawn collapses in the hall, sobbing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Buffy</b> the Vampire Slayer: Darla has {{appeared}} in 5 episodes, appearing in the first, second and fifth seasons.|$|E
5|$|Certain scenes, {{such as the}} {{argument}} between Giles and <b>Buffy</b> in the library, and Buffy's first meeting with Angel, were re-shot {{eight months after the}} first episode was recorded with both Whedon and Gellar feeling that <b>Buffy</b> was too angry in the original takes. Whedon subsequently teased Gellar {{that they were going to}} reshoot the scenes a third time. The high school used for external and some internal scenes in the series is Torrance High, the same school used for the series Beverly Hills, 90210.|$|E

The character later {{appeared in the}} <b>Buffy</b> spin-off series Angel, making at least one appearance in every season. She made her last television appearance in 2004, appearing as a special guest star in the fifth and final season of Angel.|$|E
5|$|Each {{season of}} <b>Buffy</b> the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as <b>Buffy)</b> presents an overall theme episodes tie into. Roz Kaveney identifies family and belonging as the overall {{theme of the}} fifth season. Buffy's mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) begins experiencing headaches {{at the beginning of}} the season, once collapsing and requiring hospitalization. She subsequently has a brain tumor removed. She has been recovering well. In the previous episode, she receives flowers from a male suitor, which <b>Buffy</b> finds at the end of that episode. The fifth season also introduces Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), Buffy's 14-year-old sister. Each season has a primary antagonist called the Big Bad; in the fifth season this takes the form of a powerful goddess named Glory (Clare Kramer).|$|E
