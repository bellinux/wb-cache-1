It has a circumboreal distribution, occurring {{throughout much of the}} northernmost Northern Hemisphere from the lower Arctic into the alpine climates of mountainous areas in temperate Eurasia and North America. It grows in several types of habitat, including meadows, marshes, heath, beaches and bars, and arctic and alpine tundra.|$|E
5000|$|Much of the {{grassland}} {{is dominated}} by perennial rye-grass, with a good diversity of common wild flowers, {{and there are also}} areas of dry acid grassland. Several damp hollows, probably former ponds, contain tussocky grassland with uncommon wild flowers such as great burnet, <b>bog</b> <b>stitchwort</b> and common marsh-bedstraw. A map of the 1840s shows fourteen ponds, but only Laurel Farm Pond survives. This is frequented by large numbers of geese and mallards. Trees include pedunculate oak, beech and horse chestnut.|$|E
5000|$|Higher Moors and Porth Hellick Pool SSSI {{is one of}} {{the three}} main {{freshwater}} wetland areas on Scilly. The wetland is fed by ground water and a small steam to form a mosaic of willow and alder scrub, mire and pools. The peat deposits were once a fuel source and are rich in pollen. Along with other paleo-environmental evidence the deposits provide information about the vegetational history of the islands since the Mesolithic. The area is important as a feeding ground for migrating and wintering birds and for summer visitors and waterfowl. Reed Warbler and Sedge Warbler nest in the common reed which grows along the margins of the pools and Coot, Gadwall, Mallard and Moorhen, Teal and Water Rail also breed. The moors were once grazed and the fields have a rich wet grassland flora with Greater Tussock-sedge, Hemlock Water-dropwort, Purple Loosestrife, Royal Fern, Water Mint and Yellow Iris. The acidic boggy areas support Bog Pimpernel, <b>Bog</b> <b>Stitchwort</b> and Marsh St Johnâ€™s-wort with Lesser Spearwort in the wetter areas.|$|E
