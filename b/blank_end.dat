50|$|The 1930s edition was {{published}} with the white-spine dust jacket, with artwork by Russell H. Tandy, and four glossy black-and-white interior illustrations, also by Tandy. The first edition is readily distinguished from later editions by {{its lack of}} a silhouette on the front cover, and <b>blank</b> <b>end</b> pages.

2500|$|The {{traditional}} set of dominoes contains one unique {{piece for}} each possible {{combination of two}} ends with zero to six spots, and {{is known as a}} double-six set because the highest-value piece has six pips on each end (the [...] "double six"). The spots from one to six are generally arranged as they are on six-sided dice, but because <b>blank</b> <b>ends</b> having no spots are used, seven faces are possible, allowing 28 unique pieces in a double-six set.|$|R

50|$|There is an {{additional}} concept, known as the option, given {{to one of the}} teams. The option is given to the team which did not score in the previous end (or randomly determined in the first end), and switches teams {{in the event of a}} <b>blank</b> <b>end.</b> The team with the option has the option to select which of the two rocks in play is theirs, with the hammer going to the team with the rock in the house.|$|E
50|$|The club {{scoreboard}} {{is traditional}} {{and used in}} most curling clubs. Scoring on this board only {{requires the use of}} (up to) 11 digit cards, whereas with baseball-type scoring an unknown number of multiples of the digits (especially low digits like 1) may be needed. The numbered centre row represents all possible accumulated scores, and the numbers placed in the team rows represent the end in which that team achieved that cumulative score. If the red team scores three points in the first end (called a three-ender), then a 1 (indicating the first end) is placed beside the number 3 in the red row. If they score two more in the second end, then a 2 will be placed beside the 5 in the red row, indicating that the red team has five points in total (3+2). This scoreboard works because only one team can get points in an end. However, some confusion may arise if neither team scores points in an end, this is called a <b>blank</b> <b>end.</b> The <b>blank</b> <b>end</b> numbers are usually listed in the farthest column on the right in the row of the team that has the hammer (last rock advantage), or on a special spot for blank ends.|$|E

5000|$|Apparently not comprehending the {{objection}} to the <b>blank</b> <b>end</b> of their line approaching Princes Risborough, the directors arranged for a second visit from Col Rich, and this took place on 11 July 1872. The connecting line at Princes Risborough had still not been made and once again he declined to recommend the line for opening. The company had also indicated the type of engine they expected to use on the line, to be hired in from the GWR. It was a [...] "517" [...] class 0-4-2ST. He considered {{that this was a}} heavy class of locomotive considering the very light character of the permanent way, which would, he considered, lead to serious maintenance difficulties. The undertaking regarding the method of working had still not been submitted, and also the GWR had not connected the Princes Risborough section of its own line, so Rich again refused permission to open.|$|E
5000|$|... === Hammer === Last-rock or last-stone {{advantage}} in an end {{is called the}} hammer. Before the game, teams typically decide who gets the hammer in the first end either by chance (such as a coin toss), by a [...] "draw-to-the-button" [...] contest, where a representative of each team shoots to see who gets closer to {{the centre of the}} rings, or, particularly in tournament settings like the Winter Olympics, by a comparison of each team's win-loss record. In all subsequent ends, the hammer belongs to the team that did not score in the preceding end. In the event that neither team scores, the hammer remains with the same team. Naturally, it is easier to score points with the hammer than without; in tournament play, the team with the hammer generally tries to score two or more points. If only one point is possible, the skip will often try to avoid scoring at all in order to retain the hammer until the next end, when two or more points may lie. This is called a <b>blank</b> <b>end.</b> Scoring without the hammer is commonly referred to as stealing, or a steal, and is much more difficult.|$|E

50|$|Opened in 1939, {{the former}} Petrie Terrace Police Barracks is a three-storey brick and {{concrete}} building in red face brick with contrasting horizontal banding in rendered concrete. The roof is sheeted with corrugated fibro cement tiles. The main elevation {{to the southeast}} is a single range, symmetrical about a narrow, faceted projecting parapeted central entrance. The modest entrance to the ground floor is approached {{by a set of}} concrete stairs to a covered entry porch opening into the main entrance lobby ahead. The central block is flanked to each side by verandahs to each floor. The elevation to Petrie Terrace is symmetrical about a hip-roofed projecting and faceted central bay flanked by verandahed wings which terminate in prominent hip-roofed <b>blank</b> <b>end</b> pavilions. The blank ends contain recessed rectangular panels to each floor level giving shadow and texture to the exterior walls. The faceting of the central bay forms a full length oriel-like window-bay suggestive of defensiveness. A prominent roof ventilator is located to the centre of the main roof. The second floor verandahs to both elevations are punctuated by pairs of Doric columns with battened timber balustrading with decorative criss-cross central panels. The verandahs to the ground and first floors have similar balustrading punctuated by solid brick piers. The projecting eaves around the building are timber-lined. Other detailing includes decorative terracotta tile panels to the projecting parapet fronts to each elevation and vertical bands of incised arrows to the concrete door surrounds to the north, south and east entrances.|$|E
50|$|In the 1880s, {{with the}} {{building}} of the railway line from Homebush to Hornsby, some estates were subdivided along its route. Landowners like Mrs Darvall sold parcels of their estates to the colonial government and by 1883 construction was well advanced. The railway bridge across the Parramatta River was completed in August 1886 and was followed by the opening of a single line track from Strathfield to Hornsby on 17 September 1886. Ryde (now called West Ryde) was one of the seven stations of this line and one of only two that were built of brick. The new railway platforms at both West Ryde and Eastwood did not service commuters. They were for freight. By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, some Darvall land had been sold, yet the bulk of the Ryedale Estate remained intact. Anthony Darvall started subdividing the land after his mother's death. The first subdivisions were between Clanalpine and Rowe streets (Eastwood) in the north and between Anthony Road and West Parade in the south-east. Eventually Ryedale House and a small parcel of land were sold to the Anglican Church in the 1930s. The house was used as a rectory until the early 1970s when it was bought by private individuals who removed it, stone by stone, and re-erected it on a rural property in the Hunter Region. All that remains at the original site (apart from the old and new churches) is a small group of buildings, one of which is two-storey, with a <b>blank</b> <b>end</b> wall. This was a brick extension added to Ryedale House around 1900, probably when Anthony William and his family took up residence. Other twentieth-century subdivisions proposed included the Ryde New Township Estate in the Falconer and Hermitage Road area in 1906. By 1909 Ryde Heights, which was located on the southern side of Blaxland Road between Benson Lane and Melville Street was advertised as 'the pick of the district - 10 special residential sites for high class houses overlooking the windings of the Parramatta River'. The sixth and last subdivision of the Darvall Estate was the Outlook Estate, in the Denistone area. The 124 homes sites were advertised for private sale in 1929. The houses were built during the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E
