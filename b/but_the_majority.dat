5|$|All pulmonate {{land snails}} are hermaphrodites, {{and have a}} {{complete}} and rather elaborate set of {{both male and female}} reproductive organs (see the simplified anatomical diagram above), <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of pulmonate land snails have no love darts and no dart sac.|$|E
5|$|Chemical and {{physical}} arguments {{have been made}} in support of lutetium and lawrencium <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of authors seem unconvinced. Most working chemists are not aware there is any controversy. In December 2015 an IUPAC project was established to make a recommendation on the matter.|$|E
50|$|Either of the Condorcet loser {{criterion}} or <b>the</b> mutual <b>majority</b> criterion implies <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> loser criterion. However, the Condorcet criterion {{does not}} imply <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> loser criterion, since the minimax method satisfies <b>the</b> Condorcet <b>but</b> not <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> loser criterion. Also, <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> criterion is logically independent from <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> loser criterion, since the plurality rule satisfies <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>but</b> not <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> loser criterion, and the anti-plurality rule satisfies <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> loser <b>but</b> not <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> criterion. There is no positional scoring rule which satisfies both <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> and <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> loser criterion, <b>but</b> several non-positional rules, including many Condorcet rules, do satisfy both criteria.|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the museums}} have been {{accredited}} by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, which sets {{national standards for}} museums in the UK. Several are art galleries providing space for the exhibition of art, or are philatelic, regimental, science, aviation, transport, railway, toy, religious or sports museums, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> are local museums. There are also several historic house museums owned or managed by the National Trust or English Heritage.|$|E
5|$|Not much {{tropical}} activity {{occurs during}} the month of July, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of hurricane seasons see the formation of one tropical cyclone during July. From an average of Atlantic tropical cyclone seasons from 1944 to 1996, the first tropical storm in half of the seasons occurred by 11 July, and a second formed by 8 August.|$|E

5|$|Ratites run, and {{penguins}} {{swim and}} waddle: <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of birds are rather small, and can fly. Some birds use {{their ability to}} fly to complete epic globe-crossing migrations, while others such as frigate birds fly over the oceans for months on end.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{woodpeckers}} such as Dryocopus have a fast, direct form of flight, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> {{of species}} have a typical undulating flight pattern {{consisting of a}} series of rapid flaps followed by a swooping glide. Many birds in the Melanerpes genus have distinctive, rowing wing-strokes while the piculets engage in short bursts of rapid direct flight.|$|E
5|$|Adult solitary wasps mainly feed on nectar, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> {{of their}} time is taken up by {{foraging}} for food for their carnivorous young, mostly insects or spiders. Apart from providing food for their larval offspring, no maternal care is given. Some wasp species provide food for the young repeatedly during their development (progressive provisioning). Others, such as potter wasps (Eumeninae) and sand wasps (Ammophila, Sphecidae), repeatedly build nests which they stock with a supply of immobilised prey such as one large caterpillar, laying a single egg in or on its body, and then sealing up the entrance (mass provisioning).|$|E

5|$|Anthozoa is a {{class of}} marine {{invertebrates}} which includes the sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals and gorgonians. Adult anthozoans are almost all attached to the seabed, while their larvae can disperse {{as part of the}} plankton. The basic unit of the adult is the polyp; this consists of a cylindrical column topped by a disc with a central mouth surrounded by tentacles. Sea anemones are mostly solitary, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of corals are colonial, being formed by the budding of new polyps from an original, founding individual. Colonies are strengthened by calcium carbonate and other materials and take various massive, plate-like, bushy or leafy forms.|$|E
5|$|Boyle {{sponsored}} a motion of non-confidence against the government. Despite enjoying {{the support of}} twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a royal commission, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by Arthur Sifton, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show {{a conflict of interest}} on Rutherford's part, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{regional}} seismic risk, the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s. No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units that were still operational at the facility. Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically-active area, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or inadequate maintenance. Only one piece of equipment at the facility provided data by which {{an estimate of the}} peak ground acceleration could be made.|$|E

5|$|During migration, {{the song}} thrush travels mainly {{at night with}} a strong and direct flight action. It flies in loose flocks which cross the sea on a broad front rather than concentrating at short {{crossings}} (as occurs in the migration of large soaring birds), and calls frequently to maintain contact. Migration may start as early as late August in the most easterly and northerly parts of the range, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of birds, with shorter distances to cover, head south from September to mid-December. However, hard weather may force further movement. Return migration varies between mid-February around the Mediterranean to May in northern Sweden and central Siberia. Vagrants have been recorded in Greenland, various Atlantic islands, and West Africa.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was unpopular {{with the}} party and the country, and many of Blaine’s old {{supporters}} encouraged him to run for the nomination. Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, took it for false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were certain that he was a candidate, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, good enough for second place.|$|E
5|$|Landlords {{generally}} divided their estates {{into smaller}} farms that they rented to tenant farmers. Tenant farmers were generally on one-year leases, {{and could be}} evicted even if they paid their rents. Some of the tenants were large farmers who farmed over , <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> were much smaller—on average between 15 and 50 acres (0.06–0.20km2). Many small farmers worked as labourers on the larger farms. The poorest agricultural workers were the landless labourers, {{who worked on the}} land of other farmers. Farmers were an important group politically, having more votes than any other sector of society.|$|E

5|$|Multiple escape {{attempts}} were made {{throughout the history of}} the prison camp, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. The guards forced all prisoners to watch as the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other escape {{attempts were}} made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which motivated the POWs to {{keep a close eye on}} others to prevent them from making escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the troops}} {{assigned}} to the expedition, 350 were from grenadier companies drawn from the 4th (King's Own), 5th, 10th, 18th (Royal Irish), 23rd, 38th, 43rd, 47th, 52nd and 59th Regiments of Foot, and the 1st Battalion of His Majesty's Marine Forces. Protecting the grenadier companies were about 320 light infantry from the 4th, 5th, 10th, 23rd, 38th, 43rd, 47th, 52nd, and 59th Regiments, and the 1st Battalion of the Marines. Each company had its own lieutenant, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> of the captains commanding them were volunteers attached to them at the last minute, drawn from all the regiments stationed in Boston. This lack of familiarity between commander and company would cause problems during the battle.|$|E
5|$|On the US Billboard 200, Janet Jackson had {{its peak}} at number 63. In New Zealand, the album peaked at number 44 on the New Zealand Albums Chart, during its only-week chart on April 17, 1983. As of 2003, Janet Jackson sold 82,000 copies through BMG Music Club in the United States. And sold {{additional}} 62,000 copies according to Soundscan since 1991. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> {{of the sales}} occurred before Soundscan began tracking sales in the US in 1991.
