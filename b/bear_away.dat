The {{archbishop}} then concludes the ceremonies of the anointing by reciting a prayer that is the English translation of the ancient Latin prayer Deus, Dei Filius, recited in the consecration of other Christian sovereigns. Once this prayer is finished, the monarch rises and sits again in the Coronation Chair. The Knights of the Garter then <b>bear</b> <b>away</b> the canopy.|$|E

2500|$|The Cù Sìth (...) is an enormous, otherworldly hound, said {{to haunt}} the Scottish Highlands. Roughly {{the size of}} a cow or large calf, the Cù Sìth was feared as a harbinger of death and would appear to <b>bear</b> <b>away</b> the soul of a person to the afterlife (similar to the manner of the Grim Reaper). Supernatural dogs in the legends are usually {{completely}} black, or white with red ears. The Cù Sìth's coloration is therefore highly unusual because of its light green colour, although it may be derived from the green colour often worn by Celtic fairies.|$|E

[...] Gregory's older companion, Nicholas Sadler, {{may have been a}} younger brother or perhaps a cousin of Sir Ralph Sadler, Thomas Cromwell's personal secretary and close friend. Nicholas Sadler also had with him a [...] "little gentlewoman", who Margaret wished permission to educate herself, to fill up her leisure intervals.|$|E

2500|$|Preneuse {{then turned}} her {{attention}} to Rattlesnake, and a fierce cannonade was exchanged until 3.30 am on the morning of 21 September, when Preneuse stopped firing and bore away, to the surprise of the British. She then left the bay and sailed away, ending the engagement. Both Camel and Rattlesnake had sustained damage to their masts, sails and rigging, and had several holes in their hulls. Casualties were comparatively light however, with six men wounded on Camel and two men killed, one man mortally wounded and six or seven slightly wounded on Rattlesnake. Both Lee and Gooch had made several attempts to return to their ship, but were unable to launch their boats due to the raging surf on the beach. Seeing Preneuse <b>bear</b> <b>away</b> apparently damaged, Lee sent news of the attack on to Table Bay. The 54-gun [...] put to sea to intercept the French ship, but Preneuse was able to repel her after bad weather prevented Jupiter from outmaneuvering Preneuse. The 74-gun [...] and the 50-gun [...] finally caught up with Preneuse on 11 December 1799, driving her ashore and causing her destruction.|$|E
2500|$|Roddam {{returned}} to Plymouth, with Colchester leaking badly, but the port admiral, Commodore Hanaway, merely sent some caulkers on board, {{and sent her}} back to sea to join Sir Edward Hawke off Vans with a convoy. On joining the fleet, Hawke asked who had sent him a ship in such poor condition, and sent Roddam back to Plymouth to properly refit. Roddam was then sent to Saint Helena, with Captain Jeekill's 60-gun [...] under his orders, to bring home the East Indies convoy. They were joined for their return voyage by Sir George Pocock's squadron. As the squadron and the convoy passed the Isles of Scilly, Roddam became concerned that they were {{too close to the}} land, and gave the signal to tack. Roddam had a second occasion to warn the convoy, when off Dover. Pocock gave the order to lie-to, but Roddam, seeing that some of the convoy were in danger of running onto South Foreland, signalled for the ships to <b>bear</b> <b>away</b> to the Downs. In both instances Pocock deferred to Roddam's judgement, and thanked him for his efforts. Colchester was then ordered to Portsmouth, and on peace being declared, went ashore.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{books in}} the English language to mention numbers of dog types are from the [...] "Cynegetica" [...] (hunting literature), namely [...] The Art of Venery 1327 by the Anglo-French Master of game, Twiti (Twici), a treatise which describes hunting with the limer (a leashed bloodhound type), the pack of running hounds (scent hounds) greyhounds, and alaunts. More significantly in recording the use and description of various dog types, The Master of Game circa 1406 by Edward of York [...] a treatise which describes dogs and their work, such as the alaunt, greyhound, pack scent hounds, spaniel, and mastiff used by the privileged and wealthy for hunting purposes. [...] "The Master of Game" [...] {{is a combination of}} the earlier Art of Venery and the famous French hunting treatise Livre de Chasse by Gaston Phoebus circa 1387. The Boke of St. Albans, published in 1486 a [...] "school" [...] book about hawking, hunting, fishing, and heraldry, attributed to Juliana Berners (Barnes), lists dogs of the time mainly by function: [...] " [...] First there is a greyhound, a bastard, a mongrel, a mastiff, a limer, a spaniel, raches (small-to-medium sized scenthounds), kennets (small hunting dogs), terriers, butcher's hounds, dung-heap dogs, trundel tails (lapdogs?) and prick-eared curs, and small ladies puppies that <b>bear</b> <b>away</b> the fleas and diverse small sorts".|$|E
