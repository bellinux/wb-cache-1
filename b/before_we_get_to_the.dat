500|$|In September 2015, after Marvel Studios was {{integrated}} into The Walt Disney Studios with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter, {{it was reported}} that the studios' creative committee would have [...] "nominal" [...] input on the films moving forward, though would continue to consult on Marvel Television productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control. All key film decisions going forward will be made by Feige, D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso. At the end of the month, on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said there are [...] "broad strokes" [...] though sometime [...] "super-specific things. But for the most part, in broad strokes that are broad enough and loose enough that, if through the development of four of five movies <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> culmination ... we still have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up. So that all the movies, hopefully when they're finished, will feel like they're all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead, but really can live and breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves." [...] The studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or re-acquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in February 2015 with Spider-Man.|$|E
2500|$|We can {{demonstrate}} {{there must be}} at least two people in London with the same number of hairs on their heads as follows. Since a typical human head has an average of around 150,000 hairs, {{it is reasonable to assume}} (as an upper bound) that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on their head [...] holes). There are more than 1,000,000 people in London ( [...] is bigger than 1million items). Assigning a pigeonhole to each number of hairs on a person's head, and assign people to pigeonholes according to the number of hairs on their head, there {{must be at least}} two people assigned to the same pigeonhole by the 1,000,001st assignment (because they have the same number of hairs on their heads) (or, [...] ). For the average case (...) with the constraint: fewest overlaps, there will be at most one person assigned to every pigeonhole and the 150,001st person assigned to the same pigeonhole as someone else. In the absence of this constraint, there may be empty pigeonholes because the [...] "collision" [...] happens <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 150,001st person. The principle just proves the existence of an overlap; it says nothing of the number of overlaps (which falls under the subject of probability distribution).|$|E

6000|$|... "That's the old shanty passing away," [...] said Stacy complacently. [...] "I reckon there won't be {{much left}} of it <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Boomville." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I’m sure I wish I was {{off this}} dreadful ship," [...] said Mrs. Fillson nervously. [...] "Nothing but unpleasantness. How long <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Summercove, Cap’n Bunnett?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have eaten}} worse," [...] Frank said carelessly, [...] "and don't care if I never eat better. How {{long do you}} suppose <b>we</b> shall be <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> New Orleans?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bully for you, Harry! I reckon {{that would}} {{give us a chance}} anyhow. That is, if we ain't cut off <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{know the}} lakes, Master Cap, {{or you would}} not say that. <b>Before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Thousand Islands, you will have other notions of what natur' has done in this wilderness." ...|$|E
60|$|He. What's the good? There's a cloud on Elysium Hill, {{and that}} means it's foggy all down the Mall. We'll go on. It'll blow away <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Convent, perhaps. 'Jove! It is chilly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} settled that point, {{or at least}} there is another <b>to</b> settle <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> X----. Is this Miss Zenobie" [...] (Zoraide, {{interposed}} I)--"well, Zoraide--is she really married to Pelet?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{should never}} have been let come nearer than Ratisbon! The victory [...] at Echmuhl was fatal for us. O Echmuhl, Echmuhl! I believe he will [...] {{overtake}} us <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Buda.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{going to}} be tough lines <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Farley's," [...] he said to himself; [...] "but I ought to hold out {{if for no other reason}} than to clear Sam beyond a doubt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} obliged {{if you will}} {{go up to the}} foretop, Hardy, and con the brig in; but mind you, come down <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> white water. You may as well send Mr. Eden down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had a presentiment that {{we should}} want a consoling {{something}} of this sort," [...] said Fritz. [...] "Fill your glass, David, and let out {{the worst of it}} at once, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of the bottle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{like the}} lad, though I own that, so far, I cannot altogether make him out. Perhaps I shall learn somewhat more about him, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} voyage, {{and in that case}} I will tell you all I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, you {{can keep}} an eye on these baskets. If any of the beasts makes an {{alarming}} noise, send to my room, the second, forward, port side. Look me up <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Montreal." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} scene of the film, the daughters of an alien, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Godzilla come to attend but Shaggy, Scooby and Scrappy drive off <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll need it all <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Pine.... Now, I'll ride up on {{top with}} the boys an' eat my supper. It'll be dark, presently, an' we'll stop often to listen. But don't be scared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hannah!" [...] {{said her}} mother, {{speaking}} in a stern and reproachful tone; [...] "what do you keep running about so for all the time, Hannah? You'll get tired out <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village, and then you'll be teasing me to let you stop and rest. Come and walk along quietly with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must {{go at the}} double, too, Bull," [...] Terence said, [...] "or {{they will}} be up long <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hills. We are not halfway yet. Keep the men well in hand, and don't let them fall into confusion. If they do, the cavalry will be down upon us in a minute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can light our lamps again safely now," [...] Bill Haden said. [...] "We shall {{want our}} tools, lads, and the powder; {{there may be}} some heavy falls in our way, and we may have hard work yet <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shaft, but the roof rock is strong, so I believe we shall win our way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{can keep}} an eye on these baskets. If any of the beasts inside them makes an {{alarming}} noise, send to my room; the second, forward, port side. Look me up <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Montreal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir--I {{never saw}} such a place. There's no getting {{anything}} done. I think your honor had better {{step into the}} house and <b>get</b> something <b>to</b> eat; {{it will be a long}} while <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Fundy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is a}} comfort. It was {{bad enough}} for that short distance. It would be {{something}} awful if {{it had to be}} kept up for a fortnight. How long shall <b>we</b> be <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Irkoutsk?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the sort}} of beast to have," [...] exclaimed Uncle Beamish, {{spluttering}} as the snow blew in his mouth. [...] "He is gettin' his spirits up just when they are most wanted. We must have passed Crocker's a good while ago, and it can't be long <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pike. And it's time we was there, for it's darkenin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a {{good deal}} better today, Desmond, {{but there is no}} hurry, and we will take matters quietly. If you {{continue}} to make improvement we shall be able, in another day or two, to travel faster; and I hope that, <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> end of our journey, you will be strong enough to sit your horse for a few miles each day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should think}} we had better leave the road <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village, {{so as to be}} well away from it. If any peasant were going to work early and caught sight of us he would be sure to mention it to any {{horseman}} who might come along searching for us. I noticed that there were several woods on our right as we rode along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “They {{must know}} that the frigate can’t see them,” the {{lieutenant}} said, “but they have no doubt {{come to the conclusion}} that they cannot overtake us <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> her. Anyhow it is certain that they have given it up as a bad job.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Basil, be honest; fibbing isn't your forte: I {{wonder you}} went into the {{insurance}} business; {{you ought to have}} been a lawyer. Go because you like eating, and are hungry, perhaps, or think you may be so <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> New York.|$|R
6000|$|They {{continued}} both {{to stare}} at her, helpless for what ever different reasons to take their eyes away, and they were still interested in her when they heard her asking the conductor, [...] "Must I change and take another train <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Belford? My friends thought--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will turn}} off <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next road. They {{can see a}} long way across these level plains; so we will {{dismount}} and lead our horses. The corn is well nigh shoulder deep, and if we choose a spot where the ground lies rather low, neither that scoundrel behind nor {{the one at the}} next road is likely to see us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--yes; in {{one sense}} I had; but you don't {{understand}} about business. You had better not interrupt me now as I have got a good deal to say <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Square. It will suit me {{to give up the}} rooms. I don't like them, and they are very dear. As you yourself said, it will be a capital thing for us to go and stay with your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Parkman, [...] "we {{can take}} a Hansom cab, and drive down through the streets, or we can {{walk down to the}} river side, and there take a boat. The boats are a great deal the cheapest, and the most amusing; but the cab will be the most easy and comfortable, and the most genteel. We shall have to walk nearly half a mile <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> landing of the boats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What an idea!' said Niels, who {{was growing}} {{impatient}} at the slow progress they were making. 'We can't travel by {{day for the}} heat, and we remain where we are all night. It will be long enough <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Rome if <b>we</b> go on at this rate.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We stop long <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Winnipeg," [...] he said soothingly. [...] "Then it's {{possible}} we'll be {{held up by}} a blocked track. Wash-outs {{are pretty}} numerous on this piece of line. However, if we do stop and you get down, you'll {{be left in the}} woods." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You be quiet, young gentlemen. If you can't 'elp--don't 'inder." [...] Foxy's eye {{was still}} on the council by the horse. Carter, White, and Tyrrell, all boys of influence, had joined it. The rest fingered the rifles irresolutely. [...] "Wait a shake," [...] cried Stalky. [...] "Can't we turn out those rotters <b>before</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> work?" ...|$|R
