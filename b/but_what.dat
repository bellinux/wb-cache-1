5|$|Hugh's {{register}} of ordinations still survives, {{and is in}} the Lincoln cathedral archives. Parts of this were published by Alfred Gibbons in 1888, and others in 1904 by the Canterbury and York Society.

Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E
5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of that meeting are vague, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> is clear was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to pursue an alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match of the Day. In February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over lunch to go over his expectations, {{with the idea of}} a Premier League dedicated channel high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|E

5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and somehow I kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Isidore H. Heller and his family, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> is known has been {{compiled}} through personal interviews as well as census and county records. Heller was born in Austria in 1847, and his wife, Ida, was born in Wisconsin in 1857. In America, Heller worked at Wolf, Sayer, and Heller: Packers and Butcher’s Supplies, which was located on Fulton Street, Chicago, on the northwest side of the city. Heller and Ida were later married and had three children, including Walter Heller, a Chicago investment banker.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{agree that}} Philip campaigned in Thrace in 353 BC, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> exactly he {{achieved}} {{is a matter}} of some confusion. As has been discussed, some, including Cawkwell and Sealey, place the Maroneia and Abdera campaign in 353 BC. Others suggest that, in a campaign whose details are essentially unknown, Philip defeated the central Thracian king, Amadokos, reducing him to the status of subject ally. Since the Maroneia and Abdera campaign took place in Amadokos's territory, it seems likely that, under either chronology, Philip campaigned against Amadokos in 353 BC.|$|E
5|$|Politically, the Belgians did {{not trust}} the French. Marshal Philippe Pétain had {{suggested}} a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using Belgium as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. Belgium feared it would be drawn into a war regardless, and sought to avoid that eventuality. The Belgians also feared being drawn into a war {{as a result of}} the French–Soviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian agreement stipulated Belgium was to mobilise if the Germans did, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> was not clear was whether Belgium would have to mobilise in the event of a German invasion of Poland.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books that interested him was Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What Is to Be Done?, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and family ties in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself.

As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
