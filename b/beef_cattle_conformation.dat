One conclu-sion reached in that study was that beef producers must lower their costs of beef production to prevent further loss of market share to competing meats.

The research examined the current status of the beef chain and the interventions for establishing smallholder farmers association. Survey questionnaires were administered to sixty smallholder <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> farmers in two Sub Counties (30 farmers per Sub County). Ten <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> traders and the district cooperative officer were interviewed to get additional information for the research.

Using a multi-market, multi-commodity partial equilibrium economic model of the US agricultural industry, we evaluate the market impacts of reduced BRD to producers from various livestock, meat, and feedstuffs industries. We find that as morbidity and mortality is reduced, <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> producers experience losses due to increased supplies (lower <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> prices) and increased demand for feedstuff (higher feedstuff prices). <b>Beef</b> <b>cattle</b> processors see gains {{as the price of}} <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> is lower, whereas feedstuff producers gain from higher feedstuff prices.

Data were analysed descriptively. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the factors that affect the contribution of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> to income in the study area. It was found that <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> farming in the communal areas studied were practiced equally by women (50 %) and men (50 %). Over 50. 5 % of respondents were over 51 years old and 9. 5 % of youth participated in <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> farming. The literacy rate among respondents in the study area was 55 %, including Grade 11 or below, Grade 12 and post matric education. Approximately 48 % of the respondents relied on pension income, while 28. 5 % reported that the main source of income in their households came from a combination of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> production and pension. 60. 5 % of the respondents were found to have more than 20 years of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> farming experience, while 36. 5 % have between one and twelve years’ experience. The majority of the respondents (80 %) grazed their cattle on the mountainside, 14. 5 % said they used communal grazing and 5. 5 % grazed their animals in their backyard. It was also found that 50 % of respondents maintained up to ten head of cattle and the other 50 % had more than ten cattle in their herds. Of the households that sold their <b>beef</b> <b>cattle,</b> 77 % earned R 10, 000 or less per annum while 23 % earned between R 11, 000 and R 60, 000 per annum. <b>Beef</b> <b>cattle</b> farming were therefore found to constitute 19 % of household income in the communal areas in Chief Albert Luthuli Municipality. The independent variables which collectively have a statistically significant influence on the income from <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> production at 5 % level of significance were: number of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> (t = 16. 8, P < 0. 000) and age at mortality (t = - 2. 59, P< 0. 010). The number of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> has a positive and statistically significant effect and mortality age a negative effect. It was concluded that the 19 % contribution to household income coming from <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> farming in the study area was to be expected in light of the fact more than half (50. 5 %) of the respondents were older than 51 years old and 48 % of respondents relied on pensions as a source of income. The danger is that because <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> farming in the study area have been marginalised as an agricultural activity, the rural poor are decreasingly engaging in <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> production as a source of income.

40|$|The aims of {{research}} were to investigate {{direct and indirect}} effect of farmland potency on <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> development in Blora regency with path analysis. Data about farmland potency, feed from {{inside and outside of}} agriculture system, human resources during, feed pattern and <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> development had been taken by survey method since March-June 2007. Ninety respondents of farmers had been taken with multistage sampling technique. Data was analyzed by decomposition of correlation and normal standardized equation to find the path coefficient. Result of the research showed that the total effect of farmland potency was 0. 5809 on <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> devel-opment. The indirect effect of farmland potency (0. 3159) was higher than its direct effect (0. 2650). Based on farmland potency, <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> development in Blora regency can be done through simultaneously increas-ing of the farmland potency, feed inside agriculture system, human resources and feed pattern, without feed from outside of agriculture system.

Development of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> in Indonesia {{should be}} carried out through {{sustainable}} production system approach especially under smallholders in the village areas. The information of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> productivity level under current production system {{is very important for}} the basis data in relation to the development strategic program. The purpose of current study was to find out the productivity of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> production under group of farmer at the village areas. Survey method at 34 farmer groups of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> located at Cilacap, Banyumas, Purbalingga, Banjarnegara and Kebumen regencies of Central Java was implemented. The beef catle productivity in terms of cow-calf operation and fattening were recorded. Data analysis by qualitative and quantitative descriptive statistics. This study found that Ongole Cross, Sumba Ongole Cross, Simental Cross and Charolois Cross were raised for fattening and Brahman Cross for cow-calf operation. The performance of <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> of fattening purposes was moderate condition. Body Condition Score (BCS) ranged from 4 to 6 (scale 1 - 9) with the modus 4 (for Ongole Cross, Sumba Ongole Cross) and 5 (for Simental Cross and Charolois Cross). The productivity of cow-calf operation was very low with the reproductive rate and preweaning calf mortality were 6 and 25 percent, respectively. Good Farming Practice with attention on selection of breeds and strengthens feeding aspects could be taking into account in order to improve <b>beef</b> <b>cattle</b> productivity under group of farmer at the village areas...|$|R
