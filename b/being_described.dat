50|$|According to Umm al-Qura University {{professor}} Abdul Aziz al-Harbi, Harut and Marut {{were merely}} human <b>beings</b> <b>described</b> with qualities often attributed to angels, {{rather than being}} actual angels, a belief which originates with `Abd Allah ibn `Abbas, one of Muhammad's companions.|$|R

5|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known herbals were {{produced}} in Europe between 1470 and 1670. The invention in Germany of {{printing from movable type}} in a printing press c. 1440 was a great stimulus to herbalism. The new herbals were more detailed with greater general appeal and often with Gothic script and the addition of woodcut illustrations that more closely resembled the plants <b>being</b> <b>described.</b>|$|E
5|$|Scotties, while <b>being</b> <b>{{described}}</b> as very loving, {{have also}} been described as stubborn. They are sometimes described as an aloof breed, {{although it has been}} noted that they tend to be very loyal to their family and are known to attach themselves to one or two people.|$|E

5000|$|The living creatures, living beings, or Hayyoth (Hebrew חַיּוֹת chayot, from חַיּ chai, [...] "live") are a {{class of}} heavenly <b>beings</b> <b>described</b> in Ezekiel's vision of the heavenly chariot {{in the first and}} tenth {{chapters}} of the Book of Ezekiel. References to the creatures recur in texts of Second Temple Judaism, in rabbinical merkabah ("chariot") literature, and in the Book of Daniel, and also in the Book of Revelation.|$|R
5|$|Sorabji's isolation, and {{sometimes}} the resulting lack of interaction with the music world, have {{been the target of}} criticism even by his admirers.

5|$|Wil Ohl K'inich, {{the eighth}} ruler, is another king known {{only by his}} {{appearance}} on AltarQ. He was succeeded by Ruler9 in AD551, his accession <b>being</b> <b>described</b> on the Hieroglyphic Stairway. He is also depicted on AltarQ even though he ruled for less than two years.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} ants {{have been named}} after Clark. The holotype of Polyrhachis clarki was {{originally}} collected by Clark, {{but it was not}} described until 2013. There, the author of the article named the ant after him. Leptogenys clarki is another ant named after Clark for his contributions towards Australian ants, <b>being</b> <b>described</b> by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler in 1933. Ants he collected that bear his name include Dolichoderus clarki, Plagiolepis clarki and Stigmacros clarki.|$|E
50|$|Like the original, {{the themes}} of love, mutual understanding, and {{individual}} growth {{play an important role}} in the story, albeit in different ways. For example, a prohibition on romance is enacted on the members of Neo-DEAVA for the duration of the series. The main characters are again reincarnations of the legendary <b>beings</b> <b>described</b> in Aquarion, and much of the latter half of the series works to establish connections with the series' predecessor.|$|R
5000|$|Young <b>described</b> <b>being</b> {{held in a}} {{communal}} cell, with fifteen other men, during his pre-trial detention. [...] He <b>described</b> <b>being</b> held with Taliban and al Qaeda suspects, and had been called upon to fight for his life with fellow prisoners.|$|R
50|$|The classic Indian epics, {{such as the}} Mahabharata and the Ramayana, and the Puranas, {{refer to}} diverse kinds of <b>beings,</b> <b>describing</b> them as superhuman or subhuman and other worldly extraterrestrials came to inhabit the living world. Many of these tribes have a strong {{historical}} basis, while the supernatural and fantastic aspects are considered literary speculation. These groups include Gandharva, Yaksha, Kinnara, Kimpurusha, Rakshasa, Naga, Suparna, Vanara, Vidyadhara, Valakhilyas, Pisacha, Rudra, Aditya, Danava, Marut, Nivatakavacha, Daitya, Kalakeyas and Vasus.|$|R
5|$|Between 950,000–1,000,000 of all {{described}} {{species are}} insects, so over 50% of all described eukaryotes (1.8 million) are insects (see illustration). With only 950,000 known non-insects, if {{the actual number}} of insects is 5.5 million, they may represent over 80% of the total, and with only about 20,000 new species of all organisms <b>being</b> <b>described</b> each year, most insect species likely will remain undescribed, unless species descriptions greatly increase in rate. Of the 24 orders of insects, four dominate in terms of numbers of described species, with at least 670,000 species included in Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosed with a {{brain tumor}} in March 2017, Noriega {{suffered}} complications during surgery, and died two months later. Generally described as a military dictatorship, Noriega's rule in Panama was marked by repression of the media, {{an expansion of the}} military, and the persecution of political opponents, effectively controlling the outcomes of any elections. He was known for his complicated relationship with the U.S., <b>being</b> <b>described</b> as being its ally and nemesis at the same time. He has been called one of the best-known dictators of his time, and compared to authoritarian rulers such as Muammar Gaddafi and Augusto Pinochet.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{win over}} Clemson, Tech faced {{traditional}} rival Virginia {{in the annual}} battle for the Commonwealth Cup. Despite the rivalry {{and the fact that}} Virginia was ranked the No.24 team in the country, the Cavaliers put up even less of a struggle than Clemson. Virginia Tech won, 317. Now No.5 in the country, Tech began to distance itself from other highly ranked teams with consecutive wins over Rutgers and Syracuse. The 620 shutout of No.16 Syracuse was the largest victory ever recorded against a team ranked in the AP Poll. By this time, the Hokies were <b>being</b> <b>described</b> in media reports as a national championship contender.|$|E
50|$|James Renner's science fiction/mystery novel The Man From Primrose Lane {{features}} a fictionalized {{version of the}} Loveland frog. In the novel, which is set in Renner's home state of Ohio, the <b>beings</b> <b>described</b> as a frogs are in fact humans who have traveled backwards in time. Their amphibian appearance is due to being covered in a layer of feces and other human waste during years of hibernation, which also accounts for their unusual, shuffling gait due to muscle atrophy.|$|R

5|$|Millepora alcicornis {{is not a}} true coral {{in class}} Anthozoa but is in class Hydrozoa, and is {{more closely related to}} {{jellyfish}} than stony corals. Because of the variability in growth habit that this coral exhibits, it {{has been the subject of}} much confusion as to its taxonomy, <b>being</b> <b>described</b> under a number of different names from different localities. In 1898, Hickson decided that the variations in morphology were due to environmental factors and that Millepora alcicornis was the valid name for all these species. This conclusion has since been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Poulton was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of Darwin, {{through a period}} {{when there was no}} adequate theory of heredity and both natural selection and sexual selection had become unpopular among scientists, and was attacked for his support both in The Colours of Animals and outside it. And he is recognised as the first scientist to identify frequency-dependent selection, as described in this book. By 1919, the book was <b>being</b> <b>described</b> in Nature as a classic work.|$|E
5|$|The first aetosaurs from North America {{were also}} <b>being</b> <b>described</b> at this time. American {{paleontologist}} Edward Drinker Cope named Typothorax in 1875 and Episcoposaurus in 1877, {{both of which}} were from New Mexico. However, Cope considered these genera to be phytosaurs, crocodile-like aquatic archosaurs that were also common in the Late Triassic. While new material referable to Typothorax has been found in recent years throughout the American southwest, Episcoposaurus is no longer considered valid. Cope, along with later paleontologists such as Friedrich von Huene, recognized that remains of the type species E. horridus actually belonged to Typothorax. Another species, E. haplocerus, was reassigned to Desmatosuchus in 1953.|$|E

40|$|Not {{too long}} ago, trolls only existed in {{folklore}} as supernatural <b>beings</b> <b>described</b> as grotesque and ill-mannered and often dwelling under bridges in fairy tales. However, trolls {{are no longer}} a creature of myth that is scarcely seen or heard from; instead, they have abandoned bridges for a new home – the Internet. This talk will introduce the audience to the Internet Troll – a subculture of the Internet that is “turning the web into a cesspool of aggression and violence” (Stein, 2016) ...|$|R
5000|$|Lucifer himself, {{his whole}} {{identity}} having been forged by that same motive, scoffs at his Father's final offer: to merge their <b>beings</b> (<b>described</b> by God as a potlatch) {{so that they}} can finally understand one another's perspective. As this would be the final expression of God's will (even when delivered from [...] "outside the plan", as he puts it), Lucifer finds the ultimate expression of his own defiant will by refusing the bargain and travelling beyond his Father's influence, into the undefined void.|$|R
5|$|Vocal Studies + Uprock Narrativess {{music is}} {{primarily}} instrumental and features unintelligible cut-up vocals. Originally inspired {{to sample the}} hip hop artists he was signed to work with in the studio, the album consists of samples by more popular hip hop artists including Nas, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Erykah Badu. Despite <b>being</b> <b>described</b> as electronic music, IDM and glitch and {{not the kind of}} music a hip hop audience is used to hearing, Herren felt that his music was closer to hip hop.|$|E
5|$|Both {{free and}} paid DLC was {{announced}} as being planned {{as early as}} April 2016, with paid DLC <b>being</b> <b>described</b> as a necessity due to production costs. Plans for DLC content were finalized by June of that year, with a small team working on it while the main game was completed. The main aim was to make players feel they had made a good purchase. Full production began after the main game was completed. The DLC development was handled by Haruyoshi Sawatari, who took over as producer when Tabata saw the game would not make its projected September 30 release date; Tabata continued to focus on polishing the main game, while Sawatari created the DLC {{with a group of}} core developers, although Tabata continued to oversee their production. While having story-based DLC focused on each character seemed to undermine the main appeal of the story, Sawatari noted that the breaks gave characters a chance to grow as individuals before returning to and strengthening the group. Square Enix stressed when the details were announced that the DLC was not content cut from the game itself, but original content to add new experiences for players.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there has}} been {{controversy}} over the names used at various times, with names being dropped for religious and political reasons. Female names were exclusively used in the basins at various times between 1945 and 2000, and were the subject of several protests. At present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven meteorological services and retain their names throughout their lifetimes. Due to the potential for longevity and multiple concurrent storms, the names reduce the confusion about what storm is <b>being</b> <b>described</b> in forecasts, watches and warnings. Names are assigned in order from predetermined lists once storms have one, three, or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than , depending on which basin it originates in. Standards vary from basin to basin, with some tropical depressions named in the Western Pacific, while {{a significant amount of}} gale-force winds are required in the Southern Hemisphere. The names of significant tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Australian region are retired from the naming lists and replaced with another name, at meetings of the World Meteorological Organization's various tropical cyclone committees.|$|E
