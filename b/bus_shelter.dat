5|$|An Amshack (a small {{aluminum}} and Plexiglas <b>bus</b> <b>shelter)</b> with a bare asphalt platform {{was built in}} downtown Pittsfield near the former Union Station. The 'station' opened on April 26, 1981. The 1965-built station was converted to a yard office, used by Conrail and later CSX Transportation for their adjacent Pittsfield Yard.|$|E
5|$|The Portal Building's main {{entrance}} is on Surf Avenue past the station's south end. From this entrance, {{there is a}} police precinct (Transit District 34 of the New York City Police Department), retail space, and the station's fare control area. There is also another entrance/exit to the <b>bus</b> <b>shelter</b> on Mermaid Avenue. The retail space and the new station entrance were built during the 2001–2005 renovation. There is also a side entrance from Stillwell Avenue itself.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{piece of}} public art, an {{advertising}} sign, a retail kiosk selling newspapers and hot food, as well as a <b>bus</b> <b>shelter.</b> It has been criticised by local residents who liken it to a carrot or a space ship, although it is meant to symbolise man's harmony with the sea. This was part of North Somerset Council's ongoing civic pride initiative that has sought to revitalise Weston-super-Mare's public spaces, which had suffered a period of decline. Other public space improvements have been made throughout the town such as improvements to the street scene in Grove Park Village.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Bus</b> <b>shelters</b> are semi-outdoor spaces with shelter {{provided}} {{in the form of}} a roof. The thermal comfort of <b>bus</b> <b>shelters</b> is as important as that of buses themselves in improving the quality of the experience of bus travel. This work conducted field experiments involving five <b>bus</b> <b>shelters</b> combined with numerical simulations using the RayMan model. The analytical results show that <b>bus</b> <b>shelters</b> that provide more shelter help reduce passenger exposure to direct solar radiation and provide comfortable spaces in which to shelter from the weather in Taiwan. Designers should also consider local sunlight patterns and simulate the sun duration for whole year in advance to create comfortable <b>bus</b> <b>shelters...</b>|$|R

5|$|On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian {{gets out}} of the car. A police officer gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another {{argument}} ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the <b>bus</b> <b>shelter.</b> Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be mischievous and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken hobo and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.|$|E

25|$|Several Acehnese architects have {{attempted}} to modernize the traditional architecture of Aceh. One attempt is to replicate the roof canopy of the Cakra Donya bell (an ancient relic in Aceh) into the auditorium of the State Museum of Aceh. This reinterpretation of the Cakra Donya roof was completed by Wim Sutrisno, a local architect. The Cakra Donya roof style has become popular in Aceh {{and can be found}} decorating the gates to hotels or <b>bus</b> <b>shelter</b> roofs. The gable roof has also been reinterpreted in many buildings, often with double gable screens, complete with a protruding wooden screen.|$|E
25|$|Having {{broken through}} the barrier, the truck, driving in a zigzag fashion, knocked down random {{members of the}} crowd milling about on the {{pavement}} and in the three traffic lanes on the seaward side of the Promenade. The driver tried {{to stay on the}} pavement—returning to the traffic lanes only when blocked by a <b>bus</b> <b>shelter</b> or pavilion—thus increasing the number of deaths. After reaching the Hotel Negresco, the progress of the truck, already travelling more slowly, was further slowed down by a passing cyclist, whose attempts to open the cabin door were abandoned after being threatened with a gun through the window; followed by a motorcyclist, in pursuit from the Centre Universitaire Méditerranéen, who threw his scooter under the front wheels of the truck at the intersection with rue Meyerbeer, striking blows at the driver from the running board before being struck with the butt of the driver's gun, suffering moderate injuries from falling off the truck's side. The driver fired several shots at police from his 7.65mm firearm, close to the Hotel Negresco, as police arrived; they returned fire with their 9mm Sig Sauer handguns, gave chase to the vehicle and attempted to disable it.|$|E

25|$|Work on {{the glass}} panels also proceeded. The DVLMF hired Cloud Gehshan Associates {{to assist with the}} {{selection}} of quotations for the panels. Research into the speeches and writings of famous disabled veterans was made, and hundreds of interviews with disabled veterans conducted. More than 700 quotations were gathered, but just 18 of them—representing a wide diversity of voices spread through time—were used. Initially, a New York-based firm was hired to fabricate the glass panels, but this company backed out of the project. Savoy Studios, a glass manufacturing firm located in Portland, Oregon, was then hired to inscribe and fabricate the panels. Individual sheets of glass were purchased from PPG Industries. Savoy Studios used a computer-controlled water jet cutter to carve the text into them. Moon Shadow Glass, a decorative glass fabricator (known for sandblasting artwork onto vandalized <b>bus</b> <b>shelter</b> glass for the TriMet bus system in Portland) used fine-art abrasive blasting to etch the photo-realistic images into the glass. Savoy Studios then used GlassLam, a liquid polymer trademarked by the GlassLam company of Pompano Beach, Florida, to laminate the glass sheets together into a panel. The laminate not only cemented the sheets together, but also filled in any empty spaces between the sheet. Savoy Studios then used a computer-controlled water jet to cut the panels to their final size.|$|E
500|$|Medstead's {{railway station}} was first opened in August 1868 and was renamed to Medstead and Four Marks railway station on 1 October 1937. Having closed in 1973, {{the station was}} {{restored}} and re-opened in May 1983, following the reopening of the associated Watercress Line from New Alresford to Ropley having re-opened six years earlier in 1977; the decision was taken by Mid Hants Railway to restore the entire railway {{so that it could}} run its course to the town of Alton. Around [...] of second hand track panels were purchased from Eastleigh for the Medstead and Four Marks section. The surviving buildings at the railway station were dilapidated, with one writer from a magazine suggesting they be demolished and replaced by a <b>bus</b> <b>shelter.</b> As the track was relaid at the station, a replacement wooden signal box was obtained from Wilton and placed into position near the track.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, the {{pedestrian}} area surrounding the large stone drinking fountain monument (1874) at {{the centre of}} the village was re-modelled, and given the name 'Fountain Square'. New granite paving, brick planters and trees were introduced in a design which created a haven from traffic and a new focal point for community events. [...] During the refurbishments the old [...] "threepenny bit" [...] <b>bus</b> <b>shelter</b> was moved to Snoxhall behind the leisure centre. [...] The old [...] "threepenny bit" [...] <b>bus</b> <b>shelter</b> had been a popular shelter for the youths of Cranleigh to drink and smoke in. [...] The shelter stood in its new location for only a few weeks before it was vandalised and completely pulled to the ground. The main financial sponsors of this refurbishment were Surrey County Council (SCC) and the South East England Development Agency (SEEDA), and the design was undertaken in-house by SCC.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} shot in Roy Andersson's own studio in Östermalm, Stockholm. The filming of the scenes took three years to finish. [...] "It is not the {{shooting}} itself that takes time, but the work on creating the environments. We built almost all the sets in the studio, even those that took place outdoors. Most {{of the time we}} started from Roy's sketches," [...] said Johan Carlsson, production manager. There is one single scene that wasn't shot in studio, featuring a <b>bus</b> <b>shelter</b> in heavy rain. It had to be shot outdoors because of the huge amount of running water. Nothing in the film was made with computer-generated imagery. The city seen from above in the final shot was a large model built solely for that scene.|$|E

40|$|Wildlife {{residing}} in urban landscapes face many human-related threats to their survival. For birds, collision with glass on manmade structures {{has been identified}} as a major hazard, causing hundreds of millions of avian fatalities in North America every year. Although research has investigated factors associated with bird-glass collision mortality at buildings, no prior studies have focused on bird fatalities at glass-walled <b>bus</b> <b>shelters.</b> Our objectives in this study were to describe the magnitude of bird-bus shelter collisions in the city of Stillwater, Oklahoma and assess potential predictors of collision risk, including characteristics of shelters (glass area) and surrounding land cover (e. g., vegetative features). We surveyed for bird carcasses and indirect collision evidence at 18 <b>bus</b> <b>shelters</b> over a five-month period. Linear regression and model selection results revealed that the amount of glass on shelters and the area of lawn within 50 m of shelters were both positively related to fatal bird collisions; glass area was also positively associated with observations of collision evidence on glass surfaces. After accounting for scavenger removal of carcasses, we estimate that a minimum of 34 birds are killed each year between May and September by collision with the 36 <b>bus</b> <b>shelters</b> in the city of Stillwater. While our study provides an initial look at bird fatalities at <b>bus</b> <b>shelters,</b> additional research is needed to generate a large-scale estimate of collision mortality and to assess species composition of fatalities at a national scale. Designing new <b>bus</b> <b>shelters</b> to include less glass and retrofitting existing shelters to increase visibility of glass to birds will likely reduce fatal bird collisions at <b>bus</b> <b>shelters</b> and thus reduce the cumulative magnitude of anthropogenic impacts to birds in cities...|$|R
