40|$|When a {{submerged}} bubble {{is initially}} at {{rest in a}} stagnant low viscosity liquid such as water, buoyancy forces accelerate the bubble upwards. The increasing relative velocity of the bubble with the surrounding liquid provokes deformations on the bubble shape that affect its vertical acceleration and also induce surface tension driven oscillations. Our theoretical model, which is compared with full Navier–Stokes simulations predicts, with a reasonable accuracy, both {{the position of the}} <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> of mass, as well as the time varying bubble shape under those conditions for which the Reynolds number is large, the amplitude of the deformation is small, the bubble interface is free of surfactants and the bubble rises following a straight vertical path.

40|$|In {{waste water}} treatment, {{biological}} processes for denitrification and nitrification are performed using oxidation ditches. In these reactors, the mixing and the aeration functions are dissociated: a bubble cloud is generated from flexible membrane spargers and {{is subjected to}} a horizontal liquid flow. The objective {{of this paper is}} to study the effects of the liquid crossflow on the bubble formation at a single flexible orifice in water. The several forces acting on the forming bubble have been modelled in order to understand the dynamics of the bubble growth and detachment. The bubble detachment is controlled by the drag force due to the liquid motion and not by the buoyancy force. The experimental analysis of the bubble growth has shown that, under liquid cross-flow conditions, the bubbles move downstream and are flattened during their growth (position of the <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> of gravity, bubble inclination angle). The bubbles spread over the orifice surface, and the advancing and the receding bubble angles were measured. The detached bubbles have significantly smaller sizes and higher frequencies when compared to bubble formation under quiescent liquid conditions...|$|E

Experimental conditions {{have been created}} such {{that most of the}} forces can be assessed from measured bubble shapes. Two force balances are analyzed, one an extension of the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and the other governs motion of the <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> away from the plane, hot wall. More than two governing equations can be analyzed in case the bubble deforms severely. Each of these equations yields an estimate of the histories of the unknown pressure drop between bubble content and the liquid at the wall, zip. This zip is unknown since it results of heat transfer which is not directly measured. Differences between the zip’s of the two governing equations analyzed are typically less than 10 to 30 %. It is shown that only a small deformation near the bubble foot suffices to compensate fluctuations in gravity, as with g-jitter, or to overcome inertia. Inertia is contributing both in microgravity and in case the bubble deforms strongly at terrestrial gravity. For the latter case, the Jacob and bubble Reynolds numbers need to be high and experiments have been designed to achieve this...|$|E

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} {{simulations of}} t hermal Marangoni convection about two bubbles situated on a heated wall {{immersed in a}} liquid silicone oil layer have been performed to gain {{some insight into the}} thermal and flow interactions between them. The distance between the two <b>bubbles</b> ? <b>centres</b> was varied between three and twenty five bubble radii to analyse the influence of the inter - bubble spacing on the fl ow and temperature fields and the impact upon local wall heat transfer. For zero gravity conditions, it was determined that the local wall heat flux was greatest for the smallest separation of thre e bubble radii, but that the increase in heat transfer over the whole domain was greatest for a s eparation of ten bubble radii. When the effects of gravity were included in the model, the behaviour was observed to change between the cases. At large separations between the bubbles, increasing the gravity level was found to decrease the local wall heat flux, which was consistent with two - dimensional work. At small separations however, the increase in gravity led to an increase in the local wall heat flux, which was caused by a buoyancy - driven flow formed by the inter action of secondary vortice...|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} flow {{around two}} spherical bubbles {{moving in a}} viscous fluid is studied numerically by solving the full Navier-Stokes equations. The study considers the interaction between two bubbles for moderate Reynolds numbers (50 ≤ Re ≤ 500, Re being based on the bubble diameter) and for positions described by the separation S (2. 5 ≤ S ≤ 10, S being {{the distance between the}} <b>bubble</b> <b>centres</b> normalized by the bubble radius) and the angle θ (0 o ≤ θ ≤ 90 o) formed between the line of centre and the direction perpendicular to the direction of the motion. We provide a general description of the interaction extending the results obtained for two bubbles moving side by side (θ = 0 o) by Legendre, Magnaudet & Mougin 2003 (J. Fluid Mech., 497, 133 - 166) and for two bubbles moving in line (θ = 90 o) by Yuan & Prosperetti 1994 (J. Fluid Mech., 278, 325 - 349). Simple models based on physical arguments are given for the drag and lift forces experienced by each bubble. The interaction is the combination of three effects: a potential effect, a viscous correction (Moore correction) and a significant wake effect observed on both the drag and the transverse force of the second bubble when located {{in the wake of the}} first one. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the waste}} water {{treatment}} industry, a novel gas sparger based on flexible membranes {{has been used for}} the last ten years. The objective of the present work is to study the bubble formation generated from a flexible orifice (membrane). Firstly, the membranes are characterised with regard to their properties: wetting critical surface tension, expanding hole diameter, orifice coefficients, flexibility, critical and elastic pressures. The bubble formation phenomenon in an inviscid liquid at rest is studied experimentally for different membranes and gas flow rates. The variation in the bubble diameter, the <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> of gravity and the bubble spread on the membrane are determined as a function of time. An analytic model is proposed to describe the bubble growth and its detachment at a flexible orifice. This theoretical approach, developed by Teresaka & Tsuge (1990) for rigid orifices, is adapted {{to take into account the}} membrane features (elastic behaviour and wettability). The predicted bubble diameters at detachment agree with the experimental measurements; however, the model underestimates slightly the bubble formation times. The calculation of the various forces acting on the bubble in the vertical direction indicates that the real forces governing the bubble growth are the buoyancy force, the surface tension force, and near detachment the inertial force...|$|E
40|$|The {{previously}} developed {{dynamic theory}} {{of growth and}} detachment of vapour bubbles under conditions of nucleate pool boiling is applied to study motion and deformation of a bubble evolving at a single nucleation site. The bubble growth is presumed to be thermally controlled, and two components of heat transfer to the bubble are accounted of: the one from the bulk of surrounding liquid and the one due to heat conduction across a liquid microlayer formed underneath the bubble. Bubble evolution is governed by the buoyancy and an effective surface tension force, both the forces making the <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> of mass {{move away from the}} wall and, thus, assisting its detachment. Buoyancy-controlled and surface-tension-controlled regimes are considered separately in a meticulous way. The duration of the whole process of bubble evolution till detachment, the rate of growth, and the bubble departure size are found as functions of time and physical and operating parameters. Some repeatedly observed phenomena, such as an influence of gravity on the growth rate, are explained. Inferences of the model agree qualitatively with available experimental evidence, and conclusions pertaining to the dependence on gravity of the bubble radius at detachment and the whole time of the bubble development when being attached to the wall are confirmed quantitatively...|$|E
40|$|Bubbles in ice cores store various {{information}} about climate conditions during densification and pore close-off in former times. Very recently {{it was shown}} that bubbles can additionally be used as marker for cumulated strain within the ice. Bubble studies on the Renland ice core are from particular interest: the Renland ice core includes the oldest bubbly ice retrieved so far in ice core drilling projects and it contains bubbly ice that has been exposed to tremendous deformation and thinning. The Renland ice core of 584 m length was drilled through the ice cap during May-June 2015 {{in the framework of}} RECAP (Renland ice cap drilling project). The ice shows no clathrate formation. Preliminary considerations suggest Holocene and Glacial ice with Eemian ice close to bedrock. Core sections of the Renland ice core from selected depth intervals are measured with the means of X-ray computer tomography using the core-scale AWI-ICE CT. The measurements are performed with a spatial resolution of 15 µm and provide 3 d- bubble arrangements. Different bubble shape factors, bubble volume (porosity), <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> distributions and bubble next neighbor functions are derived.

Evidently, the bubbles did not enter the boundary layer at the channel wall and a plug liquid flow assumption was acceptable in our experimental equipment. This confirmed that the experiment was appropriate for simulation of bubble rises in a quiescent liquid column. Recent data obtained by a high-speed camera permitted recording {{over a period of}} 60 s. Image analysis by a tailor-made program provided a time-series of quantities related to the position, size, and shape of bubbles. In addition to determination of the aspect ratio of the equivalent oblate ellipsoid, deviation from this shape was investigated in respect of the difference between the <b>bubble’s</b> <b>centre</b> of mass and the geometrical <b>centre</b> of <b>bubble</b> projection. Autocorrelation of the data indicated that the bubble inclination oscillated harmonically with a frequency of 5 – 10 Hz; cross correlation showed that the horizontal shift of the centre of mass, as well as the horizontal velocity, increased with increasing bubble inclination, and the vertical shift of the centre of mass increased with an increases in the absolute value of the bubble inclination. There is no significant phase shift in the oscillation of these quantities. The bulky bottom side of the bubbles is in accordance with the model of bubble oscillation induced by instability of the equilibrium of gravity and surface tension forces. The oscillation frequency dependence on surface forces (Eötvös number) is evident, while viscosity does not {{play a significant role in}} low-viscosity liquids. Therefore, vortex-shedding is more likely to be an effect of the oscillation and not its cause. Web of Science 681797...|$|R

Standard decomposition techniques for broad-band imaging are extended to integral field data in order to deblend the QSO and host emission. We perform a tentative analysis of the stellar continuum finding a young stellar population (< 100 Myr) or a featureless continuum embedded in an old stellar population (10 Gyr) typical for a massive elliptical galaxy. The stellar velocity dispersion of sigma_*= 320 ± 90 km/s and the estimated black hole mass log(M_BH/M_sun) = 8. 7 ± 0. 3 {{are consistent with the}} local M_BH-sigma_* relation within the errors. For the first time we map the two-dimensional ionised gas distribution and the gas velocity field around HE 1029 - 1401. While the stellar host morphology is purely elliptical we find a highly structured distribution of ionised gas out to 16 kpc from the QSO. The gas is highly ionised solely by the QSO radiation and has a significantly lower metallicity than would be expected for the stellar mass of the host, indicating an external origin of the gas most likely due to minor mergers. We find a rotating gas disc around the QSO and a dispersion-dominated non-rotating gas component within the central 3 kpc. At larger distances the velocity field is heavily disturbed, which could be interpreted as another signature of past minor merger events. Alternatively, the arc-like structure seen in the ionised gas might also be indicative of a large-scale expanding <b>bubble,</b> <b>centred</b> on and possibly driven by the active nucleus.

The characteristic eects of bubble dynamics, in particular {{the formation of a}} high-speed liquid jet and the emission of shock waves at the moment of collapse are recorded with high-speed photography with framing rates of up to one million frames/s. Damage is observed when the bubble is generated at a distance less than twice its maximum radius from a solid boundary (γ = 2, where γ = s=Rmax, s is the distance between the boundary and the <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> at the moment of formation and Rmax is the maximum bubble radius). The impact of the jet contributes to the damage only at small initial distances (γ 6 0 : 7). In this region, the impact velocity rises to 83 m s− 1, corresponding to a water hammer pressure of about 0. 1 GPa, whereas at γ> 1, the impact velocity is smaller than 25 m s− 1. The largest erosive force is caused by the collapse of a bubble in direct contact with the boundary, where pressures of up to several GPa act on the material surface. Therefore, it is essential for the damaging eect that bubbles ar...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a buoyant bubble near a rigid boundary at the null final Kelvin impulse state is investigated numerically {{by using a}} boundary integral method. The results of the numerical calculations provided the bubble profiles and the pressure contours in the liquid surrounding the bubble. Three cases are chosen to typify the jetting behaviour at the null final Kelvin impulse state: (i) formation of an asymmetric annular jet leading to bubble splitting; (ii) formation of an asymmetric annular jet and a high-speed axial jet directed away from the boundary, and (iii) formation of two opposite high-speed axial jets directed towards the <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> {{as a consequence of}} a more symmetric but weaker annular jet in the initial stage of bubble collapse. The complex behaviour is attributed to a slight difference between the strength of the opposite forces during bubble collapse. The present results indicate that the jetting behaviour in the neighbourhood of the neutral bubble collapse can be adequately described by the Kelvin impulse itself, but evaluated during the collapse phase of the bubble. Its direction determines the position of the annular jet in the initial phase of the collapse while its magnitude indicates the degree of asymmetry and the intensity of the annular jet. Both factors are essential in estimating the final fate of the bubble at the neutral collapse state. Far from this state, the final Kelvin impulse is a valuable tool in predicting the migratory characteristics of the bubble and the direction of the axial jet developed during bubble collapse. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} steady compressible Euler flow {{corresponding to}} the compressible analogue of the well-known incompressible Hill's spherical vortex (HSV). We first derive appropriate compressible Euler equations for steady homentropic flow and show how these {{may be used to}} define a continuation of the HSV to finite Mach number M_∞ =U_∞/C_∞, where U_∞, C_∞ are the fluid velocity and speed of sound at infinity respectively. This {{is referred to as the}} compressible Hill's spherical vortex (CHSV). It corresponds to axisymmetric compressible Euler flow in which, within a vortical bubble, the azimuthal vorticity divided by the product of the density and the distance to the axis remains constant along streamlines, with irrotational flow outside the bubble. The equations are first solved numerically using a fourth-order finite-difference method, and then using a Rayleigh–Janzen expansion in powers of M^ 2 _∞ to order M^ 4 _∞. When M_∞ > 0, the vortical bubble is no longer spherical and its detailed shape must be determined by matching conditions consisting of continuity of the fluid velocity at the bubble boundary. For subsonic compressible flow the bubble boundary takes an approximately prolate spheroidal shape with major axis aligned along the flow direction. There is good agreement between the perturbation solution and Richardson extrapolation of the finite difference solutions for the bubble boundary shape up to M_∞ equal to 0. 5. The numerical solutions indicate that the flow first becomes locally sonic near or at the <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> when M_∞ ≈ 0. 598 and a singularity appears to form at the sonic point. We were unable to find shock-free steady CHSVs containing regions of locally supersonic flow and their existence for the present continuation of the HSV remains an open question...|$|E

40|$|The {{emission}} {{of light from}} a sonoluminescing bubble may depend on whether shock waves launched each acoustic cycle by the imploding surface of the bubble focus on to a sufficiently small volume at the <b>bubble</b> <b>centre.</b> This in turn may depend on whether the shock maintains its stability as it travels inwards. With this application in mind, the linear stability of an imploding spherical shock was studied in Part I, using a van der Waals equation of state for the gas. Condi-tions for instability were determined, but the subsequent fate of the perturbations of the bubble surface was unknown. Would the instabilities grow and persist at finite amplitude or would they disappear during implosion? The answers to such questions are sought here by integrating the gas dynamics equations using the finite-difference essentially non-oscillatory method of Shu and Osher. The shock is initiated by a nearly spherical ‘piston ’ and its subsequent evolution, including its finite-amplitude deviations from sphericity, is determined. Two types of behaviour are found depending on the parameter b ̃ = bρ 0, where b is the van der Waals excluded volume and ρ 0 is the initial uncompressed density of gas ahead of the shock. When b ̃ is sufficiently large, an initially smooth shock front remains smooth as it focuses and, although {{it is impossible to}} continue the integrations up to the moment of implosion, it appears that it will focus on a small volume at the centre of the bubble. This is in sharp contrast to what happens at smaller values of b ̃ for which the initial distortion of the shock front, if sufficiently large, becomes and remains polygonal shaped. This is consistent with experimental results for cylindrical imploding shocks as well as with earlier theoretical investigations of imploding cylindrical and spherical shocks in an ideal gas (b = 0) that used the Chisnell, Chester and Witham (CCW) approximation or the geometrical shock approximation of Whitham. Plausibly, the polygonal distortions reduce the volume on to which the imploding shock in a sonoluminescing bubble focuses...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the characteristics of}} the oscillatory motion and wake of confined bubbles freely rising in a thin-gap cell (h= 3. 1 mm width). Once the diameter d of the bubble in the plane of the cell is known, the mean vertical velocity of the bubble Vb is proportional to the gravitational velocity [ [...] . ], where g is the gravitational acceleration. This velocity is used to build the Reynolds number [ [...] . ] that characterizes the flow induced by the bubble in the surrounding liquid (of kinematic viscosity ν), and which determines at leading order the mean deformation of the bubble given by the aspect ratio χ of the ellipse equivalent to the bubble contour. We then show that in the reference frame associated with the bubble (having a fixed origin and axes corresponding to the minor and major axes of the equivalent ellipse) the characteristics of its oscillatory motion in the plane of the cell display remarkable properties in the range 1200 <Re< 3000 and h/d< 0. 4. In particular, the velocity of the bubble presents along its path an almost constant component along its minor axis (fluctuations in time of approximately 5 %), given by Va/Vb≃ 0. 92 for all Re. The dimensionless amplitude of oscillation of the angular velocity is also constant for all Re, rd/Vb≃ 0. 75, while that of the transverse velocity of the bubble (along its major axis) is given by Vt/Vb≃ 0. 32 χ, reaching values comparable to those of the axial velocity Va for the most deformed bubbles (χ≈ 3). Furthermore, the frequency f of oscillation scales with the inertial time scale based on the transverse velocity of the bubble Vt, corresponding to a constant Strouhal number St=[ [...] . ]. Using high-frequency particle image velocimetry, we investigate in detail the properties of the wake associated with the oscillatory motion of sufficiently confined bubbles. We observe that vortex shedding occurs for a maximal transverse velocity Vt of the bubble, corresponding to a maximal drift angle of the bubble. Furthermore, the measured vorticity of the vortex at detachment corresponds to the estimation [ [...] . ] of the vorticity produced at the bubble surface. Three stages then emerge concerning the evolution in time of the wake generated by the bubble. For one to two periods of oscillation Tx following the release of a vortex, a rapid decay of the vorticity of the released vortex is observed. Meanwhile, the released vortex located initially at a distance of approximately one diameter from the <b>bubble</b> <b>centre</b> moves outwards from the bubble path and expands. At intermediate times, the vortex street undergoes vortex pairing. When viscous effects become predominant at a time of the order of the viscous time scale τν=[ [...] . ], the vortex street becomes frozen and decays exponentially in place...|$|E

Transition to *H-DNA at a d(GA. TC) 8 sequence is observed under conditions which destabilize the DNA double helix such as high negative supercoiling or low ionic strength.

These void solutions, if not encountering the magnetosonic critical curve (MCC), generally approach the asymptotic expansion solution far from the central void with a velocity proportional to radial distance. We identify and examine free-expansion solutions, Einstein-de Sitter expansion solutions, and thermal-expansion solutions in three different parameter regimes. Under certain conditions, void solutions may cross the MCC either smoothly or by MHD shocks, and then merge into asymptotic solutions with finite velocity and density far from the centre.

40|$|A drop {{impacting}} on a solid surface must push {{away the}} intervening gas layer before making contact. This entails a large lubricating air pressure which can deform {{the bottom of}} the drop, thus entrapping a <b>bubble</b> under its <b>centre.</b> For a millimetric water drop, the viscous-dominated flow in the thin air layer counteracts the inertia of the drop liquid. For highly viscous drops the viscous stresses within the liquid also affect the interplay between the drop and the gas. Here the drop also forms a central dimple, but its outer edge is surrounded by an extended thin air film, without contacting the solid. This is in sharp contrast with impacts of lower-viscosity drops where a kink in the drop surface forms {{at the edge of the}} central disc and makes a circular contact with the solid. Larger drop viscosities make the central air dimple thinner. The thin outer air film subsequently ruptures at numerous random locations around the periphery, when it reaches below 150 nm thickness. This thickness we measure using high-speed two-colour interferometry. The wetted circular contacts expand rapidly, at orders of magnitude larger velocities than would be predicted by a capillary-viscous balance. The spreading velocity of the wetting spots is independent of the liquid viscosity. This may suggest enhanced slip of the contact line, assisted by rarefied-gas effects, or van der Waals forces in what we call extreme wetting.

With a sufficient impact velocity, {{instead of a}} completely-bouncing ‘‘Fakir’’ droplet, wetting splashing can occur, with an entrapped air <b>bubble</b> at the <b>centre</b> surrounded by a wetted area {{as well as an}} emission of satellite droplets during the advancing phase of spreading lamella. A large portion of the lamella travels upon air and subsequently recoils due to surface tension, forming a partial rebound on the central wet spot. We present and discuss quantitative results of the entrapped air bubble, the central wetted area, and the maximal spreading lamella as the impact velocity is increased. We further vary the lattice periodicity of the micro-patterns and find its profound influence on the macroscopic flow. More specifically, directional splashing can emerge, emitting secondary droplets in certain directions which are associated with the lattice. Directional splashing can be suppressed to a gentle spreading by decreasing the periodicity of the lattice and, furthermore, can be tuned to a completely-wetting splashing in the diagonal directions of the lattice by a larger periodicity, offering opportunities to control the wetting process. Finally, the elimination of directional splashing by reducing air pressure suggests that the underlying air is squeezed outwards by the falling droplet upon the solid boundary whereby the air flow is affected, leading to different splashing behavior...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{propagation}} of finite bubbles in a Hele-Shaw channel, where a centred occlusion (termed a rail) is introduced to provide a small axially-uniform depth constriction. For bubbles wide enough to span the channel, the system's behaviour {{is similar to that}} of semi-infinite fingers and a symmetric static solution is stable. Here, we focus on smaller bubbles, in which case the symmetric static solution is unstable and the static bubble is displaced towards one of the deeper regions of the channel on either side of the rail. Using a combination of experiments and numerical simulations of a depth-averaged model, we show that a bubble propagating axially due to a small imposed flow rate can be stabilised in a steady symmetric mode centred on the rail through a subtle interaction between stabilising viscous forces and destabilising surface tension forces. However, for sufficiently large capillary numbers Ca, the ratio of viscous to surface tension forces, viscous forces in turn become destabilising thus returning the bubble to an off-centred propagation regime. With decreasing bubble size, the range of Ca for which steady centred propagation is stable decreases, and eventually vanishes through the coalescence of two supercritical pitchfork bifurcations. The depth-averaged model is found to accurately predict all the steady modes of propagation observed experimentally, and provides a comprehensive picture of the underlying steady bifurcation structure. However, for sufficiently large imposed flow rates, we find that initially <b>centred</b> <b>bubbles</b> do not converge onto a steady mode of propagation. Instead they transiently explore weakly unstable steady modes, an evolution which results in their break-up and eventual settling into a steady propagating state of changed topology.

60|$|Our scene lies in {{a chamber}} vast and gorgeous. The reader must imagine a hall, its form that of a rather long square, but {{perfectly}} proportioned. Its coved roof, glowing with golden and scarlet tints, is highly carved {{in the manner of}} the Saracens, such as we may observe in the palaces of Moorish Spain and in the Necropolis of the Mamlouk Sultans at Cairo, deep recesses of honeycomb work, with every now and then pendants of daring grace hanging like stalactites from some sparry cavern. This roof is supported by columns of white marble, fashioned in the shape of palm trees, the work of Italian artists, and which forms arcades around the chamber. Beneath these arcades runs a noble divan of green and silver silk, and the silken panels of the arabesque walls have been covered with subjects of human interest by the finest artists of Munich. The marble floor, with its rich mosaics, was also the contribution of Italian genius, though it was difficult at the present moment to trace its varied, graceful, and brilliant designs, so many were the sumptuous carpets, the couches, sofas, and cushions that were spread about it. There were indeed throughout the chamber many indications of furniture, which are far from usual even among the wealthiest and most refined Orientals: Indian tables, vases of china, and baskets of agate and porcelain filled with flowers. From one side, the large Saracenic windows of this saloon, which were not glazed, but covered only when required by curtains of green and silver silk, now drawn aside, looked on a garden; vistas of quivering trees, broad parterres of flowers, and everywhere the gleam of glittering fountains, which owned, however, fealty to the superior stream that <b>bubbled</b> in the <b>centre</b> of the saloon, where four negroes, carved in black marble, poured forth its refreshing waters from huge shells of pearl, into the vast circle of a jasper basin.|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} conjectured that {{a reason for}} the poor {{recovery}} of coarse particles in flotation, is the detachment of large particles from bubbles in the turbulent shear flow that is present in mechanical flotation cells. The aim {{of this study is to}} observe the behaviour of particle-laden bubbles in a turbulent shear flow. An agitated vessel was constructed in which particle-laden bubbles could be introduced beneath the impeller. The bubbles were generated in a liquid-fluidised bed in a special compartment beneath the cell. The bed was composed of fi ne silica particles 110 to 250 μm in diameter, with an upflow of water containing DDA as collector. Bubbles were formed at the tip of a capillary tube within the bed, and particles were collected as the individual bubbles rose through the fluidised bed. These bubbles then rose one by one into the base of the flotation cell, into the path of the rotating impeller. Some of the particles became detached by the action of the impeller and settled to the base of the cell. Others remained attached to the bubble and rose to the top of the cell, where they were collected as the product. The detached particles, which settled in the base of the cell, and the particles that flowed over the lip of the cell, were collected and weighed. Experiments were conducted at various impeller speeds. Observed values of the fractional detachment were related to the mechanical energy dissipation rate in the region swept by the impeller, in the light of the classical theory of Schulze. According to this theory, a particle will become detached from a <b>bubble</b> in the <b>centre</b> of a rotating eddy, when the centrifugal force due to the rotation exceeds the capillary force holding the particle to the bubble. The theory predicts that a particle of given diameter will detach from a bubble of a given size, when Bo > 1, where Bo is the Bond number. It was found that the theory overpredicts the Bond number for detachment by an order of magnitude. Approximately 80 per cent of the particles will detach at a Bond number of 0. 08...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSilicic pumices formed during {{explosive}} {{volcanic eruptions}} are faithful recorders {{of the state}} of the magma in the conduit, close to or at the fragmentation level. We have characterized four types of pumices from the non-welded rhyolitic Kos Plateau Tuff, which erupted 161, 000 years ago in the East Aegean Arc, Greece. The dominant type of pumice (> 90 vol. %) shows highly elongated tubular vesicles. These tube pumices occur throughout the eruption. Less common pumice types include: (1) “frothy” pumice (highly porous with large, sub-rounded vesicles), which form 5 – 10 vol. % of the coarsest pyroclastic flow deposits, (2) dominantly “microvesicular” and systematically crystal-poor pumices, which are found in early erupted, fine-grained pyroclastic flow units, and are characterized by many small (< 50 μm in diameter) vesicles and few mm-sized, irregular voids, (3) grey or banded pumices, indicating the interaction between the rhyolite and a more mafic magma, which are found throughout the eruption sequence and display highly irregular bubble shapes. Except for the grey-banded pumices, all three other types are compositionally identical and were generated synchronously as they are found in the same pyroclastic units. They, therefore, record different conditions in the volcanic conduit leading to variable bubble nucleation, growth and coalescence. A total of 74 pumice samples have been characterized using thin section observation, SEM imagery, porosimetry, and permeametry. We show that the four pumice types have distinct total and connected porosity, tortuosity and permeability. Grey-banded pumices show large variations in petrophysical characteristics as a response to mingling of two different magmas. The microvesicular, crystal-poor, pumices have a bimodal bubble size distribution, interpreted as reflecting an early heterogeneous bubble nucleation event followed by homogeneous bubble nucleation close to fragmentation. Finally, the significant differences in porosity, tortuosity and permeability in compositionally identical tube and frothy pumices are the result of variable shear rates in different parts of the conduit. Differential shear rates may be the result of either: (1) pure shear, inducing a vertical progression from frothy to tube and implying a relatively thick fragmentation zone to produce both types of pumices at the same time or (2) localized simple shear, inducing strongly tubular vesicles along the wall and near-spherical <b>bubbles</b> in the <b>centre</b> of the conduit and not necessarily requiring a thick fragmentation zone...|$|R
40|$|During subaerial eruptions, {{volatiles}} {{are often}} considered {{the driving force}} of explosive volcanism. However, for subglacial eruptions, this role is complicated by the effects of changing pressure on volatile solubility, and the additional possibility of magma-water interaction. We are using the 1918 Katla (K 1918) eruption to investigate the relative roles of these processes. K 1918 was the last confirmed eruption of Katla, which is located in South Iceland. It was a VEI 4 basaltic eruption that took place under the Mýrdalsjökull glacier, resulting in a 14 km high ash plume that blanketed half of Iceland in ash and one of the largest floods of the Quaternary; a jökulhlaup with discharge rates of > 300, 000 m 3 s- 1. Samples were collected from both the jökulhlaup and air-fall deposits. Discrete layers were observed at both locations and were sampled from; thus we have a record of sequential deposition at both localities. H 2 O concentrations were determined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were acquired at various scales, and then processed using ImageJ and FOAMS to allow a detailed quantitative investigation of both bubble and crystal populations. Preliminary results suggest that the jökulhlaup samples have retained more H 2 O, have higher bubble number densities (BNDs) and vesicularities, and lower crystallinities compared to the air-fall samples, indicating more rapid decompression and quenching. Many of the air-fall samples have larger <b>bubbles</b> in the <b>centre</b> of the clasts, implying continued vesiculation post fragmentation. There are also textures, particularly in the jökulhlaup samples, that are suggestive of clast recycling and open system degassing, involving the transportation of both gas and ash particles, including high Si material derived from the country rock. Our interpretation of the results is that the jökulhlaup samples mainly experienced magmatic fragmentation, before the magma had reached the ice interface. This was driven by a high vesicle content and rapid decompression, however, due to volumetric confinement, clast recycling, and magma shocking also played important roles. Once the clasts were expelled, they were quenched rapidly, preserving a wealth of textures that record various magmatic processes (such as particle transportation). In contrast, we believe the vesicle-poor air-fall samples mainly experienced phreatomagmatic fragmentation, but were quickly expelled through any meltwater and instead quenched slowly in the hot plume where they were able to continue degassing to atmospheric pressure. These interpretations offer a potential explanation for the exceptionally fast melting rate of the glacier and why such a powerful jökulhlaup was created...|$|R
