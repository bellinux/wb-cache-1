40|$|International audienceVelocity {{dispersed}} ion signatures (VDIS) {{occurring at}} the plasma sheet boundary layer (PSBL) are a well reported feature. Theory has, however, predicted {{the existence of}} multiple ion <b>beamlets,</b> similar to VDIS, in the boundary plasma sheet (BPS), i. e. at latitudes below the PSBL. In this study we show evidence for the multiple ion <b>beamlets</b> in Polar/TIMAS ion data and basic properties of the ion <b>beamlets</b> will be presented. Statistics of the occurrence frequency of ion multiple <b>beamlets</b> {{show that they are}} most common in the midnight MLT sector and for altitudes above 4 R E, while at low altitude (? 3 R E), single <b>beamlets</b> at PSBL (VDIS) are more common. Distribution functions of ion <b>beamlets</b> in velocity space have recently been shown to correspond to 3 -dimensional hollow spheres, containing a large amount of free energy.

40|$|Focused {{multiple}} ion <b>beamlets</b> from {{a microwave}} plasma source is investigated for localized micron-scale modification of substrates in a patterned manner. Plasma electrodes (PE) {{with an array}} of through apertures having aperture diameters of the order of plasma Debye length are investigated for generating the <b>beamlets.</b> Extraction through sub-Debye length apertures becomes possible when the PE is kept at floating potential. It is found that the current – voltage characteristics of the extracted <b>beamlets</b> exhibits interesting features such as a space-charge-limited region that has a different behaviour than the conventional Child-Langmuir’s law and an extraction-voltage-limited region that does not undergo saturation but exhibits a Schottky-like behaviour similar to that of a vacuum diode.

40|$|In a new {{approach}} to develop high current beams for heavy ion fusion, beam current at about 0. 5 ampere per channel can be obtained by merging an array of high current density <b>beamlets</b> of 5 mA each. We have done computer simulations to study the transport of high current density <b>beamlets</b> and the emittance growth due to this merging process. In our RF multicusp source experiment, we have produced a cluster of 61 <b>beamlets</b> using minimum gas flow. The current density from a 0. 25 cm diameter aperture reached 100 mA/cm{sup 2 }. The normalized emittance of 0. 02 {pi}-mm-mrad corresponds to an equivalent ion temperature of 2. 4 eV.

5000|$|Figure 2 shows {{a simple}} 2 [...] "pixel" [...] {{version of this}} implementation. A laser beam is {{deflected}} by a 25Mhz and a 29Mhz acoustic frequency via an acousto-optic modulator. Two beams emerge and both are combined on the detector along with the original laser beam. The 25Mhz <b>beamlet</b> illuminates the left half of the detector while the 29Mhz <b>beamlet</b> illuminates the right half of the detector. The beat frequencies against the signal beam on the detector produce 25 and 29 MHz output frequencies. Thus we can differentiate which photons hit {{the left or right}} half of the detector. This method scales to larger numbers of pixels since AOD's with thousands of resolvable spots (each with a different frequency) are commercially available. 2D arrays can be produced with a second AOD arranged at right angles, or by holographic methods.|$|E
40|$|Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is a {{means of}} {{delivering}} radiation therapy where the intensity of the beam is varied within the treatment field.

50|$|The method multiplexes all {{the spatial}} {{positions}} on the detector by frequency. If frequencies are uniformly spaced then a simple fourier transform recovers the coherent image. However, {{there is no reason}} the frequencies have to be uniformly spaced so one can adjust the number, size and shape of the pixels dynamically. One can also independently change the Heterodyne gain on each pixel individually simply by making the LO <b>beamlet</b> more or less strong. Thus one can extend the dynamic range of the receiver by lowering the gain on bright pixels, raising it on dim ones, and possibly using larger pixels for dim regions.|$|E
5000|$|Intensity {{modulated}} {{radiation therapy}} (IMRT) is an advanced radiotherapy technique used {{to minimize the}} amount of normal tissue being irradiated in the treatment field. In some systems this intensity modulation is achieved by moving the leaves in the MLC {{during the course of}} treatment, thereby delivering a radiation field with a non-uniform (i.e. modulated) intensity. With IMRT, radiation oncologists are able to break up the radiation beam into many [...] "beamlets". This allows radiation oncologists to vary the intensity of each <b>beamlet.</b> With IMRT, doctors are often able to further limit the amount of radiation received by healthy tissue near the tumor. Doctors have found this sometimes allowed them to safely give a higher dose of radiation to the tumor, potentially increasing the chance of a cure.|$|E

5000|$|One {{practical}} way to achieve this is to use an Acousto Optic Deflector. These devices deflect an incoming light beam {{in proportion to the}} Acoustic driving frequency. They also have the side effect of shifting the output optical frequency by the acoustic frequency. Thus when one of these is driven with multiple acoustic frequencies a series of deflected beams are emitted each with a small and different shift in the optical frequency. Conveniently, this works even if the source laser has low spectral purity since every sub-spectral component of the <b>beamlet</b> is mutually phase coherent with the source and shifted by the same frequency. In particular this approach allows the use of inexpensive, high power or pulsed lasers as sources because no frequency control is required.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{a framework for}} multiscale image analysis in which line segments play a role analogous to {{the role played by}} points in wavelet analysis. The framework has five key components. The <b>beamlet</b> dictionary is a dyadicallyorganized collection of line segments, occupying a range of dyadic locations and scales, and occurring at a range of orientations. The <b>beamlet</b> transform of an image f(x, y) is the collection of integrals of f over each segment in the <b>beamlet</b> dictionary; the resulting information is stored in a <b>beamlet</b> pyramid. Thebeamlet graph is the graph structure with pixel corners as vertices and beamlets as edges; a path through this graph corresponds to a polygon in the original image. By exploiting the first four components of the <b>beamlet</b> framework, we can formulate beamlet-based algorithms which are able to identify and extract beamlets and chains of beamlets with special properties.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{spectral}} methods, especially wavelets theory, have gained wide popularity in {{digital image processing}} because they allow for very sparse and efficient image coding. Although they are good in analyzing one dimensional signal, they cannot properly catch line discontinuities, so they are often present in two dimensional signals, that is in images. To avoid these problems the theory of geometrical wavelets has been created in recent years, which have all advantages of wavelets and moreover, allows to catch line discontinuities properly. <b>Beamlets</b> are those of {{a wide spectrum of}} the new theory of geometrical wavelets. They are successfully used in many areas of digital image processing, particularly in multiresolution image coding.

40|$|Purpose: Intensity-modulated {{radiation}} treatment (IMRT) plan optimization needs pre-calculated <b>beamlet</b> dose distribution. Pencil-beam or superposition/convolution type algorithms are typically used {{because of high}} computation speed. However, inaccurate <b>beamlet</b> dose distributions, particularly in cases {{with high levels of}} inhomogeneity, may mislead optimization, hindering the resulting plan quality. It is desire to use Monte Carlo (MC) methods for <b>beamlet</b> dose calculations. Yet, the long computational time from repeated dose calculations for a number of beamlets prevents this application. It is our objective to integrate a GPU-based MC dose engine in lung IMRT optimization using a novel two-steps workflow. Methods : A GPU-based MC code gDPM is used. Each particle is tagged with an index of a <b>beamlet</b> where the source particle is from. Deposit dose are stored separately for beamlets based on the index. Due to limited GPU memory size, a pyramid space is allocated for each <b>beamlet,</b> and dose outside the space is neglected. A two-steps optimization workflow is proposed for fast MC-based optimization. At first step, a rough dose calculation is conducted with only a few number of particle per <b>beamlet.</b> Plan optimization is followed to get an approximated fluence map. In the second step, more accurate <b>beamlet</b> doses are calculated, where sampled number of particles for a <b>beamlet</b> is proportional to the intensity determined previously. A second-round optimization is conducted, yielding the final result. Results: For a lung case with 5317 beamlets, 105 particles per <b>beamlet</b> in the first round, and 108 particles per beam in the second round are enough to get a good plan quality. The total simulation time is 96. 4 sec. Conclusion : A fast GPU-based MC dose calculation method along with a novel two-step optimization workflow are developed. The high efficiency allows the use of MC for IMRT optimizations. [...] Cite this article as: Li Y, Tian Z, Shi F, Jiang S, Jia X. GPU-Monte Carlo based fast IMRT plan optimization.
