25|$|For many species, {{sex is not}} {{determined}} by inherited traits, but instead by environmental factors experienced during development or later in life. Many reptiles have temperature-dependent sex determination: the temperature embryos experience during their development determines {{the sex of the}} organism. In some turtles, for example, males are produced at lower incubation temperatures than females; this difference in critical temperatures can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 1–2°C.|$|E
25|$|Breeders {{try to keep}} glycoalkaloid levels below 200mg/kg (200 ppmw). However, {{when these}} {{commercial}} varieties turn green, they can still approach concentrations of solanine of 1000mg/kg (1000 ppmw). In normal potatoes, analysis has shown solanine levels may <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 3.5% of the breeders' maximum, with 7–187mg/kg being found. While a normal potato has 12–20mg/kg of glycoalkaloid content, a green tuber contains 250–280mg/kg, and green skin 1500–2200mg/kg.|$|E
25|$|According to the Hurt Report, most {{motorcycle}} {{riders in}} the United States would over-brake and skid {{the rear wheel}} and under-brake the front when trying hard to avoid a collision. The ability to countersteer and swerve was essentially absent with many motorcycle operators. The often small amount of initial countersteering input required to get the bike to lean, which may <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 0.125 seconds, keeps many riders unaware of the concept.|$|E

25|$|Adelaide's {{water supply}} is gained from its {{reservoir}}s: Mount Bold, Happy Valley, Myponga, Millbrook, Hope Valley, Little Para and South Para. The yield from these reservoir catchments can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 10% of the city's requirements in drought years and about 60% in average years. The remaining demand is {{met by the}} pumping {{of water from the}} River Murray. A sea water desalination plant capable of supplying half of Adelaide's water requirements (100GL per annum) was commissioned in 2013. The provision of water services is by the government-owned SA Water.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} of an alkaline battery is strongly {{dependent on the}} load. An AA-sized alkaline battery might have an effective {{capacity of}} 3000mAh at low drain, but at a load of 1 ampere, which is common for digital cameras, the capacity could <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 700mAh. The voltage of the battery declines steadily during use, so the total usable capacity depends on the cut-off voltage of the application. Unlike Leclanche cells, the alkaline cell delivers about as much capacity on intermittent or continuous light loads. On a heavy load, capacity is reduced on continuous discharge compared with intermittent discharge, but the reduction is less than for Leclanche cells.|$|E
25|$|The microfilariae {{circulate}} in {{the bloodstream}} {{for as long as}} two years, waiting for the next stage in their lifecycles in the gut of a bloodsucking mosquito. When ingested by a mosquito, the microfilariae undergo a series of molts to the infective third larval stage, and then migrate to the salivary glands of the mosquito, where they wait to infect another host. The incubation period required to reach the stage where the microfilariae become transmittable to another host can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> two weeks or as long as six weeks, depending on the warmth of the climate, and the larval lifecycle ceases entirely if the ambient temperature drops below 14°C (57°F).|$|E

50|$|Curves in {{the tunnels}} were very tight. Mainline curves <b>were</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 16 ft radius, {{and the grand}} unions under street intersections were built to a 20 ft radius. Grades in the tunnel system were limited to 1.75 percent, except for the lines up to the Grant Park {{disposal}} station, which climbed at a 12 percent grade.|$|R
25|$|The {{thickness}} specified for a wall {{is determined}} by such factors as damp proofing considerations, {{whether or not the}} wall has a cavity, load-bearing requirements, expense, and the era during which the architect was or is working. Wall thickness specification has proven considerably various, and while some non-load-bearing brick walls may <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> half a brick thick, or even less when shiners are laid stretcher bond in partition walls, others brick walls are much thicker. The Monadnock Building in Chicago, for example, is a very tall masonry building, and has load-bearing brick walls nearly two metres thick at the base. The majority of brick walls are however usually between one and three bricks thick. At these more modest wall thicknesses, distinct patterns have emerged allowing for a structurally sound layout of bricks internal to each particular specified thickness of wall.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic Park {{was planned}} to {{incorporate}} 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, {{with a total}} of 525 bird boxes, and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process. Renewable energy also features at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, this may now <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 9%. Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons. The focus has since moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. Food packaging at the Olympics is made from compostable materials– like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics– where it cannot be re-used or recycled. This includes fast food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons. After they have been used, many of these materials would be suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.|$|E

500|$|Trespass to goods {{is defined}} as [...] "wrongful {{physical}} interference with goods {{that are in the}} possession of another", and is covered not only by the common law, but also by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977. The [...] "trespass" [...] can <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> touching or moving the goods, given the right circumstances. It is unknown whether intention is required for a claim under trespass to goods, as the matter has never gone to court; the courts have confirmed that for damages to be awarded for harm suffered, the harm must have been reasonably foreseeable.|$|E
500|$|Sinclair would shortly stop {{producing}} calculators {{and instead}} focus on computers, {{starting with the}} MK14 in 1977. The loss of the calculator market was {{due in part to}} technological development leading to smaller and cheaper components, which put heavy pressure on profit margins. An import levy of up to 17.5% was placed on components, but the duty for calculators imported from Japan or Hong Kong could <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 5%, making it unprofitable to produce calculators in the UK. Sinclair also had some problems with the reliability of earlier calculators that had adversely affected its reputation, but the Sovereign was sold with a [...] "full and unconditional" [...] five year guarantee.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Irati formation" [...] {{consists}} of two oil shale beds separated by [...] of limestone and shale. The upper layer is thicker (...) but the thinner lower bed (...) is of greater value; the weight percent of shale oil yield is around 12% for the lower layer as compared to 7% for the upper one. The oil shale yield varies laterally, and may <b>be</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 7% for the lower layer and 4% for the upper layer. The formation is a very fine grained and laminated deposit ranging in color from dark gray to brown to black.
