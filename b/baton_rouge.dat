5|$|By September 10, the {{prospect}} of securing a <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge</b> location to host the Hornets was fading {{as a result of}} the facilities being utilized for hurricane related relief operations. Numerous cities inquired about hosting the franchise for the season, including Kansas City, Louisville, Nashville, Oklahoma City and San Diego. During this period, Oklahoma City announced that it was the favored choice to serve as the temporary home of the franchise, although by mid-September SMG announced that the New Orleans arena could potentially be ready for occupancy by the All-Star Game break. However, by late September the Hornets finalized a move to Oklahoma City, where 35 games would be played at the Ford Center, as well as six in <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge</b> at the Pete Maravich Assembly Center. Additionally, it was announced that three of the games in March could be moved to New Orleans if the arena repairs were complete. At the same time, the NBA also announced the team would be referred to officially as the New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets, and that the deal reached with Oklahoma City would allow for the team to return for the 2006–07 season, if necessary.|$|E

5|$|William Abb Cannon {{was born}} in Neshoba County, Mississippi to Harvey and Virgie Cannon. The family moved to <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> Louisiana, where his father worked during World War II. While {{attending}} Istrouma High School in <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> Cannon drew attention for his speed, strength and size; he exceled in football, basketball, and track. In football in 1955, his senior year, Cannon scored 39 touchdowns, was included in All-State and All-America teams, and led the Istrouma Indians to a state championship. Although generally appearing in just {{the first half of}} games, he scored 229 points that season, a state record at the time. In track and field, he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.6 seconds and threw the shot-put over 56 feet, setting what were state records at the time for both events.

5|$|In 1984, Reagan {{commuted}} the 18-year {{sentence of}} former Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry Gil Dozier, a Democrat from <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> {{to the time}} served for violations of both the Hobbs and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations acts. On September 23, 1980, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana convicted Dozier of extortion and racketeering when he pushed companies doing business with his department to make campaign contributions on his behalf. Reagan determined that the 18-year sentence was excessive compared to what other political figures in similar circumstances had been receiving.|$|E

5|$|Recalled {{to service}} in early 1942, upon American entry into World War II, Middleton became CG of the 45th Infantry Division during the Sicily and Salerno battles in Italy, {{and then in}} March 1944 moved up to command the VIII Corps. His {{leadership}} in Operation Cobra during the Battle of Normandy led to the capture of the important port city of Brest, France, and for his success he was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal by General George Patton. His greatest World War II achievement, however, was in his decision to hold the important city of Bastogne, Belgium, during the Battle of the Bulge. Following this battle, and his corps' relentless push across Germany until reaching Czechoslovakia, he was recognized by both General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, and Patton as being a corps commander of extraordinary abilities. Middleton logged 480 days in combat during World War II, {{more than any other}} American general officer. Retiring from the army again in 1945, Middleton returned to LSU and in 1951 was appointed to the university presidency, a position he held for 11 years, while continuing to serve the army in numerous consultative capacities. He resided in <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> Louisiana, until his death in 1976 and was buried in <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge</b> National Cemetery. Both the Air Force/Army ROTC building at Mississippi State University, Middleton's alma mater, and the library at Louisiana State University are named for him.|$|E
5|$|The major {{hurricane}} intensified {{up until}} making landfall near Houma, Louisiana at 2300UTC late on August25, with winds estimated at 115mph (185km/h) {{and an estimated}} minimum barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.20inHg), based on a pressure report of 959mbar (hPa; 28.32inHg) in Houma. Maximum sustained winds extended 23mi (37km) from the hurricane's center. Once over land, however, the hurricane rapidly weakened. By 1200UTC on August26, the system had already degenerated to a tropical storm, while still located over Louisiana near <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge.</b> The next day, the storm weakened further to tropical depression strength as it moved towards the west, before degenerating into an open trough of low pressure near Hillsboro, Texas by 1800UTC on August27.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of LMAs involve the outsourcing of one television station's operations to another, occasionally, a company may operate a station under an LMA, JSA or SSA {{even if it does}} not already own a station in that market. One example occurred in December 2013, when the Louisiana Media Company (owned by New Orleans Saints and New Orleans Hornets owner Tom Benson) entered into a shared services agreement with Raycom Media to run the former company's Fox affiliate in New Orleans, Louisiana, WVUE-DT; while Louisiana Media Company retained the station's ownership and license, other assets were assumed by Raycom, which owns stations in markets adjacent to New Orleans (including <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> Jackson, Biloxi, Lake Charles and Shreveport) but not within New Orleans itself. Benson had received offers from Raycom and others to buy the station, but was not prepared to sell WVUE outright.|$|E
5|$|At {{the height}} of the storm, several of the main roads in New Orleans were shut down due to flooding. At least 100 homes were flooded by the storm. In <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> dozens of people were {{evacuated}} from a flooded home via ambulance and wagon to safer areas. In nearby Mississippi, rainfall from the storm was mainly confined to the southeastern counties; however, significant accumulations, peaking at , were recorded. Rain from the remnant low spread into Georgia. Some stream flooding and crop damage were reported but overall, the damage was minor. In all, Arlene caused $500,000 ($3.7million 2010 USD) in damage. One death was related to Arlene; a man drowned in rough surf off the Galveston coast. After the initial low dissipated over the southeastern United States, the extratropical remnants of Arlene brought moderate rainfall to parts of the Mid-Atlantic States and New England.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{extensive}} damage resulting from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005–06 season came into question. Although the New Orleans Arena suffered only slight damage, the flooding surrounding the area {{made it impossible to}} use. With the training camp scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that the first three weeks of camp would be held at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead of their usual location, Alario Center in Westwego. Additionally the team stated that they wanted to play home games within Louisiana, at either the Pete Maravich Assembly Center or the Rivercenter in <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge.</b> On September 3, Hornets owner George Shinn stated that the storm would not be used as a reason to permanently relocate the franchise.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge's {{performance}} {{earned him}} a promotion to major general on April 14, 1862. After his promotion, he joined Earl Van Dorn near Vicksburg, Mississippi. The Confederate forces awaited a Union attack throughout most of July. Finally, Van Dorn ordered Breckinridge to attempt to recapture <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> Louisiana, from federal forces. Despite having his forces reduced to around 3,000 by illness and desertions, on August 5, he attacked the Union garrison, capturing several prisoners, destroying its supplies, and driving it from the city. The ironclad CSS Arkansas was supposed to support Breckinridge's attack, but it was immobilized by a mechanical failure and its crew sank it to prevent its capture. Without naval support, the Confederates were unable to hold the city.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{irregularities}} in {{the approval of}} the Lecompton Constitution by Kansas voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid. Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave—to take his wife from <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> Louisiana, where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C.—had been planned for months. The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned. During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval. On resubmission, it was overwhelmingly rejected.|$|E
5|$|Final reports {{indicate}} that the official death toll, according to the Louisiana Department of Health, was 1,464 people. The first deaths were reported shortly before midnight on August 28, 2005, as three nursing home patients died during an evacuation to <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge.</b> On September 4, Mayor Nagin speculated that the death toll could rise as high as ten thousand after the clean-up was completed. Some survivors and evacuees reported seeing bodies lying in city streets and floating in still-flooded sections, especially in {{the east of the}} city. The advanced state of decomposition of many corpses, some of which were left in the water or sun for days before being collected, hindered efforts by coroners to identify many of the dead.|$|E
5|$|In August 2009, the {{development}} for the reboot of the Fantastic Four film franchise was announced by 20th Century Fox. In July 2012, Josh Trank was hired to direct.

5|$|In {{the preseason}} polls, LSU opened the 2011 {{season as the}} No.4 team in both the AP and Coaches' Polls. In week one, the Tigers met the No.3 Oregon Ducks in the Cowboys Classic. Against the highly {{regarded}} Oregon running attack, the LSU defense held the Ducks to less than 100 yards rushing and won the game 40–27. With their win, they moved up to No.2 and No.3 in the AP and Coaches' Polls. After they held the Northwestern State Demons of the Football Championship Subdivision to minus 4 yards rushing at <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> LSU faced ranked opponents {{on the road in}} consecutive weeks against the Mississippi State Bulldogs and the West Virginia Mountaineers. Against the No.25 Bulldogs, the Tigers only managed to score a single touchdown, but behind a third strong defensive performance won 19–6.|$|E
5|$|Marian Burnett participated on Guyana's behalf in the women's 800meters race at the Beijing Olympics. Born in Linden, Burnett {{has been}} {{affiliated}} with the athletics program at Louisiana State University in <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge.</b> His appearance at Beijing marked her second after her appearance in the same event at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where she also represented Guyana.

Burnett placed ahead of the United States' Alice Schmidt (2:02.33) and behind Belarus' Sviatlana Usovich (2:00.42) in a heat led by the Ukraine's Yuliya Krevsun (2:00.21) and Russia's Tatiana Andrianova (2:00.31). Out of the 40 finishing athletes, Burnett placed 23rd. She did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{began their}} 2007football season with emotion and remembrance. As Virginia Tech {{recovered}} from the worst school shooting in American history, football served {{as a way to}} help the university community emotionally heal. The opening game of the season, on September 1, 2007, was against East Carolina University and featured numerous remembrance ceremonies and commemorations. Buoyed by the emotion of the day, the Hokies earned a 177 victory. Their next game would not be as easy. One week later, Virginia Tech traveled to <b>Baton</b> <b>Rouge,</b> Louisiana to face the No.2 Louisiana State University Tigers. The Tigers were widely regarded in pre-season polls as favorites to play in the National Championship Game and overwhelmed the Hokies in front of a home crowd, 487.|$|E
