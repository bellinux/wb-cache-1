In addition, the possible mechanism involved in protective effects of prostacyclin against cardiac fibrosis was also studied. We found that <b>beraprost,</b> a prostacyclin analogue, inhibited angiotensin II (Ang II) -induced neonatal rat cardiac fibroblast proliferation in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner. <b>Beraprost</b> also suppressed Ang II-induced collagen I mRNA expression and protein synthesis in cardiac fibroblasts.

BackgroundPrevious trials with <b>beraprost</b> sodium, an orally active prostaglandin I 2 analogue, {{in the treatment of}} claudication in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have been inconsistent. MethodsPatients with intermittent claudication (n = 897) were randomized to receive either 40 μg three times a day of <b>beraprost</b> with meals (n = 385) or placebo (n = 377) in a double-blinded manner for one year. The primary efficacy parameter was treadmill-measured maximum walking distance, as assessed at three and six months after randomization. Secondary efficacy parameters included treadmill-measured pain-free walking distance and change in quality of life. ResultsThere was no significant improvement in maximum walking distance in the <b>beraprost</b> group (16. 7 %) as compared with the placebo group (14. 6 %, p = NS). Administration of <b>beraprost</b> did not improve the pain-free walking distance (p = NS between treatment groups), and there was no improvement in the quality-of-life measures between the treatment groups. The incidence of critical cardiovascular events was 7. 3 % in the <b>beraprost</b> group and 11. 4 % in the placebo group (p = NS).

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Beraprost</b> sodium, a {{prostaglandin}} I 2 analogue, {{has been}} recently reported to exhibit beneficial effects on atherosclerosis {{in patients with}} diabetes. However, effects of <b>beraprost</b> sodium on microvascular injury in diabetes remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that advanced glycation end products (AGE), senescent macroproteins formed at an accelerated rate in diabetes, caused pericyte apoptosis, thus {{being involved in the}} pathogenesis of the early phase of diabetic retinopathy. In this study, we examined whether <b>beraprost</b> sodium can protect against AGE-induced cytotoxicity in cultured retinal pericytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected using a fluorescent probe. DNA synthesis was determined by measuring [3 H]thymidine incorporation into cells. Apoptosis was determined by DNA fragmentations, which were quantitatively measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: <b>Beraprost</b> sodium or forskolin, a stimulator of adenylate cyclase, was found to significantly inhibit AGE-induced ROS generation and the subsequent decrease in DNA synthesis in pericytes. Both treatments significantly prevented AGE-induced apoptotic cell death in pericytes. Furthermore, <b>beraprost</b> sodium was found to down-regulate AGE receptor mRNA levels in pericytes. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that cyclic AMP-elevating agents such as <b>beraprost</b> sodium and forskolin protected retinal pericytes from AGE-induced cytotoxicity through its anti-oxidative properties. Our present study suggests that <b>beraprost</b> sodium may have therapeutic potentials in treatment of patients with early diabetic retinopathy...|$|E

Here we used computational chemistry methods to investigate the potential for PGI 2, <b>beraprost</b> (IP receptor agonist), and GW 0742 (PPAR??/?? agonist), to bind to nuclear receptors, confirmed with pharmacological methods.

We have recently demonstrated the inhibitory effect of cAMP on uPA gene transcription in RC-K 8 human lymphoma cells. Prostacyclin produced by endothelial cells is shown to increase cellular cAMP levels by activating adenylate cyclase. We, therefore, examined {{the effect of a}} stable analogue of prostacyclin, <b>Beraprost,</b> on uPA production in RC-K 8 cells. uPA activity gradually increased in the conditioned medium with time. <b>Beraprost</b> (0. 1 nM- 1. 0 μM) inhibited uPA accumulation in a dose-dependent manner without affecting cell viability. High and low molecular forms of uPA were present in the conditioned medium, but no PA inhibitor was demonstrated by fibrin zymography. All forms of uPA decreased after Beraprost-treatment. Northern blot analysis revealed that after exposure to <b>Beraprost,</b> uPA mRNA levels increased transiently and then rapidly decreased to below control levels. Treatment with <b>Beraprost</b> resulted in a rapid activation of cellular cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). <b>Beraprost</b> completely negated uPA gene expression induced by phorbol myristate acetate, an activator of protein kinase C(PKC). These results suggest that <b>Beraprost</b> inhibits uPA production by suppressing uPA gene expression may be through the PKA pathway and that PKA-mediated signals are dominant in uPA gene expression as compared to those medicated by PKC.

It also considers the optimal treatment strategies for systemic vascular protection in light of recent findings. This area is of major clinical importance given the ongoing global epidemic of type 2 diabetes and the pivotal role played by insulin resistance in the mechanism of vascular impairment that manifests as macroangiopathy and microangiopathy. Timely diagnosis and intervention is critical in patients with systemic arteriosclerotic disease. Therefore, treatment strategies are aimed not only at targeting the presenting pathology, but also at reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. These efforts can help reduce the risk of both cardiovascular events and mortality. Treatment for PAD includes pharmacotherapy, endovascular treatment, and vascular reconstruction, along with exercise therapy. Because PAD can cause ischemia in the lower extremities, typical drug approaches include use of vasodilators and antiplatelet agents. <b>Beraprost</b> sodium and cilostazol are common choices in Japan, and their risks and benefits are discussed. Of note, <b>beraprost</b> has several therapeutic properties, including vascular endothelial protection, and antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory effects, in addition to vasodilatory activity. In patients with PAD, these activities improve the pathological process in the lower extremities and reduce the incidence of systemic vascular events. Recent preclinical findings indicate that <b>beraprost</b> improves not only ischemic extremities through its vasodilatory properties, but also reduces the insulin resistance which affects vascular endothelium. In this way, <b>beraprost</b> may contribute to an overall systemic vascular protective action. The use of agents, such as <b>beraprost,</b> which are capable of improving insulin resistance and resulting vascular endothelial function at an earlier disease stage, may ultimately contribute to increasing the life expectancy of patients with PAD.

The present {{study was designed to}} determine whether the elevation of endogenous cAMP with <b>beraprost</b> sodium, a prostacyclin analog, reduces the contrast material-induced renal tubular injury. MethodsThe cell injury was induced by the exposure to ioversol for 30 minutes followed by further incubation for 24 hours {{in the absence of the}} contrast medium, and assessed by propidium iodide uptake and WST- 8 assay. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V stain and DNA electrophoresis. Caspase activity was assessed by the enzymatic degradation of specific substrate peptides.

BackgroundPulmonary arterial hypertension is a life-threatening disease for which continuous intravenous infusion of prostacyclin has been proven effective. However, this treatment is associated with serious complications arising from the complex delivery system. MethodsIn this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 130 patients with PAH were randomized to the maximal tolerated dose of <b>beraprost</b> (median dose 80 μg four times a day) or to placebo for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the change in exercise capacity assessed by the 6 -min walk test. Secondary end points included changes in Borg dyspnea index, cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and NYHA functional class. ResultsPatients treated with <b>beraprost</b> improved exercise capacity and symptoms. The difference between treatment groups in the mean change of 6 -min walking distance at week 12 was 25. 1 m (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 8 to 48. 3, p = 0. 036). The difference in the mean change of Borg dyspnea index was − 0. 94 (95 % CI: − 1. 63 to − 0. 24, p = 0. 009). In the sub-group of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, the difference in the mean change of 6 -min walking distance was 46. 1 m (95 % CI: 3. 0 to 89. 3, p = 0. 035). Cardiopulmonary hemodynamics and NYHA functional class had no statistically significant changes. Drug-related adverse events were common in the titration phase and decreased in the maintenance period.

40|$|Prostanoids {{have played}} a {{prominent}} role in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Several compounds and methods of administration have been studied: chronic intravenously infused epoprostenol, chronic subcutaneously infused treprostinil, inhaled iloprost, and oral <b>beraprost.</b> Chronic intravenous epoprostenol therapy has had a substantial impact on the clinical management of patients with severe PAH. It improves exercise capacity, hemodynamics, and survival in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). It also improves exercise capacity and hemodynamics in patients with PAH occurring in association with scleroderma. The complexity of epoprostenol therapy (chronic indwelling catheters, reconstitution of the drug, operation of the infusion pump, and others) has led to attempts to develop other prostanoids with simpler modes of delivery. Treprostinil, a stable prostacyclin analogue with a half-life of 3 h, has been developed for subcutaneous delivery. It has beneficial effects on exercise and hemodynamics, which depend somewhat on the dose achieved. This, in turn, is determined by the patient's ability to tolerate the drug's side effects, including pain and erythema at the infusion site. Inhaled iloprost therapy may provide selectivity of the hemodynamic effects to the lung vasculature, thus avoiding systemic side effects. In a randomized and controlled trial, iloprost resulted in improvement in a combined end point incorporating the New York Heart Association functional class, 6 -min walk test, and deterioration or death. <b>Beraprost</b> is the first orally active prostacyclin analogue. In the first of two randomized controlled trials, <b>beraprost</b> increased exercise capacity in patients with IPAH, with no significant changes in subjects with associated conditions. Hemodynamics did not change significantly, and no difference in survival was detected between the two treatment groups. The second study showed that beraprost-treated patients had less disease progression at six months and confirmed the results of the previous trial. However, this improvement was no longer present at 9 or 12 months. In conclusion, though treatment with prostanoids is complicated by their generally short half-lives and complicated drug delivery systems, they continue {{to play an important role}} in the treatment of PAH. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Prostanoids are a {{well-established}} therapy for {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} (PAH), and observational studies suggest their efficacy even in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) patients. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of 6 months of treatment with <b>beraprost,</b> an orally-active prostacyclin analog, in patients with distal CTEPH and PAH. DESIGN: Case-control study. POPULATION: Sixteen patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (NYHA II-IV), eight with distal CTEPH matched with eight patients with idiopathic PAH for similar effort tolerance. METHODS: All patients were in stable clinical and hemodynamic condition for 3 months with maximal standard therapy. During the titration phase (4 weeks) <b>beraprost</b> was increased to maximal tolerated dose (mean daily dosage: CTEPH 275 +/- 47 microg, PAH 277 +/- 47 microg) in adjunction of standard therapy, patients were followed-up for 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: World Heart Organization (WHO) functional class, exercise capacity measured by distance walked in 6 min, and systolic pulmonary pressure (echocardiography), were evaluated at baseline, and at 1 -, 3 - and 6 -month interval. RESULTS: At 6 months WHO class decreased significantly in both groups (CTEPH from 2. 7 +/- 0. 6 to 2. 0 +/- 0. 24, p < 0. 05; PAH from 3. 0 +/- 0. 26 to 2. 1 +/- 0. 25, p < 0. 05), similarly the 6 -min walk distance increased significantly from baseline (CTEPH from 312 +/- 31 to 373 +/- 29 m, p < 0. 003; PAH from 303 +/- 31 to 347 +/- 29, p < 0. 0003). Systolic pulmonary artery pressure showed a trend toward lower value (CTEPH from 85 +/- 7 m to 81 +/- 6 mm Hg, p = NS; PAH from 89 +/- 7 to 82 +/- 5, p = NS). During the observation period {{we did not have}} any death. The drug was well-tolerated with minor side-effects.

40|$|We {{reported}} previously that radiocontrast medium induces caspase-dependent apoptosis {{and that}} cAMP analogs inhibit cell injury in cultured renal tubular cells. In the present study, cellular me-chanisms underlying the protective effects of cAMP were determined. Ioversol, a radiocontrast medium, caused cell injury accompanied by decreases in Bcl- 2, increases in Bax, and caspase activation in LLC-PK 1 cells. Both cell injury and cellular events induced by ioversol were inhibited by dibutyryl cAMP and the prostacyclin analog <b>beraprost.</b> Dibutyryl cAMP increased phosphorylation of Akt and CREB, {{both of which}} were reversed by H 89, wortmannin and the Akt inhibitor SH- 6. The protective effect of dibutyryl cAMP was also reversed by these kinase inhibitors. In dominant-negative CREB-transfected cells, dibutyryl cAMP no longer prevented cell injury or inhibited changes in mRNA expression of Bcl- 2 and Bax. In mice with unilateral renal occlusion, ioversol increased urinary ex-cretion of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase with con-comitant decreases in Bcl- 2 mRNA, increases in Bax mRNA, activation of caspase- 3, and induction of apoptosis in tubular and interstitial cells. <b>Beraprost</b> completely reversed these in vivo effects of ioversol. These findings suggest that elevation of endogenous cAMP effectively prevents radiocontrast nephropathy through activation of A kinase/PI 3 -kinase/Akt followed by CREB phosphorylation and enhanced expression of Bcl- 2...|$|E

40|$|Prostacyclin therapies for the {{treatment}} of pulmonary arterial hypertension M. Gomberg-Maitland * and H. Olschewski# ABSTRACT: Prostacyclin and its analogues (prostanoids) are potent vasodilators and possess antithrombotic, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory properties. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with vasoconstriction, thrombosis and proliferation, and the lack of endogenous prostacyclin may considerably contribute to this condition. This supports a strong rationale for prostanoid use as therapy for this disease. The first experiences of prostanoid therapy in PH patients were published in 1980. Epoprostenol, a synthetic analogue of prostacyclin, and the chemically stable analogues iloprost, <b>beraprost</b> and treprostinil were tested in randomised controlled trials. The biological actions are mainly mediated by activation of specific receptors of the target cells; however, new data suggest effects on additional intracellular pathways. In the USA and some European countries, intravenous infusion of epoprostenol and treprostinil, as well as subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil and inhalation of iloprost, have been approved for therapy of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Iloprost infusion and <b>beraprost</b> tablets have been approved in few other countries. Ongoing clinical studies investigate oral treprostinil, inhaled treprostinil and the combination of inhaled iloprost and sildenafil in pulmonary arterial hypertension. Combination of other targeted therapies with prostanoids appears to be effective and safe. After 25 yrs of continued knowledge, prostanoids remain a mainstay in {{the treatment}} of pulmonary arterial hypertension...|$|E
