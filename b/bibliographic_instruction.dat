A Hunter College librarian, with public library experience, offered a series of drop-in workshops Saturday afternoons open to all students and questions regarding Web or Windows use in the academic year, 2000 - 2001. The intention of the workshops was to address the continuous need of students lacking technological and informational literacy. The success of these workshops led to this investigation of the implications of 21 st century technology on non-traditional students from the perspective of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instructions</b> as well as reference desk service. The perspective is that of the urban educational environment of City University of New York and Hunter College. The histories of open admissions at CUNY and the current efforts to abolish remediation are examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{practice}} of active learning in library instructions {{can be traced}} back to the 90 s and is seen to have exponentially expanded with the rapid advancement of technology. As opposed to the traditional lecture-based <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instructions,</b> engaging students in the learning process has become more and more indispensable in the current world. The concept of brain-based library can be used to further enhance active learning environment in a library instruction. The presentation intends to relate active learning to the changing pattern of information access, which is crucial in dealing with the digital natives that become the patrons of today’s libraries. Thus general findings from brain researches will be highlighted to associate with active learning instructions towards the transformation of brain-based libraries in developing future minds. The presentation also aims to showcase what has been implemented in a Malaysian library context of active learning. Though not fully embracing the ideals of active learning, it can be observed that some methods of active learning have been employed in conducting library instructions, or locally commonly known as user education programmes...|$|R
50|$|Farber {{was highly}} {{regarded}} as a leader and authority {{on the subject of}} <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instruction,</b> he began hosting conferences on the subject at Earlham College in 1977. He developed a successful <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instruction</b> program tailored to Earlham College in its specific context. This mainly entailed integrating the instruction into specific college courses within the college’s curriculum. His five defining points of the college’s <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instruction</b> program in 1974 included flexibility and variety in the methods of instruction, the use of structured examples and illustrations in the instruction process, personalized reference services, the perception of librarians as educators, and the extension of the library’s resources to include those materials presented as much as possible. The central objectives of the program at that time were to indicate to students the differences between high school and academic libraries, to show that resources relevant to nearly any topic exist and the importance of choosing the most important and pertinent ones, to illustrate basic search strategy principles transferable to any topic, to emphasize the amount of resources that exist and the usefulness of working with a reference librarian, and to develop a readiness to search outside of the library if necessary. This approach to <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instruction</b> arose from his observations that colleges provide a particularly suitable context for both librarians and faculty to emphasize undergraduate education more than research.|$|E

40|$|This study {{looked into}} {{the various types of}} user- {{education}} offered in Covenant University. These include library orientation, teaching of use of library and study skills, basic <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instructions</b> etc. The research revealed that the highest impact of user education on students is equipping them with good search skills as indicated by 93. 9 % respondents, acquainting them with available resources and their format as represented by 82. 6 % and exposing them to library rules and regulations among others. The major challenges hindering students from maximizing user education is that of scheduling library orientation too close to resumption as portrayed by 711 (90. 8 %) respondents and large number of student participants, resulting in noise. The study recommends that the orientation be scheduled after conclusion of admissions so that all students will benefit from it. More periods should be allocated to the teaching of use of library and study skills {{as well as that of}} orientation. The study concludes by encouraging Covenant University library to keep building search skills in its new patrons while making adjustments where necessary. It also encourages other university libraries lacking in this regard to follow suit...|$|R
40|$|Library {{orientation}} {{also called}} as user education, library <b>instruction,</b> library tour, <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instructions,</b> and others. It {{depends on the}} library objective and their set of programs, but {{the goals of the}} program are same, that is to make user or student become literate on information provided in the library. According to Hoppenfeld (2012), library instruction is the most valuable services reference librarians can provide to user. It allows them to help students to do their research. Since the library as a place to user allocates the information, the library orientation program should introduce about library materials and systems. That means, the program should systematically design for users know how to locate the information in the library. Nicole (2010), state that library instruction as a where a librarian should to instruct the students on how to successfully and efficiently manipulate the library information resources in a systematic manner. So in researcher opinion, the librarian should play their roles to make user become information literate. Susan and Davidson (2010), state that library orientation programs help new students become familiar with all the library services and facilities has to offer in support of their academic efforts, fn addition, according to fngersoff and Cutshaw (2004), in the new aged of library, the librarian must be multi-skilled. They also state that The librarian is a unique breed. This is because the librarian position requires someone who not only understands about libraries and computers but someone who can put both fields into context", Ingersoll and Culshaw, (2004). Meanwhile, Crum, Judkins and Zeigen (2002) also state that the library orientation is the best of time and opportunity to give new students a look what library has provider to user. In addition, Lamouroux (2008) state that "A few hours' training will not make users become an expert but it can helps students do not feel lost when their searches turn do not understand. ...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{academic}} librarians provide reference {{services to}} students, faculty, and staff; support {{curriculum and instruction}} through collection building and management of information resources; and provide <b>bibliographic</b> support and <b>instruction</b> to increase information literacy among patrons. Most institutions were already providing support to distance education students, faculty, and staff. The ACRL’s ‘’Standards for Distance Learning Library Services’’ made it necessary to formalize the function, roles, and duties of academic librarians who support distance education students {{and led to the}} creation of the job title distance education librarian.|$|R

40|$|Between 1996 and 2001, the Health Science Center Libraries and Department of Zoology at the University of Florida partnered {{to provide}} a {{cohesive}} and comprehensive learning experience to undergraduate students in PCB 3063, “Genetics. ” During one semester each year, a librarian worked with up to 120 undergraduates, providing <b>bibliographic</b> and database <b>instruction</b> in the tools that practicing geneticists use (MEDLINE, GenBank, BLAST, etc.). Students learned to evaluate and synthesize {{the information that they}} retrieved, coupling it with information provided in classroom lectures, thus resulting in well-researched short papers on an assigned genetics topic. Exit surveys of students indicated that the majority found the library sessions and librarian's instruction to be useful. Responses also indicated that the project facilitated increased understanding of genetics concepts and appreciation for the scientific research process and the relevance of genetics to the real world. The library benefited from this partnership on a variety of fronts, including the development of skilled library users, pretrained future clientele, and increased visibility among campus research laboratories. The course and associated information instruction and assigned projects can be considered models for course-integrated instruction and the role of medical libraries in undergraduate education...|$|R
5000|$|Library instruction, {{also called}} <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instruction</b> (BI), user {{education}} and library orientation, consists of [...] "instructional {{programs designed to}} teach library users how to locate {{the information they need}} quickly and effectively.

Regarding the benefits of an ideal cooperative relationship between faculty and librarians, he stated: [...] "When that cooperative relationship works well, it can result in assignments that approach, if not reach, what I consider the ideal: where both the teacher’s objectives and the librarian’s objectives are not only achieved, but are mutually reinforcing - the teacher’s objectives being those that help students attain {{a better understanding of the}} course’s subject matter, and the librarian’s objectives being those that enhance the students’ ability to find and evaluate information." ...|$|E

An 84 response rate was achieved resulting in 308 questionnaires that were returned and {{were found to be}} useful. The analysis of data was based on these 308 usable returns. Gender, nationality and <b>bibliographic</b> <b>instruction</b> were employed as independent variables to examine their effects on each of the five (5) library anxiety sub-scales: barriers with service providers, comfort with library services, affective barriers, cognitive barriers and comfort with library technology. The results of running independent sample t-tests on each of the five(5) sub-scales with gender as the independent variable was found to be statistically significant only on the "cognitive barriers "sub-scale, t (303) = 2. 22, p. 05.
