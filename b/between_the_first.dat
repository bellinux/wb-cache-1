5|$|Basically, the {{parallels}} concern {{the presence of}} first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, the Iliad itself has also been examined in a similar light.

5|$|During the Cold War Era, the {{relationships}} <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> World, Second World and the Third World were very rigid. The First World and Second World were at constant odds {{with one another}} via the tensions between their two cores, the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively. The Cold War, {{by virtue of its}} name, was a primarily ideological struggle <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> and Second Worlds, or more specifically, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Multiple doctrines and plans dominated Cold War dynamics including the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan (from the U.S) and the Molotov Plan (from the Soviet Union). The extent of the odds between the two worlds is evident in Berlin—which was then split into East and West. To stop citizens in East Berlin from having too much exposure to the capitalist West, the Soviet Union put up the Berlin Wall within the actual city.|$|E
