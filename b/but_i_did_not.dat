In my name and over my signature, inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable statements {{were given to the}} committee, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> intend to mislead the committee... I brought down on the people's house a controversy which could weaken the faith people have in their government." ...|$|E

He stated, [...] "I always knew I wanted to be in films <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know exactly what I wanted to do. I loved movies and watched a lot of them.

With the stadium packed with Benfica fans, Penafiel surprised Benfica and beat them 1–0, costing them first place. After the game, Trappattoni said, [...] "It was good game <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> expect this outcome. We have to keep morale because Saturday we have a important game.

500|$|Nonetheless, the Emperor's {{infatuation with}} the Countess {{sometimes}} put Teresa Cristina {{in an awkward}} position, as when her younger daughter Leopoldina naively asked her why PedroII kept nudging Barral's foot during their class. The Countess's increasing intimacy {{with her husband and}} daughter was painful and vexing to Teresa Cristina. Although she feigned ignorance of the situation, it did not pass unnoticed. She wrote in her diary that Barral [...] "wished to make me tell her that I did not like her, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> say either yes or no." [...] Historian Tobias Monteiro wrote that the Empress [...] "could not disguise that she detested Barral." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{social worker}} and a police officer from Haringey council, Lisa Arthurworrey and Karen Jones, respectively, were {{assigned}} to her case, and were scheduled to make a home visit on 4 August 1999; however, the visit was cancelled once they heard about the scabies. Jones later said, [...] "it might not be logical <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> know anything about scabies." [...] She said that she telephoned North Middlesex Hospital {{for information about the}} disease, but Garnham had evidence that the staff there dealt with no such inquiry. Jones was told by a doctor that Climbié's injuries were consistent with belt buckle marks, although she claimed in the inquiry {{there was no evidence of}} child abuse.|$|E
500|$|Virgil Earp {{reported}} afterward, [...] "Two shots {{went off}} right together. Billy Clanton's {{was one of}} them."

I knew that Frank McLaury had {{the reputation of being}} a good shot and a dangerous man, and I aimed at Frank McLaury." [...] He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: [...] "The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury." [...] Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.|$|E

According to historian Francisco Doratioto, Luís Alves answered that [...] "between {{the love of his}} father and his duty to the crown, he would stay with the latter." [...] PedroI expressed gratitude for his loyalty, but instead ordered him to take the Emperor's Battalion to the Field of Santana and join the rebels, preferring abdication to bloodshedding. Decades later, Luís Alves said in the Brazilian Senate: [...] "I marched along with the Emperor's Battalion to the Field of Santana, out of devotion to competent orders [...] I was not a revolutionary. I esteemed the Abdication. I judged that it would be of advantage to Brazil, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> concur directly or indirectly with it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] {{was written}} by Alain Whyte, Allessandro Benassi, Brian Kennedy, Chris Brown, Jean-Baptiste, Marco Benassi, Michael McHenry, Nick Marsh, Priscilla Hamilton, Ryan Buendia and William Orbit. It was {{produced}} by Benny and Alle Benassi, David Guetta, Free School, Orbit and Kennedy. [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] was originally intended for American pop singer Madonna's twelfth studio album MDNA (2012); however, she could not record the song because of her tight schedule, and Orbit gave the song to Brown. After an unofficial version of [...] "Don't Wake Me Up" [...] was leaked online in January 2012, websites reported that the song was produced by David Guetta. However, Guetta said on his Facebook and Twitter accounts, [...] "I'm credited for 'Don't Wake Me Up' ... <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> produce this record. Best to CB!".|$|E
500|$|Sherman {{pressured}} {{his friends}} in the Senate to defeat the bill, or to limit it to production of a larger silver dollar, which would actually be worth 1/16th its weight in gold. These efforts were unsuccessful, but Allison's amendment made the bill less financially risky. Sherman thought Hayes should sign the amended bill but did not press the matter, and the President vetoed it. [...] "In view of the strong public sentiment {{in favor of the}} free coinage of the silver dollar", he later wrote, [...] "I thought it better to make no objections to the passage of the bill, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> care to antagonize the wishes of the President." [...] Congress overrode Hayes's veto and the bill became law. The effects of the Bland–Allison Act were limited: the premium on gold over silver continued to grow, and financial conditions in the country continued to improve.|$|E

500|$|After the World War, {{according}} to Beldie, actor Iancovescu introduced impressions of Bogdan-Pitești to his cabaret routine. It showed the convicted Garmanophile and an unnamed German official, who {{looked into the}} mislanding of propaganda funds on supporting petty [...] "henchmen". To this charge, the fictional Bogdan-Pitești replies: [...] "I have consumed your money, this much is true, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> pull one on you! For {{how is it that}} you could imagine me, a traitor of my country, not also being a con artist?" [...] According to Beldie, the account has a grain of truth: instead of using money to revive the Germanophile cause, Bogdan-Pitești directed them into his art collection. A somewhat similar version of this urban legend is included in the memoirs of a National Liberal adversary, I. G. Duca, who sees Bogdan-Pitești's retort as a paradoxical sign of injured patriotism: [...] "Did you perhaps think that you might buy off some of Romania's honest people? You would be dead wrong, in this land one can only buy off the con artists, only con artists such as myself." [...] Duca concludes: [...] "this reply, with its admirable and atavistic national dignity, tempts me to forget, though not to forgive, the utter turpitude that we call Bogdan-Pitești's life." ...|$|E
500|$|In the World Rally Championship, Mouton {{made her}} driver debut in 1974, {{finishing}} 12th in the Tour de Corse in an Alpine A110. It was rumoured her good performances {{were the result}} of a special engine, however her car passed inspection by WRC scrutineers. At the end of the year, Mouton was crowned both French and European ladies' champion. Re-entering the Tour de Corse the following season, she took seventh place. Mouton successfully defended her ladies' titles, and also competed in circuit racing: In an all-female team with Christine Dacremont and Marianne Hoepfner, she won the two-litre prototype category of the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans. Recalling the race in 2008, Mouton said: [...] "It started to rain I remember, and I started to pass everybody. I was running on slicks. In the pits they were saying 'Michele you must stop', <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to because I was passing everyone." [...] Her results attracted a major sponsor {{in the form of the}} French oil company Elf. In 1976, Mouton drove the A110 to 11th place in Monte Carlo and retired at the Rallye Sanremo. At the Tour de Corse, her debut in the newer A310 also ended in retirement.|$|E
500|$|The {{severity}} of the destructive acts by Union troops was significantly greater in South Carolina than in Georgia or North Carolina. This {{appears to have been}} a consequence of the animosity among both Union soldiers and officers to the state that they regarded as the [...] "cockpit of secession". One of the most serious accusations against Sherman was that he allowed his troops to burn the city of Columbia. In 1867, Gen. O. O. Howard, commander of Sherman's 15th Corps, reportedly said, [...] "It is useless to deny that our troops burnt Columbia, for I saw them in the act." [...] However, Sherman himself stated that [...] "f I had made up my mind to burn Columbia I would have burnt it with no more feeling than I would a common prairie dog village; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> do it ..." [...] Sherman's official report on the burning placed the blame on Confederate Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton III, who Sherman said had ordered the burning of cotton in the streets. In his memoirs, Sherman said, [...] "In my official report of this conflagration I distinctly charged it to General Wade Hampton, and confess I did so pointedly to shake the faith of his people in him, for he was in my opinion a braggart and professed to be the special champion of South Carolina." [...] Historian James M. McPherson has concluded that: ...|$|E

500|$|The 12th Man {{tradition}} {{began in}} Dallas on January 2, 1922, at the Dixie Classic, {{the forerunner of}} the Cotton Bowl Classic. [...] A played defending national champion Centre College in the first postseason game in the southwest. [...] In this hard-fought game, which produced national publicity, an underdog Aggie team was slowly defeating a team which had allowed fewer than six points per game. The first half produced so many injuries for A, Coach D. X. Bible feared {{he would not have}} enough men to finish the game. [...] At that moment, he called into the Aggie section of the stands for E. King Gill, a student who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Gill, who was spotting players for a Waco newspaper and was not in football uniform, donned the uniform of injured player Heine Weir and stood on the sidelines to await his turn. Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. When the game ended in a 22-14 Aggie victory, Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. Gill later said, [...] "I wish I could say that I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not.</b> I simply stood by in case my team needed me." [...] A statue of E. King Gill stands to the north of Kyle Field to remind Aggies of their constant obligation to preserve the spirit of the 12th Man.|$|E
