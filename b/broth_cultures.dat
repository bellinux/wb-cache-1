Methods: Prospective cross-sectional study performed at Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of Aga Khan University. During the period of February 2013 –September 2014, a total of 139 adult, MDR-pulmonary TB patients were enrolled in this study. For each patient an appropriate sputum specimen was collected for MTB culture initially and then monthly (maximum) up to the next 6 months.

Results: To date, a total of 502 sputum samples were submitted from 139 enrolled patients. Out of these, 170 were smear-positive, while 310 were smear-negative. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of micro colony <b>broth</b> <b>culture</b> for AFB smear positive samples were 100 % (95 % CI: 97. 83 – 100), 95. 45 % (95 % CI: 77. 08 – 99. 24), 99. 42 % (95 % CI: 96. 77 – 99. 90), and 100. 00 % (95 % CI: 83. 75 – 100. 00), respectively.

Average time of positivity of standard cultures for smear positive samples (n = 192) was 26. 0 days, while micro colony <b>broth</b> <b>culture</b> average positivity time was 8. 8 days.

In this study, we investigated the effects of H. pylori <b>broth</b> <b>culture</b> supernatants on epidermal growth factor (EGF) -mediated signal transduction pathways in a gastric carcinoma cell line (KATO III).
