5|$|After {{considering}} various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since {{named the}} Emirates Stadium, about 500metres south-west of Highbury.|$|E
5|$|As part of Oslo's bid to {{host the}} FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was {{necessary}} to build a normal hill, as Holmenkollbakken only consists of a large hill. Several proposals were made, including converting Holmenkollbakken to a normal hill and <b>building</b> <b>a</b> large hill in Rødkleiva, or <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new hill in Holmenkollen and <b>building</b> <b>a</b> small hill in Rødkleiva. Alternatively, a new small hill could be built at the location of the demolished Midtstubakken, next to Holmenkollbakken. City Councilor for Culture Anette Wiig Bryn (Progress Party) supported <b>building</b> <b>a</b> large hill in Rødkleiva and reducing Holmenkollbakken to a small hill.|$|E

5|$|Other {{proposals}} {{were made in}} 1715, this time by the knight René Jacob de Tigné {{and a team of}} French engineers. There were several different plans, including <b>building</b> <b>a</b> coastal battery and a redoubt. Other plans included <b>building</b> <b>a</b> four-bastioned fort, or combining all three (fort, battery and redoubt) for the defence of the island.|$|E

50|$|The {{main house}} {{and five other}} {{contributing}} <b>buildings</b> (<b>a</b> wagon shed, a barn, a jail, a workshop, and a bunkhouse) were all built during 1899-1900. Newer <b>buildings</b> (<b>a</b> garage, a shop, and a walk-in freezer) are not contributing but do not detract greatly from the historic feeling of the property.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the {{pumping station}} was a complex which {{comprised}} three two-storey <b>buildings</b> and <b>a</b> tall chimney for the boiler. The first <b>building</b> consisted <b>an</b> engine {{house and a}} boiler house. The second <b>building</b> had <b>a</b> workshop {{on the ground floor}} and fitters' quarters on the first floor. Between the first building and the second <b>building</b> was <b>a</b> chimney. For the third <b>building,</b> <b>an</b> office, a store, a boy and coolie room, a cook House and a latrine are the components of the ground floor, while there was overseers' quarters on the first floor.|$|R

5|$|Work on <b>building</b> <b>a</b> {{smaller and}} cheaper {{computer}} began in 1952, {{in parallel with}} Meg's ongoing development. Two of Kilburn's team, Richard Grimsdale and D. C. Webb, {{were assigned to the}} task of designing and <b>building</b> <b>a</b> machine using the newly developed transistors instead of valves. Initially the only devices available were germanium point-contact transistors, less reliable than the valves they replaced but which consumed far less power.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a simple}} example, [...] could be <b>a</b> <b>building,</b> and [...] {{could be the}} number of people in the building. The surface [...] would consist of the walls, doors, roof, and {{foundation}} of the building. Then the continuity equation states that {{the number of people}} in the building increases when people enter the <b>building</b> (<b>an</b> inward flux through the surface), decreases when people exit the <b>building</b> (<b>an</b> outward flux through the surface), increases when someone in the <b>building</b> gives birth (<b>a</b> source, [...] ), and decreases when someone in the <b>building</b> dies (<b>a</b> sink, [...] ).|$|R

5|$|A {{radioisotope}} <b>building,</b> <b>a</b> steam plant, {{and other}} structures were added in April 1946 {{to support the}} laboratory's peacetime educational and research missions. All work was completed by December, adding another $1,009,000 {{to the cost of}} construction at X-10, and bringing the total cost to $13,041,000. Operational costs added another $22,250,000.|$|E
5|$|A red-painted {{house for}} the {{signalman}} was put up close to the station. Tryvandsbanen also developed plans for <b>building</b> <b>a</b> station house with a waiting shed, but these never materialised. The name of the red-painted house was changed from Nordpolen ("The North Pole") to Norden ("The North") and it was modernised after {{the removal of the}} tracks. The station was included on the Nordmarka maps published in 1913 and 1938.|$|E
5|$|Access {{routes to}} the estate were also added to and enhanced; there were three {{driveways}} giving approaches from the North Downs, Dorking and from the railway at the west. Cubitt was responsible for <b>building</b> <b>a</b> siding {{on the north side}} of Dorking Town railway station, which was initially used for trains delivering building materials required for the mansion's construction.|$|E
500|$|From February 2001 to November 2005, Duke spent $835 {{million on}} 34 major {{construction}} projects {{as part of}} a five-year strategic plan, [...] "Building on Excellence."

5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{the site in}} 1142, they began <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle's chapel, which {{was replaced by the}} present chapel. In 1163 the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.|$|E
5|$|After {{advancing}} to the Imperial Age, players can also construct a Wonder, an extremely expensive non-military building. On many gameplay modes, <b>building</b> <b>a</b> Wonder triggers a victory countdown—unless it's destroyed within a certain timeframe, the building player wins. Every civilization's Wonder is {{in the shape of}} a landmark unique to that historical culture—the Temple of Heaven for the Chinese, for example, or Notre Dame for the Franks.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1898, without <b>building</b> <b>a</b> dam, the {{original}} Lower Bonnington Power Plant was generating hydroelectricity from Bonnington Falls in the Kootenay River near {{the confluence of}} the Slocan River in order to supply water to mines in Rossland, British Columbia.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, {{the school}} {{expanded}} yet again, <b>building</b> <b>an</b> adjacent <b>building</b> containing <b>a</b> gym, a new cafeteria, a computer lab, a library and class spaces for the cegep.|$|R
50|$|In 1899 Vincent Stuckey Lean left a bequest of £50,000 for <b>a</b> new library <b>building.</b> <b>As</b> a result, in 1906 {{the library}} {{was moved to the}} newly built Bristol Central Library on College Green. The King Street <b>building</b> {{eventually}} became <b>a</b> restaurant.|$|R

5|$|As of 2008, Arsenal's {{season ticket}} waiting list stood at 40,000 people. The {{potential}} for expanding the stadium {{is a common}} topic within fan debate. Potential expansion methods include, make seats smaller, filling in the dips {{in the corners of}} the stadium though this would block airflow, and replacing the roof with a third level and <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new roof. There has also been discussion on the implementation of safe standing.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish heavy vehicle {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) was <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new factory in Karis, a location considered {{less likely than}} Helsinki to come under attack from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered <b>building</b> <b>a</b> new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in heavy vehicle production but economic and technical resources were limited. Heavy vehicle importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E
5|$|Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet {{was largely}} {{obsolete}} at {{the outbreak of}} World War I, and over {{the first two years}} of the war the Austro-Hungarian Navy focused its efforts on <b>building</b> <b>a</b> U-boat fleet for local defense within the Adriatic. With boats to fill that need either under construction or purchased from Germany, efforts were focused on building ocean-going submarines for operation in the wider Mediterranean, outside the Adriatic.|$|E
