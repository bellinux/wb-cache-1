5|$|Bayern is one {{of three}} {{professional}} football clubs in Munich. Bayern's main local rival is 1860 Munich, who were the more successful club in the 1960s, winning a cup and a championship. In the 1970s and 1980s, 1860 Munich moved between the first and the third division <b>but</b> <b>lately,</b> have settled in the second division. The Munich derby is still a much-anticipated event, getting a lot of extra attention from supporters of both clubs. 1860 Munich is considered more working-class, and therefore suffers from a diminishing fan base in a city where the manufacturing sector is declining. Bayern is considered the establishment club, which is reflected by many board members being business leaders and including the former Bavarian minister president, Edmund Stoiber. Despite the rivalry, Bayern has repeatedly supported 1860 in times of financial disarray.|$|E

500|$|New York Post Robert Rorke {{reviewed}} the numerous characters with heavy romantic development, noting perpetual [...] "merry-go-round of hookups, breakups and makeup sex", while describing {{the lack of}} sentimental involvement of Katherine Heigl's character {{in the first half}} of the season. However, he deemed Izzie Stevens [...] "the hear and soul" [...] of the [...] "sex-filled series", due to the season mostly focusing on the events that come to define her as a person. Rorke named her the show's heroine, and wrote that [...] "Izzie is a welcome, calming presence, despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fiancé Denny Duquette", considering her to have been more prominent than the title character, Meredith Grey, whose storyline received negative critiques: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas. <b>But</b> <b>lately,</b> she's been a little dopey, with that endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] He also noted Meredith's decreasing importance in the ongoing arc, describing how Sandra Oh's character development was vital to the success of the season, as he compared her [...] "cutthroat exterior" [...] with the emotional side of her personality that evolves throughout the season. New York Post compared Izzie, who is described as having achieved a depth, to Miranda Bailey, noting the maturity they have, which is uncharacteristic to the fellow interns. Robert Rorke positively reviewed Chandra Wilson's performance by stating that she was [...] "formidable".|$|E

[...] In another article, Borden heavily criticized the writing for Chloe's character.

She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime. She is way too much woman to be cheated on by someone like Chance." [...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe never had much chemistry.

We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt."

Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward.

500|$|Former {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Grey's relationships storylines while reviewing the second season's finale: [...] "On those occasions when Meredith's {{not involved in}} a plot about her love life, I do kind of like her, but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really, really can't stand her." [...] During the show's third season, {{the development of the}} character received negative reviews, with Cristopher Monfette of IGN stating that her storyline has become [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Also during the third season, Robert Rorke of the New York Post noted the decline in Meredith's role in the show, expressing disappointment: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, <b>but</b> <b>lately,</b> she's been a little dopey, what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Similarly, Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused, [...] "This whole 'Oh I need more time,' but 'Oh, I'm jealous if you look at someone else' angst was tired in the second season, frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer. The will-they-or-won't-they plot doesn't work because they've already {{been in and out of}} that relationship too many times. Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked."

500|$|Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV had a {{generally}} mixed to positive {{perspective on the}} episode, expressing hope in its further development. Although originally criticizing the predictability of the event, Dahl noted an [...] "undeniable sense of originality", deeming the episode a portal to the series becoming [...] "a medical chick flick, but a damn good one". Highly praising the [...] "big and attractive" [...] cast, Dahl positively received {{the interaction between the}} characters, noting the [...] "smart" [...] dialogue that helps each character evolve. However, Dahl expressed disappointment in the over emotional scenes, describing them as [...] "off-putting" [...] and [...] "not believable", while comparing them to real life interactions between people who emote in a more sublte manner than displayed on television. [...] "Emotions ran high in the premiere and there was much crying", stated Dahl, but noted that the dialogue, who he had previously been worried would be [...] "too cutesy", was not bothering, and rather realistic, noting how the show is [...] "smartly written". He also described the Pompeo and Heigl's as [...] "worthy of attention". After the episode's broadcast, Robert Rorke of the New York Post deemed Stevens [...] "the heart and soul" [...] of the series, due to the episode mostly focusing on the events that come to define her as a person. Rorke named her the show's heroine, and wrote that [...] "Izzie is a welcome, calming presence, despite the devastation she experienced when she failed to save her patient and fiance Denny Duquette", considering her to have been more prominent than the title character, Grey, whose storyline received negative critiques: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmeas. <b>But</b> <b>lately,</b> she's been a little dopey, with that endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Abigail Chao of Television Without Pity had a positive outlook on the episode. She praised the storyline of Izzie lying on the bathroom floor, describing at as [...] "a perfect opportunity for flashbacks", which proved the strong friendship the five interns share. Montgomery's reaction to the discovery of Grey's underwear was deemed by Chao [...] "hilarious", whereas Bailey's interaction with the quarantined patient was described as [...] "touching". [...] "Now it's Meredith's turn to be feckless and indecisive", stated Chao, noting the lack of realism in Grey's love triangle with Shepherd and Dandridge.

500|$|The title {{character}} of Grey's Anatomy, Meredith, has received both overwhelmingly positive and weary feedback by critics along {{the course of}} the show, with the development of the character garnering praise from majority critics. Earlier reactions for Meredith were mixed; in a 2006 review, Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times dubbed to her as [...] "the heroine of Grey's Anatomy". A reviewer for BuddyTV praised the distinct uniqueness in the character calling Meredith an [...] "unconventional heroine" [...] adding that the character was, [...] "Neither black nor white but always...wait for it...many shades of grey. The reviewer and to add that even in her lighter moments, she has still been [...] "dark and twisty." [...] The sentiment was shared by Glenn Diaz who remarked, [...] "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy." [...] When Pompeo did not receive a nomination 61st Primetime Emmy Awards, for her work as Meredith, Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times suggested that Pompeo, [...] "has worked very hard [...] to make Meredith Grey an interesting character", and should have received a nomination. IGN Monfette, less impressed by the character, criticized her storyline as [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a season's worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Robert Rorke of the New York Post was critical of Meredith's relationship with Derek Shepherd, writing: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, <b>but</b> <b>lately,</b> she's been a little dopey, what with the endless 'McDreamy' soliloquies." [...] The development of the character has received praise from critics. Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." [...] Rick Porter reviewing the episode How to Save a Life from the eleventh season for Zap2it wrote, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episode, the likes of which the show has done several times before. He added. [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] may not be the ideal Emmy-submission episode for Ellen Pompeo, considering Meredith is off screen for more than half of it. But it's among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] Janalen Samson of BuddyTV lauded the Meredith's development throughout the series saying, [...] "When one considers how this character has grown over eleven seasons, it really is amazing. Kudos to Ellen Pompeo for her fine work. She's actually done the impossible, because I actually care what happens to Meredith Grey." [...] Reviewing the season 12 premiere Sledgehammer critics including Alex Hawkins of the Western Gazette again highlighted Pompeo's due for an Emmy Award.|$|E
