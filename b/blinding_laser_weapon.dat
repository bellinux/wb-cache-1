50|$|Weapons {{designed}} to cause permanent blindness are {{banned by the}} 1995 United Nations Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>Weapons.</b> The dazzler is a non-lethal weapon intended to cause temporary blindness or disorientation and therefore falls outside this protocol.|$|R
50|$|The {{personnel}} halting and stimulation response rifle (PHASR) is {{a prototype}} non-lethal laser dazzler {{developed by the}} Air Force Research Laboratory's Directed Energy Directorate, U.S. Department of Defense. Its purpose is to temporarily disorient and blind a target. <b>Blinding</b> <b>laser</b> <b>weapons</b> have been tested in the past, but were banned under the 1995 UN Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>Weapons,</b> which the United States acceded to on 21 January 2009. The PHASR rifle, a low-intensity laser, is not prohibited under this regulation, as the blinding effect {{is intended to be}} temporary. It also uses a two-wavelength laser. The PHASR was tested at Kirtland Air Force Base, part of the Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate in New Mexico.|$|R
50|$|The Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>Weapons,</b> Protocol IV of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, {{was issued}} by the United Nations on 13 October 1995.

25|$|After the Korean War, North Korea {{maintained}} a powerful, but smaller military force {{than that of}} South Korea. In 1967 the KPA forces of about 345,000 were {{much smaller than the}} South Korean ground forces of about 585,000. North Korea's relative isolation and economic plight starting from the 1980s has now tipped the balance of military power {{into the hands of the}} better-equipped South Korean military. In response to this predicament, North Korea relies on asymmetric warfare techniques and unconventional weaponry to achieve parity against high-tech enemy forces. North Korea is reported to have developed a wide range of technologies towards this end, such as stealth paint to conceal ground targets, midget submarines and human torpedoes, <b>blinding</b> <b>laser</b> <b>weapons,</b> and probably has a chemical weapons program and is likely to possess a stockpile of chemical weapons. The Korean People's Army operates ZM-87 anti-personnel lasers, which are banned under the United Nations Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>Weapons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ZM-87 Portable Laser Disturber is a Chinese {{electro-optic}} countermeasure {{neodymium laser}} device. The ZM-87 was primarily intended to blind humans {{but was also}} reported to damage the photo-electric elements in laser rangefinders, videocameras and missile seekers.

50|$|The {{aim of the}} Convention and its Protocols is {{to provide}} new rules for the {{protection}} of civilians from injury by weapons that are used in armed conflicts and also to protect combatants from unnecessary suffering. The convention covers fragments that are undetectable in the human body by X-rays, landmines and booby traps, and incendiary <b>weapons,</b> <b>blinding</b> <b>laser</b> <b>weapons</b> and the clearance of explosive remnants of war. Parties to the convention must take legislative and other actions to ensure compliance with the convention.|$|R

The Seventh Review Conference {{was held}} in Geneva in December 2011, which {{resulted}} in the Final Declaration document that affirmed that [...] "under all circumstances the use of bacteriological (biological) and toxin weapons is effectively prohibited by the Convention". The Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>Weapons,</b> Protocol IV of the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, was issued by the United Nations on October 13, 1995 and came into force on July 30, 1998.|$|R
50|$|The United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW or CCWC), {{concluded}} at Geneva on October 10, 1980, {{and entered}} into force in December 1983, seeks to prohibit or restrict {{the use of}} certain conventional weapons which are considered excessively injurious or whose effects are indiscriminate. The full title is Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects. The convention covers landmines, booby traps, incendiary <b>weapons,</b> <b>blinding</b> <b>laser</b> <b>weapons</b> and clearance of explosive remnants of war.|$|R
50|$|Development of the ZM-87 {{began in}} the late 1980s. The device was first {{publicly}} revealed at a defense exhibition in the Philippines in May 1995 and, soon after, in Abu Dhabi, where the weapon gained publicity. In October 1995, during the United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, Protocol IV, banning <b>blinding</b> <b>laser</b> <b>weapons,</b> was passed, making the ZM-87 illegal. In April 1997 a United States Naval officer sustained a retinal injury consistent with exposure to this sort of laser fired from the Russian freighter Kapitan Man at a Canadian Forces helicopter in which he was a passenger. This became known as the Strait of Juan de Fuca laser incident. By December 2000, known production of ZM-87 has ceased. However, in 2003 North Korea is reported to have used the ZM-87 to illuminate two United States Army Apache helicopters.|$|R
50|$|Lasers {{of all but}} {{the lowest}} powers can {{potentially}} be used as incapacitating weapons, through their ability to produce temporary or permanent vision loss in varying degrees when aimed at the eyes. The degree, character, and duration of vision impairment caused by eye exposure to laser light varies {{with the power of}} the laser, the wavelength(s), the collimation of the beam, the exact orientation of the beam, and the duration of exposure. Lasers of even a fraction of a watt in power can produce immediate, permanent vision loss under certain conditions, making such lasers potential non-lethal but incapacitating weapons. The extreme handicap that laser-induced blindness represents makes the use of lasers even as non-lethal weapons morally controversial, and weapons designed to cause blindness have been banned by the Protocol on <b>Blinding</b> <b>Laser</b> <b>Weapons.</b> Incidents of pilots being exposed to lasers while flying have prompted aviation authorities to implement special procedures to deal with such hazards.|$|R
40|$|Abstract While {{a number}} of {{significant}} campaigns since the early 1990 s have resulted in bans of particular weapons, at least as many equivalent systems have gone unscrutinized and uncondemned by transnational campaigners+ How can this variation be explained? Focusing on the issue area of arms control advocacy, this article argues that an important influence on the advocacy agenda within transnational networks is the decision-making process not of norm entrepreneurs nor of states but of highly connected organizations within a given network+ The argument is illustrated through a comparison between existing norms against landmines and <b>blinding</b> <b>laser</b> <b>weapons,</b> and the absence of serious current consideration of such norms against depleted uranium and autonomous weapons+ Thus, the process of organizational issue selection within nongovernmental organizations ~NGOs! and international organizations ~IOs! most central to particular advocacy networks, rather than the existence of transnational networks around an issue per se, should be a closer focus of attention for scholars interested in norm creation in world politics+ A number of transnational advocacy campaigns have emerged in recent years ben...|$|R
50|$|The CCW is a {{framework}} convention with five protocols, which ban or restrict {{the use of}} various types of weapons that are deemed to cause unnecessary suffering, or affect either soldiers or civilians indiscriminately. The weapons covered include: weapons that leave undetectable fragments in the body (Protocol I - 1980); mines, booby-traps and other devices (Protocol II - 1980, amended in 1996); incendiary weapons (Protocol III - 1980); <b>blinding</b> <b>laser</b> <b>weapons</b> (Protocol IV - 1995); and explosive remnants of war (Protocol V - 2003). As of 1 February 2011, 113 States had joined the Convention. The GICHD has observer status at the High Contracting Parties meetings {{taking place in the}} framework of the CCW.The Centre has an observer status and assists High Contracting Parties, at their request, in their efforts to minimise human suffering caused by landmines, booby traps and other devices, explosive remnants of war and cluster munitions, which are covered by the ongoing work of the CCW and its Group of Governmental Experts. Since 1999, the GICHD has supported the CCW, primarily by providing expert advice in order to promote the development of, and compliance with, the obligations contained in CCW. In addition, the GICHD is administering the CCW Sponsorship Programme, as mandated by the High Contracting Parties at the CCW Third Review Conference in November 2006.|$|R
