In December 1820, the Assembly modified the replevin law to state that creditors who would accept payment in notes from the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> the Commonwealth but not the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky would be forced to wait three months to collect on a debt. The wait was one year if the creditor accepted only notes from the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky, and it remained two years for creditors who would not accept notes from either.|$|E

5|$|As news spread, {{other banks}} and trust {{companies}} {{were reluctant to}} lend any money. The {{interest rates on loans}} to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900. The panic quickly spread to two other large trusts, Trust Company of America and Lincoln Trust Company. By Thursday, October 24, a chain of failures littered the street: Twelfth Ward Bank, Empire City Savings Bank, Hamilton <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> New York, First National <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Brooklyn, International Trust Company of New York, Williamsburg Trust Company of Brooklyn, Borough <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Brooklyn, Jenkins Trust Company of Brooklyn and the Union Trust Company of Providence.|$|E
5|$|Banking also {{developed}} in this period. The <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies {{and so a}} rival Royal <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Scotland was founded in 1727.

5|$|In 1999, the chairman, Lord Alexander of Weedon, {{announced}} a merger with Legal & General {{in a friendly}} £10.7billion deal, the first between a bank and an insurance company in UK history. The move was poorly received in the London financial markets and NatWest's share price fell substantially. Seen as a driver of the ill-advised investment banking expansion, Derek Wanless {{was forced to resign}} as chief executive following the appointment of Sir David Rowland (who became executive chairman). Also in 1999, in response to the much reduced NatWest market capitalisation, the much smaller <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Scotland made a hostile takeover bid for NatWest. The <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Scotland's aim was to break up the NatWest Group and dispose of its non-retail assets. NatWest was forced to abandon its merger, but refused to agree to a takeover by a rival bank. The Royal <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Scotland tabled another hostile offer and trumped the <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Scotland with a £21billion bid. The takeover of NatWest in early 2000 was the biggest in UK history. National Westminster Bank, once Britain's most profitable bank, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and became, with its subsidiaries, component parts of the Royal <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Scotland Group. The outcome of this bitter struggle set the tone for a round of consolidation in the financial sector as it prepared for a new age of fierce global competition. The Royal <b>Bank</b> <b>of</b> Scotland Group became the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (after HSBC) and the fifth largest in the world by market capitalisation. According to Forbes Global 2000, it was then the 13th largest company in the world. NatWest was retained as a distinct brand with its own banking licence, but many back office functions were merged with those of the Royal Bank, leading to over 18,000 job losses.|$|E
