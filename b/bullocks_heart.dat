The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of irrigated fruit orchard cultivation on the stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) of an Arenosol/Quartzpsament from Paraipaba-CE, Semiarid Brazil. Soil samples were taken from irrigated orchards of banana (Musa ssp.), cashew (Anacardium ocidentale), guava (Psidium guajava), <b>bullock's</b> <b>heart</b> (Annona reticulata), mango (Mangifera indica), and sapote (Manilkara zapota) in the wetted-bulb and non-irrigated area between the plant rows. Additional samples were collected from adjacent areas under secondary Caatinga forest, and under a 2 -year-old deforested area. Sampling depths were: 0 - 0. 1, 0. 1 - 0. 2, and 0. 2 - 0. 4 m. The highest contents of SOC and N were found in the surface layer. The soil bulk density did not change in depth. The stocks of SOC and total N under secondary forest at 0 - 0. 40 m layer were 27. 6 and 2. 4 Mg ha- 1, respectively. Caatinga Forest conversion into fruit orchard cultivation led to a decrease of 5 to 23 % and 4 to 21 % on SOC and N stocks, respectively. Compared to other soil uses, sapote and <b>bullock's</b> <b>heart</b> contributed for a lower decrease of SOC and N stocks after deforestation. Guava, <b>bullock's</b> <b>heart,</b> mango and sapote contributed for improving the SOC stratification index...|$|R

Before she sat down to eat the <b>bullock's</b> <b>heart</b> she turned to the young man, and said: 'You did not do that all alone, my friend; but, nevertheless, I will keep my word, and to-morrow you shall go your way.' So they went to bed and slept till dawn.|$|R

But he was not {{prepared}} for the peroration of Jackson's address to him; which consisted of the two <b>bullock</b> <b>hearts,</b> snatched bodily off the dish, and flung at his head, by way of a recapitulation of the preceding arguments. The company then broke up in disgust, and dined elsewhere.|$|R

40|$|AbstractFrom the {{beginning}} of human civilization plants and plant based chemicals {{are the most important}} sources of medicines. Phytochemical and different products obtained from plant are used as medicines, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and food supplements. Annona reticulata Linn. (牛心果 niú xīn guǒ; <b>Bullock's</b> <b>heart)</b> is a versatile tree and its fruits are edible. Parts of A. reticulata are used as source of medicine and also for industrial products. It possesses several medicinal properties such as anthelmintic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, wound healing and cytotoxic effects. It is widely distributed with phytochemicals like tannins, alkaloids, phenols, glycosides, flavonoids and steroids. Present article is an attempt to highlight over taxonomy, morphology, geographical distribution, phytoconstituents and pharmacological activities of A. reticulata reported so far...|$|R
5000|$|Gulab Bagh, {{also known}} as Sajjan Niwas Garden, was built by Maharana Sajjan Singh in the 1881. It is the fourth oldest zoo in the semi-continent. It spans across 66 acres of land, and is hailed {{as one of the}} most {{beautiful}} and largest garden in Rajasthan. [...] By Maharana's volition, a horticulturist from Madras, T.H. Story, was appointed in 1882 to stock the garden with plants with medicinal values on the 66.5 acres of land and worked there till 1920.The garden consisted of a Lotus Pond, and many prominent trees that included many species of mangoes, guava, grapes, lemon, bor, mulbury, rayan, pomegranate, bananas, sapota, tamarind, <b>bullock’s</b> <b>heart</b> (ramphal), lichi, arjun trees, wood apple, karonda, campher, citron, jamun, pummelo, meetha neem, kargi lime, ficus species, anola, jack fruit, dhanverjia, grandi flora, jasmin, dawood etc.In the year 1882, all the trees had their name-plates denoting Hindi, English, and systematic botanical names, which are not the same now.A small pond existed in the garden before it was demolished for the construction of Water works complex. In this pond a water lily, Victoria sp., was initially planted. The leaf of Victoria could withstand a child on a chair kept on it, a property common to all the water-lilies of the genus due to plant's structure.|$|R
6000|$|Then Mrs Pipkin {{spoke up}} with {{a keen sense of}} offence. Ruby Ruggles had had as {{wholesome}} a dinner as any young woman in London,--a <b>bullock's</b> <b>heart</b> and potatoes,--just as much as ever she had pleased to eat of it. Mrs Pipkin could tell Mr Crumb that there was 'no starvation nor yet no stint in her house.' John Crumb immediately produced a very thick and admirably useful blue cloth cloak, which he had brought up with him to London from Bungay, as a present to the woman who had been good to his Ruby. He assured her that he did not doubt that her victuals were good and plentiful, and {{went on to say that}} he had made bold to bring her a trifle out of respect. It was some little time before Mrs Pipkin would allow herself to be appeased;--but at last she permitted the garment to be placed on her shoulders. But it was done after a melancholy fashion. There was no smiling consciousness of the bestowal of joy on the countenance of the donor as he gave it, no exuberance of thanks from the recipient as she received it. Mrs Hurtle, standing by, declared it to be perfect;--but the occasion was one which admitted of no delight. 'It's very good of you, Mr Crumb, to think of an old woman like me,--particularly when you've such a deal of trouble with a young un'.' ...|$|R

Along with Bullock (Donal Logue), they interrogate a bartender for information. Through flashbacks, a man, Jason Lennon (Milo Ventimiglia) seduces Fairchild in the bar and brings her to his house, where he kills her. Upon discovering a painting of a broken <b>heart,</b> <b>Bullock</b> states the murderer is a serial killer known as [...] "The Ogre", who targets young women.

6000|$|April 5.--I am almost devoured by ennui. Pundit is {{the only}} conversible person on board; and he, poor soul! can speak of nothing but antiquities. He has been {{occupied}} all {{the day in the}} attempt to convince me that the ancient Amriccans governed themselves!--did ever anybody hear of such an absurdity?--that they existed in a sort of every-man-for-himself confederacy, after the fashion of the [...] "prairie dogs" [...] that we read of in fable. He says that they started with the queerest idea conceivable, viz: that all men are born free and equal--this in the very teeth of the laws of gradation so visibly impressed upon all things both in the moral and physical universe. Every man [...] "voted," [...] as they called it--that is to say meddled with public affairs--until at length, it was discovered that what is everybody's business is nobody's, and that the [...] "Republic" [...] (so the absurd thing was called) was without a government at all. It is related, however, that the first circumstance which disturbed, very particularly, the self-complacency of the philosophers who constructed this [...] "Republic," [...] was the startling discovery that universal suffrage gave opportunity for fraudulent schemes, by means of which any desired number of votes might at any time be polled, without the possibility of prevention or even detection, by any party which should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the fraud. A little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render evident the consequences, which were that rascality must predominate--in a word, that a republican government could never be any thing but a rascally one. While the philosophers, however, were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen these inevitable evils, and intent upon the invention of new theories, the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of the name of Mob, who took every thing into his own hands and set up a despotism, in comparison with which those of the fabulous Zeros and Hellofagabaluses were respectable and delectable. This Mob (a foreigner, by-the-by), {{is said to have been}} the most odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth. He was a giant in stature--insolent, rapacious, filthy, had the gall of a <b>bullock</b> with the <b>heart</b> of a hyena and the brains of a peacock. He died, at length, by dint of his own energies, which exhausted him. Nevertheless, he had his uses, as every thing has, however vile, and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger of forgetting--never to run directly contrary to the natural analogies. As for Republicanism, no analogy could be found for it upon the face of the earth--unless we except the case of the [...] "prairie dogs," [...] an exception which seems to demonstrate, if anything, that democracy is a very admirable form of government--for dogs.|$|R
