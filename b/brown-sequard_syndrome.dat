40|$|AbstractWe {{present the}} case of a 54 year-old man {{presenting}} with a right <b>Brown-Séquard</b> plus <b>syndrome</b> (BSPS) after a traumatic cervical spinal cord injury. After being operated on with selective tibial neurotomy and triceps surae lengthening because of a right spastic equinus foot, he developed a gait disorder at high speed. The patient complained about an instability of the right knee. Observational gait analysis exhibited an oscillating, flexion/extension motion of the right knee during stance, which was confirmed by gait analysis. Dynamic electromyographic recordings exhibited a clonus of the right rectus femoris (RF) during stance. The spastic activity of the RF and the abnormal knee motion totally reversed after a motor nerve block of the RF, as well as after botulinum toxin type A injection into the RF. We emphasize that complex, spastic gait disorders can benefit from a comprehensive assessment including gait analysis and nerve blocks...|$|R
40|$|Acute and {{subacute}} diseases causing intrinsic {{spinal cord}} damage are confusing and poorly defined clinically and pathologically. {{of this study}} is: The purpose 1. To analyse the spectrum of conditions responsible for acute and subacute myelopathy in South Africa. 2. To categorise the clinical presentations and prognosis of the illnesses and to correlate these with aetiology. 3. To assess the validity of diagnostic criteria for acute and subacute myelopathy in general and for the different aetiological groups. 4. To review the literature and to correlate previous studies with the present one. Thirty-four patients fulfilling strict criteria nave been identified over a seven-and-a-half-year period using the Groote Schuur Hospital computer retrieval system. Although the study was essentially retrospective, 11 of these patients were seen personally during their acute illnesses. All these patients have suffered from illnesses causing spinal cord dysfunction {{in the absence of}} trauma, physical agents or any extrinsic pressure such as might be caused by tumours or spondylosis. Maximum disability was reached in less than 8 weeks. In 17 patients no cause was identified. The clinical features, laboratory findings and courses have been analysed. Among the results, a high percentage of patients with <b>Brown-Sequard</b> <b>Syndromes</b> were found with possible significance for the pathogenesis of the illness. Seven patients with meningovascular syphilis were analysed as well as 2 additional patients with spinal cord syphilis not fulfilling the strict criteria of the study. Although well known before the penicillin era, this entity is not well described in modern neurological literature. Four patients had myelopathy associated with pulmonary tuberculosis in the absence of tuberculous meningitis or spinal disease. Three of these 4 patients also developed optic neuropathy. The association of these conditions has previously been described in only a very few patients. Two patients had Epstein-Barr virus infections and 1 had an infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Two had systemic lupus erythematosus and 1 had an acute cord infarct following an aortic aneurysm repair. The literature is reviewed and {{the findings of this study}} correlated with previous ones. Conclusions regarding terminology, criteria for diagnosis, investigations, course and prognosis are discussed...|$|R
500|$|Spinal cord {{injuries}} generally {{result in}} at least some incurable impairment even with the best possible treatment. The best predictor of prognosis is the level and completeness of injury, as measured by the ASIA impairment scale. The neurological score at the initial evaluation done 72 hours after injury is the best predictor of how much function will return. Most people with ASIA scores of A (complete injuries) do not have functional motor recovery, but improvement can occur. Most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function. Chances of recovering the ability to walk improve with each AIS grade found at the initial examination; e.g. an ASIA D score confers a better chance of walking than a score of C. The symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary {{and it is difficult to}} make an accurate prediction of the outcome. [...] A person with a mild, incomplete injury at the T5 vertebra will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe, complete injury at exactly the same place. Of the incomplete SCI <b>syndromes,</b> <b>Brown-Séquard</b> and central cord syndromes have the best prognosis for recovery and anterior cord syndrome has the worst.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome</b> may {{be caused}} by a spinal cord tumour, trauma as a gunshot wound or {{puncture}} wound to the cervical (neck) or thoracic spine (back), ischemia (obstruction of a blood vessel), or infectious or inflammatory diseases such as tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis. In its pure form, it is rarely seen. The most common cause is penetrating trauma such as a gunshot wound or stab wound to the spinal cord. Decompression sickness may also be a cause of <b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The lateral funiculus transmits the {{contralateral}} corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts. A {{lateral cutting}} of {{the spinal cord}} results in the transection of both ipsilateral posterior column and lateral funiculus and this produces <b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome</b> is rare as {{the trauma}} {{would have to}} be {{something}} that damaged the nerve fibres on just one half of the spinal cord. The classic cause is a stab wound in the back.|$|E
50|$|Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard FRS (8 April 1817 - 2 April 1894), {{also known}} as Charles Edward, was a Mauritian {{physiologist}} and neurologist who, in 1850, became the first to describe {{what is now called}} <b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|In October 1872, {{a lecture}} by C.E. Brown-Sequard was {{published}} that proposed the then-revolutionary idea that one cerebral hemisphere can influence {{both sides of}} the body. The neurologist would go on to describe what is now known as the <b>Brown-Sequard</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{presentation}} can be {{progressive and}} incomplete. It can advance from a typical <b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome</b> to complete paralysis.

50|$|<b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome</b> (also {{known as}} Brown-Séquard's {{hemiplegia}}, Brown-Séquard's paralysis, hemiparaplegic syndrome, hemiplegia et hemiparaplegia spinalis, or spinal hemiparaplegia) {{is caused by}} damage to {{one half of the}} spinal cord, resulting in paralysis and loss of proprioception on the same (or ipsilateral) side as the injury or lesion, and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite (or contralateral) side as the lesion. It is named after physiologist Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who first described the condition in 1850.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{occurs when}} the spinal cord is injured on one side {{much more than the}} other.

On the contralateral (opposite side) of the injury, there is a loss of pain and temperature sensations.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the axons of second-order neurons in posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway, the axons of second-order neurons in the spinothalamic tracts cross at every segmental level in the spinal cord. This fact aids in determining whether a lesion is in the brain or the spinal cord. With lesions in the brain stem or higher, deficits of pain perception, touch sensation, and proprioception are all contralateral to the lesion. With spinal cord lesions, however, the deficit in pain perception is contralateral to the lesion, whereas the other deficits are ipsilateral. See <b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an {{incomplete}} spinal cord lesion characterized by findings on clinical examination which reflect hemisection of {{the spinal cord}} (cutting the spinal cord in half on {{one or the other}} side). It is diagnosed by finding motor (muscle) paralysis on the same (ipsilateral) side as the lesion and deficits in pain and temperature sensation on the opposite (contralateral) side. This is called ipsilateral hemiplegia and contralateral pain and temperature sensation deficits. The loss of sensation {{on the opposite side of}} the lesion is because the nerve fibers of the spinothalamic tract (which carry information about pain and temperature) crossover once they meet the spinal cord from the peripheries.|$|E
50|$|Brown-Séquard was a keen {{observer}} and experimentalist. He contributed largely {{to our knowledge}} of the blood and animal heat, as well as many facts of the highest importance on the nervous system. He was the first scientist to work out the physiology of the spinal cord, demonstrating that the decussation of the fibres carrying pain and temperature sensation occurs in the cord itself. His name was immortalised in the history of medicine with the description of a syndrome which bears his name (<b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome)</b> due to the hemisection of the spinal cord, which he described after observing accidental injury of the spinal cord in farmers cutting sugar cane in Mauritius.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{hemiparesis}} and hemiplegia is stroke. Strokes can cause a variety of movement disorders, depending on the location and severity of the lesion. Hemiplegia is common when the stroke affects the corticospinal tract. Other causes of hemiplegia include spinal cord injury, specifically <b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome,</b> traumatic brain injury, or disease affecting the brain. As a lesion that results in hemiplegia occurs in the brain or spinal cord, hemiplegic muscles display features of the upper motor neuron syndrome. Features other than weakness include decreased movement control, clonus (a series of involuntary rapid muscle contractions), spasticity, exaggerated deep tendon reflexes and decreased endurance.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brown-Séquard</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by loss of motor function (i.e. hemiparaplegia), loss of vibration sense and fine touch, loss of proprioception (position sense), loss of two-point discrimination, and signs of weakness on the ipsilateral (same side) of the spinal injury. This {{is a result of}} a lesion affecting the dorsal column-medial lemniscus tract, which carries fine (or light) touch fibers, conscious proprioception, vibration, pressure and 2-point discrimination, and the corticospinal tract, which carries motor fibers. On the contralateral (opposite side) of the lesion, there will be a loss of pain and temperature sensation and crude touch 1 or 2 segments below the level of the lesion via the Spinothalamic Tract of the Anterolateral System. Bilateral (both sides) ataxia may also occur if the ventral spinocerebellar tract and dorsal spinocerebellar tract are affected.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: <b>Brown-Sequard</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{an unusual}} {{sequelae}} of pre-ganglionic brachial plexus injury. There have been sporadic case reports indicating {{that the cause of}} this condition is due to tethering of the cord, vascular ischaemia or direct avulsion injury of the nerve roots. This is a report of two patients with complete pre-ganglionic brachial plexus avulsion injuries who developed acute partial <b>Brown-Sequard</b> <b>syndrome</b> due to haematoma. Cases: Two patients developed acute partial <b>Brown-Sequard</b> <b>syndrome</b> associated with complete pre-ganglionic brachial plexus avulsion injuries. In the first case the neurology recovered fully after the evacuation of the large subdural hematoma. Whereas, in the second case the neurology only recovered after 4 weeks closed observation in view of the compression was due to small epidural haematoma. Conclusion: Acute <b>Brown-Sequard</b> <b>syndrome</b> occurring in association brachial plexus injury should be investigated with urgent magnetic resonance imaging to exclude any reversible haematoma compression.
