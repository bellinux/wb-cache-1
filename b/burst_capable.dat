50|$|Another {{machine pistol}} using the three shot burst {{system is the}} Heckler & Koch VP70. It will only fire three-round bursts with the stock attached. It is a 9 mm, 18-round, double action only, semi-automatic/three-round <b>burst</b> <b>capable</b> polymer frame pistol {{manufactured}} by German arms firm Heckler & Koch GmbH; the VP designation stands for Volkspistole ("The people's pistol"), and the designation 70 was for {{the year of the}} first edition: 1970. It was the first polymer-framed pistol, predating the Glock 17. The stock incorporates a selector switch that allows selective fire. Cyclic rounds per minute for the three-round bursts is 2200 rpm. The VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional firing pin. It is double action only, so the trigger pull is relatively heavy. Despite the VP70's potential, it was never adopted by the Bundeswehr.|$|E
40|$|Oscillations are {{ubiquitous}} {{phenomena in}} the animal and human brain. Among them, the alpha rhythm in human EEG {{is one of the}} most prominent examples. However, its precise mechanisms of generation are still poorly understood. It was mainly this lack of knowledge that motivated a number of simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) - functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. This approach revealed how oscillatory neuronal signatures such as the alpha rhythm are paralleled by changes of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal. Several such studies revealed a negative correlation between the alpha rhythm and the hemodynamic BOLD signal in visual cortex and a positive correlation in the thalamus. In this study we explore the potential generative mechanisms that lead to those observations. We use a <b>bursting</b> <b>capable</b> Stefanescu-Jirsa 3 D (SJ 3 D) neural-mass model that reproduces a wide repertoire of prominent features of local neuronal-population dynamics. We construct a thalamo-cortical network of coupled SJ 3 D nodes considering excitatory and inhibitory directed connections. The model suggests that an inverse correlation between cortical multi-unit activity, i. e. the firing of neuronal populations, and narrow band local field potential oscillations in the alpha band underlies the empirically observed negative correlation between alpha-rhythm power and fMRI signal in visual cortex. Furthermore the model suggests that the interplay between tonic and bursting mode in thalamus and cortex is critical for this relation. This demonstrates how biophysically meaningful modelling can generate precise and testable hypotheses about the underpinnings of large-scale neuroimaging signals...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} found that the onset of auroral kilometric {{radiation}} (AKR) frequently coincides with the arrival of type III solar radio bursts. Although the AKR onsets are usually abrupt and appear to be spontaneous, they sometimes develop from a discrete frequency near the leading edge of a type III burst or sometimes occur at progressively lower frequencies following that edge. From this, and the absence of the related solar electrons in specific cases, it was concluded that the incoming type III waves were sometimes responsible for stimulating auroral kilometric radiation. It was estimated that intense, isolated type III <b>bursts</b> were <b>capable</b> of stimulating AKR roughly one third of the time, and that at least ten percent of the observed AKR onsets could be attributed to these and weaker bursts, including some barely detectable by the ISEE plasma wave receivers...|$|R
40|$|We have {{discovered}} recent star {{formation in the}} outermost portion ((1 - 4) × R_ 25) of the nearby lenticular (S 0) galaxy NGC 404 using Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV imaging. FUV-bright sources are strongly concentrated within the galaxy's H I ring (formed by a merger event according to del Río et al.), even though the average gas density is dynamically subcritical. Archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging reveals resolved upper main-sequence stars and conclusively demonstrates that the UV light originates from recent star formation activity. We present FUV, NUV radial surface brightness profiles, and integrated magnitudes for NGC 404. Within the ring, the average star formation rate (SFR) surface density (Σ_SFR) is ~ 2. 2 × 10 ^– 5 M_☉ yr^– 1 kpc– 2. Of the total FUV flux, 70 % comes from the H I ring which is forming stars {{at a rate of}} 2. 5 × 10 ^– 3 M_☉ yr^– 1. The gas consumption timescale, assuming a constant SFR and no gas recycling, is several times the age of the universe. In the context of the UV-optical galaxy color-magnitude diagram, the presence of the star-forming H I ring places NGC 404 in the green valley separating the red and blue sequences. The rejuvenated lenticular galaxy has experienced a merger-induced, disk-building excursion away from the red sequence toward bluer colors, where it may evolve quiescently or (if appropriately triggered) experience a <b>burst</b> <b>capable</b> of placing it on the blue/star-forming sequence for up to ~ 1 Gyr. The green valley galaxy population is heterogeneous, with most systems transitioning from blue to red but others evolving in the opposite sense due to acquisition of fresh gas through various channels...|$|E

40|$|The {{synchrotron}} self-Compton (SSC) emission {{model for}} gamma-ray <b>bursts</b> is <b>capable</b> of producing narrow line features {{for a variety}} of modelled field strengths, primary electron injection distributions and burst luminosities. Multiple resonant scattering with synchrotron continuum photons efficiently traps and cools pairs in the ground state to an average energy where the Compton energy loss rate is zero. Annihilation between pairs in these cooled distributions can be very efficient. For isotropic injection of primary electrons, there is an anti-correlation of the intensity of the angular-binned emission between the portions of the continuum spectrum below the cyclotron peak and above the annihilation line feature. Small-angle emission dominates the continuum above the annihilation line feature and is smooth through the line up to the pair production cut-off, which can be above several MeV for small enough angles. The angle-averaged annihilation line is made of components which can have peak emission centered at energies away from 511 keV, due to Doppler shifting. For beamed injection,the annihilation line breaks up into relatively narrow components in the angular emission, which sum into a broad feature in the angle-averaged emission...|$|R
40|$|Spike-independent {{miniature}} postsynaptic currents {{are generally}} stochastic {{and are therefore}} not thought to mediate information relay in neuronal circuits. However, we recorded endogenous bursts of IPSCs in hypothalamic magnocellular neurones {{in the presence of}} TTX, which implicated a coordinated mechanism of spike-independent GABA release. IPSC bursts were identical in the absence of TTX, although the burst incidence increased 5 -fold, indicating that IPSC bursts were composed of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs), and that the probability of burst generation increased with action potential activity. IPSC bursts required extracellular calcium, although they were not dependent on calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels or on calcium mobilization from intracellular stores. Current injections simulating IPSC <b>bursts</b> were <b>capable</b> of triggering and terminating action potential trains. In 25 % of dual recordings, a subset of IPSC bursts were highly synchronized in onset in pairs of magnocellular neurones. Synchronized IPSC bursts displayed properties that were consistent with simultaneous release at GABA synapses shared between pairs of postsynaptic magnocellular neurones. Synchronized bursts of inhibitory synaptic inputs represent a novel mechanism that may contribute to the action potential burst generation, termination and synchronization responsible for pulsatile hormone release from neuroendocrine cells...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{development}} of a high-speed three-dimensional laser induced fluorescence system using an acetone tracer is explored. The technique {{is based on the}} high-speed scanning and imaging of a ultraviolet laser sheet produced by a home-built Nd:YAG pulse <b>burst</b> laser <b>capable</b> of operating in excess of 1 MHz. The focus of this study is on characterization of a substantial upgrade to the pulse burst laser and the addition of a fourth-harmonic generator to yield 266 nm ultraviolet light capable of efficient acetone excitation. Using this system, high-speed 2 -D acetone PLIF is demonstrated at 250 kHz. To transition this planar technique to a scanned volumetric measurement, a detailed analysis of 3 -D image reconstruction methods and corrections is conducted using traditional Mie scattering flow visualization of a low-speed axisymmetric jet. Multiple sample visualizations (220 x 220 x 68 voxel resolution) of the jet are presented with the camera and laser operating at 500 kHz.

5000|$|The goal is {{to defeat}} all or {{specific}} Aragami in the designated area within the time limit depending on mission objectives. Additional rewards are gained depending on how efficiently the mission was completed. Players can dash, sprint, and jump by consuming stamina (ST) that auto-regenerates over time. Players' sole weapon is the God Arc (Jinki); a unique weapon that can instantly switch to four different forms: Blade, Gun, Shield and Predator. Attacking Aragami in Gun form consumes Oracle Points (OP). Oracle Points can be regained by successfully attacking in Blade form, however this also consumes stamina. Once an Aragami has been defeated, materials can be collected from its remains by switching to Predator form and devouring it.

40|$|Introduction: Some {{forms of}} {{tinnitus}} {{are considered to}} be auditory phantom phenomena related to reorganization and hyperactivity of the auditory central nervous system. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive tool capable of modulating human brain activity, using single pulse or burst stimuli. Burst rTMS has only been performed in the theta range, and has not been used clinically. The authors analyze whether burst TMS at theta (5 Hz), alpha (10 Hz) and beta (20 Hz) frequencies can temporarily suppress narrow band noise/white noise tinnitus, which has been demonstrated to be intractable to tonic stimulation. Methods: rTMS is performed both in tonic and burst mode in 46 patients contralateral to the tinnitus side, at 5, 10 and 20 Hz. Fourteen placebo negative rTMS responders are further analyzed. Results: In 5 patients, maximal tinnitus suppression is obtained with theta, in 2 with alpha and in 7 with beta burst stimulation. Burst rTMS suppresses narrow band/white tinnitus much better than tonic rTMS t (13) = 6. 4, p &# 60;. 000. Women experience greater suppression of their tinnitus with burst stimulation than men, t (12) = 2. 9, p &# 60;. 05. Furthermore left sided tinnitus is perceived as more distressing on the TQ than right sided tinnitus, t (12) = 3. 2, p&# 60;. 01. The lower the tinnitus pitch the more effectively rTMS suppresses tinnitus(r =- 0. 65, p &# 60; 0. 05). Discussion: Burst rTMS can be used clinically, not only theta burst, but also alpha and beta burst. <b>Burst</b> rTMS is <b>capable</b> of suppressing narrow band/white noise tinnitus very much better than tonic rTMS. This could be due the simple fact that burst neuromodulation is more powerful than tonic neuromodulation or to a differential effect of burst and tonic stimulation on the lemniscal and extralemniscal auditory system. In some patients only alpha or beta <b>burst</b> rTMS is <b>capable</b> of suppressing tinnitus, and theta burst not. Therefore in future rTMS studies it could be worthwhile not to limit burst stimulation to theta burst rTMS. </p...|$|R
40|$|Many {{powerful}} and variable gamma-ray sources, including pulsar wind nebulae, active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray <b>bursts,</b> seem <b>capable</b> of accelerating particles to gamma-ray emitting energies efficiently over {{very short time}} scales. These are likely due to rapid dissipation of electromagnetic energy in a highly magnetized, relativistic plasma. In {{order to understand the}} generic features of such processes, we have investigated simple models based on relaxation of unstable force-free magnetostatic equilibria. In this work, we make the connection between the corresponding plasma dynamics and the expected radiation signal, using 2 D particle-in-cell simulations that self-consistently include synchrotron radiation reaction. We focus on the lowest order unstable force-free equilibrium in a 2 D periodic box. We find that rapid variability, with modest apparent radiation efficiency as perceived by a fixed observer, can be produced during the evolution of the instability. The "flares" are accompanied by an increased polarization degree in the high energy band, with rapid variation in the polarization angle. Furthermore, the separation between the acceleration sites and the synchrotron radiation sites for the highest energy particles facilitates acceleration beyond the synchrotron radiation reaction limit. We also discuss the dynamical consequences of radiation reaction, and some astrophysical applications of this model. Our current simulations with numerically tractable parameters are not yet able to reproduce the most dramatic gamma-ray flares, e. g., from Crab Nebula. Higher magnetization studies are promising and will be carried out in the future. Comment: 24 pages, 24 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ. Movies can be found at [URL]...|$|R

We have established a program of routine LO observations at the VLT observatory, especially designed {{to take advantage of}} short breaks available in-between other programs. We have used the ISAAC instrument in <b>burst</b> mode, <b>capable</b> of producing continuous read-outs at millisecond rates on a suitable subwindow. Given the random nature of the source selection, our aim has been primarily the investigation {{of a large number of}} stellar sources at the highest angular resolution in order to detect new binaries. Serendipitous results such as resolved sources and detection of circumstellar components were also anticipated. We have recorded the signal from background stars for a few seconds, around the predicted time of occultation by the Moon's dark limb. At millisecond time resolution, a characteristic diffraction pattern can be observed. Patterns for two or more sources superimpose linearly, and this property is used for the detection of binary stars. The detailed analysis of the diffraction fringes can be used to measure specific properties such as the stellar angular size and the presence of extended light sources such as a circumstellar shell. We present a list of 191 stars for which LO data could be recorded and analyzed. Results include the detection of 16 binary and 2 triple stars, all but one of which were previously unknown.

As seen from the sun, the two spacecraft will separate at a rate of 45 degrees per year, with Earth bisecting the angle. The instrument complement on the two spacecraft will consist of a package of optical instruments capable of imaging the sun in the visible and ultraviolet from essentially the surface to 1 AU and beyond, a radio <b>burst</b> receiver <b>capable</b> of tracking solar eruptive events from an altitude of 2 - 3 Rs to 1 AU, and a comprehensive set of fields and particles instruments capable of measuring in situ solar events such as interplanetary magnetic clouds.

This beacon data will be received by NOAA and NASA tracking stations and then relayed to the STEREO Science Center located at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland where the data will be processed and made available within a goal of 5 minutes of receipt on the ground.

40|$|Synchronized {{cortical}} {{activities in}} the central nervous systems of mammals are crucial for sensory perception, coordination, and locomotory function. The neuronal mechanisms that generate synchronous synaptic inputs in the neocortex are far from being fully understood. This thesis contributes toward {{an understanding of the}} emergence of synchronization in networks of bursting neurons as a highly nontrivial, combined effect of chemical and electrical connections. The first part of this thesis addresses the onset of synchronization in networks of bursting neurons coupled via both excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that the addition of pairwise repulsive inhibition to excitatory networks of bursting neurons induces synchrony, in contrast to one’s expectations. Through stability analysis, we reveal the mechanism underlying this purely synergistic phenomenon and demonstrates that it originates from the transition between different types of bursting, caused by excitatory-inhibitory synaptic coupling. We also report a universal scaling law for the synchronization stability condition for large networks {{in terms of the number}} of excitatory and inhibitory inputs each neuron receives, regardless of the network size and topology. In the second part of this thesis, we show that similar effects are also observed in other models of <b>bursting</b> neurons, <b>capable</b> of switching from square-wave to plateau bursting. Finally, in the third part, we report a counterintuitive find that combined electrical and inhibitory coupling can synergistically induce robust synchronization in a range of parameters where electrical coupling alone promotes anti-phase spiking and inhibition induces anti-phase bursting. We reveal the underlying mechanism which uses a balance between hidden properties of electrical and inhibitory coupling to act together to synchronize neuronal bursting. We show that this balance is controlled by the duty cycle of the self-coupled system which governs the synchronized bursting rhythm. This work has potential implications for understanding the emergence of abnormal synchrony in epileptic brain networks. It suggests that promoting presumably desynchronizing inhibition in an attempt to prevent seizures can have a counterproductive effect and induce abnormal synchronous firing...|$|R
40|$|Object Tinnitus is a {{prevalent}} symptom, with clinical, pathophysiological, {{and treatment}} features analogous to pain. Noninvasive {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS) and intracranial auditory cortex stimulation (ACS) via implanted electrodes into the primary or overlying the secondary auditory cortex {{have been developed to}} treat severe cases of intractable tinnitus. Methods A series of 43 patients who benefited transiently from 2 separate placebo-controlled TMS sessions underwent implantation of auditory cortex electrodes. Targeting was based on blood oxygen level-dependent activation evoked by tinnitus-matched sound, using functional MR imaging-guided neuronavigation. Results Thirty-seven percent of the patients responded to ACS with tonic stimulation. Of the 63 % who were nonresponders, half benefited from burst stimulation. In total, 33 % remained unaffected by the ACS. The average tinnitus reduction was 53 % for the entire group. <b>Burst</b> stimulation was <b>capable</b> of suppressing tinnitus in more patients and was better than tonic stimulation, especially for noise-like tinnitus. For pure tone tinnitus, there were no differences between the 2 stimulation designs. The average pure tone tinnitus improvement was 71 % versus 37 % for noise-like tinnitus and 29 % for a combination of both pure tone and noise-like tinnitus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation did not predict response to ACS, but in ACS responders, a correlation (r = 0. 38) between the amount of TMS and ACS existed. A patient's sex, age, or tinnitus duration did not influence treatment outcome. Conclusions Intracranial ACS might become a valuable treatment option for severe intractable tinnitus. Better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of tinnitus, predictive functional imaging tests, new stimulation designs, and other stimulation targets are needed to improve ACS results. status: publishe...|$|R
