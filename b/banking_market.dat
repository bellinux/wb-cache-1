25|$|The modest credit {{facilities}} of the IMF were clearly insufficient {{to deal with}} Western Europe's huge balance of payments deficits. The problem was further aggravated by the reaffirmation by the IMF Board of Governors in the provision in the Bretton Woods Articles of Agreement that the IMF could make loans only for current account deficits and not for capital and reconstruction purposes. Only the United States contribution of $570 million was actually available for IBRD lending. In addition, because the only available market for IBRD bonds was the conservative Wall Street <b>banking</b> <b>market,</b> the IBRD was forced to adopt a conservative lending policy, granting loans only when repayment was assured. Given these problems, by 1947 the IMF and the IBRD themselves were admitting {{that they could not}} deal with the international monetary system's economic problems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{unregulated}} {{growth of}} small rural banking institutions can be partially {{attributed to the}} rising cost of agriculture especially in the Corn Belt and Cotton Belt. Throughout the corn and cotton belts real estate increases drove the demand for more local funding to continue to supply rising agricultural economics. The rural banking structures would supply the needed capital to meet the farm commodity market, however, this came with a price of reliability and low risk lending. Economic growth was promising during the period of 1887-1920 with an on average of 6 percent growth in [...] In particular the participation in World War I (1917-1918) drove a booming agricultural market that drove optimism at the consumer and lending level, which in turn, resulted in a laxer approach in the lending process. Overbanked conditions existed which pressured struggling banking locations to increase their services (specifically to the agricultural customers) without any additional regulatory oversight or qualifications. This dilemma introduced several high risk and marginal business returns to the <b>banking</b> <b>market.</b> Banking growth would continue through the first two decades well outside of previous trends disregarding the current economic and population standards. Banking profitability and loan standards begin to deteriorate as early as 1900 as a result; adding to the agriculture shock and Great Depression to follow.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} impact of <b>bank</b> consolidation (<b>market</b> power) and country-level institutional development on macroeconomic performance. In general, the empirical results from a sample of commercial banks in 11 Asian countries over the period 2002 - 2007, show that greater <b>bank</b> <b>market</b> power enhances macroeconomic performance, which {{would not be the}} case as economic freedoms increase. If we consider different economic sectors, greater <b>bank</b> <b>market</b> power only enhances tradable sector growth, but impedes non-tradable sector growth. On the contrary, as economic freedoms increase, greater <b>bank</b> <b>market</b> power deteriorates tradable sector growth, but boosts non-tradable sector growth. In countries with higher economic freedoms, therefore, enhancing bank competition is necessary, since greater <b>bank</b> <b>market</b> power impedes productive growth through tradable sector and spurs booms in non-tradable sector, which may result in an increase in speculations. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews how {{long-term}} {{relationships between}} firms and banks shape {{the structure and}} integration of <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> worldwide. <b>Bank</b> relationships arise to span informational asymmetries that are endemic in financial markets. Firm-bank relationships not only entail specific benefits and costs for both the engaged firms and banks, but also directly affect the structure of <b>banking</b> <b>markets.</b> In particular, the sunk cost of screening and monitoring activities and the 'informational capital' collected by the incumbent banks may act {{as a barrier to}} entry. The intensity of the existing firm-bank relationships will determine the height of this barrier and shape the structure of international <b>banking</b> <b>markets.</b> For example, in Scandinavia where firms maintain few and strong relationships, foreign banks may only be able to enter successfully through mergers and acquisitions. On the other hand, Southern European firms maintain many bank relationships. Therefore, banks may consider entering Southern European <b>banking</b> <b>markets</b> through direct investment.
