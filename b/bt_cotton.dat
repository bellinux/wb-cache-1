5|$|In cotton production, the {{replacement}} of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk. Such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the Bt protein. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt cotton are often similar.|$|E

3000|$|PBDMs of ten pests {{of cotton}} in Arizona-California, {{including}} pink bollworm and bollworm (see Additional file 1) were developed {{and used in}} analyses of their impact on cotton growth and yield in Arizona and California [27, 29], Brazil [95], Sudan [31], and Egypt [49] (see Additional file 1). Only the pink bollworm model was used in our analysis of Indian cotton. The dynamics of PBW are intimately linked to cotton fruiting phenology, dynamics, and age structure, but unlike bollworm and other cotton pests, PBW attacks the standing crop without affecting plant growth dynamics. A major factor in PBW population dynamics is the evolved adaptation of winter dormancy that enables it to bridge crop cycles. The model captures the phenology of dormancy induction as regulated by decreasing temperature and photoperiod, and spring emergence from diapause {{as a function of}} temperature [28] (Fig.  2 e, see Additional file 1).

25|$|But <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> is {{ineffective}} against many cotton pests, however, such as plant bugs, stink bugs, and aphids; {{depending on}} circumstances it {{may still be}} desirable to use insecticides against these. A 2006 study done by Cornell researchers, the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy and the Chinese Academy of Science on <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> farming in China found that after seven years these secondary pests that were normally controlled by pesticide had increased, necessitating the use of pesticides at similar levels to non-Bt cotton and causing less profit for farmers because of the extra expense of GM seeds. However, a 2009 study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford University and Rutgers University refuted this. They concluded that the GM cotton effectively controlled bollworm. The secondary pests were mostly miridae (plant bugs) whose increase was related to local temperature and rainfall and only continued to increase in half the villages studied. Moreover, the increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> adoption. A 2012 Chinese study concluded that <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> halved the use of pesticides and doubled the level of ladybirds, lacewings and spiders. The International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) said that, worldwide, GM cotton was planted on an area of 25 million hectares in 2011. This was 69% of the worldwide total area planted in cotton.|$|E
25|$|Other {{avenues of}} control {{that have been}} {{explored}} include weevil-resistant strains of cotton, the parasitic wasp Catolaccus grandis, the fungus Beauveria bassiana, and the Chilo iridescent virus.

30|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is {{the most}} {{economically}} important crop in the global textile industry and constitutes {{more than half of}} all textile fiber consumption worldwide (Karademir et∼al. 2011). A great achievement in cotton breeding was the development of transgenic pure-line varieties or hybrids containing the crystal (cry) genes of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) encoding insecticidal proteins (δ-endotoxin) that provide protection from lepidopteran pests (Terán-Vargas et∼al. 2005). The adoption of <b>Bt</b> transgenic <b>cotton</b> varieties in countries as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico helped to reduce the cost of insecticide applications and increased yield of this crop (Terán-Vargas et∼al. 2005). For example, Mexico has adopted this new technology, and 9  years after commercial release, <b>Bt</b> transgenic <b>cotton</b> reached 133, 000  ha planted in Mexico in 2015 / 16 according to the Agrifood and Fisheries Information Service (SIAP) of the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fishing and Food ([URL] However, the presence of fungal phytopathogens during the development of plants is very important because these organisms can lead to wilt or root rot disease that causes substantial losses to farmers (Abd-Elsalam 2003). Fusarium wilt is an important disease present in cotton plants in diverse countries, which is caused by Fusarium solani (González Soto et∼al. 2015). These pathogens cause root rot, damping-off symptoms, and reduction in the size of leaves and bolls, which affect the yield and fiber quality (González Soto et∼al. 2015).|$|R
30|$|Native diploid “Desi” cottons (varieties of Gossypium arboreum L. and G. herbaceum L) {{have been}} grown in India {{for more than}} 5000  years without {{synthetic}} inputs [1] (i.e., functionally whether or not certified organically). Cotton was also domesticated in Africa and the Americas, and {{for all but the}} past 180  years, India was the center of world cotton innovation (see Additional file 1 for a review of the agronomic and political history). Cotton was the target of strong selection and adaptation by Indian farmers, but several agronomic changes altered the ecology and economics of cotton production in India as cotton became the raw material for the world’s largest manufacturing industry—cotton textiles through {{the first half of the}} Industrial Revolution [1]. Starting in 1790, new world cottons (chiefly G. hirsutum L. and later G. barbadense L.) were introduced [2] with F 1 hybrid cotton (normally G. hirsutum) introduced in the 1970 s [3] ushering in high use of insecticide and fertilizer [4, 5]. Planting of transgenic (i.e., genetically modified) F 1 hybrid <b>Bt</b> <b>cottons</b> expressing endotoxins of the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis for control of lepidopteran pests began in 2002 [6], and by 2012, more than 1128 Bt hybrid varieties of variable quality were planted on 92  % of the cotton area [2, 7]. Seed from F 1 hybrid plants are fertile but are not usually saved for planting by farmers because they produce variable phenotypes, and hence seed must be purchased annually.|$|R
40|$|In South Africa, {{modified}} Bt (Cry 1 Ac) cotton cultivars {{and organic}} ones coexist. This {{raises the question}} of the risk of dissemination of genetically modified (GM) pollen to non-GM crops by visiting insects. We inventoried the flower-visiting insects in <b>Bt</b> and non-Bt <b>cotton</b> fields of the South African Highveld region and investigated their role in pollen dispersal. Their diversity and abundance varied slightly among sites, with Astylus atromaculatus as the predominant insect on both <b>Bt</b> and non-Bt <b>cotton</b> flowers. The other major flower-visiting species were Apis mellifera and solitary Apidae. No differences were found in the abundance of each taxum between <b>Bt</b> and non-Bt <b>cotton</b> except for Scoliidae and Nitidulidae, which were scarce overall (< 0. 5 %) but more abundant on the non-Bt flowers in the central area of the field at one site. The pollen load on A. atromaculatus was as high as on Apis mellifera. Cage tests showed that A. atromaculatus can pollinate female cotton plants by transferring pollen from male donor plants. In the field, the flight range of this insect was generally short (25 m), but it can occasionally reach up to 200 m or even more. This study therefore highlights that A. atromaculatus, commonly regarded as a pest, could be an unexpected but efficient pollinator. Because its population density can be high, this species could mediate unwanted cotton pollen flow when distances between coexiting fields are not sufficient. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

25|$|Historically, in North America, one of {{the most}} {{economically}} destructive pests in cotton production has been the boll weevil. Due to the US Department of Agriculture's highly successful Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> (which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and pink bollworm), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.|$|E
25|$|GM cotton acreage in India {{grew at a}} rapid rate, {{increasing}} from 50,000 hectares in 2002 to 10.6 {{million hectares}} in 2011. The total cotton area in India was 12.1 million hectares in 2011, so GM cotton was grown on 88% of the cotton area. This made India {{the country with the}} largest area of GM cotton in the world. A long-term study on the economic impacts of <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> in India, published in the Journal PNAS in 2012, showed that <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> has increased yields, profits, and living standards of smallholder farmers. The U.S. GM cotton crop was 4.0 million hectares in 2011 the second largest area in the world, the Chinese GM cotton crop was third largest by area with 3.9 million hectares and Pakistan had the fourth largest GM cotton crop area of 2.6 million hectares in 2011. The initial introduction of GM cotton proved to be a success in Australia– the yields were equivalent to the non-transgenic varieties and the crop used much less pesticide to produce (85% reduction). The subsequent introduction of a second variety of GM cotton led to increases in GM cotton production until 95% of the Australian cotton crop was GM in 2009 making Australia the country with the fifth largest GM cotton crop in the world. Other GM cotton growing countries in 2011 were Argentina, Myanmar, Burkina Faso, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, South Africa and Costa Rica.|$|E
30|$|While Bt-transgenic {{corn and}} cotton have {{displaced}} an estimated 56 million kgs (123 million pounds) of insecticides since 1996, every plant in a <b>Bt</b> corn or <b>cotton</b> field is manufacturing within its cells {{one or more}} forms of the natural bioinsecticide Bacillus thuringiensis. The rate of synthesis of Bt Cry protein endotoxins is roughly proportional to the rate of plant growth. As plants mature and enter senescence, Bt endotoxin expression falls.|$|R
50|$|One highly {{sought after}} trait is insect resistance. This trait {{increases}} a crop’s resistance to bugs {{and allows for}} a higher yield. These genetically engineered crops can now produce their own Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis), which contains toxin-producing proteins that are non-harmful to humans. <b>Bt</b> corn and <b>cotton</b> are now commonplace, and cowpeas, sunflower, soybeans, tomatoes, tobacco, walnut, sugar cane, and rice are all being studied in relation to Bt.|$|R
25|$|Farmers {{generally}} {{use less}} insecticide when they plant Bt-resistant crops. Insecticide use on corn farms declined from 0.21 pound per planted acre in 1995 to 0.02 pound in 2010. This {{is consistent with}} the decline in European corn borer populations {{as a direct result of}} <b>Bt</b> corn and <b>cotton.</b> The establishment of minimum refuge requirements helped delay the evolution of Bt resistance. However, resistance appears to be developing to some Bt traits in some areas.|$|R
25|$|The first genetically {{modified}} food approved for release was the Flavr Savr tomato in 1994. Developed by Calgene, it was engineered to have a longer shelf life by inserting an antisense gene that delayed ripening. China was the first country to commercialize a transgenic crop in 1993 {{with the introduction of}} virus-resistant tobacco. In 1995, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Potato was approved for cultivation, making it the first pesticide producing crop to be approved in the USA. Other {{genetically modified}} crops receiving marketing approval in 1995 were: canola with modified oil composition, Bt maize, cotton resistant to the herbicide bromoxynil, <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton,</b> glyphosate-tolerant soybeans, virus-resistant squash, and another delayed ripening tomato.|$|E
25|$|Genetically {{modified}} (GM) cotton {{was developed}} to reduce the heavy reliance on pesticides. The bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) naturally produces a chemical harmful only to {{a small fraction of}} insects, most notably the larvae of moths and butterflies, beetles, and flies, and harmless to other forms of life. The gene coding for Bt toxin has been inserted into cotton, causing cotton, called <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton,</b> to produce this natural insecticide in its tissues. In many regions, the main pests in commercial cotton are lepidopteran larvae, which are killed by the Bt protein in the transgenic cotton they eat. This eliminates the need to use large amounts of broad-spectrum insecticides to kill lepidopteran pests (some of which have developed pyrethroid resistance). This spares natural insect predators in the farm ecology and further contributes to noninsecticide pest management.|$|E

Based on pooled analysis, both Bt hybrids produced similar seed <b>cotton</b> yield (SCY). <b>Bt</b> hybrid have produced 7. 1 bolls/plant (on an average) and bolls 0. 48 g heavier than non Bt hybrid LHH 144 that lead to 1. 07 t ha- 1 higher SCY of Bt hybrids than non-Bt hybrid (1. 93 t ha- 1). Though the N uptake by cotton hybrids was statistically similar N harvest index (NHI) was higher in Bt hybrid (57. 85) as compared to non-Bt hybrid (40. 5).

2500|$|A {{number of}} social activist groups and studies {{proposed}} a link between genetically modified crops and farmer suicides. <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> (Bacillus thuringiensis cotton) was claimed {{to be responsible for}} farmer suicides. The <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> seeds cost nearly twice as much as ordinary ones. The higher costs forced many farmers into taking ever larger loans, often from private moneylenders charging exorbitant interest rates (60% a year). The moneylenders force farmers to sell their cotton to them at a price lower than it fetches on the market. According to activists, this created a source of debt and economic stress, ultimately suicides, among farmers. Increasing costs in farming associated with decreasing yields even with use of <b>BT</b> <b>cotton</b> seeds are often quoted cause of distress among farmers in central India.

2500|$|In 2008, {{a report}} {{published}} by the International Food Policy Research Institute, an agriculture policy think tank based in Washington DC, noted {{that there was an}} absence of data relating to [...] "numbers on the actual share of farmers committing suicide who cultivated cotton, let alone Bt cotton." [...] In order to evaluate the [...] "possible (and hypothetical)" [...] existence of a connection the study employed a [...] "second-best" [...] assessment of evidence relating to farmer suicides firstly, and to the effects of <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> secondly.

[...] The report also noted that farmer suicides predate the official commercial introduction of <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> by Monsanto Mahyco in 2002 (and its unofficial introduction by Navbharat Seeds in 2001) and that such suicides were a fairly constant portion of the overall national suicide rate since 1997. The report noted that while <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> may have been a factor in specific suicides, the contribution was likely marginal compared to socio-economic factors. Elsewhere, Gruere et al. discuss the introduction and increase in use of <b>Bt</b> <b>cotton</b> in the state of Madhya Pradesh since 2002, and the observed drop in total suicides among that state's farmers in 2006.
