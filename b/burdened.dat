This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Aging & Mental Health on 31 Mar 2014, available online: [URL] To investigate caregiver <b>burden</b> in dementia and explore factors associated with different types of <b>burden</b> in a country without formal caregiver support using a province in China as a case. Method: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey was used to collect data. One hundred and fifty-two family caregivers of people with dementia in community settings were recruited from 2012 to 2013 using convenience sampling. Objective <b>burden</b> was measured by caregiving hours and dementia-related financial <b>burden.</b> Subjective <b>burden</b> was measured and analysed using the Caregiver <b>Burden</b> Inventory and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire. Multivariate regression models were employed to analyse factors associated with each type of subjective <b>burden.</b> Results: Five types of subjective <b>burden</b> were measured by the Caregiver <b>Burden</b> Inventory, namely, physical <b>burden,</b> emotional <b>burden,</b> time-dependence <b>burden,</b> developmental <b>burden,</b> and social <b>burden.</b> Caregiver distress, as a subjective <b>burden,</b> {{was measured by the}} Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire and reported by relating to the severity of care recipients’ behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. This caregiver cohort showed a high level of physical, time-dependence, and developmental <b>burdens,</b> but a low level of emotional and social <b>burdens.</b> Factors contributing to each type of subjective <b>burden</b> measured by the Caregiver <b>Burden</b> Inventory differed from each other. Conclusion: The high level of objective and subjective <b>burdens</b> identified in this study suggests that government-funded formal caregiver support should be established and services should be designed to target different types of <b>burdens</b> and factors contributing to these <b>burdens...</b>|$|R

5|$|Hasan Pasha's {{nickname}} Arap ("Bedouin") {{derived from}} the Ridwan family's good relations with and reputation for keeping the Bedouin tribes in check. When Hasan was commissioned by Sultan Murad IV to help suppress the long-running rebellion of Fakhr ad-Din II (1623-1635), Hasan's Bedouin units often proved effective in battle. During this period, Hasan Pasha gained the additional governorship of Tripoli, although he was deposed in 1644. His rule impoverished Gaza Sanjak and <b>burdened</b> the Ridwan family with heavy debts. According to the Damascene historian and Hasan's contemporary, Muhammad Amin al-Muhibbi, Hasan Pasha had numerous wives and concubines and fathered 85 children. During Hasan Pasha's lifetime, one of his sons, Husayn Pasha, served as governor of Nablus and Jerusalem as well as amir al-hajj.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in the world, with a high population growth rate of 2.5%per year and nearly 70% of the population living in poverty. The country is also <b>burdened</b> with high levels of debt and limited resources. These socioeconomic issues have complicated conservation efforts, even though the island of Madagascar has been recognized by IUCN/SSC as a critical primate region for over 20years. Due to its relatively small land area—587,045km2 (226,659sq mi)—compared to other high-priority biodiversity regions and its high levels of endemism, the country {{is considered one of the}} world's most important biodiversity hotspots, with lemur conservation being a high priority. Despite the added emphasis for conservation, there is no indication that the extinctions that began with the arrival of humans have come to an end.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{explanation}} {{is provided in}} the biographies of the Ridwan family, it is evident they chose Gaza as their home and the place for their castle.

He became Governor of Damascus Eyalet in 1601 after bribing several viziers and bureaucrats in Istanbul and died in 1607. Next in line was Hasan Pasha ibn Ahmad who became known 'Arab Hasan ("Hasan the Bedouin") because by then, the Ridwans were identified with the control {{and knowledge of the}} Bedouin. He successfully led his pro-Ottoman Bedouin troops against the army of the rebel Fakhr ad-Din in a series of battles. He was later appointed Governor of Tripoli in Lebanon, but he was deposed in 1644. 'Arab Hasan had many wives and concubines and 85 children.

40|$|Abstract. In legal system, {{there are}} mainly {{two kinds of}} <b>burdens</b> of proof; one is a <b>burden</b> of persuasion {{and the other is}} a <b>burden</b> of produc-tion.

If a <b>burden</b> of persuasion is not fulfilled, a judge will make a decision which is not favorable to the party having the <b>burden.</b> And as by-product, both parties are trying to fulfill their <b>burden</b> of persuasion.

The second objective is focused on Hill 400, involving the capture of Bergstein, a disastrous charge at Hill 400's bunkers and the defense against the German counterattack, with the player again performing sniper work against German mortar teams, destroying enemy armor, and generally holding the hill against the counter-offensive, all the while <b>burdened</b> by artillery and overwhelming numbers of German soldiers. The final mission is set amongst the Americans in the Rhine River crossing into Germany. It begins {{as one of the few}} missions with the player immediately under fire, providing cover fire against the Germans until reaching the river banks and then fighting through most of the town.

5|$|Feeding horses {{was a major}} issue, {{and horse}} fodder was the single largest {{commodity}} shipped to the front by some countries, including Britain. Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further <b>burdened</b> already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse fodder crisis, as they had underestimated {{the amount of food}} they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war. Sawdust was mixed with food during times of shortage to ease animals' sense of hunger, and many animals died of starvation. Some feed was taken from captured territories on the Eastern Front, and more from the British during the advances of the 1918 spring offensive.|$|E
5|$|Historian James C. Klotter has speculated that, had John C.

Breckinridge's grandmother taught him the political philosophies of his late grandfather, U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge. John Breckinridge believed {{the federal government was}} created by, and subject to, the co-equal governments of the states. As a state representative, he introduced the Kentucky Resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts and asserted that states could nullify them and other federal laws that they deemed unconstitutional. A strict constructionist, he held that the federal government could only exercise powers explicitly given to it in the Constitution.|$|E
40|$|Response <b>burden</b> in {{business}} surveys {{has long been}} a concern for National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) for three types of reasons: political reasons, because response <b>burden</b> is part of the total administrative <b>burden</b> governments impose on businesses; methodological reasons, because an excessive response <b>burden</b> may reduce data quality and increase data-collection costs; and strategic reasons, because it affects relations between the NSIs and the business community.

The study aims were to assess (a) whether {{the dimensions of}} <b>burden</b> were the same for caregiving spouses and adult children, (b) the role of assisting with problem behaviors (PBs) and {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs) on each dimension of <b>burden,</b> and (c) the role of each dimension of <b>burden</b> on self-rated health and intention to institutionalize the care receiver.  Design and Methods: This study included 280 spouse/partner and 243 adult child caregivers of persons with chronic illnesses.  Results: Analysis using 2 -group structural equation modeling showed that the factor structure of <b>burden</b> was equivalent for spouses and adult children. For both groups, assisting with ADLs was directly related with objective <b>burden,</b> whereas PBs were directly related to all dimensions of <b>burden.</b> For both groups, stress <b>burden</b> was the only predictor of self-rated health, whereas PBs were significantly linked with intention to institutionalize.

5|$|In early 1804, {{following}} a massacre of Serb chieftains by renegade Ottoman janissaries known as Dahis, the Serbs of the Pashalik rebelled.

Within six months, most of the Dahi leaders had been captured and executed by Karađorđe's forces, and by 1805, the final remnants of Dahi resistance had been crushed. Karađorđe and his followers now demanded far-reaching autonomy, a move which Sultan Selim interpreted as but the first step towards complete independence. Selim promptly declared jihad against the rebels and ordered an army to march into the Pashalik. The Ottomans suffered a string of defeats {{at the hands of}} Karađorđe's forces. By 1806, the rebels had captured all the major towns in the Pashalik, including Belgrade and Smederevo, and expelled their Muslim inhabitants. <b>Burdened</b> by the demands of the Russo-Ottoman War of 1806–1812, Selim offered to grant the Serbs extensive autonomy but Karađorđe refused in light of Russia's avowal to provide extensive aid to the rebels should they continue fighting.|$|E
