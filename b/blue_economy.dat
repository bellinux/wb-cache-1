5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, industrial ecology, biomimicry, and the <b>blue</b> <b>economy.</b> These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The {{demand for}} fish and fish {{products}} {{is on the}} rise and being sought as a preferred alternative to other animal protein, owing to its taste, preference and proven health benefits. However the consumers’ urge in knowing the fish origin and its quality are decisive factors for determining its saleability. Numerous management and  policy initiatives  like IUU fishing and “Marine Stewardship Council” are means and measures to trace the fish’s origins and ensuring quality.  The fish production in India during 2013 - 14 was ten million tonnes; with a growing market with and outside the country due to increased purchasing power, thereby a distinct willingness to pay for premium quality fish. The climate change necessitates the global coordination in reducing carbon emission and setting emission standards which would provide a major incentive in the competitive global fish trade. Considering ocean to be a major carbon sink- this study attempts to create a <b>blue</b> carbon <b>economy</b> based on fishes caught in Indian waters. In this context a study was carried out to estimate the carbon emissions based on life cycle assessment; the differential carbon emissions across the chain during pre-harvest, harvest and post-harvest were computed. The study ascertains the amount of emission and provides scope for competitive advantage of Indian fish considering lower carbon emission. The study highlights the need for providing incentives for fishing operations which involves lower carbon emission. The study also suggests possible trade-offs and aims at developing scenarios across the different chain in reducing carbon emission for the future...|$|R

5000|$|The Blue Economy: 10 years - 100 {{innovations}} - 100 {{million jobs}} {{is a book}} by Gunter Pauli. The book expresses the ultimate aim that a <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy</b> business model will shift society from scarcity to abundance [...] "with what is locally available", by tackling issues that cause environmental and related problems in new ways. The book highlights potential benefits in connecting and combining seemingly disparate environmental problems with open-source scientific solutions based upon physical processes common in the natural world, to create solutions that are both environmentally beneficial and which have financial and wider social benefits. The book suggests that we can alter {{the way in which}} we run our industrial processes and tackle resultant environmental problems, refocusing from the use of rare and high-energy cost resources to instead seek solutions based upon simpler and cleaner technologies. The book proposes to focus on the generation of more value, instead of blindly cutting costs. The book aims to inspire entrepreneurs to adopt its insights, by demonstrating ways in which this can create economic benefits via job creation, reduced energy use, and more revenue streams from each step of the process, at the same time benefiting the communities involved. The <b>Blue</b> <b>Economy</b> is presented in 14 chapters, each of which investigates an aspect of the world’s economies and offers a series of innovations capable of making aspects of those economies sustainable. By 2014, the book has been translated into 35 languages worldwide.|$|E
