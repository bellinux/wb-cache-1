500|$|Some of the {{dialogue}} Blair uses to describe {{his first meeting with}} ElizabethII led to accusations of plagiarism from Peter Morgan, who wrote The Queen, set during {{the first few months of}} Blair's premiership. Blair recalls his first meeting with ElizabethII in which she tells him, [...] "You are my 10th prime minister. The first was Winston. That was <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> born." [...] In the film, Helen Mirren's fictionalised ElizabethII says almost exactly the same thing. Morgan said it had been purely his own imagination.|$|E
500|$|Having {{been elected}} as leader Blair moves the Labour Party to the {{political}} centre ground, repackaging it as [...] "New Labour", {{and goes on to}} win the 1997 general election. At his first meeting with Elizabeth II following his election as Prime Minister Blair recalls the Queen telling him, [...] "You are my tenth prime minister. The first was Winston. That was <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> born." [...] Within a few months his government must deal with the aftermath of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and following the Princess's funeral, ElizabethII tells Blair that lessons must be learned from the way things have been handled. Social occasions with the Queen are also recalled, including a gathering at Balmoral Castle where Prince Philip is described manning the barbecue while ElizabethII dons a pair of rubber gloves to wash up afterwards.|$|E
500|$|On Nova Chrysalia's final day, Hope reveals to Lightning that Bhunivelze {{used him}} to watch over Lightning and that the deity will dispose of him now that his task is completed. After Hope disappears, Lightning is transported to Luxerion and enters the cathedral, where Noel, Snow and Fang help her fight the Order to save Vanille. Lightning manages to {{convince}} her to free {{the souls of the}} dead. This act allows Lightning to find Serah's soul, kept hidden inside Lumina to keep it safe, but Bhunivelze arrives using Hope as his host and captures everyone but Lightning. Transported to an otherworldly realm, Lightning meets Bhunivelze in person, and learns his true agenda: that he has been planning to make Lightning take Etro's place as the Goddess of Death. Because Lightning prevented the ritual, he plans to destroy the new world and create another one, with those living on it to be created in his image, under his full control. The two battle, and after wounding the god in battle, Lightning frees Hope from Bhunivelze's influence and prepares to become the new goddess in order protect the new world by trapping herself and Bhunivelze in the Unseen Realm. An illusion of Serah then confronts Lightning, revealing Lumina as the physical manifestation of Lightning's suppressed vulnerabilities. Accepting Lumina as a part of herself, Lightning calls for aid. Hope, Snow, Noel, Vanille, Fang and the Eidolons answer her call, and they sever Bhunivelze's hold on the souls of humanity, including Sazh, Dajh, Mog, and a revived Serah. The souls then unite and defeat Bhunivelze, ending his reign once and for all. In the aftermath, Caius and the multiple versions of Yeul choose to remain in the Unseen Realm and protect the balance between worlds in Etro's stead. The final incarnation of Yeul, who alone wishes for a new life, is allowed to accompany Lightning and her friends. After the Eidolons and Mog depart for the Unseen Realm, Lightning, her allies, and the souls of humanity travel to a new world, which turns out to be Earth. A final monologue by Lightning states that the crystal age is now a legend, and [...] "it ended <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> born".|$|E

[...] For some, this verse, while talking specifically about Jeremiah, {{is an indication that}} God is aware of the identity of [...] "developing unborn human beings even before they enter the womb", or that for everyone, God has a plan that abortion might be seen as frustrating. Others say that this interpretation is incorrect, and that the verse is not related to personhood or abortion, as Jeremiah is asserting his prophetic status as distinct and special.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{detailed}} {{version of the}} practice is by Cyril of Jerusalem who details how ointment or oil was [...] "symbolically applied to the forehead, and the other organs of sense" [...] and that the [...] "ears, nostrils, and breast were each to be anointed." [...] Cyril states that the [...] "ointment is the seal of the covenants" [...] of baptism and Godâ€™s promises to the Christian who is anointed. Cyril taught that being [...] "anointed with the Holy anointing oil of God" [...] was {{the sign of a}} Christian, and a physical representation of having the Gift of the Holy Spirit, and it retains this meaning in Catholicism and Orthodoxy today. He says, [...] "Having been counted worthy of this Holy Chrism, ye are called Christians, verifying the name also by your new birth. For <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> deemed worthy of this grace, ye had properly no right to this title, but were advancing on your way towards being Christians."(On the Mysteries 3.5) ...|$|E
