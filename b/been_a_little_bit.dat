500|$|Blair Marnell of CraveOnline {{gave the}} episode an {{eight out of}} ten rating, noting that the episode [...] "hit its {{dramatic}} points." [...] Marnell commended Grenier's acting, as he opined, [...] "I've never hated Vince before this season, but that's the reaction that he was meant to elicit. Vince has always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> shallow, but never to this extent. Vince never told his friends that they needed him more than he needed them before. And while it's definitely true to a certain extent, part of Vince's charm was that he never threw that back in their faces." [...] In concurrence, TV Fanatic Eric Hochberger expressed that [...] "Lose Yourself" [...] was a [...] "stellar season finale with plenty of unanswered cliffhangers for next season." [...] Concluding his review, Hochberger gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E
500|$|Television critics reacted mostly {{positive}} {{toward the}} episode, calling the storyline [...] "heartfelt." [...] In a simultaneous {{review of the}} episodes of The Simpsons and The Cleveland Show that preceded and followed the show, respectively, The A.V. Clubs Rowan Kaiser wrote, [...] "I spent the entire time expecting the rug to be pulled out {{and the whole thing}} revealed to be Seth MacFarlane just trying to manipulate my emotions." [...] Kaiser went on to compliment series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane, stating [...] "some of the more recent formal experiments that the show has done, such as the hour-long murder mystery in this season's premiere, indicate that MacFarlane and company agree with the criticism." [...] He concluded his review by writing, [...] "I have to give props to Family Guy for going outside their wheelhouse without winking excessively at their audience, but I think it may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too far to be truly great." [...] Kaiser ultimately gave the episode a B rating, the best rating of the night, beating The Cleveland Show episode [...] "Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'" [...] and The Simpsons episode [...] "Moms I'd Like to Forget". In another positive review of the episode, Jason Hughes of TV Squad praised the episode's [...] "funniest moments," [...] which included the opening sequence involving Peter and the Red Bull, as well as the reference to The Price Is Right. Hughes went on to comment that the episode [...] "taught us about the depths and bonds of love that make a family. Whether it's acceptance, hope or sacrifice, there's no limit to what we will do for family." [...] Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also commented positively on the episode, writing in her review of the storyline, [...] "Overall, I found the installment to be refreshing with everyone taking a part in Peter’s dilemma. It was actually sweet and emotional for a change." [...] Moon also praised the scenes involving President Obama, and Stewie's attempt at saving Brian.|$|E
2500|$|Four years later, when part of Crowe's {{appearance}} at the 2002 BAFTA awards was cut out {{to fit into the}} BBC's tape-delayed broadcast, Crowe used strong language during an argument with producer Malcolm Gerrie. The part cut was a poem in tribute to actor Richard Harris, and it was cut for copyright reasons. Crowe later apologised, saying [...] "What I said to him may have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more passionate than now, in the cold light of day, I would have liked it to have been." ...|$|E

Following his death, Helene Deutsch began to reminisce about her life with Felix and all that he had given her. Her relationship with Felix, up to that point, had always <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> strained. Through numerous affairs, like the one she had with Sándor Rado, Deutsch had always felt that Felix was more of the mother figure than she. According to Deutsch, [...] "Felix seemed to have no trouble in 'naturally' displaying all the motherly ease.

2500|$|... Games Workshop {{released}} a new expansion entitled Legions of Middle-earth, centering on theming and army building. [...] It {{is not a}} supplement or rulebook, as it contains no rules; instead, it provides army lists for players to theme their forces around, and scenarios which are designed to work in conjunction with them. However, Games Workshop also released supplement summaries online in conjunction with Legions of Middle-earth, so effectively a player only requires Legions of Middle-earth and the main rulebook {{in order to use}} the rules of the supplements. According to one review, the army lists would transform the game [...] "from what has essentially been a scenario-based game that appealed mostly to collectors to a genuine tournament-compatible game system," [...] although in this it [...] "could have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more restrictive." [...] Interestingly, some of the miniatures for the point values listed have not yet been released; in this way, the book was not to become obsolete with future releases for some time.|$|E

2500|$|In 2013, Orci {{had begun}} writing the script with Patrick McKay and J. D. Payne, with Payne saying {{of the script}} in March, [...] "We {{really want to get}} back to the sense of {{exploration}} and wonder. The kind of optimistic sense of the future that Star Trek has always kind of had at its core. It's the Chicago Bulls in space, in terms of these people who are all awesome at their job." [...] In January 2015, after Orci's departure, Simon Pegg and Doug Jung were hired to rewrite the screenplay, with Pegg saying on the previous draft, Paramount [...] "had a script for Star Trek that wasn't really working for them. I think the studio was worried that it might have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> too Star Trek-y." [...] Pegg had been asked to make the new film [...] "more inclusive", stating that the solution was to [...] "make a western or a thriller or a heist movie, then populate that with Star Trek characters so it's more inclusive to an audience that might be a little bit reticent." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thirdly, {{the writing}} {{sessions}} {{were affected by}} Patrick's struggles with addiction, concerning alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs. While Patrick had struggled {{with it in the}} past, it became particularly bad upon dealing with the pressure of recording a follow-up to the platinum selling Title of Record. Patrick would stay up for multiple days at a time without sleep, spending entire days indulging in his addictions instead of working on the album. The album's first single, [...] "Where Do We Go From Here" [...] addressed said struggles; the track was self-referential in Patrick's struggles to create the album in the face of his addiction, knowing that the money being spent in the prolonged period, and the drugs being taken, were not sustainable activities. The track [...] "God Damn Me" [...] was written in between Patrick's blackouts one night when he was so heavily intoxictated that a friend kept on stopping in to wake him up {{to make sure he was}} still alive. In 2013, Patrick would reflect on the writing sessions, stating [...] "I went through a music phase where I was writing as I experienced my life within drugs and alcohol....I cringe when I hear some of it because a lot of the lyrics I feel like ugh what was I thinking. There’s a lot of stuff I would have changed if I had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more clear headed." ...|$|E

There's no humour in my blood. I'm in earnest in warp and woof. I stumble and flounder, but I know that over all these merry immediate things, there are other things that are great and serene, very high, beautiful things--the reality. I haven't got it, but it's there nevertheless. I'm a spiritual guttersnipe in love with unimaginable goddesses. I've never seen the goddesses nor ever shall--but it takes all the fun out of the mud--and at times I fear it takes all the kindliness, too.|$|E
