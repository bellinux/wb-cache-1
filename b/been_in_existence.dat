Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E

5|$|Goodrich Castle {{appears to}} have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> by 1101, when it was known as Godric’s Castle, named {{probably}} after Godric of Mappestone, a local Anglo-Saxon thane and landowner mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Victorian historians, however, believed the castle to date back further to the pre-Norman conquest days of King Canute, and the site may have been among {{a small number of}} Saxon fortifications along the Welsh border. By Norman times, Goodrich formed part of the Welsh Marches, a sequence of territories granted to Norman nobles in, and alongside, Wales. Although Goodrich lay on the safer, English side of the border, the threat of raids and attacks continued throughout most of the period.|$|E

5|$|Presently, most {{armed forces}} are {{composed}} of people from different ethnic backgrounds.

While there are many examples of polyethnic forces, the most prominent are among the largest armed forces in the world, including those of the United States, the former USSR and China. Polyethnic {{armed forces are}} not a new phenomenon; multi-ethnic forces have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> since the ancient Roman Empire, Middle Eastern Empires and even the Mongol Khans. The U.S. Military {{was one of the first}} modern militaries to begin ethnic integration, by order of President Truman in 1945.|$|E
5|$|SR905 was {{formerly}} routed on Otay Mesa Road, which had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> {{since at least}} 1927. Before it was SR 905, the route was first designated as part of SR 75, before it was redesignated as SR 117. The freeway was completed between I-5 and Otay Mesa Road in 1976. The border crossing opened in 1985 after several delays in obtaining funding {{for the construction of}} what would become SR905. After becoming SR905 in 1986, the highway was converted to first an expressway in 2000 and then a freeway in 2010 and 2011. Plans are for this highway to eventually become known as Interstate 905.|$|E

Unlike other heavyweight titles {{such as the}} WWE Championship or the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, {{it is not the}} main championship in the promotion because CMLL has emphasized the lower weight levels since there are more workers in the lower levels. The title was the first to be created after Empresa Mexicana de la Lucha Libre changed its name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E
5|$|In 1789, {{the area}} of modern-day Belgium was divided into two independently-governed polities, both part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Austrian Netherlands, which {{included}} most of the territory of modern-day Belgium, had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> {{since the end of}} the War of the Spanish Succession in 1714 when the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the section called the Spanish Netherlands from the Spanish branch of the house. The traditional principalities, duchies and counties surviving from the Middle Ages retained great regional autonomy. The economy of the Austrian Netherlands developed little, as its neighboring states imposed high export tariffs and the port of Antwerp remained blocked by the Dutch. Although Enlightenment ideals developed among the urban bourgeoisie, most of the population remained suspicious of education and extremely politically conservative. The Catholic church was particularly influential, despite the attempts of Emperor Joseph II to reduce its power.|$|E

5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E
5|$|Jackson and Walsh {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} The Frighteners during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Executive producer Robert Zemeckis hired the duo to write the script, with the original intention of Zemeckis directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, Tales from the Crypt. With Jackson and Walsh's first draft submitted in January 1994, Zemeckis believed the film {{would be better off}} directed by Jackson, produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Studios. The visual effects were created by Jackson's Weta Digital, which had only <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> for three years. This, plus the fact that The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made until that time, resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed.|$|E
5|$|Jackson's Weta Digital {{created the}} visual effects, which {{included}} computer-generated imagery, {{as well as}} scale models (which were necessary to make Wellington look American), prosthetic makeup and practical effects with help from Weta Workshop. Visual effects supervisor Richard Taylor explained that effects work on The Frighteners was complex due to Weta's inexperience with computer technology in the mid-1990s. Prior to this film, Weta worked largely with physical effects. With so many ghosts among its main cast, The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made up till that time. For a special effects company that had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> less than three years, the eighteen-month period for completing The Frighteners was largely stressful. Some shots were handled by a small New Zealand company called Pixel Perfect, many of whose employees would eventually join Weta Digital. Rick Baker was hired to design the prosthetic makeup for The Judge, portrayed by John Astin (the detachable jawbone was later added digitally). However, Baker {{was not able to}} apply Astin's five hours of makeup himself due to his commitment on The Nutty Professor. Makeup artist Brian Penikas (Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull) fulfilled Baker's duties.|$|E
