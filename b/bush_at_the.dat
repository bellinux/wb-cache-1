5|$|Buckles joined actor Gary Sinise in 2007 {{to lead a}} Memorial Day parade, {{and that}} evening his life was {{featured}} on NBC Nightly News. With the death of 108-year-old Harry Richard Landis in February 2008, Buckles became the last surviving American veteran of World War I. The following month, he met with United States President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House. The same day, he attended {{the opening of a}} Pentagon exhibit featuring photos of nine centenarian World War I veterans, with Defense Secretary Robert Gates in attendance. That summer, he visited wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.|$|E

5|$|In {{his last}} years, he was Honorary Chairman of the World War I Memorial Foundation. As chairman, he {{advocated}} {{the establishment of}} a World War I memorial similar to other war memorials in Washington, D.C.. Toward this end, Buckles campaigned for the District of Columbia War Memorial to be renamed the National World War I Memorial. He testified before Congress in support of this cause, and met with President George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House.|$|E

She had plans to present the president with a petition to place a mandatory carbon cap on the United States. The goal of the petition was compliance with the commitment made by President Bill Clinton in previous years to follow the Kyoto Protocol. However, she {{was not able to}} present the petition because the president was rushed away after the concert, due to security concerns.|$|E
5|$|The world responded {{rapidly to}} the {{disaster}} in Leninakan and Spitak, {{with much of}} Europe sending cargo aircraft loaded with medical supplies, rescue equipment, and trained personnel {{to assist in the}} recovery, and even more reinforcement came in from Latin America and the Far East. Mikhail Gorbachev was in New York on his first day of visits with Ronald Reagan and George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the earthquake, and once the scale of the disaster was realized, a quick departure was made back to Armenia, with the Kremlin formally asking for American help. Washington immediately responded with offers of doctors, medical equipment, and rescue teams, and by the first weekend the first US plane arrived in Yerevan with search and rescue teams and detection dogs.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{opposition}} from conservatives, in April 2008, {{there were signs}} that the Republican Party base was coalescing behind McCain's candidacy. A CBS News/New York Times poll showed that McCain was viewed favorably by 78 percent of conservatives, and unfavorably by only 18 percent. This was the same percentage who had an unfavorable opinion of George W. <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time in 2000.|$|E

25|$|As a batter, Bush {{ranked among}} the American League leaders in bases on balls 12 {{straight}} years, from 1909 through 1920, and led the league five times. His career high was 118 bases on balls in 1915. During the decade from 1910 to 1919, no Major League player had more bases on balls than <b>Bush.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time of his retirement in 1923, Bush had 1,158 walks, second best in Major League history trailing only Eddie Collins.|$|E

25|$|Hobbiton was {{a village}} on a stream locally known as The Water, a short {{distance}} west of Bywater. It had a mill, {{and there was a}} small inn called the Ivy <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> eastern end of the village, on the road to Bywater. The part of the village on the north of the river was known as Hobbiton-across-the-Water. This included The Hill, with Bag End and the neighbourhood of Underhill on the south, and Overhill on the north of the Hill. The Hill Road led north from Hobbiton past Bagshot Row and The Hill and on to Overhill.|$|E
25|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in August 1914, Harris did not learn of it for nearly a month, being out in the <b>bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Despite his {{previous}} reluctance to follow the path his father had had in mind {{for him in the}} army, and his desire to set up his own ranch in Rhodesia, Harris felt patriotically compelled to join the war effort. He quickly attempted to join the 1st Rhodesia Regiment, which had been raised by the British South Africa Company administration to help put down the Maritz Rebellion in South Africa, but he found that only two positions were available; that of a machine-gunner or that of a bugler. Having learnt to bugle at Allhallows, he successfully applied for the bugler slot and was sworn in on 20 October 1914.|$|E
25|$|In 1988 Governor Michael Dukakis (Massachusetts) chose Bentsen to be {{his running}} mate in that year's presidential election, beating out Ohio Senator John Glenn, who was {{considered}} the early favorite. Bentsen was selected {{in large part to}} try to lure away the state of Texas and its electoral vote for the Democrats, even with fellow Texan George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the Republican ticket. Because of Bentsen's status as something of an elder statesman who was more experienced in electoral politics, many believed Dukakis's selection of Bentsen as his running mate was a mistake in that Bentsen, number two on the ticket, appeared more presidential than did Dukakis. During the vice presidential debate (see below), Republican vice presidential nominee Dan Quayle spent most of his speaking time criticizing Dukakis as too liberal while avoiding a match up with the seasoned Bentsen. One elector in West Virginia even cast a ballot for him rather than Dukakis, giving Bentsen one electoral vote for president.|$|E

25|$|Corporal Freddie Stowers of the 371st Infantry Regiment {{that was}} {{seconded}} to the 157th French Army division called the Red Hand Division {{in need of}} reinforcement {{under the command of}} the General Mariano Goybet was posthumously awarded a Medal of Honorâ€”the only African American to be so honored for actions in World War I. During action in France, Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died from his wounds, but his men continued the fight and eventually defeated the German troops. Stowers was recommended for the Medal of Honor shortly after his death, but the nomination was, according to the Army, misplaced. In 1990, under pressure from Congress, the Department of the Army launched an investigation. Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers. On April 24, 1991â€“73 years after he was killed in actionâ€”Stowers' two surviving sisters received the Medal of Honor from President George H. W. <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House. The success of the investigation leading to Stowers' Medal of Honor later sparked a similar review that resulted in six African Americans being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in World War II. Vernon Baker was the only recipient who was still alive to receive his award.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, 2001, Bush {{had been}} hosting {{her father and}} {{mother-in-law}} George H. W. Bush and Barbara <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House and was scheduled to give a testimony to Congress on education. Instead, during the September 11 attacks, Bush was taken to inside the White House and placed in an underground bunker, later being met by her husband, who had returned to Washington from Florida. Two weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks, Bush inaugurated a music concert at the Kennedy Center, organized to fundraise for families of the victims. Though she received applause, she returned the compliment {{to members of the}} audience and added that although the event was tragic, Americans had deepened their appreciation [...] "of life itself, how fragile it can be, what a gift it is and how much we need each other." [...] Senator Ted Kennedy, who introduced <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> event, praised her and said he knew his deceased sibling, the late President John F. Kennedy, would also be proud of her. Bush believes the September 11 attacks ignited the interest in the way Afghanistan women were treated, who were not allowed to leave their homes and of which composed a high number of widows due to terrorist attacks in Afghanistan prior to the attacks.|$|E
500|$|At the RAM, Bush studied {{composition}} under Frederick Corder {{and piano}} with Tobias Matthay. [...] He made rapid progress, and won various scholarships and awards, including the Thalberg Scholarship, [...] the Phillimore piano prize, and a Carnegie award for composition. [...] He produced the first compositions of his formal canon: Three Pieces for Two Pianos, Op. 1, and Piano Sonata in B minor, Op. 2, [...] and also {{made his first}} attempt to write opera â€“ a scene from Bulwer Lytton's novel The Last Days of Pompeii, with a libretto by his brother Brinsley. The work, with <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano, received a single private performance [...] with {{family members and friends}} forming the cast.

500|$|The Advisory Committee on Uranium {{met again}} at the National Bureau of Standards on April 27, 1940. This time {{they were joined by}} Rear Admiral Harold G. Bowen, Sr., the {{director}} of the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), along with Sachs, Pegram, Fermi, Szilard, and Wigner. Once again, Einstein, although invited, declined to attend. The meeting highlighted differences between the optimistic Szilard and Sachs, and the more cautious Fermi. The committee agreed to proceed with the work at Columbia, which it hoped would demonstrate whether or not a chain reaction was possible. Bowen and Gunn suggested the creation of a scientific subcommittee to advise the Advisory Committee on Uranium.

The team also visited <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> White House the following March, where he gave a speech honoring their presence, in which he asked [...] "what took [...] so long?"

500|$|During the French and Indian Wars, the British {{military}} {{improved the}} road significantly {{for use by}} its forces. After the war it was used by numerous settlers moving west into the Mohawk Valley. During the late-18th century, taverns and the occasional homesteader began to dot the Pine Bush along the King's Highway, while development began to encroach on the Pine <b>Bush</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Albany and Schenectady edges as those settlements began to grow. The highway and the Pine Bush was a frontier wilderness and extremely dangerous even {{after the end of}} the war. Starting in 1765, militiamen took turns escorting travelers through the area to protect them from outlaws, bandits, smugglers, and other dangers. During the American Revolutionary War, the Bush was home to Loyalists of the British Crown. Among the taverns established in the 1760s catering to Pine Bush travelers was the Truax Tavern owned by Isaac Truax, a descendant of French Huguenots and a Tory sympathizer; he said that he was [...] "not a Tory, but a man for the King". Rumors circulated of several murders/robberies being carried out at the tavern.|$|E
