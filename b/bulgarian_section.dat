2500|$|The {{ideas of}} Bulgarian {{nationalism}} {{grew up in}} significance, following the Congress of Berlin which took back the regions of Macedonia and Southern Thrace, returning them {{under the control of}} the Ottoman Empire. Also an autonomous Ottoman province, called Eastern Rumelia was created in Northern Thrace. As a consequence, the Bulgarian nationalist movement proclaimed as its aim the inclusion of most of Macedonia and Thrace under Greater Bulgaria. Eastern Rumelia was annexed to Bulgaria in 1885 through bloodless revolution. During the early 1890s, two pro-Bulgarian revolutionary organizations active in Macedonia and Southern Thrace were founded: the Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committees and the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee. The Macedonian Slavs then, were regarded and self-identified predominantly as Macedonian Bulgarians. In 1903 they participated together with the Thracian Bulgarians in the unsuccessful Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising against the Ottomans in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilajet. That was followed by series of conflicts between Greeks and Bulgarians into both regions. The tension were result of the [...] different concepts of nationality. The Slavic villages became divided into followers of the Bulgarian national movement and so-called grecomans. The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 restored the Ottoman Parliament, which had been suspended by the Sultan in 1878. After the Revolution armed factions laid down their arms and joined the legal struggle. The Bulgarians founded the Peoples' Federative Party (<b>Bulgarian</b> <b>Section)</b> and the Union of the Bulgarian Constitutional Clubs and participated in Ottoman elections. Soon, the Young Turks turned increasingly Ottomanist and sought to suppress the national aspirations of the various minorities in Macedonia and Thrace.|$|E

40|$|The Danian–Selandian (D–S) {{boundary}} {{has been}} identified {{for the first time}} in the Black Sea coast at Bjala (Bulgaria) based on a new integrated bio-, magneto- and cyclostratigraphic study. Several correlation criteria as established for the basal Selandian GSSP from Zumaia (Basque Basin) are evaluated. Noteworthy, is the almost complete lack of calcareous nannoplankton species Braarudosphaera bigelowi in the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>sections,</b> a sharp decrease of which was indicated as suitable criteria for defining the D–S boundary as it occurred both at Zumaia and in the classical locations of the North Sea basin. Conversely, the second evolutionary radiation of the calcareous nannofossil genus Fasciculithus together with the occurrence of Fasciculithus tympaniformis that define the NP 4 /NP 5 zonal boundary seem to be reliable criteria to approximate the D–S boundary. In detail, however, the best approach is to integrate biostratigraphic data within a magnetostratigraphic and/or cyclostratigraphic framework. Refinements on the placement of chron C 27 n at Zumaia and robust bed-by-bed correlation between several Basque sections and Bjala indicates that the D–S boundary is located 30 precession cycles (~ 630 ky) above C 27 n. In addition to the precession-related marl–limestone couplets and 100 -ky eccentricity bundles recognized in the studied sections, expression of the stable 405 -ky long eccentricity allows direct tuning to the astronomical solutions. A correlation of the land-based sections with previously tuned data from ODP Site 1262 from the Southern Atlantic is challenged. Our choice is consistent with original tuning at Zumaia but shifts one 100 -ky cycle older previous tuning from Site 1262 along the interval above C 27 n. Under the preferred tuning scheme the D–S boundary can be given an age of 61. 641 ± 0. 040 Ma on the La 04 orbital solution...|$|R

40|$|The Infra-Getic Unit is a palaeogeographic unit, predestined by palaeotectonics. From {{the point}} of view of {{geological}} heritage, it represents a geosites framework. For the purpose of the correlation, the Serbian sections of Lukanja, Bogorodica Monastery, Rosomač and Senokos, as well as the <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>sections</b> of Komshtitsa, Gintsi, and Stanyantsi were used. The Jurassic sediments of the Infra-Getic Unit crop out on the southern slops of the Stara Planina Mountain in east Serbia and west Bulgaria. The Lower Jurassic started with continental and continental-marine sediments (clays and sandstones) (Lukanja clastics and Lukanja coal beds in Serbia and the Tuden Formation in Bulgaria) and continue with Lukanja quartz sandstones (Serbia) and the Kostina Formation (Bulgaria). These sediments are covered by Lukanja brachiopod beds and Lukanja limestones (Serbia) and the Romanov Dol, Ravna and Dolni Loukovit Members of the Ozirovo Formation (Bulgaria) predominantly consist of bioclastic limestones. The sedimentations follow with Lukanja belemnites-gryphaea beds (marls and clayey limestones), which in Bulgaria correspond to the Bukorovtsi Member (also marls and clayey limestones) of the Ozirovo Formation. The Middle Jurassic sedimentation started with black shales with Bossitra alpine. These sediments are individualized in Serbia as Senokos aleurolites and clays and in Bulgaria they are known as the Etropole Formation. In Serbia the section continues with sandstones called Vodenički sandstones of Bajocian age, known in Bulgaria as the Dobrogled Member of the Polaten Formation. However, in Bulgaria, the age is Upper Bajocian-Lower Bathonian, and it cover the marls of the lower member (Gornobelotintsi Member) of the Bov Formation and is covered by the upper member - alternation of marls and clayey limestones - the Verenitsa Member of the Bov Formation. The Vodenički sandstones-Dobrogled Member which ended their distribution in the section of Komshtitsa, to the east (in the Gintsi section), they are not represented - build a body of sandstones, a prodelta coming from the west to the east. The Bov Formation corresponds to the Senokos ammonite beds in east Serbia. The upper boundary of the Senokos ammonite beds and of the Bov Formation is sharp. It is covered by grey limestones of the Yavorec Formation in Bulgaria and by the Kamenica limestones in eastern Serbia. They are covered by grey or red nodular/lithoclastic limestones ("ammonitico rosso" type) of the Gintsi Formation in Bulgaria and the Pokrovenik ammonitic (acanthicum) limestones in Serbia.

5000|$|The Bulgarian {{population}} in Pirin Macedonia remained Bulgarian after 1913. The [...] "Macedonian Question," [...] became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912-1913, followed from the withdraw of the Ottoman Empire {{and the subsequent}} division of the region of Macedonia between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia. The Slav - speakers in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasants, {{but the majority of}} them were {{under the influence of the}} Exarchate and its education system, thus considered themselves as Bulgarians. Moreover, Bulgarians in Bulgaria believed that most of the population of Macedonia was Bulgarian. Before the Balkan Wars the regional Macedonian dialects were treated as Bulgarian and the Exarchate school system taught the locals in Bulgarian. Following the Balkan wars the Bulgarian Exarchate activity in most of the region was discontinued. After World War I, the territory of the present-day Republic of Macedonia came under the direct rule of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and was sometimes termed [...] "Southern Serbia". Together with a portion of today's Serbia, it belonged officially to the newly formed Vardar Banovina. An intense program of Serbianization was implemented during the 1920s and 1930s when Belgrade enforced a Serbian cultural assimilation process on the region. Between the two world wars in Vardar Banovina, the regional Macedonian dialects were declared as Serbian and the Serbian language was introduced in the schools and administration as official language. There was implemented a governmental policy of assassinations and assimilation. The Serbian administration in Vardar Banovina felt insecure and that provoked its brutal reprisals on the local peasant population.Greece, like all other Balkan states, adopted restrictive policies towards its minorities, namely towards its Slavic {{population in}} its northern regions, due to its experiences with Bulgaria's wars, including the Second Balkan War, and the <b>Bulgarian</b> inclination of <b>sections</b> of its Slavic minority.|$|R
