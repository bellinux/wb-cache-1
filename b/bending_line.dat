6000|$|Thus far {{the same}} {{interest}} attaches {{to all the}} earths, and all the metals {{of which they are}} made; but a deeper interest, and larger beneficence belong to that ochreous earth of iron which stains the marble of your springs. It stains much besides that marble. It stains the great earth wheresoever you can see it, far and wide--it is the colouring substance appointed to colour the globe for the sight, as well as subdue it to the service of man. You have just seen your hills covered with snow, and, perhaps, have enjoyed, at first, the contrast of their fair white with the dark blocks of pine woods; but have you ever considered how you would like them always white--not pure white, but dirty white--the white of thaw, with all the chill of snow in it, but none of its brightness? That is what the colour of the earth would be without its iron; that would be its colour, not here or there only, but in all places, and at all times. Follow out that idea till you get it in some detail. Think first of your pretty gravel walks in your gardens, yellow and fine, like plots of sunshine between the flower- beds; fancy them all suddenly turned to the colour of ashes. That is what they would be without iron ochre. Think of your winding walks over the common, as warm to the eye as they are dry to the foot, and imagine them all laid down suddenly with gray cinders. Then pass beyond the common into the country, and pause at the first ploughed field that you see sweeping up the hill sides in the sun, with its deep brown furrows, and wealth of ridges all a-glow, heaved aside by the ploughshare, like deep folds of a mantle of russet velvet--fancy it all changed suddenly into grisly furrows in a field of mud. That is what it would be without iron. Pass on, in fancy, over hill and dale, till you reach the <b>bending</b> <b>line</b> of the sea shore; go down upon its breezy beach--watch the white foam flashing among the amber of it, and all the blue sea embayed in belts of gold: then fancy those circlets of far sweeping shore suddenly put into mounds of mourning--all those golden sands turned into gray slime, the fairies no more able to call to each other, [...] "Come unto these yellow sands;" [...] but, [...] "Come unto these drab sands." [...] That is what they would be, without iron.|$|E
60|$|When water, not in {{very great}} body, {{runs in a}} rocky bed much {{interrupted}} by hollows, {{so that it can}} rest every now and then in a pool as it goes along, it does not acquire a continuous velocity of motion. It pauses after every leap, and curdles about, and rests a little, and then goes on again; and if in this comparatively tranquil and rational state of mind it meets with an obstacle, as a rock or stone, it parts on each side of it with a little bubbling foam, and goes round; if it comes to a step in its bed, it leaps it lightly, and then after a little plashing at the bottom, stops again to take breath. But if its bed be on a continuous slope, not much interrupted by hollows, so that it cannot rest, or if its own mass be so increased by flood that its usual resting-places are not sufficient for it, but that it is perpetually pushed out of them by the following current, before it has had time to tranquillize itself, it of course gains velocity with every yard that it runs; the impetus got at one leap is carried to the credit of the next, until the whole stream becomes one mass of unchecked, accelerating motion. Now when water in this state comes to an obstacle, it does not part at it, but clears it, like a racehorse; {{and when it comes to}} a hollow, it does not fill it up and run out leisurely at the other side, but it rushes down into it and comes up again on the other side, as a ship into the hollow of the sea. Hence the whole appearance of the bed of the stream is changed, and all the lines of the water altered in their nature. The quiet stream is a succession of leaps and pools; the leaps are light and springy, and parabolic, and make a great deal of splashing when they tumble into the pool; then we have a space of quiet curdling water, and another similar leap below. But the stream when it has gained an impetus takes the shape of its bed, never stops, is equally deep and equally swift everywhere, goes down into every hollow, not with a leap, but with a swing, not foaming, nor splashing, but in the <b>bending</b> <b>line</b> of a strong sea-wave, and comes up again on the other side, over rock and ridge, with the ease of a bounding leopard; if it meet a rock three or four feet above the level of its bed, it will neither part nor foam, nor express any concern about the matter, but clear it in a smooth dome of water, without apparent exertion, coming down again as smoothly on the other side; the whole surface of the surge being drawn into parallel lines by its extreme velocity, but foamless, except in places where the form of the bed opposes itself at some direct angle to such a line of fall, and causes a breaker; so that the whole river has the appearance of a deep and raging sea, with this only difference, that the torrent-waves always break backwards, and sea-waves forwards. Thus, then, in the water which has gained an impetus, we have the most exquisite arrangements of curved lines, perpetually changing from convex to concave, and vice versa, following every swell and hollow of the bed with their modulating grace, and all in unison of motion, presenting perhaps the most beautiful series of inorganic forms which nature can possibly produce; for the sea runs too much into similar and concave curves with sharp edges, but every motion of the torrent is united, and all its curves are modifications of beautiful line.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When {{sheets of}} {{high-strength}} (HS) and ultra-high-strength (UHS) steels are bent by a press brake the process suffers from large bending forces, considerable springback, and eventual cracks. Additionally, some unpredictable effects, such as lost contact to the punch, caused by strain hardening may occur producing a bend with erroneous radii. The strain hardening of the <b>bending</b> <b>line</b> may make further processes, such as forming or welding, more complex. One solution {{to these problems}} is to anneal the <b>bending</b> <b>line</b> with a laser in advance. Of course, {{it is also possible}} to utilise other types of heat sources, but the laser can offer the most precisely controlled heat treatment. The proper process parameters depend on the material, and it has been noticed that inadequate process parameters may harden the material instead of annealing. In this work some experiments on bending sheet metal samples of HS or UHS steel with previously laser-annealed bending lines have been carried out and the outcome analysed. The results show that the annealing produces better bending results compared to the conventional procedure. This includes lower springback, less hardening in the <b>bending</b> <b>line</b> and more precise geometry of the bend. It can be even suggested that proper annealing with strain hardening in bending will produce the original material structure. Obviously, more theoretical and experimental work is required to optimise the process parameters including the laser power and speed for each pair of material strength and thickness...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION A 200 MeV {{recirculating}} SRF e-beam accelerator {{is being}} designed at CEBAF for driving kW-level industrial UV FELs [1, 2]. This accelerator, {{like all the}} FEL drivers, should provide e-beams having the smallest possible emittances. This demands minimization of the emittance growth {{at all of the}} stages of beam creation, acceleration and transport. One of the most critical regions is the injection line which transports the e-beams from a CW high current 10 MeV injector [3] to the accelerator. It is interesting to consider in general how a high current injection beam line should be designed to provide a high degree of beam quality preservation, while providing the required matching conditions into the accelerator. For a non-circulating accelerator, one can minimize the emittance growth in the bending system by minimizing the average beam size [5], and match the beam into the accelerator by adding quadrupoles after the last dipole of the beam <b>bending</b> <b>line.</b> However, thi...|$|E

Moreover, in most types of bearings, a reactive bending moment is the response of bearing to unparallel position of inner bearing rings in relation to outer rings, that is to the tilt angle. As a result, real loads of rolling elements differ from theoretical ones. The aim of the paper is to develop a method of calculating generalized loads in rolling bearings of a three-bearing shaft taking into consideration shaft deformation, deformations in bearings and reactive moments of bearings caused by tilt angle. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} the inelastic compressive behaviour and strength of gusset plate connections is presented in this paper. The study is performed by the commercial finite element program ABAQUS. Based on the parametric study, general design guidelines are proposed. To increase the buckling strength of gusset plate connections efficiently and improve the energy absorption behaviour of the connections under cyclic loading, adding the centerline stiffener along the splice member {{as close to the}} beam and column boundaries as possible and/or adding free edge stiffeners are recommended. In addition, welded connection between the splice member and the gusset plate is recommended. The splice member with higher bending rigidity such as tee-sections and channel sections should always be used. Shaping the gusset plate according to 30 ° load dispersion angle may be recommended {{to reduce the size of}} the connection between the gusset plate and the beam and column boundaries provided that the splice member is sufficiently extended beyond the <b>bending</b> <b>line.</b> Finally, a design method accompanied by some design charts for rectangular type gusset plates subject to compression is proposed based on an inelastic plate buckling equation.

40|$|Bump bending or step bending is a forming {{technique}} that allows making large radius bends in a {{sheet metal part}} {{by means of a}} series of bends performed close to each other. The bump bending process has been studied by means of both an experimental campaign and finite element analysis. High-strength steel Weldox 1300 and a punch of radius 30 mm have been used. The finite element calculations have been performed with Abaqus using the solid formulation and Implicit/Explicit solvers. The results of the finite element analysis have been validated experimentally by monitoring the bending process using a camera system aligned with the <b>bending</b> <b>line.</b> Experiments were performed on a press-brake with a capacity of 50 metric tons. Deflections of a sheet during and after bending have been measured using the images recorded by the camera. In order to investigate the influence of a new bend on a previously formed bend, experiments have been performed with different distances between two consecutive bends. Based on the experiments, the size of the affected zone for the bend has been measured. The dependence of the distance between two consecutive bends on the resulting global bending angle has been studied. Moreover, the influence of the bump distance on the springback has been investigated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Ground {{deformation}} {{induced by}} fault rupture gives {{a potential threat}} {{to the safety of}} infrastructures, pipe line systems and tunnels. In this paper, two centrifugal tests with different bedrock faulting displacements were conducted to investigate the static permanent responses of a sandy soil overlaying an active normal fault with a dip angle of 90 °.

Through analysis of the displacement vector and the deviatoric strain obtained by geotechnical PIV technique, the following conclusions are drawn: (1) the range of significant distortion zone does not increase linearly as the increase in bedrock displacement, especially on the foot wall block; (2) the fault rupture brings more disturbance on the hanging wall side than on the foot wall block; and (3) the fault rupture propagates toward the hanging wall block in a <b>bending</b> <b>line.</b> The propagation angle of the principal fault rupture through soil equals the dilation angle of the soil under the mean confining pressure.

40|$|SUMMARY This report {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} a series of experiments on pneumatic tyres which were designed to test the various hypotheses: regarding the deformed shape of a tyre during the steering process. The experiments consisted of several separate tests first described in Ref. 1 and 2. a) The application of a point lateral force or a moment at one position on the tread band which is restrained at the centre of the wheel, and the measurement of the resulting lateral deflection of each point of the tyre perimeter. b) The application of a uniform force around the tyre perimeter on a hollow cylindrical former and applying a load at the centre of the wheel. c) Direct determination of tread band tension by cutting the tread band and bridging the cut by a dynamometer. d) Estimation of the bending modulus of the tread band by test on sections cut from the tread band. The analysis of the experiments is carried out by first transforming the test results into a Fourier series and determining the spectral content of the <b>bending</b> <b>line</b> with an harmonic analysis. Transfer functions of beam and string models are derived and applied to the test results. A method of considering a three parameter model is described...|$|E
