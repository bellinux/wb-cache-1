It was first {{published}} by Jonathan Cape in the UK on 1 April 1965, {{eight months after the}} author's death.

5|$|A wait {{of three}} years {{occurred}} between the release of Goblet of Fire and the fifth Harry Potter novel, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. This gap led to press speculation that Rowling had developed writer's block, speculations she denied.

5|$|Escoffier also {{simplified}} {{and organized}} the modern menu {{and structure of}} the meal. He published a series of articles in professional journals which outlined the sequence, and he finally published his Livre des menus in 1912. This type of service embraced the service à la russe (serving meals in separate courses on individual plates), which Félix Urbain Dubois had made popular in the 1860s. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of Le Guide Culinaire in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. The <b>book</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> collaboration with Philéas Gilbert, E. Fetu, A. Suzanne, B. Reboul, Ch. Dietrich, A. Caillat and others. The significance of this is to illustrate the universal acceptance by multiple high-profile chefs to this new style of cooking.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} edition, {{published}} in 1539, Calvin dropped this format {{in favour of}} systematically presenting the main doctrines from the Bible. In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen. He concurrently worked on another book, the Commentary on Romans, {{which was published in}} March 1540. The <b>book</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin Vulgate, an exegesis, and an exposition. In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work of his predecessors Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Nixon {{published}} his memoirs, RN: The Memoirs of Richard Nixon, {{the first of}} ten books he was to author in his retirement. The <b>book</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response.

Carter had not wanted to invite Nixon, but Deng had stated he would visit Nixon in California if the former president was not invited.

50|$|The Zork <b>books</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> {{series of}} four books, written by S. Eric Meretzky, {{which took place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of Zork. The <b>books</b> <b>were</b> published by Tor Books. Like the Zork video games, the <b>books</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> form of interactive fiction which offered the reader a choice of actions symbolized by pages to turn to, as in the contemporary book series Choose Your Own Adventure, or the later Give Yourself Goosebumps series. The protagonists of each <b>book</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> boy and girl, called Bill and June on Earth, and re-dubbed Bivotar and Juranda in Zork.

5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The <b>book</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's information theory. It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed information theory, the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.|$|E
5|$|Morris had {{continued}} to devote much time to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy published Morris's epic poem, The Life and Death of Jason, at his own expense. The <b>book</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> retelling of the ancient Greek myth of the hero Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris's former publication, The Life and Death of Jason was well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.|$|E
5|$|Morton {{interviewed about}} 70 {{people who had}} known Madonna since her youth. He had {{to spend a lot}} of evenings in bars and clubs in New York chatting to people—including artists, musicians, and directors—who had an {{interesting}} perspective on Madonna and the world. After its release, Madonna received mixed reviews from contemporary critics, who pointed out Morton's poor writing skills and felt that the book did not present anything new about the singer. The <b>book</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> commercial disappointment. In the United States, the book reached eight on The New York Times Best Seller list, and sold half of its initial print.|$|E

The book was never published and the manuscript was lost when it was lent to someone to read.|$|E
