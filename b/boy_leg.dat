6000|$|... "Notice {{that the}} round muscle-pads {{on the inner}} sides that make most women appear {{knock-kneed}} are missing. They're <b>boy's</b> <b>legs,</b> firm and sure--" ...|$|R
60|$|And Songbird did run {{the moment}} he could regain his feet. One snake got tangled up in the <b>boy's</b> <b>legs</b> and was carried along, {{whipping}} one way and another. But it soon lost its hold and then wiggled through the grass to rejoin its fellows. In the meantime, the dog had disappeared.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{consider}} Mr. Slasher a good operator?' said Mr. Pickwick. 'Best alive,' replied Hopkins. 'Took a <b>boy's</b> <b>leg</b> out of {{the socket}} last week--boy ate five apples and a gingerbread cake--exactly two minutes after it was all over, boy said he wouldn't lie there to be made game of, and he'd tell his mother if they didn't begin.' ...|$|R
60|$|And {{this first}} lesson progressed {{in about the}} same way until the hour was over, save that now and then Mr. Castle would give him some good advice, but oftener he would twist the long lash of the whip around the <b>boy's</b> <b>legs</b> {{with such force that}} Toby {{believed}} the skin had been taken entirely off.|$|R
40|$|Zusters van Liefde van Jezus en Maria, Gent KONGO, Kasai. In het dispensarium. ” A missionary sister {{doctor or}} nurse treats a <b>boy's</b> <b>leg</b> {{at the mission}} clinic in Kasai. The caption {{and the name of}} the {{publisher}} “Ern. Thill, Brussel” are printed on the back of the postcard. There are several lines of handwriting in French on the back...|$|R
5000|$|Carl, Trixie and Frankenbooger (The Three Robo-Boogers) - Boogers that {{planned to}} destroy Captain Underpants. They all {{came from the}} Bionic Booger Boy. They all share a {{weakness}} to oranges, which Captain Underpants successfully used to destroy the rampaging trio of living mucus. Carl had the Bionic Booger <b>Boy's</b> <b>legs,</b> Trixie had the tentacles, and Frankenbooger had the arms. Whenever they eat, they become bigger and more evil.|$|R
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Major Adams bargains for water, Craven sets a <b>boy's</b> broken <b>leg</b> and {{the river}} is reached ...|$|R
50|$|On 18 August 2011 a boy {{was hit by}} {{an express}} heading to city after dangerously {{crossing}} the tracks. The <b>boy's</b> <b>leg</b> and elbow were broken as well as sustaining serious injury. Transit officers arrived soon to call emergency services. The boy was then transported to the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children for treatment. It was revealed that the boy had survived by hiding in the 'lip' of the platform where the train had injured but not killed him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'A watering-place,' {{retorted}} Thomas Idle, {{with the}} pardonable sharpness of an invalid, 'can't be five gentlemen in straw hats, on a form {{on one side}} of a door, and four ladies in hats and falls, on a form on another side of a door, and three geese in a dirty little brook before them, and a <b>boy's</b> <b>legs</b> hanging over a bridge (with a boy's body I suppose {{on the other side of}} the parapet), and a donkey running away. What are you talking about?' ...|$|R
6000|$|As {{the three}} men waded nearer to him they got into {{shallower}} water, and then perceived that the boy had not lost his self-possession, but was still tightly grasping {{the butt of his}} rod. Just as they came up the salmon, in its blind terror, ran straight against the <b>boy's</b> <b>legs.</b> Olly fell upon it, let go the rod, and embraced it! Happily, his friends reached him at the moment, else the water that rushed over his head would have compelled him to let go--or die! ...|$|R
50|$|Rasputin is {{summoned to}} the Tsar’s palace and brought before Alexei. Rasputin startles Nicholas and Alexandra by asking Alexei about his leg, despite neither of them having told him of Alexei’s affliction. Rasputin soothes Alexei with images of sailing whilst he places {{his hand on the}} <b>boy’s</b> <b>leg.</b> Rasputin limps away, causing Alexandra to believe he has absorbed Alexei’s pain into his own body. Nicholas asks Rasputin how he knew about Alexei’s leg, and Rasputin {{responds}} that the Virgin Mary told him and sent him to heal Alexei; Nicholas remains skeptical.|$|R
50|$|The elder Gho {{died when}} Goh {{was three years}} old, leaving him {{in the care of}} his mother and Goh's older siblings. As a boy, Goh studied in the local town school and {{primarily}} taught in Dutch language. But he was active and mischievous child who often played truant from school and indulge in cock fighting. His strict disciplinarian mum would often punish him for playing truant - at one time she even put a ball and chain on the <b>boy's</b> <b>leg,</b> and sent him to school in a horse carriage, or a Bendi.|$|R
5000|$|Ned {{broke his}} leg as a child, and Hetty first {{tried to have}} him {{admitted}} to a free clinic for the poor. Charles Slack, her biographer, {{said that she was}} recognized, and she agreed to pay for the medical services. She also sought other doctors for help for Ned, while trying home remedies. The <b>boy's</b> <b>leg</b> did not heal properly and, after years of unsuccessful treatment, had to be amputated. Ned had to use a cork prosthesis. He grew to 6'4" [...] (1.93 m) and 300 lb. (136 kg) as an adult.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} morning, Ludovic buries a {{dead man}} he finds strung up outside. Later, Zioig returns and forces his way into Ludovic's cabin with a gun. When the boy faints, Ludovic takes pity on him and tends to the <b>boy's</b> <b>leg</b> wound with antibiotics. After feeding Zioig, Ludovic tells him {{that he has to}} leave the next day because his presence would endanger him. Zioig complies but later returns with a woman, who identifies herself as Zioig’s mother Ankica. Taking pity on them, Ludovic decides to allow Zioig and his mother to stay.|$|R
6000|$|People accuse Mr. Shaw {{and many}} much sillier persons of [...] "proving that black is white." [...] But they never {{ask whether the}} current colour-language is always correct. Ordinary {{sensible}} phraseology sometimes calls black white, it certainly calls yellow white and green white and reddish-brown white. We call wine [...] "white wine" [...] which is as yellow as a Blue-coat <b>boy's</b> <b>legs.</b> We call grapes [...] "white grapes" [...] which are manifestly pale green. We give to the European, whose complexion {{is a sort of}} pink drab, the horrible title of a [...] "white man"--a picture more blood-curdling than any spectre in Poe.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{great deal}} of harm," [...] Ned replied. [...] "If it was known that a <b>boy's</b> <b>leg</b> got broke {{in a fight with}} us it would be sure to come to Hathorn's ears; then there would be an inquiry and a row. Like enough he would go up to see the boy and inquire all about it. Then the men would suppose that we had broken our words, and the next time you and I go out on a fishing {{expedition}} there's no saying what mightn't happen to us. They are a rough lot those moor men, and don't stick at trifles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lord god {{of models}} and marvels, behold them! My dear, {{did you ever}} see two such legs on one small woman! Look at the {{roundness}} and taperingness. They're <b>boy's</b> <b>legs.</b> I've seen featherweights go into the ring with legs like those. And they're all-woman's legs, too. Never mistake them in the world. The arc of the front line of that upper leg! And the balanced adequate fullness at the back! And the way the opposing curves slender in to the knee that IS a knee! Makes my fingers itch. Wish I had some clay right now." ...|$|R
50|$|Coe {{taught and}} preached fervently on divine healing, {{claiming}} to have healed visitors to his revivals. In a 1955 revival service in Miami, Florida, Coe told {{the parents of a}} three-year-old boy that he had healed their son of polio. Coe then told the parents to remove the <b>boy's</b> <b>leg</b> braces. However, the boy was not cured, and removing the braces left him in constant pain. As a result, Coe was arrested and on February 6, 1956, was charged with practicing medicine without a license, a felony in the state of Florida. A judge dismissed the case on grounds that Florida exempts divine healing from the law.|$|R
40|$|Watercolour. The {{horse is}} shown side-on facing left, with its head {{turned away from}} the viewer. The boy is seen from behind in half-profile with a conical soft-cloth cap in bright red, a cloak in dark blue, and holding an {{unidentified}} brownish package(?) along with horse's reins. The rest of the picture is uncoloured. The annotation {{to the right of the}} milkboy reads: "brown earthen jars". The `earthen jars' are shown attached behind the <b>boy's</b> <b>legs</b> below the back hem of his cloak. In the distance to the right of the annotation two other mounted figures are sketched in profile from the side, riding to the left, one nearly obscuring the other. A boy on a horse...|$|R
5000|$|The {{secret to}} {{the trick was}} {{revealed}} by the magician Samri Baldwin as early as 1895. Baldwin described the trick as a very simple illusion. The boy whilst inside the basket [...] "coils himself around in the bulge or protruding sides of the basket, {{so that when the}} Fakeer tramples in the middle or center, he does not trample on the boy... The sword is only put through the basket at certain prearranged places and passes between the <b>boy's</b> <b>legs,</b> between his arms and the body, between the shoulders and the body, or between the shoulders and the neck." [...] As for the boy reappearing outside of the basket behind the crowd, it is not the same boy but a confederate.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} in no way to blame in the matter, nor could you have acted otherwise. The {{breaking}} of the <b>boy's</b> <b>leg</b> is unfortunate, {{but it was a}} pure accident, and even the boy's friends did not blame you in the matter. As to the illegal drilling, that is no new thing; it has been known to be going on for many months, and, indeed, in some places for years. The authorities take but little notice of it. An outbreak of these poor fellows would, indeed, constitute a considerable local danger. Mills might be burned down, and possibly some obnoxious masters killed, but a few troops of dragoons, or half a regiment of light infantry, would scatter them like chaff.|$|R
5000|$|... 17 October: RAAD claimed {{responsibility}} for shooting a 17-year-old <b>boy</b> in both <b>legs</b> at a house on Virginia Court, Derry.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, constable," [...] said Sir Richard, [...] "I am {{on my way}} {{to visit}} a poor <b>boy</b> whose <b>leg</b> was broken on the day my pony ran away. He was holding the pony at the time. He lives in Whitechapel somewhere. I have the address here in my note-book." ...|$|R
50|$|Liang Jie (April 1991) Liang Jie, {{a ten-year-old}} <b>boy</b> with {{disabled}} <b>legs,</b> {{was forced to}} swallow magnets for reporting abuse on another child.|$|R
50|$|There {{have also}} been legal controversies. For example, in 1955 at a Jack Coe revival service in Miami, Florida, Coe told {{the parents of a}} three-year-old boy that he healed their son who had polio. Coe then told the parents to remove the <b>boy's</b> <b>leg</b> braces. However, their son was not cured of polio and {{removing}} the braces left the boy in constant pain. As a result, through the efforts of Joseph L. Lewis, Coe was arrested and charged on February 6, 1956 with practicing medicine without a license, a felony in the state of Florida. A Florida Justice of the Peace dismissed the case on grounds that Florida exempts divine healing from the law. Later that year Coe was diagnosed with bulbar polio, and died a few weeks later at Dallas' Parkland Hospital on December 17, 1956.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not mind}} the darkness. When he had got into his clothes, he {{went out into the}} kitchen. His tread was very heavy for so thin and light a <b>boy.</b> His <b>legs</b> dragged with their own weight, which seemed {{unreasonable}} because they were such skinny legs. He drew a broken-bottomed chair to the table.|$|R
60|$|Mother, {{the poor}} soldier with {{diarrhoea}} is still living, but, O, what a looking object; death {{would be a}} boon to him; he cannot last many hours. Cunningham, the Ohio <b>boy</b> with <b>leg</b> amputated at thigh, has picked up beyond expectation now!--looks altogether like getting well. The hospitals are very full. I am very well indeed--pretty warm here to-day.|$|R
50|$|In July 2001, in Irvine, {{a coyote}} bit a 3-year-old <b>boy</b> in the <b>leg</b> {{while he was}} playing in his yard. He was saved by his father.|$|R
50|$|A footwalk {{that was}} created by Poppin Pete. He invented crazy legs by {{watching}} a <b>boy</b> called Crazy <b>Legs</b> dancing and changed what he saw into a Popping move.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not salt-water boys," [...] Sheldon cautioned, [...] "but bush boys--leg belong him strong fella <b>leg.</b> <b>Boy</b> no savvee musket, no good. You bring 'm boy shoot musket strong fella." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My hired <b>boy's</b> {{broke his}} <b>leg,</b> and I must fill his place right off. Somebody {{referred}} me to you. Guess I'll try you. Twelve dollars a month, board, and lodging. What say?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this moment}} a larger wave than usual took both <b>boys</b> off their <b>legs,</b> and dashed them with {{considerable}} force against the cliff. Frank seized Ruthven, and assisted him {{to regain his}} feet.|$|R
5000|$|Joe {{takes the}} boy to Dr. Merrill, who long ago {{proposed}} to Katherine, but she had politely declined and told the doctor that she still loved Joe. Dr. Merrill says he will either operate for free if Joe relinquishes Little Pal to his mother's care or charge a large fee if Joe insists on keeping {{the boy to}} himself. Joe panics and leaves with the boy, but soon realizes his mistake and brings Little Pal back for the surgery. After obtaining Joe's promise that he will return Little Pal to his mother, Merrill operates and restores {{the use of the}} <b>boy's</b> <b>legs.</b> Little Pal's voice is regained later when Katherine plays a recording by Joe, [...] "Little Pal", at his bedtime and Little Pal dreams of a tender visit with his father holding him in his arms and singing to him. Joe returns to work, singing and also sending personal messages over the airwaves to his wife, who, along with their son, await Joe at their lovely home.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2016, he {{appeared}} on the track [...] "Protectors of the Heat" [...] on Open Mike Eagle & Paul White’s album “Hella Personal Film Festival” and on [...] "This Is Where I Leave You", an exclusive track to the single Chekhov's Gun, off the album Fuck That Pretty Boy Shit by Words Hurt (rapper [...] Alaska & producer Lang Vo).
