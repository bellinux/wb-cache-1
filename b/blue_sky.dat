5|$|Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) {{studied the}} European honey bee, demonstrating that bees can {{recognize}} a desired compass direction {{in three different}} ways: by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the <b>blue</b> <b>sky,</b> and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive.|$|E
5|$|Monday, 16 August 1819, {{was a hot}} summer's day, with a {{cloudless}} <b>blue</b> <b>sky.</b> The fine weather {{almost certainly}} increased {{the size of the}} crowd significantly; marching from the outer townships in the cold and rain would have been a much less attractive prospect.|$|E

5|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{worked closely}} with series star David Duchovny, who shares a story credit with Carter for the episode. Because the series was filmed in Vancouver, the {{producers}} painted a disused quarry in Vancouver with 1,600 gallons of red paint and also composited in images shot in New Mexico and a <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> {{in order to make}} the New Mexico rock quarry featured in the episode.|$|E
5|$|The scene changes again, now to bright {{daylight}} and <b>blue</b> <b>sky.</b> Two men are driving an old Alfa Romeo Giulietta Spider passo corto down an empty road. As {{one of the}} men helps the girl up, she spreads her wings and he holds her hands while she gains confidence. With a nudge she is airborne, but she seems hesitant and afraid as he lets go.|$|E

5|$|This day a {{dense fog}} {{obscured}} everything. Things a foot away {{could not be}} made out. Towards evening, rain streamed down heavily, abating somewhat with night. The frightening waves were like mountains. They would lift the ship up into the <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> and then drop it as if down an abyss. They billowed and crashed, the noise splitting heaven from earth. We might all be drowned and left to rot at any moment.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of +0.08, Capella is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation Auriga, the sixth-brightest star in the night sky, the third-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere (after Arcturus and Vega), and the fourth-brightest star {{visible to the naked eye}} from the latitude 40° N. It appears to be a rich yellowish-white color, although the yellow color is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the <b>blue</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{over one}} million units in sales, John Madden Football '93 was a {{commercial}} success. Critics awarded the game high scores and praised its updated graphics; but several reviewers complained that little had changed since John Madden Football '92.

5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E
5|$|In November 1987, the British {{journalist}} and writer Russell Miller published Bare-faced Messiah, the first full-length biography of L. Ron Hubbard. He drew on Armstrong's papers, official records {{and interviews with}} those who had known Hubbard including ex-Scientologists and family members. The book was well-received by reviewers but the Church of Scientology sought unsuccessfully to prohibit its publication {{on the grounds of}} copyright infringement. Other critical biographical accounts are found in Bent Corydon's L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman? (1987) and Jon Atack's A Piece of <b>Blue</b> <b>Sky</b> (1990).|$|E
5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} Scotland's {{association with}} the Saint Andrew's Cross was related by Walter Bower and George Buchanan, who claimed that the flag originated in a 9th-century battle, where Óengus II led a combined force of Picts and Scots to victory over the Angles, led by Æthelstan. Supposedly, a miraculous white saltire appeared in the <b>blue</b> <b>sky</b> and Óengus' troops were roused to victory by the omen. Consisting of a blue background over which is placed a white representation of an X-shaped cross, the Saltire is one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.|$|E

5|$|Ultima Underworld: The Stygian Abyss is a first-person {{role-playing}} {{video game}} (RPG) developed by <b>Blue</b> <b>Sky</b> Productions (later Looking Glass Studios) {{and published by}} Origin Systems.

It takes place inside the Great Stygian Abyss: a large, underground cave system that contains the remnants of a failed utopian civilization. The player assumes the role of the Avatar—the Ultima series' protagonist—and attempts to find and rescue a baron's kidnapped daughter.|$|E
5|$|By 2001, {{the notable}} successes of computer-animated films from Pixar and DreamWorks such as Monsters, Inc. and, Shrek, respectively, against Disney's lesser returns for The Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis: The Lost Empire {{led to a}} growing {{perception}} that hand-drawn animation was becoming outdated and falling out of fashion. In March 2002, just after the successful release of <b>Blue</b> <b>Sky</b> Studios' computer-animated feature Ice Age, Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films. A handful of employees were offered positions doing computer animation. Morale plunged to a low {{not seen since the}} start of the studio's ten-year exile to Glendale in 1985. The Paris studio was also closed in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Dead reckoning, {{navigating}} from a known position {{using only}} information about one's own speed and direction, was suggested by Charles Darwin in 1873 {{as a possible}} mechanism. In the 20th century, Karl von Frisch showed that honey bees can navigate by the sun, by the polarization pattern of the <b>blue</b> <b>sky,</b> and by the earth's magnetic field; of these, they rely on the sun when possible. William Tinsley Keeton showed that homing pigeons could similarly make use {{of a range of}} navigational cues, including the sun, earth's magnetic field, olfaction and vision. Ronald Lockley demonstrated that a species of small seabird, the Manx shearwater, could orient themselves and fly home at full speed, when released far from home, provided either the sun or the stars were visible.|$|E
