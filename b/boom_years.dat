5|$|The trade's <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> ended around 1810, {{after which}} a long decline {{was marked by}} {{increasing}} economic diversification. By 1810, the supply of sea otter pelts had fallen due to overhunting. American trade declined during the War of 1812, but after 1815, Americans were able to resume and expand the maritime fur trade, and continued to dominate.|$|E
5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's total output of palm kernels. Since the Nigerian Civil War production has markedly declined {{largely because the}} plantations and processing equipment were either damaged or destroyed. The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil <b>boom</b> <b>years.</b> Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E
5|$|When {{industrialisation}} {{spread across}} Europe, Classicism and a distinctive style of historism developed in Germany, {{sometimes referred to}} as Gründerzeit style, due to the economical <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> {{at the end of the}} 19th century. Regional historicist styles include the Hanover School, Nuremberg Style and Dresden's Semper-Nicolai School. Among the most famous of German buildings, the Schloss Neuschwanstein represents Romanesque Revival. Notable sub-styles that evolved since the 18th century are the German spa and seaside resort architecture. German artists, writers and gallerists like Siegfried Bing, Georg Hirth and Bruno Möhring also contributed to the development of Art Nouveau at the turn of the 20th century, known as Jugendstil in German.|$|E
50|$|Scotts Run’s largest <b>boom</b> <b>year</b> was 1923, {{during which}} thirty-seven mines from thirty-three {{different}} companies actively operated. However, the overextended industry was in steady decline until 1923 until {{the beginning of}} the Great Depression in 1929.|$|R

5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city {{was stunned by the}} Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the Seattle Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> ended in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{town centre}} {{and its environs}} contain many {{examples}} of Regency, Victorian and Edwardian villas and hotels. Many of the houses were built during the Industrial Revolution, and Malvern's <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> as a spa town, by wealthy families from the nearby Birmingham area. Following {{the collapse of the}} spa industry, many of the hotels and villas became schools, and some have since been further converted to apartments, while some of the smaller hotels are now retirement homes. The Imperial Hotel in red brick with stone dressings, which later became a school, {{is one of the largest}} buildings in Malvern. It was built in 1860 by the architect E. W. Elmslie who also designed the Great Malvern railway station, and the Council House on the plot where Dr. Gully's original house stood. The Grove in Avenue Road in 1867, originally to be his private residence in 1927 became part of the Lawnside School for girls, and in 1860 Whitbourne Hall, a Grade II* listed building, in Herefordshire. The Imperial was the first hotel to be lit by incandescent gas. It was equipped with all types of baths and brine was brought specially by rail from Droitwich.|$|E

Business sentiment among manufacturers is currently as optimistic as last recorded in 2000, a <b>boom</b> <b>year.</b> Retail trade also showed signs of a revival, but weak car sales and lower fuel consumption held down the result for private consumption. ...|$|R

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} burdens on the government was the Canadian National Railway (CNR).

The debt the government assumed was over $2 billion, a massive sum at the time, but during the <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> it seemed payable. The Depression turned this debt into a crushing burden. Due to the decrease in trade, the CNR also began to lose substantial amounts of money during the Depression, and had to be further bailed out by the government.|$|E

25|$|Oil {{was first}} {{discovered}} in Alberta in 1902, {{but it did}} not become a significant industry in the province until 1947 when reserves of it were discovered near Leduc. Calgary quickly found itself at the centre of the ensuing oil boom. The city's economy grew when oil prices increased with the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973. The population increased by 272,000 in the eighteen years between 1971 (403,000) and 1989 (675,000) and another 345,000 in the next eighteen years (to 1,020,000 in 2007).

During the <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> of the pink film industry, in the mid- to late-1960s, dozens of small studios produced pink films. The major studios, including Toei, and especially Nikkatsu took over the sexploitation film in the early 1970s. This was a period of weeding-out of smaller independent studios, leaving only a few major pink studios. Along with Shintōhō Eiga and Ōkura Eiga (OP Eiga), Million {{was one of the few}} independent studios to survive this era.|$|E

Yet, since the mid- 1990 s, Spain was a champion of growth and fiscal stability; its unemployment had fallen rapidly to the levels that prevailed {{in the rest of}} the European Union.

25|$|Due to the 1973 {{spike in}} oil prices, {{the economy of}} Iran was flooded with foreign currency, which caused inflation. By 1974, the economy of Iran was {{experiencing}} double digit inflation, and despite the many large projects to modernize the country, corruption was rampant and caused large amounts of waste. By 1975 and 1976, an economic recession led to increased unemployment, especially among millions of youth who had migrated to the cities of Iran looking for construction jobs during the <b>boom</b> <b>years</b> of the early 1970s.

25|$|During the Depression, {{not much}} money was {{available}} {{since the two}} banks had failed, but progress continued, and the town still looked prosperous because of the previous burst of new buildings during the <b>boom</b> <b>years.</b> The Artists and Writers Colony flourished and Delray Beach's fame as a resort town grew.

Ramsden later became the first mayor of Barrow, which was given municipal borough status in 1867, and county borough status in 1889. The imposing red sandstone town hall, designed by W.H.
