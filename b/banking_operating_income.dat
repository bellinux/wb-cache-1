The electronic banks promote the business innovation, and it is very convenient for the customer service. The purpose of innovation is to improve the quality of service. Bank service quality is an important factor to affect the bank's reputation and an important means of competition among banks. Based on the model of service quality of commercial banks, according to Chinese current situation, the paper puts forward an evaluation method using the FAHP-FUZZY model of service quality evaluation, in order to promote the continuous improvement of commercial banking service quality. </p...|$|R
40|$|Bank {{revenues}} have a time variation pattern over the business cycle. Since revenues {{are a major}} determinant of bank capital and lending capacity, the time variation may {{have an impact on the}} real economy and may potentially amplify the business cycle. It will therefore be useful to understand how bank revenues vary over time, and in particular what are the relationships with key macroeconomic variables. The present paper sets out to investigate these relationships more deeply in the context of the Norwegian banking industry. The banking literature contains only a handful of studies of how bank revenues vary over the business cycle, and they all look exclusively on the net interest margin. The general conclusion has been that the margin tends to increase during recessions and decrease during booms. This paper extends the existing literature by taking the volume effect into account and looking at net interest income, and also by looking at how fee income varies over the cycle. The paper is written in the context of an on-going research programme at Norges Bank Financial Stability, aiming to develop procedures for stress testing the profitability and capital adequacy of the Norwegian <b>banking</b> sector. <b>Bank</b> <b>operating</b> <b>income,</b> Business cycles, Stress testing...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} risk {{mitigation}} of interest rate margins {{related to a}} bank’s demand deposits. We assume the demand deposit evolution {{to be related to}} both interest rates and some exogenous factor which can be interpreted as business risk or model risk. We subsequently discuss the tradeoff between the alleviation of interest rate risk and the excess return due to investing in longer term assets. We take the viewpoint of an asset and liability manager, dealing with interest rate derivatives and focusing on the <b>bank’s</b> net <b>operating</b> <b>income.</b> We firstly derive static hedging strategies in a mean-variance framework. Then we compare them with dynamic investment strategies. Applying Duffie and Richardson’s (1991) approach, we firstly study the case of demand deposits bearing a rate which is an affine function of the market rate. We prove that the optimal hedging risk profile involves a semi-static replication of Libor exotic options, thus revealing the hidden optionality in demand deposits and paving the way for low transaction cost hedging strategies. Finally, we derive dynamic optimal strategies when the deposit rate follows some more complex function of the market rate and we show their robustness with respect to other risk measures...|$|R
30|$|From Proposition 1, larger {{banks will}} value put options on their loan {{portfolios}} more than smaller banks. As the valuations of loan inflows differ between <b>banks</b> of varying <b>Operating</b> <b>Income</b> classes {{it is to}} the advantage of smaller banks to lend to more borrowers, while not going beyond lending limits set by the BSP. After a series of discussions with officers at various bank branches, and support from evidence of financial system wide outstanding loan values, actively traded Philippine Universal Banks tend to focus more efforts on making consumer loans (such as those for housing and cars). Distributing risk throughout more borrowers such that the amount in loans that do pay off, counter losses from defunct borrowers, proves as an impetus for more lending at an individual level. The practice of diversification, in this case diversifying among individual borrowers, echoes concepts from Markowitz (1952). This provides the argument for banks to engage in micro-lending activities to spur entrepreneurial ventures.|$|R
40|$|Using both a {{theoretical}} and empirical model, this paper examines the relationship between subordinated debt and risk in the banking industry. Analyzing quarterly data from March 1997 to December 2000, I use asset variance {{as a proxy for}} bank risk. I discover that the beta on subordinated debt is negative and insignificant. Therefore, my empirical work suggests the potential presence of market discipline. Government risk measures, the size of the <b>bank,</b> and its <b>operating</b> <b>income</b> are other measures that are highly correlated to asset variance.

30|$|This study {{introduces}} a Real Options Model that describes option values of loan portfolios for actively traded Philippine Universal Banks. The model assumes that these banks may continually invest funds; the loan portfolio and deposit accounts are positively and strongly correlated; and <b>banks</b> <b>operate</b> {{in an environment}} of imperfect information. From simulation, the study finds that the Value of Waiting functions similar to a risk-adjusted discount factor to <b>Operating</b> <b>Income</b> from the Loan Portfolio. Resulting cumulative distribution factors (from the equilibrium condition) adjust asset values, and inflows for lending risks. A put option premium on the loan portfolio results from the difference between the salvage value of a loan, and its inflows. This put option values the strategy of not lending, or idling, the loan portfolio. The call option values the strategy of lending, essentially expanding the loan portfolio. Call option premiums result from the difference between the risk-adjusted inflows, and the risk-adjusted value of the loan portfolio.|$|R
