25|$|Amygdalin {{was first}} {{isolated}} in 1830 from <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> seeds (Prunus dulcis) by Pierre-Jean Robiquet and Antoine Boutron-Charlard. Liebig and Wöhler found three hydrolysis products of amygdalin: sugar, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide). Later research showed that sulfuric acid hydrolyzes it into D-glucose, benzaldehyde, and prussic acid; while hydrochloric acid gives mandelic acid, D-glucose, and ammonia.|$|E
50|$|In Italy, <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds</b> are the {{traditional}} base for amaretti (almond macaroons), a common dessert. Traditionally, a low percentage of <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds</b> (10-20%) {{is added to}} the ingredients, which gives the cookies their bitter taste (commercially, apricot kernels are used as a substitute for <b>bitter</b> <b>almonds).</b> Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in torrone. In Apulia and Sicily, pasta di mandorle (almond paste) is used to make small soft cakes, often decorated with jam, pistachio, or chocolate. In Sicily, almond milk is a popular refreshing beverage in summer.|$|R

25|$|As {{with many}} {{other members of the}} rose family, peach seeds contain cyanogenic glycosides, {{including}} amygdalin (note the subgenus designation: Amygdalus). These substances are capable of decomposing into a sugar molecule and hydrogen cyanide gas. While peach seeds are not the most toxic within the rose family (see <b>bitter</b> <b>almond),</b> large consumption of these chemicals from any source is potentially hazardous to animal and human health.|$|E
25|$|Amygdalin is {{contained}} in stone fruit kernels, such as apricot (8%), peach (6%), <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> (5%), and plum (2.5%); amygdalin {{is also found in}} the seeds of the apple. The stones are taken out of the fruit and cracked to obtain the kernels, which are dried in the sun or in ovens. The kernels are boiled in ethanol; on evaporation of the solution and the addition of diethyl ether, amygdalin is precipitated as white minute crystals. Natural amygdalin has the (R)-configuration at the chiral phenyl center. Under mild basic conditions, this stereogenic center isomerizes; the (S)-epimer is called neoamygdalin. Although the synthesized version of amygdalin is the (R)-epimer, the stereogenic center attached to the nitrile and phenyl groups easily epimerizes if the manufacturer does not store the compound correctly.|$|E
60|$|Thus, bitter almonds contain two substances, {{amygdalin}} and synaptase, {{which can}} be extracted, in a separate state, from the bitter almonds. The amygdalin thus obtained, if dissolved in water, undergoes no change; but if a little synaptase {{be added to the}} solution, the amygdalin splits up into <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> oil, prussic acid, and a kind of sugar.|$|E

60|$|As {{chemistry}} advanced, facts came {{to light}} which put a new face upon Stahl's hypothesis, {{and gave it a}} safer foundation than it previously possessed. The general nature of these phenomena may be thus stated:--A body, A, without giving to, or taking from, another body B, any material particles, causes B to decompose into other substances, C, D, E, the sum of the weights of which is equal to the weight of B, which decomposes. Thus, bitter almonds contain two substances, amygdalin and synaptase, which can be extracted, in a separate state, from the bitter almonds. The amygdalin thus obtained, if dissolved in water, undergoes no change; but if a little synaptase be added to the solution, the amygdalin splits up into <b>bitter</b> <b>almond</b> oil, prussic acid, and a kind of sugar.|$|E
