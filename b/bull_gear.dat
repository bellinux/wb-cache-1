The conventional metallic web was replaced with a composite element made from A&P's quasi-isotropic braid. The 0 deg, +/- 60 deg braid architecture was chosen so that inplane stiffness properties and strength would be nearly equal in all directions. The test results from the Phase I Small Spur Gear program demonstrated satisfactory endurance and strength while providing a 20 percent weight savings. (Greater weight savings is anticipated with structural optimization.) The hybrid gears were subjected to a proof-of-concept test of 1 billion cycles in a gearbox at 10, 000 revolutions per minute and 490 in-lb torque with no detectable damage to the gears. After this test the maximum torque capability was also tested, and the static strength capability of the gears was 7 x the maximum operating condition. Additional proof-of-concept tests are in progress using a higher oil temperature, and a loss-of-oil test is planned.

Introduction: Object: To design and construct at the shops of the Kansas State Agricultural College, a gasoline traction engine that shall fulfill the following requirements; The engine shall have but one set of gearing {{to be used for}} forward and reverse motion, dispensing with speed changing gearing, together with its expensive first cost and maintenance, noise, low efficiency and weight. The gearing shall be on stiff shafts and rigid centers, having no radius rods nor stub gearing. All gears shall be of crucible cast steel, and shall be of ample size to stand rough usage and wear. Master or <b>bull</b> <b>gears</b> shall have roller bearings. Differential gears shall be of the spur gear type and shall be placed on a counter shaft. The <b>bull</b> <b>gears</b> shall be attached to the drive wheels by means of ample spring cushion links to take off sudden strains on the gearing and frame. The crank shaft shall be given as steady a torque as possible by using four quadruple opposed cylinders. These cylinders shall be large enough to give the crank shaft as great a torque as is given to the crank shaft of steam engine of the same nominal rating. The governor shall be constructed {{so that it can be}} set and regulated to run the engine under complete control at any speed from 50 R. P. M. to 220 R. P. M., as desired. The cylinders shall be horizontal and shall be located as low as possible in order that they may be covered with cooling water when water in the tank is low. The engine shall be easily reversed and shall be fitted with two friction clutches, one for the traction gearing and one for the belt pulley...|$|R

40|$|Power {{production}} {{represents one}} fourth to {{one third of}} all CO 2 emissions. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in one way to approach the increasing problem with CO 2 emissions from fossil fuelled power plants. The CO 2 is separated, compressed and transported to a final storing site. To allow more efficient transport and to match {{the pressure of the}} final storing site, the CO 2 is compressed to a supercritical fluid. The additional equipment that a CCS system requires will {{have a negative effect on}} the overall power plant efficiency and it is of great importance to minimise this consequence. This thesis is a preliminary scoping of different CO 2 compression technologies and ways to improve them prior to transportation to a final storage site. The report compares existing, adapted and novel compression technologies in terms of power consumption. CO 2 is currently being compressed in for example urea production using integrally <b>bull</b> <b>geared</b> compressors. In-line barrel compressors used in the gas industry show promising possibilities to be adapted for CO 2. Two novel ways that has been investigated are a high pressure ratio compressor that uses oblique shock waves to compress the gas and a cryogenic system where the CO 2 first is compressed, then cooled in chillers and then pumped to the required delivery pressure. The different compression technologies were modelled in IPSEpro, a thermodynamic simulation tool and the data was validated against TechUtils, a thermodynamic calculation tool. The result shows that compared to the current compression technologies for CO 2, novel or adapted methods can reduce the power consumption with approximately 7 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Integrally geared {{compressors}} (IGCs) {{comprise of}} single stage impellers {{installed on the}} ends of pinion shafts, all driven by a main <b>bull</b> <b>gear</b> (BG) and shaft system. When compared to single shaft multistage centrifugal compressors, the benefits of IGCs include better thermal efficiency, reduced footprint and simple foundation, dispensing with a high speed coupling, as well as better access for maintenance and overhauls. In IGCs the compression of the process gas induces axial loads on the pinion shafts that are transmitted via thrust collars (TCs) to the main drive shaft and balanced by a single thrust bearing. The TCs, located on either side of pinion gears, slightly overlap with the BG outer diameter to form lentil-shaped lubricant-wetted regions. A numerical model, based on classical thin film lubrication theory, predicts the force response of lubricated thrust collars for use in integrally geared compressors. The predictive model determines performance parameters such as lubricant flow rate, mechanical power loss, peak pressure, lubricant temperature rise, as well as rotordynamic stiffness and damping coefficients for a lubricated TC and <b>bull</b> <b>gear</b> pair. A Newton-Raphson based iterative procedure determines an equilibrium operating position for a given set of TC and BG operating conditions and geometry. Periodic, dynamic displacements from the equilibrium position renders complex dynamic stiffnesses (H = K+i?C), from which the fluid film force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients are determined. In a lubricated thrust collar and <b>bull</b> <b>gear,</b> a hydrodynamic pressure builds in {{the lower half of the}} lubricated zone and lubricant cavitation occurs in the upper half. The minimum film thickness and peak pressure in the lubricated zone shift location due to the difference in taper angles between the TC and BG surfaces. For a given applied load, a study on the differences in taper angle between the TC and BG surfaces reveals that current angular tolerances of ? 0. 1 produce TC/BG pairs with similar performance parameters (power loss, lubricant temperature rise, etc.) and dynamic force and moment stiffness and damping coefficients. Increasing the taper angles of both the TC and BG decreases mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise, but also decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. In addition, static angular misalignments of the TC and BG about the horizontal (x) axis joining the BG and TC centers alters the shape and extent of the lubricant cavitation region. This change alters the load carrying capacity and mechanical power losses of the lubricated element. For the specific TC/BG pair investigated herein, there exists a maximum difference between the two taper angles for which the mechanical element can support an imposed thrust load. Increasing the speed of the BG (and proportionally the TC speed) increases the mechanical power loss and lubricant temperature rise and decreases the fluid film axial stiffness and damping coefficients. As with most fluid film bearings, increasing the applied load increases the power loss, lubricant temperature rise, and axial stiffness and damping coefficients. The thesis delivers a predictive tool, yet to be benchmarked against experimental data, that provides insight to both the static and dynamic force performance of a lubricated thrust collar, not currently in the archived literature...|$|E
40|$|PaperPg. 19 - 27. This paper {{presents}} {{the highlights of}} a complete rotor dynamics analysis and bearing optimization study that was performed on a 3800 HP multistage steam turbine. This unit is coupled to a three stage, poster-type, centrifugal air compressor with two high speed pinion shafts engaging a common <b>bull</b> <b>gear.</b> The turbine drives the lower speed pinion at a maximum speed of 10, 500 rpm. Located {{at the other end}} of this same pinion is the first stage impeller wheel. The second and third stages are mounted on the higher speed pinion, rotating at a maximum speed of 13, 600 rpm. The maximum speed of the <b>bull</b> <b>gear</b> is 1, 940 rpm. All the existing compressor bearings are the four-lobe type. The original turbine rotor consists of three stages and has a 41. 34 inch bearing span. The bearings are lemon-bore type with journal diameters of 3. 0 and 4. 0 inches on the inlet and exhaust ends, respectively. This turbine has exhibited subsynchronous vibration, at approximately half rotational speed, during field testing. The half frequency vibration prevented operation above 9, 400 rpm because a shaft resonance was excited and vibration levels became prohibitively high. The analysis of the existing rotor-bearing system predicts that the turbine operates close to the second critical speed and that the rotor is stable under normal load conditions. However, the rotor becomes unstable when the lemon-bore bearings are unloaded. There are two major sources of bearing load in addition to gravity. These loads are misalignment and gear mesh loading. Misalignment can result from differential thermal growth of the turbine and compressor cases and supports. If the coupling does not act as an ideal joint, this differential growth can impose external loads at the bearings. The bearing load resulting from the gear mesh is a reaction to the torque transmission at the gear interface. For example, the turbine driver rotates in the counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, the low speed pinion gear tends to climb up the <b>bull</b> <b>gear,</b> which causes an upward external load on the pinion bearings. As in the case of misalignment, if the coupling is not ideal, the turbine bearings can also be affected by these gear mesh reaction loads. This analysis is primarily concerned with the effect of these external loads that oppose gravity and cause degrees of net bearing unloading because the unloading causes rotor instability. The rotor is unstable with 75 pounds unloading at each bearing or 110 pounds unloading at the exhaust end bearing alone (with a normal gravity load at the inlet end bearing). As a solution to the problem, a new set of bearings was designed to stabilize the rotor and move the peak response speeds away from the operating speed range. The new bearings are five-shoe-tilt-pad bearings with load-between-pad orientation. The inlet end bearing has a 3. 0 inch diameter bore with length-to-diameter ratio of 1. 0; and preload of 0. 8. The exhaust end bearing has a 3. 995 inch diameter bore with a length-to-diameter ratio of 0. 4 and preload of 0. 0. With the new tilt-pad bearing design there are no response peaks in the normal operating speed range and the system log decrement is 2. 8 times higher than with the existing system, under normal load conditions. The log decrement for the tilt-pad bearings is + 0. 52 for an unloading of 100 pounds. Therefore, the tilt-pads provide a stable rotor support that is not sensitive to unloading...|$|E

Vibration levels did not differ greatly between the hybrid and steel configurations, nor did temperature differential between inlet and outlet. While orbit shape displayed differences between the hybrid and baseline configurations, the general overall amplitude was comparable.
