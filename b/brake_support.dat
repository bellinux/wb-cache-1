40|$|It is {{desirable}} for driving support systems {{to improve the}} safety of driver vehicle systems, {{and at the same}} time to have a performance that does not make individual drivers feel uncomfortable. Since human beings have various control characteristics, any system that supports driving under fixed conditions without taking such characteristics into consideration cannot be a driving support system in the true sense. The authors believe that only those systems that reflect the characteristics of individual drivers improve safety and pave the way for their widespread use, and proposal Tailormade Driving Support System (TDSS) in IATSS RESEARCH Vol. 28 No. 1. This TDSS is composed of three systems that <b>support</b> <b>braking,</b> steering and accelerating, and it gives assistance fitted to individual drivers with a driver model that uses a neural network. This research reviewed the construction of models of a Tailormade <b>Braking</b> <b>Support</b> System (TBSS) for braking to stop vehicles and the evaluation of drivers. As a result, the following conclusions were drawn. (1) Braking factors were found to change in the period from the start of braking to stopping; (2) Changes in braking factors can be logically incorporated into the control elements of <b>braking</b> <b>support</b> system; (3) Readymade Driver Model is effective as a model to be incorporated into the base system of TBSS; (4) Tailormade Driver Model built on Neural Network is effective as a main model to construct TBSS; (5) As for TBSS, both subjective and objective ratings on the timing and magnitude of braking are favorable, and its safety and sense of security are improved...|$|R

To extend the applications-range of LIBs to Full-Hybride and native electric drive, the availability of storage systems with increased volumetric and gravimetric energy density (high-energy batteries, HE) is a precondition.

50|$|At launch, Kadett Cs {{powered by}} the 1.0 litre and the lower {{compression}} version of the 1.2 litre engine were delivered fitted with 200 mm diameter drum brakes on all four wheels. It was possible to specify front disc brakes, which, following an upgrade in January 1975, became standard fittings on all Kadetts. Servo-assistance for the brakes was also initially an option which became a standard fitting - in this case from May 1975 - on these less powerful Kadetts. On cars fitted with the higher compression version of the 1.2 litre engine and on cars with larger engines, the combination of front wheel disc brakes and rear wheel drum <b>brakes,</b> <b>supported</b> by servo-assistance had come as standard equipment from 1973. The brakes on the Kadett C were operated via a twin circuit hydraulic mechanism.|$|R

5000|$|Breeching {{may be omitted}} {{where the}} animal {{does not need to}} provide {{substantial}} braking. For example, in very light harness, such as in a sulky used for harness racing or in a light cart used with fine harness, the weight of the vehicle and passenger is little enough that the girth and crupper of the harness provide sufficient <b>braking</b> <b>support.</b> Breeching may also be omitted if the vehicle has efficient brakes on the wheels [...] - [...] examples include larger carriages and modern vehicles with disk brakes. Similarly, breeching and the requisite shafts or pole are not needed for a dragged load such as a plow or a log that will not move on its own, nor for a canal boat, which is towed by a long rope from the bank.Historically, additional animals were sometimes used to brake very heavy vehicles on steep downhills, being hitched in harness breeching behind the load. This is still done when logging in very steep terrain.|$|R
50|$|The S80 is {{available}} with optional Adaptive cruise control (ACC) with Collision Warning with full <b>Brake</b> <b>Support</b> (CWBS). <b>Brake</b> <b>Support</b> offers additional assistance by preparing {{the braking system}} so that the car can begin stopping faster and preparing for panic brake application. S80 is also equipped with an adaptive brake light as standard which is active at speeds above 30 mph, and can sense the difference between normal and panic braking. Ready Alert Brakes (RAB) are also available to anticipate severe braking. It prepares for this by moving the brake pads closer to the discs.|$|E
50|$|Using an {{exterior}} design previewed by the 2013 Ford Atlas concept vehicle, the 2015 F-150 {{introduced a}} number of driver assistance and safety technologies to the vehicle, including a 360-Degree camera, Adaptive Cruise Control and Collision Warning with <b>Brake</b> <b>Support,</b> Blind Spot Information System with Cross-Traffic Alert, and Lane-Keeping System.|$|E
50|$|Radar-based ACC often {{feature a}} precrash system, which warns the driver and/or {{provides}} <b>brake</b> <b>support</b> {{if there is}} a high risk of a collision. Also in certain cars it is incorporated with a lane maintaining system which provides a power steering assist to reduce steering input burden on corners when the cruise control system is activated.|$|E

40|$|Introduction {{of active}} safety systems {{has led to a}} {{significant}} increase of passenger car safety. However, statistics on road accidents show that further improvements of active systems would be necessary. This paper presents a dynamical model of the engine-car-brakes system that is used to simulate vehicle deceleration and calculate the risk of injuries. The model is used to quantify the performance of {{active safety systems}} during specific collision scenarios in which several vehicle cruising speeds and different values of distance from the obstacle that causes the active system activation are considered. The base system constituted by actual hydraulic brakes with embedded ABS is first compared to the ideal active system. The latter allows for maximum vehicle deceleration owing to ideal operation of hydraulic <b>brakes</b> <b>supported</b> by ABS and also to mechatronic actuation which anticipates the human intervention and eliminates the delay due to reaction time. Then, the model is used to analyse two feasible evolutions of the ideal active safety system. In the first one, the internal combustion engine friction power aids the vehicle speed decrease before the action of brakes. In the second one, specifically devoted to vehicles powered by hybrid electrical�thermal units, the reversible electric motor operates in addition/substitution to the braking action exerted by the engine mechanical friction...|$|R
50|$|The Sports ABS system <b>supports</b> <b>braking</b> when {{entering}} {{into a corner}} by controlling power to all tires depending on handling characteristics. Braking can be controlled to obtain optimal damping at each tire based on information from four wheel-speed sensors and steering wheel angle sensor. The addition of yaw rate sensors and brake pressure sensors to the Sport ABS system has improved braking performance through corners compared to the Lancer Evolution IX.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 Ford {{introduced}} the Collision Warning with <b>Brake</b> <b>Support</b> on the Lincoln MKS and MKT and the Ford Taurus. This system provides a warning through a Head Up Display that visually resembles brake lamps. If the driver does not react, the system pre-charges {{the brakes and}} increases the brake assist sensitivity to maximize driver braking performance.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} safety systems {{seen in this}} {{generation}} of the Taurus either saw their debut or one of their first uses by Ford in the vehicle, including BLIS, Adaptive cruise control, Forward Collision Warning with <b>Brake</b> <b>Support,</b> and Lane keeping assist. As with its predecessor, the Ford Taurus is equipped with dual front airbags, side airbags, and curtain airbags.|$|E
5000|$|Smart City <b>Brake</b> <b>Support</b> uses a {{windshield}} mounted laser {{that measures}} {{the distance to}} a car in front, works with car braking systems at speeds below 19 mph to avoid or reduce the severity of a rear-end collision. If the SCBS laser detects imminent collision conditions, the braking system is prepared to deliver full stopping power, the engine speed is reduced, and if necessary, brakes are applied.|$|E
50|$|Radial force {{variation}} or {{road force}} variation (RFV) is a property of a tire that affects steering, traction, <b>braking</b> and load <b>support.</b> High values of RFV {{for a given}} tire reflect {{a high level of}} manufacturing variations in the tire structure that will impart ride disturbances into the vehicle in the vertical direction. RFV is measured according to processes specified by the ASTM International in ASTM F1806 - Standard Practice for Tire Testing.|$|R
40|$|Many {{scientific}} researches {{and huge}} investments {{have been addressed}} towards improving the safety of passenger cars in recent decades. However, about 3, 600 people dead and 265, 000 people injured because of almost 187, 000 road accidents that occurred in Italy during 2012 prove that much {{still needs to be}} done. The new opportunities offered by mechatronics push R&D towards active safety systems, such as antilock braking system (ABS), traction control system (TCS), and electronic stability control (ESC). Active safety systems are very interesting because they act before the collision event in order to avoid/limit the accident effects and, therefore, they contribute also to increase the effectiveness of any co-existing passive safety system. This paper presents a dynamical model of the engine–car–brakes system that is used to simulate vehicle deceleration and calculate the risk of injuries. The model is used to quantify the performance of active safety systems during specific collision scenarios in which several vehicle cruising speeds and different values of distance from the obstacle that causes the active system activation are considered.

5000|$|The {{similarly}} named Smart <b>Brake</b> <b>Support</b> uses {{a millimeter}} wave radar to measure distances {{to the next}} car as far as 200 m ahead, at speeds up to 90 mph. The SBS radar inputs {{can be used for}} adaptive cruise control inputs to allow for safe following distances using cruise control throttle and brake inputs, and {{in the event of a}} potential collision, SBS can apply brakes and slow the car for collision avoidance or collision severity mitigation.|$|E

40|$|Parallel {{mechanisms}} frequently {{contain an}} unstable type of singularity {{that has no}} counterpart in serial mechanisms. When the mechanism is at or near this type of singularity, it loses the ability to counteract external forces in certain directions. This paper considers an interesting alternative to redundant actuation {{through the application of}} additional kinematic constraint viapassive joint braking in the close neighborhood of unstable poses. The brake has the advantage of not requiring additional actuator/sensor pairs or mechanism architecture redesign, and of being implemented only when necessary to stabilize the system. The kinematic analysis of <b>braked</b> mechanisms is <b>supported</b> with results using a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) parallel machining mechanism. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{takes up}} the {{familiar}} question of how one can explain support for European integration. One line of explanation builds on trade theory to theorize a calculus of economic costs and benefits. A second explanation draws on cognitive and social psychology to assess how individuals use political cues—grounded in ideology or elite communication—as a guide to complex issues. A third line draws on the psychology of group membership to consider how group identities, above all, national identities, bear on support for European integration. We use multi-level analysis to evaluate these explanations, and we conclude that perceptions of national identity are by far most powerful in structuring views on European integration. We find that the particular perception of national identity matters, {{as well as how}} identity is mobilized in national contexts. Thus, while strong national identity is consistent with support for European integration, exclusive national identity is a powerful <b>brake</b> on <b>support.</b> The effect of exclusive national identity varies across countries. It is strongest in countries where referenda on European integration have taken place. Referenda exacerbate conflicts within and among elites and empower single-issue anti-European protest movements, and this mobilizes exclusive national identity in an anti-European direction.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCurrently, the world's predicament regarding fuel shortages affects the daily activities {{of nations and}} directly affects national security. The concept of starving an aggressive nation of resources, in particular fuel, is a war tactic that is effective in preventing the aggressor from accomplishing objectives. This was proven in World War II. National security is affected because shortages leave nations defenseless against invaders. Warfare methodologies will change drastically to accommodate the inability to use fossil fueled assets, unless alternative energy sources are found. The focus {{of this research is}} to use computer software and electrical hardware available to the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) to model regenerative <b>braking</b> to <b>support</b> energy conservation technologies and to improve the efficiencies within the United States Navy (USN). The goal of this research is to demonstrate regenerative braking during the deceleration of an induction motor and analyze various aspects during the braking process. This will help in the further development for the "All Electric Ship" by exploring methods to increase its longevity, while improving the efficiency of energy recovery technology. The USN will realize a degree of freedom from fossil fuel and be capable of employing future, more versatile energy recovery systems for naval base infrastructure. US Navy (USN) autho...|$|R
