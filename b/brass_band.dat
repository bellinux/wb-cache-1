5|$|Traditional {{folk music}} in Northern England is a {{combination}} of styles of England and Scotland – what is now called the Anglo-Scottish border ballad was once prevalent as far south as Lancashire. In the Middle Ages, much of Northern folk was accompanied by bagpipes, with styles including the Lancashire bagpipe, Yorkshire bagpipe and Northumbrian smallpipes. These disappeared {{in the early nineteenth century}} from the industrialising south of the region, but remain in the music of Northumbria. The British <b>brass</b> <b>band</b> tradition began in Northern England at around the same time: the dismissal of the Cheshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire military bands after the Napoleonic Wars, combined with the desire of industrial communities to better themselves, led to the founding of civilian bands. These bands provided entertainment at community events and led protest marches during the era of radical agitation. Although the style has since spread across much of Great Britain, brass bands remain a stereotype of the North, and the Whit Friday <b>brass</b> <b>band</b> contests draw hundreds of bands from across the UK and further afield.|$|E

They entertained themselves with sports, sun baking and gambling, and those on Queen Mary could attend concerts performed by a regimental <b>brass</b> <b>band.</b> The 9th Division's officers enjoyed somewhat better conditions, which frustrated {{some of the other}} ranks. The 9th Division's preparations for jungle warfare continued during the voyage, with all personnel attending daily lectures delivered by officers on the lessons learnt during the previous fighting in the Pacific.|$|E
