5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
25|$|Surprise {{is a big}} {{element in}} bowling, and bowlers will often shun common {{tactical}} approaches {{in the hope of}} simply confusing the batsman into playing the wrong shot. For example, bowling a yorker at a new batsman who will likely <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> bouncers or at least standard line and length balls has been the cause of many batsmen losing their wicket first ball.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirement}} of road signals that a stop light should be visible over a queue of traffic {{and as far}} back as possible (thus demanding an order with red above) does not apply to railways with a block signalling system as there is no traffic queuing within a block, there being only one train in a block at a time. With railway signals, red need not be at the top for maximum visibility over distance as the driver of a train will already <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> a red signal, having passed a yellow one in the previous block. This advance warning is missing with road signals.|$|E

25|$|On July 2, 1976 the two-man Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) {{detachment}} of Willow Bunch {{moved to the}} nearby town of Coronach, Saskatchewan after 90 years in Willow Bunch. The then-Assistant Commissioner, J.E. Gibbon, recommended that the RCMP should be moved because of the low population in Willow Bunch. Residents of Willow Bunch strongly disagreed with the move and protested at the Regina Legislature on two different occasions. Two hundred protesters gathered outside the legislature on June 1, 1976. On June 30, 130 protested, demanding to see then-Saskatchewan premier Allan Blakeney. The premier told the angry group that he would not make any commitments other than to consider new facts on the move. Until that confrontation, Attorney General Roy Romanow had been the main government official handling the press and public for the RCMP move. Romanow had said the RCMP advised him that, “one man detachments are of limited value” and that is why the RCMP would be building a new detachment in the economically prosperous Coronach. The developing Poplar River Power Station in Coronach would <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> 400 to 500 workers, therefore more police manpower would be needed in the town, he argued.|$|E
25|$|Their {{preliminary}} versions used primitive art {{assets to}} allow them to focus on the game. This helped them to realize that they were trying to help the player become invested in the characters they controlled, allowing their imagination to fill in what their graphics at the time could not. Only as they neared the August 2011 Game Developers Conference in China after about six months of work, where they planned to submit FTL as part of the Independent Games Festival there, did they start focusing on the game's art. The game was named as a finalist at the IGF China competition, leading to initial media exposure for the game. PC Gamer magazine offered an early preview of the game that created more media interest in time for the Independent Games Festival at the March 2012 Games Developer Conference. The OnLive cloud-based gaming service included FTL and other Independent Games Festival finalists for several weeks around the conference. At the Festival, FTL was nominated for, though did not win, the Grand Prize and the Excellent in Design award; these accolades further helped spark interest in the game. Davis considered that the game's involvement in these competitions were important to keep the game's development on a forward schedule, as judges and members of the press would <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> playable prototypes of the completed title. He believed that the publicity of being a part of these competitions, even if not as a nominated title, helped to garner interest in FTL by the larger public.|$|E
500|$|As Seen On TV was {{a highly}} {{acclaimed}} show in the United Kingdom {{by the time it}} ended in 1987. Wood, having just received a BAFTA for the first series, said at the time: [...] "I was very pleased to win, but it really put pressure on me. I was already writing the new series and every time I looked at the award I kept on thinking that people would <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> so much more now and I just wouldn't be able to live up to it. In the end, I just put the thing away." [...] The series then went on to win BAFTAs for its entire run.|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The Indo-Asian News Service gave the album 3.5 stars (out of 5): [...] "Bharadwaj has composed a wonderful album {{that is not}} a clone of his previous work. It exudes freshness and is worth listening. However, the songs would not have achieved zenith without Gulzar's lovely lyrics. The team has done it again". Bollywood Hungama rated the album a 3 (out of 5): [...] "7 Khoon Maaf is a good album with a couple of definite hits, couple of skip worthy ones and the remaining have the potential to grow. Since 7 Khoon Maaf is not a routine Bollywood affair, it can't <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> a quick pick at the stands from Day One". The Hindustan Times noted that the soundtrack takes the listener through a variety of moods: [...] "Bhardwaj has certainly succeeded in adding new sounds to his catalogue. He continues to evade Bollywood monotony with this soundtrack [...] an innovative effort." ...|$|E
500|$|At that time, a Parisian ballet {{audience}} typically {{consisted of}} two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a [...] "Bohemian" [...] group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would [...] "acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions [...] began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: [...] "Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with {{the intervention of the}} police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. Things grew noticeably quieter during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final [...] "Sacrificial Dance" [...] was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.|$|E
500|$|After being {{nominated}} for awards {{such as the}} Golden Globes, Critics' Choice, and Writers Guild of America, Deadpool was considered a serious contender for several Academy Awards despite its content and tone, including potential nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and, after its Producers Guild of America nomination, Best Picture. When the film did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it was widely considered to have been [...] "". Analyzing potential reasons for this, Screen Rant's Alex Leadbeater said that though the film [...] "earned a solid thumbs up from most", it was generally not praised by top critics for offering any [...] "depth or related subversion of its genre." [...] He also noted an apparent bias that Academy voters' have against superhero films; {{the lack of a}} targeted campaign for the awards by Fox, who did not seem to <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> any of the film's previous awards either; and the large amount of other films in contention, as [...] "2016 was, all in all, a pretty good year for movies". A variant cover for Marvel Comics' X-Men: Gold #1, with art by Ron Lim, references Deadpools Oscar snub.|$|E

2500|$|The ad {{was also}} denounced by Canada's {{ambassador}} to the United States, Michael Wilson, and in the Parliament of Canada by MP Omar Alghabra. [...] The ad became an issue in Canada because of an actor's statement in the advertisement, [...] "Canada {{can take care of}} North Korea. They’re not busy." [...] Alghabra, in the House of Commons, responded, [...] "Is this what Canadians should <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> as the outcome of cozying up to Mr. Bush by the prime minister and his Conservatives?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The song {{proved to}} be a huge hit, a {{surprise}} for the station since they catered mainly to a more staid audience, which would normally <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> songs from singers such as Andy Williams or Bobby Vinton instead of rock and roll. James took to playing the song repeatedly on the station, often turning down the song in the middle to make the declaration, [...] "This is a Carroll James exclusive", to avoid theft of the song by other stations.|$|E

2500|$|Although Eurogamer's Simon Parkin {{praised the}} {{graphics}} {{and range of}} mini-games and side-quests, he felt the game's release after Final Fantasy XII placed an unrealizable burden of expectation upon it: [...] "Many players will <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> that game's new lessons in design to have been absorbed and even evolved here." [...] He concluded, when [...] "viewed objectively and set against the newest highpoints of the genre, aside from its gorgeous aesthetics and removal of load times, Rogue Galaxy just isn't the marvel it's been set up to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Altruism can be {{distinguished}} from feelings of loyalty, in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether [...] "true" [...] altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing {{can be described as}} truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification. The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as [...] "benefits". The actor also may not <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> a reward.|$|E
2500|$|In the Fourth Test at Sydney, England took {{a series}} lead with a 299-run win {{after taking a}} 106-run first innings lead and setting Australia 415 for victory. Lawry's critics became more vocal, despite a defiant unbeaten 60 {{carrying}} his bat as Australia collapsed and fell for 116 in the second innings. It was England's largest victory in terms of runs over Australia for 34 years. His own batting saw him described by Ian Wooldridge as [...] "a corpse with pads on". According to Ray Robinson, Lawry [...] "appeared to <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> the worst and getting it often enough to expect more of the same". The selectors responded by axing both of Australia's frontline pace duo of McKenzie and Connolly for the Fifth Test.|$|E

2500|$|To {{transport}} the raiders across the North Sea, a Minerve class submarine, Q186 Junon, {{under the command}} of Commander Querville and belonging to the Free French Navy was used. Junon was selected because in silhouette it had the appearance of a German U-Boat, which could be advantageous if sighted on the surface. The submarine left the Orkney Islands at 11:40 on 11 September 1942, under escort in British waters by HMS Sturgeon, HMS Tigris and HMS Thunderbolt. Junon crossed the North Sea undetected and, nearing Glomfjord, rose to periscope depth. Checking the horizon they discovered that a fishing boat was trailing them; they crash dived, but this sighting {{does not appear to have}} compromised the operation. [...] The commander of the raid, Captain Black, had decided against a frontal assault since he suspected any German defences would <b>be</b> <b>expecting</b> just that. The submarine entered the Bjaerangsfjord just south of Glomfjord on 15 September.|$|E
