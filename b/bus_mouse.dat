25|$|The Macintosh SE was {{released}} {{at the same}} time as the Macintosh II for $2900 (or $3900 with hard drive), as the first compact Mac with a 20MB internal hard drive and an expansion slot. The SE's expansion slot was located inside the case along with the CRT, potentially exposing an upgrader to high voltage. For this reason, Apple recommended users bring their SE to an authorized Apple dealer to have upgrades performed. The SE also updated Jerry Manock and Terry Oyama's original design and shared the Macintosh II's Snow White design language, as well as the new Apple Desktop <b>Bus</b> (ADB) <b>mouse</b> and keyboard that had first appeared on the Apple IIGS some months earlier.|$|R

5000|$|Passing through Amsterdam {{where they}} joined {{up with the}} crew of the Man bus just {{returned}} from India, they set out for Stockholm in a <b>bus</b> called the <b>Mouse</b> <b>bus</b> that had been converted from a gasoline engine to a propane engine. This was done {{in order to make the}} point at the conference that if a bunch of [...] "ignorant hippies" [...] could convert machines that consumed gasoline (and create unnecessary pollution), then industry could just as well or perhaps even better convert motors to a cleaner fuel. The Hog Farm were given a free campsite at Skarpnäck, a small glider airfield outside Stockholm proper together with an assortment of ecology activists. A free kitchen was established there by the Swedish Army who brought several mobile cooking units and also left hundreds of pounds of oatmeal, wheat flour, rice and other foods to help out with. The Free Food Kitchen started feeding a few hundred people a day. The Swedish Army also set up over 100 twenty-man tents, and built a stage where, at night, people gathered and discussed the happenings of the day. The highlight for the Hog Farm was the whale march into downtown Stockholm where they traveled in a bus—the Robin Hood bus—that was covered in black plastic with a big whale tail and preceded by a group of dancers representing death, to support a moratorium on the killing of whales.|$|R
5000|$|The iPAQ was {{developed}} by Compaq based on the SA-1110 [...] "Assabet" [...] and SA-1111 [...] "Neponset" [...] reference boards that were engineered by a StrongARM development group located at Digital Equipment Corporation's Hudson Massachusetts facility. At the time when these boards were in development, this facility was acquired by Intel. When the [...] "Assabet" [...] board is combined with the [...] "Neponset" [...] companion processor board they provide support for 32 megabytes of SDRAM in addition to CompactFlash and PCMCIA slots along with an I2S or AC-Link serial audio <b>bus,</b> PS/2 <b>mouse</b> and trackpad interfaces, a USB host controller and 18 additional GPIO pins. Software drivers for a CompactFlash ethernet device, IDE storage devices such as the IBM Microdrive and the Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE 802.11 Wifi device were also available. An earlier StrongARM SA-1100 based research handheld device call the [...] "Itsy" [...] had been developed at Digital Equipment Corporation's Western Research Laboratory (later to become the Compaq Western Research Laboratory). With the acquisition of Compaq by Hewlett-Packard, HP discontinued the Jornada line of Microsoft Windows powered Pocket PCs, moving development and marketing of Pocket PCs to the iPAQ line.|$|R

These cards were unique at the time as they offered the end user a considerable amount of value by combining support for multiple graphics standards (and monitors) into a single card. The VGA Wonder series added additional value with the inclusion of a <b>bus</b> <b>mouse</b> port, which normally required the installation of a dedicated Microsoft <b>Bus</b> <b>Mouse</b> adapter.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, mice were not {{integrated}} with IBM-compatible personal computers, and the specialized bus interface (implemented via an ISA add-in card) {{was one of}} two popular ways to connect a mouse. (Serial interfaces, common on engineering workstations, were the other method.) When the IBM PS/2 was introduced, it included a motherboard mouse interface which was integrated with the keyboard controller (still called the PS/2 mouse interface long after the PS/2 brand was withdrawn); this fairly quickly drove the <b>bus</b> <b>mouse</b> design out of the marketplace.|$|E
50|$|The EX is {{upgradable}} via Tandy PLUS cards, {{and systems}} have bays for three. A PLUS card connector is electrically identical to an ISA slot connector, but uses a Berg-style 62-pin connector {{instead of a}} 62-contact ISA card-edge connector. RAM can be upgraded in the EX—and later the HX—to 640 KB, but requires a PLUS memory expansion card, which also provides DMA. Other PLUS cards could be installed to add serial ports, a 1200-baud modem, a clock/calendar and <b>bus</b> <b>mouse</b> board, or a proprietary Tandy network interface. RadioShack later sold an adapter card allowing installation of a PLUS card into a standard ISA slot, {{such as those in}} the larger Tandy 1000 models.|$|E

While Deskmate II used a text-based interface, Personal Deskmate used a {{graphical}} interface and also supported a mouse-like cursor using a joystick-mouse driver or a Tandy <b>bus</b> <b>mouse.</b> The MS-DOS was a version specialized for and only bootable on the Tandy 1000, {{as it would}} announce on the screen of any other PC-compatible one tried to boot with it; it included a version of BASICA (Microsoft's Advanced GW-BASIC) with support for the enhanced CGA graphics modes (a.k.a. Tandy Graphics or TGA) and three-voice sound hardware of the Tandy 1000.|$|E
