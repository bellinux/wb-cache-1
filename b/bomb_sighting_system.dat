50|$|The company prospered during World War II as {{military}} demand skyrocketed, ranking 19th among US corporations {{in the value}} of wartime production contracts. It specialized in high technology devices such as analog computer-controlled <b>bomb</b> <b>sights,</b> airborne radar <b>systems,</b> and automated take-off and landing systems. Sperry also was the creator of the Ball Turret Gun mounted under the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and the Consolidated B-24 Liberator, as commemorated by the film Memphis Belle and the poem The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner. Postwar, the company expanded its interests in electronics and computing, producing the company's first digital computer, SPEEDAC, in 1953.|$|R

25|$|Mechanical {{devices were}} also used to aid the {{accuracy}} of aerial <b>bombing.</b> Drift <b>Sight</b> was the first such aid, developed by Harry Wimperis in 1916 for the Royal Naval Air Service; it measured the wind speed from the air, and used that measurement to calculate the wind's effects on the trajectory of the bombs. The system was later improved with the Course Setting <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight,</b> and reached a climax with World War II <b>bomb</b> <b>sights,</b> Mark XIV <b>bomb</b> <b>sight</b> (RAF Bomber Command) and the Norden (United States Army Air Forces).|$|R

25|$|World War I <b>bomb</b> <b>sight</b> designs had {{improved}} rapidly, {{with the ultimate}} development being the Course Setting <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight,</b> or CSBS. This was essentially a large mechanical calculator that directly represented the wind triangle using three long pieces of metal in a triangular arrangement. The hypotenuse of the triangle was the line the aircraft needed to fly along in order to arrive over the target {{in the presence of}} wind, which, before the CSBS, was an intractable problem. Almost all air forces adopted some variation of the CSBS as their standard inter-war <b>bomb</b> <b>sight,</b> including the US Navy and US Army, who used a version designed by Georges Estoppey, the D-series.|$|R

50|$|Development {{had begun}} before the War as the Automatic <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight,</b> but early bomber {{operations}} proved that systems without automatic stabilization of the bombsight crosshairs were {{extremely difficult to}} use under operational conditions. A stabilizer for the ABS began development, but to fill the pressing need the simpler Mark XIV <b>bomb</b> <b>sight</b> was introduced. By the time the SABS was available, the Mark XIV was in widespread use.|$|R
50|$|Later {{in the war}} the {{development}} of the Tallboy and Grand Slam earthquake bombs demanded accuracy that even the Mk. XIV could not supply. For this role, the Automatic <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight</b> was dusted off and mounted to new stabilization platform, producing the Stabilized Automatic <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight.</b> This complex device was available only in very small numbers from late 1943 on, and used only by specific groups within the RAF.|$|R
50|$|After the war {{the design}} found {{widespread}} use around the world. A US {{version of the}} CSBS was used by Billy Mitchell on his famous attack on the Ostfriesland. The basic design was adapted by almost all air forces and used well into World War II. It was eventually replaced in British service by the more advanced designs like the Mark XIV <b>bomb</b> <b>sight</b> and the Stabilized Automatic <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight.</b> Other services used vector bombsights throughout the war.|$|R

50|$|In a {{separate}} line of development, the RAF {{was working on}} a pair of mechanical computers known as the Air Milage Unit (AMU) and Air Position Indicator (API), which continually performed dead reckoning calculations, greatly reducing navigator workload. This was fed by inputs similar to those for the Mk. XIV <b>bomb</b> <b>sight,</b> namely the estimated wind direction and speed, with the aircraft heading and speed fed in directly from the aircraft instruments. The system output was a varying voltage {{that could be used to}} drive the Mk. XIV <b>bomb</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|R

50|$|Although the US put {{the most}} effort into {{development}} of the tachometric concept, they were also being studied elsewhere. In the UK, work on the Automatic <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight</b> (ABS) had been carried on since the mid-1930s {{in an effort to}} replace the CSBS. However, the ABS did not include stabilization of the <b>sighting</b> <b>system,</b> nor the Norden's autopilot system. In testing the ABS proved to be too difficult to use, requiring long bomb runs to allow the computer time to solve the aim point. When RAF Bomber Command complained that even the CSBS had too long a run-in to the target, efforts to deploy the ABS ended. For their needs they developed a new vector bombsight, the Mk. XIV. The Mk. XIV featured a stabilizing platform and aiming computer, but worked more like the CSBS in overall functionality - the bomb aimer would set the computer to move the <b>sighting</b> <b>system</b> to the proper angle, but the bombsight did not track the target or attempt to correct the aircraft path. The advantage of this system was that it was dramatically faster to use, and could be used even while the aircraft was manoeuvring, only a few seconds of straight-line flying were needed before the drop. Facing a lack of production capability, Sperry was contracted to produce the Mk. XIV in the US, calling it the Sperry T-1.|$|R

25|$|By mid-1938 {{information}} about the Norden had worked its way up the Royal Air Force chain of command and was well known within that organization. The British had been developing a similar bombsight known as the Automatic <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight,</b> but combat experience in 1939 demonstrated the need {{for it to be}} stabilized. Work was underway as the Stabilized Automatic <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight</b> (SABS), but it would not be available until 1940 at the earliest, and likely later. Even then, it did not feature the autopilot linkage of the Norden, and would thus find it difficult to match the Norden's performance in anything but smooth air. Acquiring the Norden became a major goal.|$|R
50|$|The Stabilized Automatic <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight,</b> or SABS, was a Royal Air Force bombsight used {{in small}} numbers during World War II. The system worked along similar {{tachometric}} principles {{as the more}} famous Norden bombsight, but was somewhat simpler, lacking the Norden's autopilot feature.|$|R
50|$|The Course Setting <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight</b> (CSBS) is the {{canonical}} vector bombsight, the first practical system for properly {{accounting for the}} effects of wind during the dropping of bombs. It is also widely referred to as the Wimperis sight after its inventor, Harry Wimperis.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{officers}} of the CFS at Upavon developed the <b>bomb</b> <b>sight</b> between 1914-1915, and this was used in a very successful manner at the Western Front. For {{a short period of}} time during 1917, Upavon was used as an [...] "air fighting school".|$|R
50|$|During World War II, {{the company}} {{suspended}} sewing machine production {{to take on}} government contracts for weapons manufacturing.

25|$|Unable {{to obtain}} the Norden, the RAF {{continued}} development of their own designs. Having moved to night bombing, where visual accuracy was difficult under even the best conditions, they introduced the much simpler Mark XIV <b>bomb</b> <b>sight.</b> This was designed not for accuracy above all, but ease of use in operational conditions. In testing in 1944, it was found to offer a CEP of , about what the Norden was offering at that time. This led to a debate within the RAF whether {{to use their own}} tachometric design, the Stabilized Automatic <b>Bomb</b> <b>Sight,</b> or use the Mk. XIV on future bombers. The Mk. XIV ultimately served into the 1960s while the SABS was removed from service almost immediately after the war.|$|R

5000|$|The wooden [...] "coat hanger" [...] <b>bomb</b> <b>sight</b> {{intended}} to enable crews {{to release the}} weapon at the right distance from the target was not wholly successful; some crews used it, but others came {{up with their own}} solutions, such as pieces of string in the bomb-aimer's position and/or markings on the blister.|$|R

Dialling in the values for altitude, airspeed and the speed {{and direction of the}} wind rotated and slid various mechanical devices that solved the vector problem. Once set up, the bomb aimer would watch objects on the ground and compare their path to thin wires {{on either side of the}} sight. If there was any sideways motion, the pilot could slip-turn to a new heading in an effort to cancel out the drift. A few attempts were typically all that was needed, at which point the aircraft was flying in the right direction to take it directly over the drop point, with zero sideways velocity. The bomb aimer (or pilot in some aircraft) then sighted through the attached iron sights to time the drop.|$|R
