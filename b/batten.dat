5|$|During the First World War, Plymouth was {{the port}} of entry for many troops from around the Empire. It was {{developed}} as a facility for the manufacture of munitions. Although major units of the Royal Navy moved {{to the safety of}} Scapa Flow, Devonport was an important base for escort vessels and repairs. Flying boats operated from Mount <b>Batten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cox faced 42 {{counts of}} fraud, in {{addition}} to felony charges for fleeing while on probation from a previous conviction. Facing potential prison sentences of over 400 years, he negotiated a plea bargain agreement that gave him a maximum of 54 years, and a $2 million fine. On November 17, 2007, federal judge Timothy C. <b>Batten,</b> Sr. sentenced Cox to 26 years in prison. He also ordered Cox to pay $5.97 million in restitution. He will not be eligible for release until 2029.|$|E
5|$|In January 1985, he debuted for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW), the NWA {{territory}} in Dallas, Texas. In April 1985, Michaels {{went to work}} for another NWA {{territory in}} Kansas City called Central States Wrestling. There, he and tag team partner Marty Jannetty defeated The <b>Batten</b> Twins for the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship, later losing it back to the Battens.|$|E
50|$|Truss <b>battens,</b> {{sometimes}} referred to as double <b>battens,</b> use a pipe-over-pipe arrangement (often 12 in center-to-center), with vertical struts welded between the upper and lower pipes to provide rigidity. Truss <b>battens</b> generally permit greater loads than single-pipe <b>battens</b> and may not require as many lift lines due to improved ability to span between lift lines. Truss <b>battens</b> are typically designed to support 25 to 50 lb of live load per foot.|$|R
50|$|<b>Battens</b> {{are used}} for solid wall insulation. Regularly spaced <b>battens</b> are fitted to the wall, the spaces between them filled with insulation, and {{plasterboard}} or drywall screwed to the <b>battens.</b> This method {{is no longer the}} most popular, as rigid insulation sheets give better insulation (with <b>battens</b> bridging the insulation) and take less time to fit.|$|R
50|$|Wall <b>battens</b> like roofing <b>battens</b> {{are used}} to fix siding {{materials}} such as tile or shingles. Rainscreen construction uses <b>battens</b> (furring) {{as part of a}} system which allows walls to dry out more quickly than normal.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{characters}} in Little Annie Fanny are derived from Gray's Little Orphan Annie. Sugardaddy Bigbucks, Annie's surrogate father and a powerful, manipulative capitalist, is based on Daddy Warbucks. His mysterious assistant, the Wasp, derives from Warbucks' assistant the Asp, and Punchjab, his bodyguard, comes from the character Punjab. Other supporting characters include ad man Benton Battbarton (whose name is taken from the advertising agencies <b>Batten,</b> Barton, Durstine & Osborn and Benton & Bowles), Battbarton's rival Huck Buxton (modeled on gap-toothed British actor Terry-Thomas), Duncan Fyfe Hepplewhite (an art plagiarist), and Freddie Flink (who resembles comic actor Fred Gwynne from Car 54, Where Are You?).|$|E
5|$|A regular {{international}} ferry {{service provided}} by Brittany Ferries operates from Millbay taking cars and foot passengers directly to France (Roscoff) and Spain (Santander) {{on the three}} ferries, MV Armorique, MV Bretagne and MV Pont-Aven. The Cremyll Ferry is a passenger ferry between Stonehouse and the Cornish hamlet of Cremyll, which {{is believed to have}} operated continuously since 1204. There is also a pedestrian ferry from the Mayflower Steps to Mount <b>Batten,</b> and an alternative to using the Tamar Bridge via the Torpoint Ferry (vehicle and pedestrian) across the River Tamar.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{continued}} {{to publish the}} poetic works of Aikin and Barbauld {{as well as those}} of George Dyer, Joseph Fawcett, James Hurdis, Joel Barlow, Ann <b>Batten</b> Cristall and Edward Williams. Most of the poets that Johnson promoted and published are not remembered today. However, in 1793, Johnson published William Wordsworth's An Evening Walk and Descriptive Sketches; he remained Wordsworth's publisher until a disagreement separated them in 1799. Johnson also put out Samuel Taylor Coleridge's Fears of Solitude (1798). They were apparently close enough friends for Coleridge to leave his books at Johnson's shop when he toured Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Impulses {{have four}} full length <b>battens</b> in their sails {{as opposed to}} the Laser's three partial <b>battens</b> and the {{stiffness}} of the Impulse's <b>battens</b> can be varied to suit the sailor's weight and the prevailing conditions.|$|R
50|$|Tab <b>battens</b> are {{oriented}} {{perpendicular to}} the proscenium opening, parallel to and just off stage of light ladder <b>battens.</b> When provided, they are single-pipe or truss <b>battens</b> {{for the support of}} tab draperies, which are used to mask the stage wings.|$|R
40|$|Built-up columns {{have been}} widely {{employed}} by practice engineers {{in the design and}} construction of buildings and bridges. However, failures have been observed in this type of columns in previous seismic events. This study analyses the performance of built-up columns with different configurations of <b>battens</b> when it is subjected to seismic loads. Four columns with different size of <b>battens</b> were simulated and subjected to three different intensities of axial load along with a lateral cyclic load. Results indicate that the size of <b>battens</b> influences significantly the seismic behavior of columns. Lower shear capacity of <b>battens</b> results in higher ultimate strength and ductility for built-up columns. It is observed that intensity of axial load has a significant effect on the ultimate strength of columns, but it is less influential on the yield strength. For a given drift value, the stress level in the centroid of smaller size <b>battens</b> is significantly more than that of larger size <b>battens</b> signifying damage concentration in <b>battens</b> rather than chords. It is concluded that design of <b>battens</b> for shear demand lower than code specified values only slightly reduces initial stiffness of columns; however, it improves seismic performance of <b>battened</b> columns...|$|R
5|$|Plymouth's {{early history}} {{extends to the}} Bronze Age, when a first {{settlement}} emerged at Mount <b>Batten.</b> This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton founded in the ninth century, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony – the second English settlement {{in what is now}} the United States of America. During the English Civil War, the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646.|$|E
5|$|Vice-Admiral William <b>Batten</b> {{had been}} forced by Parliamentary {{officials}} to resign from his post as Commander of the Fleet the previous year, and he now encouraged the fleet to join the Royalist faction. Sir Henry Palmer, a former sailor, accompanied by {{other members of the}} Kentish gentry, also called on the fleet to revolt, taking advantage of the many fellow Kentish men in the crews. Sandown Castle declared for the King, followed shortly afterwards by the garrisons at Deal and Walmer as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast or aid sent to the Scots.|$|E

5|$|When the English Civil War {{broke out}} in 1642, Portland was {{initially}} controlled by Parliamentary forces. The castle was captured in 1643 {{by a group of}} Royalists who gained access by pretending to be Parliamentary soldiers. As the war turned against the King in the south-west, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle for four months in 1644, and once again the following year. The castle finally surrendered to Vice-Admiral William <b>Batten</b> in April 1646. It is uncertain why the castle, which was not easily defensible on the landward side, proved so difficult to take; the historian Peter Harrington has suggested that its low-lying position may have made it difficult for Parliament to bombard it from the sea.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War Plymouth {{sided with}} the Parliamentarians and was besieged for almost four years by the Royalists. The last major attack by the Royalists was by Sir Richard Grenville leading {{thousands}} of soldiers towards Plymouth, but they were defeated by the Plymothians at Freedom Fields Park. The civil war ended as a Parliamentary win, but monarchy was restored by King Charles II in 1660, who imprisoned many of the Parliamentary heroes on Drake's Island. Construction of the Royal Citadel began in 1665, after the Restoration; it was armed with cannon facing both out to sea and into the town, rumoured to be a reminder to residents not to oppose the Crown. Mount <b>Batten</b> tower also dates from around this time.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, Kaegi {{was invited}} to compose at Utrecht's Institute of Sonology, {{formerly}} known as STEM, in The Netherlands, where he created the tape music of Hydrophonie I. Owing to {{a grant from the}} Swiss government, he permanently relocated to The Netherlands in 1971 to work at the Institute and soon {{became a member of the}} board of directors. At the Institute, Kaegi worked as a composer, researcher and teacher in the field of electronically generated music and composition – his students have among others included Benno Ammann, Lasse Thoresen, Jos Janssen, Cort Lippe, Kathleen St John, Trevor <b>Batten,</b> Maarten In 't Veld, Martin Supper, Peter Pabon, Kees van Prooijen. After Floris van Maanen the Canadian composer Paul Goodman, born 1955, became his assistant in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Thomson noted {{a continued}} media bias against Jackson after the Chandler suicide. Thomson {{said he was}} contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations, only to have them replace his carefully researched information with the common myths he advised them to avoid and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide. He noted when Jackson's FBI file was released the following month, the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence. He noted how Gene Simmons' allegations in 2010 about Jackson molesting children received over a hundred times more coverage than his interview with Jackson's long-time guitarist, Jennifer <b>Batten,</b> who rebutted Simmons' claims.|$|E
5|$|During {{the opening}} days of 1994, Rewa moved southwards {{parallel}} to the Queensland coast; however, because it was located about 600km (370mi) to the north-east of Mackay, it {{was too far away}} from the coast for there to be any direct impact on Queensland. The only indirect impact was higher surf, from which several people had to be rescued from before the cyclone started to move towards New Caledonia during 4January. As Rewa affected Queensland for the second time, watches and warnings were issued for various parts of Queensland by TCWC Brisbane, who predicted a landfall near Mackay. On 18 January local disaster committees met to consider evacuating people, while people who were on vacation in national parks were alerted about Rewa by a helicopter. A military training exercise that was due to take place in Shoalwater Bay had to be cancelled, with army personal evacuated to Rockhampton to avoid being cut off by flood waters. Along the coast, several ports including Gladstone were shut with large vessels told to head to sea and small vessels told to <b>batten</b> down and prepare for the storm.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effectiveness of}} the strengthening technique for deficient reinforced concrete columns using steel angles and <b>battens.</b> The compressive strength of concrete was chosen as 9 MPa to represent poor concrete quality. The experiment consisted of a control reinforced concrete column and columns that were strengthened by steel angles and <b>battens.</b> In this study, the effectiveness of different configurations of <b>battens</b> was investigated; different amounts of <b>battens</b> as well as different spacing while maintaining amount of steel. The results showed that both load carrying capacity and ductility of the strengthened columns could be significantly improved. While maintaining the same amount of <b>battens,</b> different spacing does not show significant difference in load carrying capacity but affects ductility. The experimental results showed that using steel angles and <b>battens</b> is effective for strengthening reinforced concrete even when the compressive strength of the concrete is very low...|$|R
