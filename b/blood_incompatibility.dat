This underlines the importance of documenting RBC antigen variability in various ethnic groups. Central Asia is an area with a long and complex migratory history. The {{purpose of this article}} is to describe key antigen frequencies of Afghan ethnic groups in the Hindu-Kush region of Afghanistan as a basis for improving blood transfusion practices in that area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The key ABO, Rh and Kell antigens were investigated in five Afghan populations. In order to depict accurately the blood group gene diversity in the area, DNA from eight additional Pakistani populations were included, and the entire sample set screened using two multiplex polymerase chain reactions sensitive for 17 alleles in 10 blood group genetic systems (MNS, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, Cartwright, Dombrock, Indian, Colton, Diego and Landsteiner-Wiener). RESULTS: Phenotype and allele frequencies fell within the ranges observed in Western European and East Asian populations.

40|$|On April 23, 1951, a 30 -year-old woman {{received}} the first intentional ABOi (ABO incompatible) renal transplantation in Boston. At that time, it was commonly believed that intensely rinsing the graft to remove blood {{would be sufficient}} to overcome any immunological problems associated with blood type incompatibility. However, when the abovementioned patient and another ABOi transplant recipient died within a month, Humes and colleagues arrived at the same conclusion: "We {{do not feel that}} renal transplantation in the presence of <b>blood</b> <b>incompatibility</b> is wise. " In the decades that followed, we learned that the oligosaccharide surface antigens representing the ABO-blood group antigens are expressed not only on erythrocytes but also on cells from various tissues, including the vascular endothelium. The growing gap between organ demand and availability has sparked efforts to overcome the ABO barrier. After its disappointing results in the early 1970 s, Japan became the leader of this endeavor in the 1980 s. All protocols are based on 2 strategies: removal of preformed antibodies with extracorporeal techniques and inhibition of ongoing antibody production. Successful ABOi renal transplantation became possible with the advent of splenectomy, new immunosuppressive drugs (e. g., rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against CD 20), and extracorporeal methods such as antigen-specific immunoadsorption. This review summarizes the underlying pathophysiology of ABOi transplantation and the different protocols available. Further, we briefly touch potential short- and long-term problems, particularly the incidence of infectious complications and malignancies, that can arise with high-intensity immunosuppressive therapy...|$|E

Design and methods: Blood requests were for patients with trauma, unexpected massive intraoperative hemorrhage, or ruptured aneurysm. Group O Rh positive RBC is our first choice to support patients who cannot wait for type specific or crossmatched blood. Transfusion was ordered on clinical signs of class III or class IV hemorrhage who could not be adequately resuscitated with crystalloid solutions. Results: One hundred nineteen patients entered the protocol, receiving a total of 568 units of blood (4. 77 units/patient). There were no adverse effects noted even though complete serologic testing had not been done. There were no deaths related to transfusion incompatibility. None of the patients presented with anti-D. Only 14 patients who were Rh negative received group O Rh positive RBC, and most of these patients were male. There were no acute hemolytic reactions or sensitization of young females. Overall, 38 patients (31. 9 %) died, 24 within hours of arrival. No death was attributable to transfusion reaction or <b>blood</b> <b>incompatibility.</b> Complications included two dysrhythmia, four patients developed ARDS (3. 36 %), and seven patients (5. 8 %) had DIC.

The monoclonal antibodies were produced by mouse hybridoma techniques and examined by ELISA isotyping, immunoblotting, and affinity chromatography. Canine blood samples were typed and the development of alloantibodies was examined in transfused dogs. The monoclonal Kai 1 and Kai 2 antibodies were isotyped as IgM kappa and IgG 3 lamda, respectively, and identified two different erythrocyte membrane proteins of 200 kDa and 80 kDa in molecular weights, respectively. Either Kai 1 or Kai 2 can be expressed but not both in an individual dog. There were no naturally occurring anti-Kai 1 or Kai 2 alloantibodies.

The authors describe and discuss the conduct in three patients undergoing surgical intervention for neoplastic disease with positive Coombs Test (CT), and the impossibility to determine the blood type. Case report 1 st case: 87 -year old male patient, ASA III, scheduled for surgery for colon neoplasia. The patient had positive CT, being treated with corticosteroids, immunoglobulin (Ig), and erythropoietin, after which it was possible to determine his blood type. One unit of packed-red blood cells (PRBC) was transfused intraoperatively without intercurrences. Twenty four hours after the transfusion, the patient died due to an ischemic stroke. 2 nd case: 77 -year old male patient, ASA III, scheduled for surgery for a gastric carcinoma. The patient had a positive CT, being treated with corticosteroids and Ig, but we were unable to determine his blood type. The surgery was performed without intercurrences. The patient died on the 18 th postoperative day after a cardiorespiratory arrest. 3 rd case: 80 -year old female patient, ASA IV, undergoing emergency exploratory laparotomy. She also had a positive CT. The surgery (hemicolectomy) was performed without intercurrences. The patient died 48 hours after the surgery from an ischemic stroke.

40|$|CONTEXT: With early discharge, many newborns {{have to be}} readmitted to {{hospital}} for hyperbilirubinemia to be treated, {{and this has been}} held responsible for the reappearance of kernicterus. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether bilirubin levels in cord blood could predict neonatal hyperbilirubinemia that would require treatment, in full-term newborns up to their third day of life. TYPE OF STUDY: Prospective study. SETTING: Neonatal Unit of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, São Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 380 full-term newborns considered normal: with or without ABO/Rh blood group incompatibility and without other complications. PROCEDURES: Blood was taken from the umbilical cord for analysis of conjugated, unconjugated and total bilirubin serum levels. The newborns were followed up until discharge, and unconjugated bilirubin that required phototherapy was compared to the cord bilirubin assay. Discriminant analysis was used to classify newborns: with or without risk of needing phototherapy by the third day of life. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: Bilirubin assay in cord blood; mother's and newborn's blood groups; phototherapy indication. RESULTS: The mean value for unconjugated bilirubin in cord blood was significantly higher in newborns whose unconjugated bilirubin required phototherapy. The presence of ABO blood group incompatibility was a significant variable in relation to unconjugated bilirubin that required phototherapy. The most useful cutoff point for unconjugated bilirubin in cord blood was 2. 0 mg/ 100 ml. DISCUSSION: Cord blood could be collected, stored and used for further analysis of unconjugated bilirubin levels as a means for considering whether or not to discharge a moderately jaundiced child from hospital, in association with other resources. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Blood</b> <b>incompatibility</b> between mother and child was a predictor for the appearance of hyperbilirubinemia that required treatment. Considering a cutoff point of 2. 0 mg/ 100 ml, it could be concluded that 53 % of the newborns who had greater unconjugated bilirubin levels in cord blood would reach levels requiring phototherapy by the third day of life...|$|E

40|$|Background: Jaundice is {{the most}} common cause of {{neonatal}} admission within the first month after birth. Therefore, by identifying the causes of jaundice based on the infant’s age at disease onset and age at hospital admission and providing the required training, jaundice can be managed and its associated complications can be prevented. This study was performed to evaluate the causes of neonatal jaundice, based on the infant’s age at disease onset and age at hospital admission. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, out of 3, 130 infants with jaundice, referring to Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran, from 2003 to 2015, 2, 658 newborns were selected. Causes of jaundice are determined based on hematocrit, direct and indirect bilirubin, Coombs test, reticulocyte count, blood group and Rh of mother and neonate, thyroid tests, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) enzyme testing, urinalysis, urine culture, and If necessary, Na, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and other tests depending on the doctor's supervision. After confirming jaundice in infants, based on the physician’s diagnosis and laboratory results, a researcher-made questionnaire including the infant’s characteristics, was completed. Results: Based on our study, 27. 9 % of infants had identified as causes of jaundice. Known causes of jaundice were blood group incompatibility (40 %), infection (19 %), G 6 PD enzyme deficiency (12 %), endocrine disorders (8 %), neonatal hypernatremic dehydration (7 %), polycythemia (6 %), congenital heart disease (CHD) (4 %), occult bleeding (3 %) and Crigler-Najjar syndrome (2 %). The most common time of hospital admission of jaundice was 4 - 6 days after birth due to blood incompatibilities, occult bleeding, endocrine disorders, hypernatremic dehydration, CHD, polycythemia and G 6 PD enzyme deficiency. Moreover, the most common time of admission due to infection was after the first week of birth. Conclusion: The most common age of onset of jaundice was first three days of birth for <b>blood</b> <b>incompatibility,</b> although they were admitted two days later. Therefore, neonatal admission at appropriate time at onset of jaundice and receiving prompt treatments can reduce the probable complications (e. g., kernicterus) ...|$|E

The effectiveness analysis including all patients showed an allogeneic blood transfusion rate of 14 % in both groups. The efficacy analysis included 197 patients and showed a transfusion rate of 9 % in the Sangvia group as compared to 13 % in the Control group (95 %CI - 0. 05 - 0. 12, p =  0. 5016). A mean of 522 mL autologous blood was returned in the Sangvia group and lower calculated blood loss was seen. 1095 mL vs 1285 mL in the Control group (95 %CI 31 - 346, p =  0. 0175). No differences in postoperative hemoglobin was detected but a lower hematocrit reduction after surgery was seen among patients receiving autologous blood. No relevant differences were found for safety parameters or quality of life. General low use of allogeneic blood in THA is seen in the current study of the Sangvia system used together with a transfusion protocol. The trial setting is under-powered due to premature termination and therefore not able to verify efficacy for the system itself but contributes with descriptive data on safety.

40|$|Development of small-diameter {{blood vessels}} using tissue {{engineering}} has been promising as a novel therapy {{for patients who}} require coronary artery bypass grafting but lack suitable donor tissue. However, the performance of tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) has been challenged {{by the lack of}} a complete endothelium and by poor mechanical properties which contribute to <b>blood</b> <b>incompatibility</b> and burst failure in vivo respectively. In this work, these challenges have been addressed by genetically modifying vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to produce factors that will promote endothelialization and improve mechanical properties. Genetic engineering of VSMCs was explored using different methods to obtain the optimal transfection system. Viral transduction of cells resulted in the highest efficiency and stability of expression. Neomycin selection of virally transduced SMCs resulted in a homogenous population with high expression levels. To promote endothelialization of TEVGs, VSMCs were virally-transduced to produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which acts as a chemoattractant and mitogen of endothelial cells (ECs). The proliferation of ECs significantly increased after exposure to VEGF-transfected SMCs or their conditioned media. The chemotactic response of ECs to the VEGF-producing cells was explored by different in vitro models which demonstrated increased migration of ECs in response to VEGF-transfected cells on both tissue culture treated surfaces as well as collagen-coated surfaces. To improve mechanical properties, lysyl oxidase (LO) was utilized to enzymatically crosslink extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, particularly collagen and elastin, to enhance the mechanical integrity of the ECM and thereby impart mechanical strength to the engineered tissue. Viral transduction of VSMCs resulted in increased LO expression using Northern and Western analysis. Increased LO activity was demonstrated using a fluorescent enzyme substrate assay, and as increased levels of desmosine, a product of LO crosslinking, in the ECM. The mechanical effects of altered crosslink densities within tissue engineered constructs were demonstrated in a VSMC-populated collagen gel model. VSMCs transfected with lysyl oxidase were seeded in collagen gels; the tensile strength and elastic modulus in these constructs increased by approximately three-fold compared to constructs seeded with mock transfected VSMCs. Compositional analysis of the ECM deposited by the transformed cells showed similar collagen and elastin levels, and cell proliferation rates were similar as well, thus attributing increased mechanical properties to ECM crosslinking...|$|E

Progress in defined desensitization practice and immunologic understanding has allowed increasingly successful ABO incompatible transplantation during recent years. This paper focused on the history, disserted outcomes, desensitization modalities and protocols, posttransplant immunologic surveillance, and antibody-mediated rejection in transplantation with an ABO incompatible kidney allograft.

50|$|It is {{therefore}} advisable to do a baseline antibody screen and Rh & Kell phenotyping (type and screen) before starting the therapy. If antibody screen is negative, proceed with phenotype matched transfusions during therapy. If antibody screen is positive, give specific antigen negative <b>blood.</b> The <b>incompatibility</b> may persist for upto 6 months after stopping the medicine. Furthermore, blood transfusion centers should be routinely notified when sending such a sample.|$|R
