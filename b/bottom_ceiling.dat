However, over recent years, more effective treatments and questions being raised over the safety implications of using mammography have led to the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening to be highlighted as an important issue to investigate. Methods: A cost–utility analysis was conducted to appraise the breast cancer screening program. The analysis considered the breast cancer screening program and its utility over a 20 -year period, accounting for the typical breast cancer screening period taking place between the ages of 50 and 70 years. Analysis was conducted {{from the perspective of the}} UK National Health Service (NHS). This accepted NHS threshold was utilized for analysis of £ 20, 000 /quality-adjusted life year (QALY) –£ 30, 000 /QALY gain. A systematic literature review was conducted to obtain relevant financial, health, and probability outcomes pertaining to the breast cancer screening program. Results: The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated was at a value of £ 11, 546. 11 with subsequent sensitivity analysis conducted around this value. Three sensitivity analyses were undertaken to evaluate ICERs of a range of scenarios which could occur as the following: 1) maximum costs at each node – £ 17, 254 /QALY; 2) all costs are fixed costs: screening center costs, and staff are paid for regardless of use – £ 14, 172 /QALY; and 3) combination of (1) and (2) to produce a worst case scenario £ 20, 823 /QALY. Discussion and conclusion: The majority of calculations suggested that breast cancer screening is cost-effective. However, in our worst case scenario, the ICER fell near the <b>bottom</b> <b>ceiling</b> ratio. This makes it unclear whether the program should be available in the future, as more evidence becomes available over the risks of screening and as some currently expensive chemotherapy drugs begin to lose patents.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} flow structure formation in turbulent mixed convection {{in a closed}} rectangular cavity with an aspect ratio of 1 : 1 : 5 and air as working fluid is presented. Mixed convection at Re = 1. 1 · 10 ^ 4 and Ra = 3. 0 · 10 ^ 8 is studied under well-defined conditions by combination of forced and thermal convection. The resulting flow structures strongly depend on the ratio of inertia and buoyancy forces. A 2 D mean wind, which can be approximated by a solid body rotation, is found at pure forced convection. With increasing Archimedes number (Ar), realized by a temperature gradient between <b>bottom</b> and <b>ceiling</b> of the convection cell, this structure becomes instable. Leading to four convection rolls for Ar = 3. 4, which are oriented in longitudinal direction of the cell, are observed...|$|R

40|$|Results of {{mathematical}} modeling of the transient temperature field {{in a new}} chamber developed to measure surface tension of supercooled liquids are presented. The chamber is designed to enable a very fast (within 0. 1 s) formation of a homogeneous temperature field (within 0. 02 K) after a temperature jump of 60 K. The interior {{of the chamber of}} dimensions 20 x 16 x 32 mm is filled with dry nitrogen surrounding the measuring capillary and thermometers (very fine thermocouples and RTD’s). The temperature jump is generated by switching the flow direction of the nitrogen serving as a heat transmitting fluid. To reduce the thermal boundary layer near the <b>bottom</b> and <b>ceiling</b> walls, they are made permeable and some gas is sucked out. The flow in the chamber is laminar.

40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the reliability of the "chewing" subscale of the OPS-NVI, a novel tool designed to estimate presence and severity of orofacial pain in nonverbal patients. Methods. The OPS-NVI consists of 16 items for observed behavior, classified into four categories and a subjective estimate of pain. Two observers used the OPS-NVI for 237 video clips of people with dementia in Dutch nursing homes during their meal to observe their behavior and to estimate the intensity of orofacial pain. Six weeks later, the same observers rated the video clips a second time. Results. <b>Bottom</b> and <b>ceiling</b> effects for some items were found. This resulted in exclusion of these items from the statistical analyses. The categories which included the remaining items (n = 6) showed reliability varying between fair-to-good and excellent (interobserver reliability, ICC: 0. 40 - 0. 47; intraobserver reliability, ICC: 0. 40 - 0. 92). Conclusions. The "chewing" subscale of the OPS-NVI showed a fair-to-good to excellent interobserver and intraobserver reliability in this dementia population. This study contributes to the validation process of the OPS-NVI as a whole and stresses the need for further assessment of the reliability of the OPS-NVI with subjects that might already show signs of orofacial pain...|$|R
30|$|A conical {{pattern has}} been {{characterized}} as one that is produced when the interacting buoyant fire plume is restricted by an intersecting horizontal surface, spreading the heat {{across the bottom of}} the obstructing surface. The surface then redirects the buoyant flow and its momentum across the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>ceiling</b> creating a ceiling jet, which begins to descend from the ceiling as an upper layer (Hicks et al. 2008). This causes the plume to widen horizontally in the upper layer causing damage to the intersecting surfaces. A two-dimensional fire pattern is expected to form on the vertical surface interface (i.e. walls) {{in the form of a}} funnel or cone with the vertex at the bottom. This fire pattern has been proposed to indicate a fuel package that has reached a HRR sufficient to create a flame plume that reaches the horizontal surface (i.e. ceiling).|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{study on}} natural convection heat transfer {{of cold water}} near 4 °C in a thick bottom walled cavity filled with a porous medium has been performed. It is assumed that the cavity is isothermally heated from {{the outside of the}} thick bottom wall and cooled from ceiling. The finite-difference method has been used to solve the governing partial differential equations of heat and fluid flow. Effects of thermal conductivity ratio, Rayleigh number and bottom wall thickness on heat transfer from the <b>bottom</b> to the <b>ceiling</b> have been studied. The heatline visualization technique has been used to demonstrate the path of heat transport through the enclosure. Moreover, streamlines and isotherms have been used to present fluid flow and temperature distributions. The obtained results show that multiple circulation cells are formed in the cavity and the local Nusselt numbers at the bottom wall and solid-fluid interface are highly affected by formed cells. The increase of Rayleigh number and thermal conductivity ratio increases heat transfer through the cavity. However, the increase of thickness of the bottom wall reduces the mean Nusselt number. Almost one-dimensional conduction heat transfer is observed in the solid bottom wall of the cavity. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Fish assemblages {{associated}} with 14 marine caves and adjacent external rocky reefs were investigated at four Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) along {{the coasts of}} Italy. Within the caves sampling {{was carried out in}} different sub-habitats: walls, <b>ceilings,</b> <b>bottoms</b> and ends of caves. On the whole, 38 species were recorded inside the 14 caves investigated. Eighteen species were exclusively found inside the caves: they were mainly represented by speleophilic (i. e. species preferentially or exclusively inhabiting caves) gobids (e. g. Didogobius splechtnai) and nocturnal species (e. g. Conger conger). Forty-one species were censused outside, 20 of which were shared with cave habitats. Apogon imberbis was the most common fish found in all 14 caves investigated, followed by Thorogobius ephippiatus (recorded in 13 caves), and Diplodus vulgaris and Scorpaena notata (both censused in 12 caves). Distinct fish assemblages were found between external rocky reefs and the different cave sub-habitats. New data on the distribution of some speleophilic gobids were collected, showing the existence of a pool of species shared by marine caves on a large scale (i. e. hundreds of km). Considering the uniqueness of cave fishes (18 exclusive species and different assemblage structures), the inclusion of marine caves among the habitats routinely investigated for fish biodiversity monitoring could facilitate the achievement of more comprehensive inventories. Due to their contribution to local species diversity and the shelter they provide to species valuable for conservation, marine caves should be prioritized for their inclusion not only within future MPAs through the Mediterranean Sea, but also into larger management spatial planning...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} the Bachelor thesis is The {{principles}} of the social justice and its reflection among the university students is a contribution to social justice, {{to one of the}} principles of the modern social politics. The social justice is a very complex notion and one of the conditions of the legitimacy of the government effecting the social politics of the state and its positive attitude to the principles of the social politics, which are accented by the society. The thesis is divided into the theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part is divided into 5 subheads. The first subhead of the theoretical part deals with the definition of the social justice. The second focus on the issues of equality in social justice. In the third subhead is deeper focus on social justice in the context of particular ideologies. The fourth describes social justice in the Czech Republic and the last deals with social justice in education. I chose qualitative research strategy using the method of substituting. As a data collecting technique I chose a semi-structured interview. The conception of the interview consisted of 20 questions, which correlated with the theoretical treatises and were adjusted so as to achieve the selected goal. With the help of the purposeful selection were chosen 10 communication partners, while 5 of them were students of economics field and 5 were students of specialization in helping profession. The main goal was to find out how the students interpret the principle of social justice in the context of social policy. This main goal was followed by 3 sub-goals. The first sub-goal has to find out how students interpret the principle of permission. The second sub-goal has to find out how students interpret the principle of equality of results. The last sub-goal was finding out what principles of social justice students prefer in educational policy. For the research were set 2 research questions. 1. What factors influence students in interpretation of social justice? 2. What is the relationship between studying university and interpretation of social justice? The results show that students most frequently emphasize the model solid <b>bottom</b> and open <b>ceiling</b> and principle of permission in context of heritage. Respondents in educational policy put most emphasis on the principle of equality of opportunity, which is from their perspective reinforced by the principle of equality of results, meritocratic principle and principle to each according to merit. Influence of studying field was evident especially in principle of equality of results, where communication partners studying study focused on helping profession interpreted this principle positively than communicating partners who are studying economic fields. This thesis could serve as a tool for students to understand the whole complexity of social justice and as basis for any discussion in the lectures and seminars connected to social policy. complexity of social justice and as basis for any discussion in the lectures and seminars connected to social policy...|$|R
40|$|In this {{cumulative}} thesis, the superposition of {{shear flow}} and thermal convection, namely mixed convection, is investigated experimentally. The experiments were {{performed in a}} cuboidal sample with aspect ratios Gamma_xz = length=height = 5 and Gamma_yz = width=height = 1. The sample was composed of a heatable <b>bottom</b> and coolable <b>ceiling</b> as well as air inlet and outlet channels, which are located {{on the same side}} and both span the whole length of the sample. Different measurement techniques were applied and four main results were obtained. The first main result is the finding of large-scale flow structures, which arrange in different configurations within the sample depending on the characteristic numbers. In specific, the breakdown of a two-dimensional forced convective roll structure at low and vanishing Ar into three-dimensional configurations at higher Ar was found. Thereby, stable arrangements of three and four thermally induced convection rolls were also found. Their axis of rotation was found to be zigzag shaped and tilted with respect to the inflow velocity. This is ascribed to the superposition of the thermally induced convection rolls with shear forces. The second main result is the observation of a maximum in the enthalpy flux carried by the fluid between in- and outflowing air at Ar approx. 0. 6. This was caused by the existence of an upper boundary of the temperature difference between in- and outflowing air with changing Ar. As a consequence, there are flow conditions, which maximise the enthalpy flux of the flow through the cell. The third main result is the finding of different dynamics of the large-scale flow structures, namely stable configurations, erratic changes and periodic oscillations. These results are based on long duration temperature measurements and smoke visualisations. A dependency on the underlying characteristic numbers, namely Re, Ra and Ar, was found: first the strength of the thermal convection (Ra) determines if oscillations can occur. Second, mixed convection (Ar) determines the dynamics (steady, erratic changes or periodic oscillations) if Ra allows oscillations. Third, forced convection (Re) determines the oscillation frequency if Ar allows periodic oscillations. The fourth main result is the experimental realisation of simultaneous measurement of instantaneous temperature and velocity fields in a system with continuous fluid exchange and air as working fluid. This is more a result of the experimental accessibility than of the fluid dynamical processes in mixed convection. However, for the challenging task of measuring both quantities non-intrusively and extensively, a solution is presented, which was developed and successfully applied. The main idea of this technique is the simultaneous usage of thermochromic liquid crystals as tiny thermometers and as tracer particles for particle image velocimetry. Experimental cornerstones are the particle generation, their illumination, image filtering and calibration. They are addressed in this thesis. Additional accomplishments of the thesis are the following findings: The large-scale flow structures couple the momentum transport from one wall to the opposing side wall. Even more, a back-coupling is found and a concept describing the mechanisms acting to trigger the periodic oscillations is presented. Furthermore, it showed that a proper adjustment of Re, i. e. the inflow velocity, can destroy stable arrangements of large-scale structures or oscillating configurations of them. Finally, probability density functions of the temperature distribution in a horizontal layer, slightly above the bottom thermal boundary layer, allowed for analysis of fingerprints of the sheet-like thermal plumes. For the given location of the measurement plane a change of the plume fraction P 2 =P 1 occurred at Ra approx. 2. 3 x 10 ^ 8. Here P 1 denotes the abundance of fluid temperatures imprinted by the bulk flow, while P 2 inhibits the abundance of temperatures ascribed to warm thermal plumes...|$|R
