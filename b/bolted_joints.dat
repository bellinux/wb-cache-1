Firstly, the dynamic model of the linear rolling guide joint surface is established and its natural frequency is figured out.

Six weeks into the work, a major storm (Hurricane Ella) was off Cape Hatteras and heading for New York. With New York City hours away from emergency evacuation, the reinforcement was only half-finished.

However, during construction, builder Bethlehem Steel was approved to use <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> to save labor and material costs.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{performed}} together with ÅF Industry AB in Trollhättan, Sweden. ÅF’s expertise in Trollhättan is oriented towards the automotive industry. It was conducted within {{the section of}} CAE and safety where they, for instance, dimension <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> in the cars. <b>Bolt</b> <b>joints</b> {{play an important role}} in the automotive industry. Slip critical <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> are used widely throughout the vehicles. With lack of good test data, the <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> need to be dimensioned conservatively. This may lead to that <b>bolt</b> <b>joints</b> are over-dimensioned, adding more mass to the car. On the contrary, the availability of reliable test data enables designers to optimize joint dimensions to achieve a safe design with minimized mass. A mechanical testing configuration has been designed as well as a testing procedure for a test to determine the static friction value between mating surfaces in <b>bolt</b> <b>joints.</b> The testing configuration has been used to perform tests to find the static friction coefficient in different materials. The study contains varied combinations of steel, aluminium and ED-Coated steel. The study resulted in tables with levels of probability. The developed test configuration is robust and relatively simple to use and is recommended for further use. For improved statistical significance, it was noted that more samples should be used than was used in this study. The aluminium has a smoother surface finish and that could be the reason why its coefficient of friction is lower than steel. It is therefore considered important to also include surface roughness when presenting coefficient of friction results...|$|R

30|$|The {{ultimate}} load of a <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> {{parallel to the}} grain with a large l/d ratio was different from its yield load, although the yield embedding strength of wood {{was close to the}} ultimate embedding strength [7, 19, 28]. This occurred because, when the l/d ratio is large, the side members are strongly pressed against the main member by the rope effect {{as a result of the}} increased bending deformation of the bolt. Consequently, the friction between the main and side members is increased, and the {{ultimate load}} of the <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> is larger than the yield load. When the <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> was forced in a direction perpendicular to the grain, the load increased as the slip progressed because the embedding stress perpendicular to the grain showed a continuous increase after yielding [18 – 20]. When the l/d ratio was large, and the end and edge distances were sufficiently large, the crack failure from the lead hole to the end of the wood specimen was hardly observed in specimens [19, 20]. As a result, although the yield load of a <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> perpendicular to the grain was smaller than that parallel to the grain, the ultimate load of the former was sometimes larger than the latter.|$|R

30|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate embedding strength on Uruguayan wood to apply the European yield theory (EYT) for double shear bolted joints’ on Eucalyptus grandis H.(EGH). To introduce the dowel-type connection performance, double shear tests were conducted. The embedding tests were conducted to calculate the yield strength of <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> by EYT and the compression test, to estimate the embedding strength. The yield strength obtained from the experiments showed a good agreement with the yield strength calculated by EYT method. The yield strength of double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> evaluated from compressive strengths is a very close to the yield strength calculated by EYT. The average value and variability of the yield strength of double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>joint</b> calculated by EYT applying the embedding strengths of experimental results were very close to the yield strength or 5  % offset method of experimental results. The results from this study showed a good behavior to structural design with EGH in accordance to the Japanese standard code.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, {{some degree}} of {{embedment}} is inevitable. That said, short grip lengths should be avoided. For two <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> of identical design and installation, except the second having a longer grip length, the first joint {{will be more likely}} to loosen and fail. Since both joints have the same loading, the surfaces will experience the same amount of embedment. However, the relaxation in strain is less significant to the longer grip length and the loss in preload will be minimized. For this reason, <b>bolted</b> <b>joints</b> should always be designed with careful consideration for the grip length.|$|E
