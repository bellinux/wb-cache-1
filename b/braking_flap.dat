50|$|The ASW 28 is a single-seat shoulder-winged {{composite}} construction sailplane with a T-shaped horizontal tailplane and 15 metre wingspan. The {{upper wing surface}} has Schempp-Hirth <b>brake</b> <b>flaps.</b>|$|R
40|$|These {{two reports}} are surveys on the {{progress}} and present state of development of dive-control flaps for gliders and airplanes. The second article describes how {{on the basis of}} wind tunnel and free-flight tests, the drag increase on <b>brake</b> <b>flaps</b> of the type DFS, can be predicted. Pressure records confirm a two-dimensional load distribution along the brake-flap surface Aerodynamically, the location of the <b>brake</b> <b>flaps</b> along the span is of importance for reasons of avoidance of vibration and oscillation phenomena on control and tail surfaces; statically, because of the magnitude of the frontal drag in diving with respect to the bending moments, which may become decisive for the dimensions of the wing attachment and for the wing covering...|$|R
50|$|The ALR {{would have}} been {{equipped}} with avionics, radar, armament and engines from abroad, and a laser seeking sensor {{in front of the}} cockpit.

Air <b>brake</b> <b>flaps</b> are extended, the burning port wing tank is {{trailing}} smoke. The lack of self-sealing fuel tanks made the D4Y easy to ignite {{with a few}} rounds of incendiary tracers, so a stricken Suisei often developed a fiery tail reminiscent of its namesake.

25|$|The SLR {{features}} active aerodynamics; {{there is}} a spoiler mounted on the rear integral air <b>brake</b> <b>flap.</b> The spoiler increases downforce depending on its angle of elevation (angle of attack). At a set speed, the spoiler/brake automatically raises to 10degrees (15degrees in the 722 edition), when demanded via the driver's switch, the elevation can be increased to 30degrees (35degrees in the 722 version) for increased rear downforce, {{at the cost of}} increased steady state drag.|$|R
25|$|The Mark IV DP845 first flew on 27 November 1941. It had the full-span C wing {{combined}} with a small tail unit and retractable tailwheel, and also had external bracket hinges under the wings, denoting the installation of <b>braking</b> <b>flaps.</b> These were soon removed and a mock up of a proposed six-cannon armament was fitted, three in each wing. The aircraft was soon renamed Mk XX, to avoid confusion with a renamed PR type, then it became the Mk XII.|$|R
50|$|The Hanuman offers full dual controls, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the main pilot seat having <b>brakes</b> and <b>flap</b> controls. Instrumentation consists of a tachometer, airspeed indicator, altimeter, slip indicator, battery charge indicator & coolant temperature or CHT, GPS etc.|$|R
50|$|The landing gear, <b>brake,</b> <b>flap</b> and spoiler {{systems are}} {{hydraulically}} operated. On aircraft 25-061 through 25-180 the engine driven hydraulic pumps supply fluid under pressure of 1500 psi {{to the system}} pressure is maintained at 1250 to 1500 psi by a pressure regulator. On aircraft 25-181 and subsequent the variable volume engine driven pump delivers fluid under a pressure of 1450 psi to the system and static pressure is maintained at 1500 to 1550 psi. Over pressurization is prevented by a pressure relief valve which opens at 1700 psi. A pre-charged accumulator dampens and absorbs pressure surges. Two motor-driven shutoff valves will stop hydraulic flow to the engine-driven pumps {{in case of an}} emergency. The valves are controlled by the FIRE switch and activation of these valves are indicated with pinhead lights located in the cockpit next to the FIRE switch.|$|R
50|$|The filler {{materials}} {{were made of}} either white AB312 fibers or black AB312 cloth covers (which contain alumina fibers). These {{materials were}} used around {{the leading edge of}} the nose cap, windshields, side hatch, wing, trailing edge of elevons, vertical stabilizer, the rudder/speed <b>brake,</b> body <b>flap,</b> and heat shield of the shuttle's main engines.|$|R
50|$|There was {{confusion}} in the initial dive as Lieutenant Commander McClusky called out a dive on one carrier, but then dove on the others (Kaga and Akagi). This caused VS-6 and VB-6 planes to co-mingle on the first carrier, leaving Lt. Richard Best to call off the final two sections of VB-6 to attack the second carrier. Ensigns Pittman and Jaccard were flying as wingmen to McClusky. Pittman {{should have been the}} second man down after McClusky, but because of confusion over the ship they were diving on, it was Jaccard who followed McClusky down. During his dive he apparently mistook his undercarriage lever for the wing-brake lever and slowed his plane by lowering his wheels instead of his <b>brake</b> <b>flaps.</b> While he apparently missed his target on that dive, he is credited with a hit on Hiryu (later the same day) and on Mogami (the next day).|$|R

50|$|The head-down {{illusion}} {{involves a}} sudden linear deceleration (air <b>braking,</b> lowering <b>flaps,</b> decreasing engine power) during level flight where the pilot perceives {{the illusion that}} {{the nose of the}} aircraft is pitching down. The pilot's response to this illusion would be to pitch the nose of the aircraft up. If this illusion occurs during a low-speed final approach, the pilot could stall the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|In 1929 Vincent Bendix {{branched}} out into aeronautics and renamed the company [...] "Bendix Aviation" [...] {{to reflect the}} new product lines. Bendix supplied aircraft manufacturers with all types of hydraulic systems, for <b>braking</b> and <b>flap</b> activation, and introduced new devices such as a pressure carburetor which dominated the market during World War II. It also made {{a wide variety of}} electrical and electronic instruments for aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Dive <b>brakes</b> or dive <b>flaps</b> are {{deployed}} {{to slow down}} an aircraft when in a dive. They often consist of a metal flap that is lowered against the air flow, thus creating drag and reducing dive speed.|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{landings}} was performed with a straight-wing airplane {{to evaluate the}} effect of low lift-drag ratios on approach and landing characteristics. Landings with a peak lift-drag ratio as low as 3 were performed by altering the airplane configuration (extending speed <b>brakes,</b> <b>flaps,</b> and gear and reducing throttle setting). As lift-drag ratio was reduced, it was necessary either to make the landing pattern tighter or to increase initial altitude, or both. At the lowest lift-drag ratio the pilots believed a 270 deg overhead pattern was advisable because of the greater ease afforded in visually positioning the airplane. The values of the pertinent flare parameters increased with the reduction of lift-drag ratio. These parameters included time required for final flare; speed change during final flare; and altitude, glide slope, indicated airspeed, and vertical velocity at initiation of final flare. The pilots believed that the tolerable limit was reached with this airplane in the present configuration, and that if, because of a further reduction in lift-drag ratio, more severe approaches than those experienced in this program were attempted, additional aids {{would be required to}} determine the flare-initiation point...|$|R

Operation occurs during launch/ascent, in-space exercise, reentry/descent, and landing/rollout. Operational effectiveness of the APU is predicated on reliable, failure-free operation during each flight, mission life (reusability) and serviceability between flights (turnaround).

50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} fibreglass, foam and carbon fibre. Its 20.42 m span foam-core wing employs a Wortmann FX67-K-170 airfoil at the wing root, transitioning to a FX67- K-150 section at the wing tip. The wings feature both double-panel upper surface air <b>brakes</b> and <b>flaps</b> that can be set to -7°, -4°, 0°, +5°, +11° and +15°. Water ballast is 190 L held in the wing leading edges and dumped through a centre-fuselage valve. The landing gear is a single retractable monowheel suspended by an oil/nitrogen oleo, plus a tailskid. The cockpit canopy is of one-piece and forward hinged.|$|R
50|$|Pulling {{the alarm}} chain on a British train will pull a lever {{connected}} to the <b>brake</b> pipe <b>flaps.</b> Pulling the alarm activates a piston, causing the flaps to be opened and all the air pushed out the air tube, forcing the brakes on. In the driver's cab, a buzzer and a light will tell that the alarm has been activated. In the guard's van, this is seen from a valve which shows loss of pressure in the brake pipe. In the UK, there is a fine of £80 for pulling the alarm chain without good reason.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1930s, Beech {{undertook}} a major redesign of the aircraft, {{to create the}} Model D17 Staggerwing. The D17 featured a lengthened fuselage that improved the aircraft's handling characteristics by increasing control leverage, and the ailerons were relocated to the upper wings, eliminating interference with the <b>flaps.</b> <b>Braking</b> was improved with a foot-operated brake linked to the rudder pedals.|$|R
50|$|Brakes are {{generally}} applied to rotating axles or wheels, {{but may also}} take other forms such as {{the surface of a}} moving fluid (flaps deployed into water or air). Some vehicles use a combination of braking mechanisms, such as drag racing cars with both wheel brakes and a parachute, or airplanes with both wheel <b>brakes</b> and drag <b>flaps</b> raised into the air during landing.|$|R
25|$|The Sea Vampire {{has several}} key {{differences}} from their land-based counterparts. It {{could be easily}} distinguished be {{the presence of a}} V-shaped arrestor hook that retracted to a high-mounted position above the jet pipe. The Sea Vampire was fitted with enlarged air <b>brakes</b> and landing <b>flaps</b> for superior low speed control during landing approaches, along with construction to higher load factors to account for the greater stresses involved in carrier landings.|$|R
50|$|The sole PM-3's {{construction}} {{was started in}} one factory, but finished in another. It was first flown in 1955 and then went into storage for three years. The aircraft is built from Swiss pine and birch plywood and has a 52.5 foot wingspan. The PM-3 has dive <b>brakes</b> and full-span <b>flaps</b> with aileron interconnects to the flaps. It originally had fixed landing gear, but has been retrofitted with retractable mainwheel.|$|R

50|$|The Sukhoi Shkval was {{designed}} as a two-engined interceptor with radar, two built-in aircraft guns and side-by-side afterburner engines. Two designs were investigated in the wind tunnel. These differed only {{in the form of the}} air intakes and the position of the canards. The first version with D-shaped air intakes, comparable to the Su-15, and canards in front of the cockpit, which extend to the radome, could not get through. The second concept with rectangular ramp air inlets (comparable to the air inlets of the MiG-25) and canards at the upper side edge of the air inlets got the advantage. The hull itself is similar to the fuselage of the Su-15 without landing gear, wing, fin and <b>brake</b> <b>flaps.</b> The four wings were fixed at the corners of the fuselage as a reclining X (comparable to the fictional X-wing fighter from Star Wars). On the four wings end were cylindrical containers, which in the lower part contain shock absorbers for take-off and landing. In the remaining part of these cylindrical containers were kerosene tanks, as in wings and the fuselage. The containers were externally provided with a guide plate as a continuation of the wing. Each wing has a rudder that functions as a rudder and aileron. In order to facilitate the vertical landing, the entire Ejection seat as well as the Thrust lever and the Side-stick were pivotally mounted in the cockpit in such a way that the ratio of the ejection seat to these control elements remained unchanged regardless of the pivoting position. The swivel device gave the pilot a better view of the ground / landing zone by a window in the cockpit floor. A cockpit section of the Sukhoi Shkval was built with the window in the ground and the swivel seat / instrument combination, with which this function could be tested and demonstrated, which happened several times. A two-axle trailer was also planned for the transport and erection of the Sukhoi Shkval.|$|R
50|$|The 18T was {{designed}} in the late 60's, as a civilian aircraft. The aircraft has a nosewheel, is a four- or five-seater, and has a nine-cylinder 360 hp radial. The Yak-18T shares systems with the Yak-50/52 family. These aircraft all have the 265 kW (355 hp) Vedneyev M14 nine-cylinder radial engine {{as well as the}} same underlying compressed-air system for engine starting, <b>brakes,</b> undercarriage and <b>flaps.</b> The propeller, avionics and other parts are also shared. The Yak-18T, like all Russian aircraft used for training, is aerobatic.|$|R
50|$|After the engagement, an {{assessment}} {{revealed that the}} B-17's oxygen and hydraulic systems were destroyed, {{as well as all}} of the pilot's flight instruments. The magnetic compass and engine instruments on the copilot's side were undamaged, as were all four engines. Too wounded to move and unwilling to give up command of the plane, Zeamer advised the top turret gunner as he took over copiloting duties, allowing the unwounded copilot to attend to the wounded. The lack of oxygen, in addition to Zeamer's and the navigator's injuries, meant a return to Port Moresby over the Owen Stanley Mountains was impossible. Instead they made an emergency landing at an Allied fighter airstrip at Dobodura, New Guinea. Without operable <b>brakes</b> or <b>flaps</b> because of the destroyed hydraulic system, the B-17 was ground-looped without incident by the co-pilot. The casualties were one killed (Sarnoski) and four wounded. Zeamer was initially thought dead from loss of blood, but was treated with the other injured crew members by the 10th Field Ambulance of the Royal Australian Army Medical Corps before being transported back to Port Moresby the next day.|$|R
50|$|The exhaust {{produced}} by the Hydrazine Gas Generator APUs {{on either side of}} Endeavour's tail fin created concern among some observers that something was amiss, as it appeared more pronounced than usual in NASA's visual light cameras. However, this exhaust is normal and expected. The three Hydrazine Gas Generator APUs are activated five minutes before the deorbit burn and are running for five minutes after wheels stop. The mono-propellant hydrazine changes phase due to a catalyst and reaches 1,700 °F (927 °C). The hydraulic power is needed for the shuttle's rudder/speed <b>brake,</b> elevons, body <b>flap</b> and landing gear during descent, and for the main engine nozzles' gimballing during ascent. Each of the Solid Rocket Boosters have two similar Hydrazine Gas Generators for their nozzle gimballing.|$|R

Fuel was held in two tanks in the wing centre-section and oil in the fuselage aft of the engine firewall. Its enclosed cabin, entered via centrally hinged, multi-part glazing, had two forward seats, equipped with dual controls, and a rear bench seat. It was normally flown from the left-hand seat, where the rudder bar was fitted with <b>brake</b> pedals. The <b>flap</b> lever was placed centrally. The fuselage was fabric covered apart from the engine area and the sloping fuselage roof and upper part aft of the cabin, which was covered with electron metal sheet.|$|R
40|$|This project {{document}} {{deals with the}} design and analysis of aerodynamic brake for a 500 kw wind turbine. This aerodynamic brake is mounted {{on the tip of}} the wind turbine blade. The tip brake (aerodynamic brake) consists of two primary members, namely, 1) main tip brake and 2) spoiler flaps. The loads acting on the main tip <b>brake</b> and spoiler <b>flaps</b> are 3. 15 kpa and 3. 95 kpa respectively. The material chosen for the design is CFRP because of its high stiffness and strength. The design is base on the the regular spar and rib construction. Analysis has been carried out with the classical laminate theory and it is found that the maximum stresses are within the permissible limits. Further, analysis of the torque shaft is also carried out and it is found tht the stress in the shaft is within the limits. ...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{transports}} {{as well as}} fighter aircraft of {{the future}} are being designed with very low drag (friction and pressure). Concurrently, commuter airports are being built or envisioned {{to be built in}} the centers of metropolitan areas where shorter runways and/or reduced noise footprints on takeoff and landing are required. These requirements and the fact that drag is lower on new vehicles than on older aircraft have resulted in vehicles that require a large amount of braking force (from landing-gear <b>brakes,</b> spoilers, high-lift <b>flaps,</b> thrust reversers, etc.). Micro-drag generators (MDGs) were envisioned to create a uniformly distributed drag force along a vehicle by forcing the flow to separate on the aft-facing surface of a series of deployable devices, thus, generating drag. The devices are intended to work at any speed and for any type of vehicle (aircraft, ground vehicles, sea-faring vehicles). MDGs were applied to a general aviation wing and a representative fuselage shape and [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present report}} consolidates the {{aerodynamic}} sizing of an innovative tip brake. The innovativeness {{in the design}} {{lies in the fact}} that the tip brake, in the braking position, not only provides a braking surface to retard the rotor, but also spoiles the flow over the outboard portion of the wind turbine rotor lifting aerofoil blade. At the same time, in its non-braking position, when the flaps are inline with the main blade, it acts as leading edge flaps and trailing edge slats and thereby augments the power to consequently improve the performance of the rotor. The present report consolidates the aerodynamic design and analysis of the primary tip <b>brake</b> and spoiler <b>flaps</b> that has been worked out for the braking mode. The augmentation due to the presence of the flaps in the non braking mode has also been worked out. The loads during the braking (aerodynamic pressure / loads acting on the surface of the tip brake) have been quantified. The sizing was done for three configurations of the aerodynamic brake with different primary tip brake width (0. 6 m, 1 m, 1. 25 m and 1. 5 m). Finally, after intra-divisional discussions, the final configuration with primary tip brake width of 1. 5 m was chosen for further structural design...|$|R
5000|$|The Twin Otter {{incorporated}} [...] "flaperons" [...] that drooped the ailerons {{as part of}} the flaps, {{but these}} {{were not included in the}} Dash 7 due to weight and complexity. Instead, the ailerons were reduced in size to allow more flap area, and were augmented with two sets of roll spoilers, or [...] "spoilerons". The inboard roll spoilers operate at all speeds. while the outboard roll spoilers only operate at speeds less than 130 KIAS to allow for more roll control at slower speeds. Upon touchdown, both the inboard and outboard roll spoilers extend in unison to aid in destroying lift created by the wing. Each wing also includes two ground spoilers which only extend on touchdown. Most of the trailing edge is spanned by a complex, double Fowler flap arrangement for high lift at low speed. During a typical STOL landing, flaps are selected to the 45° position, generating more lift and drag, thus allowing for steeper descents and slower approach speeds. Depending on weight, the VREF speed with flaps at 45° is between 70 and 85 knots. On touchdown, through [...] "squat switches" [...] in the main gear, the flaps automatically retract to the 25° position, thus reducing lift once on the runway and producing better <b>braking</b> performance. The <b>flaps</b> also retract to 25° when engine power is increased during a go-around procedure. The four-engine layout aids lift at low speeds due to the wide span of the propellers blowing air over the wing ("propwash"). When reverse thrust is selected on landing, the props reverse pitch, push air forward, and slow the aircraft very effectively along with the antiskid wheel brakes. More importantly, if an engine fails, the asymmetric thrust is much less than on a twin-engine layout, thereby increasing safety and allowing for a lower minimum control speed with an engine inoperative [...]|$|R
