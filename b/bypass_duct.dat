50|$|The normal {{definition}} for the bypass ratio (BPR) of a turbofan engine is the ratio between the {{mass flow rate}} of the bypass stream to the mass flow rate entering the core.

50|$|GE took a {{different}} approach with their first high bypass ratio turbofan, the TF39. A unique, very complex design; the T-stage, which supercharges the core stream, is located ahead of the main fan rotor.

Outboard of the T-stage rotor are the main inlet guide vanes, which only affect the bypass stream. The T-stage rotor extends to about half the main rotor stage annulus and runs in a tip shroud. The main fan stage has a mid-span platform/flow splitter which separates the single-stage outer annulus from the 2-stage inner annulus. These two stages mainly supercharge the 16-stage high-pressure compressor.

A project has been undertaken at NASA Langley Research Center to investigate the propagation of higher order modes in ducts with flow. This is a two-pronged approach, including development of analytic models (the subject of a separate paper) and installation of a laboratory-quality test rig. The purposes of the rig are to validate the analytical models and to evaluate novel duct acoustic liner concepts, both passive and active. The dimensions of the experimental rig test section scale to between 25 % and 50 % of the aft <b>bypass</b> <b>ducts</b> of most modern engines.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{implementation of the}} standard Galerkin finite element method {{for the analysis of}} the acoustic and vortical modes in an axisymmetric lined duct carrying a high speed, subsonic, parallel mean shear flow. This is fundamentally theoretical work, but with a view to the specific engineering application of acoustic liner optimization in turbofan aero-engine ducts, as cylindrical and annular ducts are approximate models of inlet and <b>bypass</b> <b>ducts,</b> respectively. At high frequencies, the acoustic wavelength is comparable to the boundary layer thickness and this has an effect on acoustic refraction close to the duct walls. Preliminary results of this study reveal how different boundary layer profiles affect sound attenuation in a lined duct, compared with a uniform mean flow. The method solves the third-order eigenvalue problem for the pressure perturbation (Pridmore-Brown equation) with a locally reacting impedance boundary condition. The distinctive feature of this implementation is that it is fast and efficient. Owing to the circular geometry, the problem is reduced to a one-dimensional finite element solution, which permits at high frequencies the calculation {{of a large number of}} modes at a modest computational cost...|$|R

Results show that there is a complex interplay between the boundary layer thickness, the direction of propagation and the liner impedance and that the boundary layer can have a strong impact on liner performance for typical configurations (including changes of the order of 30 dB on the attenuation of modes associated with tonal fan noise). A modified impedance condition including the effect of a small but finite boundary layer thickness is considered and compared to the standard Myers condition based on an infinitely thin boundary layer.
