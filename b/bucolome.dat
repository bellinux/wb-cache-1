50|$|<b>Bucolome</b> (Paramidine) is a {{barbiturate}} derivative. Unlike most barbiturates it {{does not}} have any significant sedative or hypnotic effects, but instead acts as an analgesic and antiinflammatory. It also acts as a CYP2C9 inhibitor and reduces the metabolism of several commonly used drugs, which makes it useful for potentiating or extending the duration of action of those drugs, or reducing the production of unwanted metabolites.|$|E
40|$|Influence of <b>bucolome</b> on non-bilirubin {{fraction}} showing positive diazo-reaction (non-bilirubin fraction, dipyrril substances) was studied using heterozygous Gunn rats. Two hundred mg of <b>bucolome</b> per kg of rat {{body weight}} was injected intramuscularly {{once a day}} for four days. The bile collection by the bile duct canulation was started 24 hours after the final drug loading and continued for 22 hours. The following results were obtained: 1) Amount of non-bilirubin in the rat bile increased significantly in <b>bucolome</b> loading group than in the control group. 2) Radioactivity in non-bilirubin fraction in the bile after <b>bucolome</b> and (3) H-bilirubin loading was not increased significantly than in the control. 3) In <b>bucolome</b> loading group, bile volume increased significantly but the excreted amount of bilirubin did not increased. According to these results, <b>bucolome</b> did not catabolize bilirubin directly but increased non-bilirubin fraction, dipyrril substances, in the bile...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether <b>bucolome</b> (5 -n-butyl- 1 -cyclohexyl- 2, 4, 6 -tri-oxoperhydropyrimidine), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, can reverse diuretic resistance of furosemide {{in patients with}} ne-phrotic syndrome, we examined the inhibitory effect of <b>bucolome</b> on the protein binding of furosemide in serum and urine. <b>Bucolome</b> significantly inhibited the protein binding of furosemide not only in serum but also in urine of preparation albumin (UPA), which mimics urinary albumin concentration in patients with nephrotic syndrome by ultrafiltration method. The binding percentage of furosemide to albumin was approximately 70 % in UPA. With coadministration of <b>bucolome</b> to healthy volunteers, renal clearance of furosemide was increased, reflecting the increase of the free fraction of furo-semide in serum. Furthermore, coadministration of <b>bucolome</b> caused a significant increase of urine volume and sodium concen-tration in urine. Even at higher urine levels of furosemide, th...|$|E
40|$|Effects of <b>bucolome</b> on congenitally jaundiced Gunn rats were examined. Plasma total {{bilirubin}} level fell immediately after a single injection of <b>bucolome</b> and the lowered level persisted {{for more than}} 6 hours. Plasma unbound-bilirubin level and cerebellar bilirubin content increased simultaneously with the drop in total plasma bilirubin level. Kernicterus was observed in the brains of the treated rats 6 hours after the treatment. LD 50 of the drug in jaundiced rats was about 37 mg/kg, about one-tenth of the value in nonjaundiced rats. It is suggested that <b>bucolome</b> displaces bilirubin from albumin, transferring bilirubin from blood into tissues including the brain, and resulting in kernicterus. The use of <b>bucolome</b> in infants with hyperbilirubinaemia is inadvisable...|$|E
40|$|Biliary {{bilirubin}} conjugates {{were investigated}} in heterozygote Gunn rat after loading of phenobarbital or <b>bucolome</b> for 4 days. 50 mg of phenobarbital or 200 mg of <b>bucolome</b> per Kg {{of body weight}} was given intramusculary once a day. The bile collection by bile duct canulation was started 24 hours after the final drug loading and continued for 22 hours. The following results were obtained: 1) Bile volume increased significantly in both groups compared with the control group (no treatment group). The amount of excreted bilirubin increased significantly in the phenobarbital loading group than the control group, {{but not in the}} <b>bucolome</b> loading group. 2) A significantly increased amount of biliary bilirubin sulfate was observed in the Phenobarbital loading group compared with the control group, but not in the <b>bucolome</b> loading group. 3) The amount of excreted biliary bilirubin glucuronide increased significantly in the phenobarbital loading group compared with the control group, but not in the <b>bucolome</b> loading group...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bucolome,</b> a new non-steroid {{agent for}} {{inflammatory}} disease, {{was administered to}} a total of 86 patients with urological inflammation and the following results were obtained. 1) <b>Bucolome</b> was given to 57 cases of cystitis, and its effectiveness was evaluated to be very good in 4, good in 10, fair in 34 and ineffective in 9. 2) On the other hand, <b>Bucolome</b> for balanoposthitis, urethritis, prostatitis and epididymitis was evaluated as ineffective in 14, fair in 11 and good in 4. 3) Thus, the results of administration of <b>Bucolome</b> were very good in 4 (4. 7 %), good in 14 (16. 3 %), fair in 45 (52. 3 %) and ineffective in 23 (26. 7 %). 4) In 16 of 86 cases, side effects were noticed. The above results show that this medicine is effective for inflammatory diseases in the urological field...|$|E
40|$|Fifty preterm {{babies were}} {{randomly}} assigned to a group given oral <b>bucolome</b> (30 mg/kg per day for 5 days) and a control group. Serum bilirubin levels of the treated infants from day 4 onwards were consistently lower than those of the control infants. 3 of the 25 control infants (but none of the 25 treated infants) had bilirubin levels greater than 18 mg/ 100 ml (308 mumol/l) and required exchange transfusion. No sedation or drowsiness was observed in the infants given <b>bucolome,</b> and though the drug caused some vomiting, weight gains were unaffected...|$|E
40|$|<b>Bucolome</b> N-glucuronide (BCP-NG, main {{metabolite}} of <b>bucolome</b> (BCP) is {{the first}} N-glucuronide of barbituric acid derivatives isolated from rat bile. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the main tissue producing BCP-NG and the molecular species of BCP-NG-producing UGT. Four target tissues were investigated: the liver, small and large intestines, and kidney. To identify the UGT molecular species responsible for BCP-NG formation, yeast microsomes expressing each rat UGT isoform were prepared. BCP-NG formation was detected in all microsomal fractions of the 4 tissues. The liver microsomal BCP-NG-producing activity was the highest, followed by that in the small intestinal microsomes, showing about 41 % of the liver microsomal activity level. BCP-NG-producing activity (min- 1) was determined in yeast microsomal fractions expressing rat UGT isoforms, and the activity was detected in UGT 1 A 1 (0. 059), UGT 1 A 2 (0. 318), UGT 1 A 3 (0. 001), UGT 1 A 7 (0. 003), UGT 2 B 1 (0. 004), UGT 2 B 3 (0. 091), and UGT 2 B 6 (0. 031), showing particularly high levels for UGT 1 A 1 and UGT 1 A 2 among the UGT 1 A isoforms. It was clarified that UGT 1 A 1, widely distributed in rat tissues, is the molecular species responsible for BCP-NG formation...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{efficacy}} {{depends on}} the amount of a preparation reaching the target tissue (grade of tissue transfer). In this experiment, we established the normal albumin concentration of a healthy adult (600 μ M) or a low-albumin state indicating marked liver hypofunction (100 μ M) on a cell membrane plate, and evaluated the cell membrane permeability of the probe agents. The cell membrane permeability of phenytoin or valproate depended on the concentration of albumin. Probe agent site-I and -II inhibitors, <b>bucolome</b> and oleic acid, respectively, increased the cell membrane permeability. In the future, the cell membrane permeability of probe agents should be further investigated to estimate the tissue transfer of agents based on various laboratory data (albumin, free fatty acids, uremic toxins, and bilirubin) ...|$|E
40|$|A 31 -year-old man {{had been}} treated with {{carbamazepine}} (CBZ) for 6 years and warfarin with <b>bucolome</b> for 2 years before developing hyponatremia 7 days after an injection of interferon-alpha 2 b and starting oral ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Despite the hyponatremia, urinary osmolality exceeded plasma osmolality, and urinary excretion volume decreased markedly after water loading. Restriction of water intake and administration of dimethylchlortetracycline improved the hyponatremia, and lithium therapy maintained the normonatremia for one year. The hyponatremia recovered 6 months after the interferon-alpha 2 b therapy was completely stopped. In the present case, the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis may {{have been caused by}} the effect of interferon-alpha 2 b on the renal distal tubules that had been sensitized by CBZ. Patients on CBZ therapy should be carefully observed for the development of hyponatremia when they are started on interferon-alpha 2 b injections...|$|E
40|$|The {{barbituric acid}} {{derivative}} <b>bucolome</b> (BCP) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The present study investigated whether BCP N-glucuronide (BCP-NG, the primary metabolite of BCP) {{was produced in}} mammalian species other than rats, and attempted to identify the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoform (s) responsible for formation of BCP-NG in humans. BCP-NG was detected in all species tested. The results were as follows (pmol equivalent/ min/mg protein) : rat, 479 ± 83; Mongolian gerbil, 378 ± 9; rabbit, 275 ± 26; guinea pig, 257 ± 10; human, 242 ± 18; hamster, 177 ± 22; and mouse, 167 ± 15. Since human liver microsomes formed BCP-NG, we investigated the metabolites of BCP excreted in the urine of a patient after oral administration of BCP (600 mg). BCP and BCP-NG were excreted in the urine at amounts of 2. 9 mg (about 0. 5 % of the dose) and 14. 4 mg (about 2. 5 % of the dose) over 12 hours. In order to identify the UGT isoforms involved in formation of BCP-NG in humans, we investigated BCP-NG formation by the microsomes of insect cells expressing each of twelve UGT isoforms (hUGT 1 A 1, 1 A 3, 1 A 4, 1 A 6, 1 A 7, 1 A 8, 1 A 9, 1 A 10, 2 B 4, 2 B 7, 2 B 15, and 2 B 17). As a result, BCP-NG formation (pmol equivalents/min/mg protein) was observed with microsomes expressing hUGT 1 A 1 (142), 1 A 3 (196), 1 A 4 (8), 1 A 7 (8), 1 A 8 (66), 1 A 9 (38), 1 A 10 (9), 2 B 4 (7) and 2 B 7 (16). In particular, the activity of hUGT 1 A 1 and 1 A 3 was high. These {{results suggest that the}} UGT isoforms responsible for formation of BCP-NG exist in various mammalian species, including humans, and that the UGT 1 A family is primarily responsible for BCP N-glucuronide formation in humans...|$|E
40|$|Soy-derived {{products}} containing phy-toestrogens (mainly isoflavones), functionally {{similar to}} 17 β-estradiol, {{have been adopted}} as a natural alternative medicine and were listed {{as one of the}} top 5 herbal products sold in 2002. 1 Even though the potential drug interaction of es-trogens is low, in vitro study has demon-strated that unhydrolyzed soy extract has the possibility to activate CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 9 at low concentrations in human liver microsomes, whereas the hydrolyzed soy extract inhibited the activity of these isoenzymes. 2 The primary isoflavones of soybean, genistein and daidzein, can in-teract with oxidative and conjugative metabolism enzymes such as CYP 3 A 4, CYP 2 C 9, and UDP-glucuronosyltrans-ferase in vitro, as reviewed by Moon et al. 3 and Sparreboom et al. 4 Losartan is a selective angiotensin II receptor antagonist used in the treatment of hypertension 5 and management of heart failure due to its ability to inhibit the an-giotensin II subtype 1 receptor within the systemic and tissue renin–angiotensin–al-dosterone systems. 6 Approximately 14 % of a losartan dose is metabolized to its active metabolite, E- 3174, which contributes significantly to the effect of losartan because of its potent antihyperten-sive effects, longer half-life, and greater area under the plasma concentration–time curve. 7, 8 Data from in vitro studies suggested that CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 2 C 9 were in-volved in the metabolism of losartan to E- 3174. 9, 10 Howev-er, CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors, such as itraconazole, 11 ery-thromycin, 12 and cimetidine, 13 did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of losartan in vivo, which demon-strated that CYP 3 A 4 had few effects on losartan metabo-lism in humans. Meanwhile, CYP 2 C 9 inhibitors, such as <b>bucolome,</b> 14 a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, and amodiaquine, 15 an antimalarial drug, significantly changed the pharmacokinetics of losartan and E- 3174, indicating that CYP 2 C 9 was the major metabolic enzyme of losartan...|$|E
