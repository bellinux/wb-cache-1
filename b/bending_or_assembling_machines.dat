Modern millwrights work with steel and other {{materials}} and must often combine the skills of other mechanical trades in order to successfully install industrial machinery <b>or</b> to <b>assemble</b> <b>machines</b> from pre-fabricated parts. Modern millwrights must {{also be able to}} read blueprints and other schematics to aid them in the construction of complex systems. Millwrights are frequently unionized, with estimated numbers of around 45% in the US.|$|R
40|$|Electronic excitations, caused {{for example}} by {{irradiation}} with electrons, light or modern photon sources (synchrotron, ultra-fast lasers), are key quantities {{for the study}} of materials, ranging from solids to atoms, from surface to nanoscale systems. An accurate understanding and prediction of the interaction of radiation and matter can even favor remarkable technological breakthroughs, like new functionalities for bulk systems (e. g. in optoelectronics) or, in the long term, in biological applications ("bottom-up" <b>assembling</b> <b>or</b> molecular <b>machines</b> 1).

40|$|The Integrated Feature-Based Modeller is the {{kernel of}} the Integrated Feature-Based Prototype System, {{developed}} within a European cooperation between Fraunhofer-IGD, Darmstadt and IMATI, C. N. R., Genova. It includes the recognition and the completion steps. The feature recogniser performs a reasoning process {{in order to}} identify and classify characteristic regions (form features). The completion step aims at determining the volumetric representations of the space occupied by the features of an object. The objective is to evaluate the volumes that can be associated to specific operations executed in an application context, such as design, <b>assembling</b> <b>or</b> <b>machining.</b> This document describes the upgraded completion process within the Intermediate Modeller module. Moreover, for what concerns the recognition and the completion steps, the usage, the results, and the choices that can be done thanks to the textual interface provided with the application are also explained...|$|R

Heat exchanger tube bundle drawing and <b>assembling</b> <b>machine</b> is a special equipment for maintenance of heat exchanger of petroleum, chemical and other enterprises,specifically for removal and installation of the heat exchanger tube bundle. This paper introduces a self-developed heat exchanger tube bundle drawing and <b>assembling</b> <b>machine’s</b> overall structure, driving principle, hydraulic system and electrical control system’s design. The bundle drawing and <b>assembling</b> <b>machine</b> has large force, drawing and assembling are stable, safe and high efficiency and low cost and so on advantages, it has been put into mass production and gets a good evaluation...|$|R

50|$|The shin injury {{affected}} him {{for most}} of the remainder of the year as was evident in his first loss when he returned to racing for September's St Leger Stakes, where he finished fifth behind winner Robert the Devil. His next start came in the Great Foal Stakes. In that race, Robert the Devil made the running, with <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> held up in the rear. At the bushes, <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> moved up to third behind Robert the Devil and Muriel. <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> then overtook Muriel and challenged Robert the Devil. <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> seemed to have the race won with 50 yards to go, but he swerved badly and lost by a head. He faced Robert the Devil again in the Champion Stakes. Robert the Devil started the 11/10 favourite, with <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> at 5/4. Robert the Devil led from the start and was never caught. He won by 10 lengths from <b>Bend</b> <b>Or,</b> with the other two runners a further 10 lengths back.|$|R

50|$|<b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> was not entered for the 2000 Guineas, but {{in early}} March, {{he was the}} 5/1 {{favourite}} for the Epsom Derby. He started his three-year-old campaign in the Derby. He was ridden by Fred Archer and started as the 2/1 favourite {{in a field of}} 19. After the start, he was in a prominent position but was dropped back into mid-division by Archer. At Tattenham Corner Robert the Devil was leading from Von der Tann, <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> being in about the sixth position. In the straight <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> passed some of the horses to move into third. The second placed Mask then began to fade as he was passed by <b>Bend</b> <b>Or,</b> who went off in pursuit of Robert the Devil. <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> won the Derby by a head from Robert the Devil, with Mask a further six lengths back in third.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> (1877-1903) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse {{who won the}} 1880 Epsom Derby. His regular jockey Fred Archer, {{winner of}} {{thirteen}} consecutive British jockey titles, said <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> was probably the greatest horse he had ever ridden.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> had white flecks on his {{chestnut}} coat, {{and like}} his damsire Thormanby, had black spots on his neck, shoulder, {{and on his}} quarters. These markings often showed up in his progeny and {{is referred to as}} <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> spotting.|$|R

50|$|Returning to {{the track}} at age four, <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> won the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom Downs {{carrying}} 9 stone. He then avenged his defeats to Robert the Devil in the Epsom Gold Cup. Only the two horses ran, with <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> winning by a neck. <b>Bend</b> <b>Or</b> then won the Champion Stakes easily by ¾ length from Scobell, with the 1881 Derby winner Iroquois a bad third. <b>Bend</b> <b>Or's</b> next start came in the Cambridgeshire Stakes where, under Archer, he carried 9 st 8 lb. During the closing stages the weight began to tell and he was eased by Archer, finishing in seventh. He was then retired to breeding duties at his owner's Eaton Stud.|$|R
