40|$|Among {{the various}} promotional schemes {{targeted}} {{for the promotion}} of rubber in Tripura, <b>Block</b> <b>Plantation</b> Scheme (BPS) has been introduced exclusively for the rehabilitation of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes. BPS is a comprehensive scheme with the characteristic features of group/community approach in all spheres of operations up to primary processing and marketing and family labour participation as wage labour during the immature phase of the plantations spanning six years. However, there has been a distortion in the uninterrupted supply of family labour to the scheme in the recent past due to growing popularity of employment opportunities under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (MGNREGA) programme, which may eventually lead to a prolongation of immature phase and adversely affect the uniform and healthy growth of the rubber plants. These factors in turn could affect the overall rubber yield and so suitable policies needed to be evolved to ensure adequate and timely availability of family labour to immature rubber plantation. One of the options could be the inclusion of the developmental works required for the immature rubber plantations under the MGNREGA projects by the State Government of Tripura.

He was Chief of the Soils Conservation Division, Forestry Directorate and then Director of Forestry, Fisheries and Wildlife in Mali. Since 1978 {{he has been the}} FAO Senior Regional Forestry Officer for Africa based in Accra, Ghana. The need for wood as a source of {{domestic}} fuel is now a serious cause of the accelerating process of desertification in the Sahel-Sudan regions of Africa. Rapid population growth, particularly among the urban poor, has increased pressure on limited forestry resources. However, the possibility of the wide-spread adoption of alternative energy sources seems limited, to say the least, because of the inherent economic and social problems. Obviously, therefore, those countries which are threatened by desertification, will, together with aid and development organizations, initiate projects to conserve firewood, which is why schemes for improved burning systems have mushroomed in the Sahel The use of charcoal has come in for considerable criticism in the campaign against wastage of wood. Charcoal-making often wastes more than 60 %, especially when there is only patchy carbonization, as is usually the case in Africa. However, in everyday use charcoal wastes less energy than wood. In traditional wood-burning firestoves wood can release only about 8 % of its potential energy, and this is so particularly of the three-stone stove which gives out only 5 %. For every kilo of wood only 280 kcals are used. Traditional charcoal-burning stoves have an average output of 28 % of the available energy. Thus one kilo of wood turned into charcoal will give 420 kcals in a domestic stove. These calculations demonstrate that charcoal wins as far as energy economy is concerned. But there are numerous variables, and one can project figures with different carbon/stove ratios, the calorific power of wood, and so on. The Stove Improvements Scheme's own research shows {{that it is difficult to}} get a 20 % return from woodburning stoves. Charcoal-burning stoves, however, will achieve 40 % yields, and if one includes improved carbonization return of 16 % to 30 % then it will be seen that 25 % of the total energy will be utilized. Woodburning would become viable if output from wood-burning stoves rose beyond 20 - 25 % The use of charcoal in towns has even more advantages in terms of energy conservation [...] in the field of transport. If the radius of the supply of fuel wood exceeds 150 - 200 km from the town, then more energy from fossil fuels will have been consumed than has been transported. Charcoal, on the other hand, can be transported more than 2000 km. It is vital, however, to take into account the following facts in the formulation of an energy policy based on forestry concerns. Charcoal allows energy sources to be situated farther afield. Energy development policy must therefore consider separately urban and rural problems. Firewood for rural. communities must, where possible, be produced in the immediate vicinity. In contrast, charcoal for urban use, can come from areas further away which are more suited to forestry development. The basic problem here is one of transferring energy sources and this must not be seen solely as the task of forestry administrations. It might even perhaps be considered, as an international commercial vensure. The most pressing problem for forestry in sub-Saharan Africa is the supply of domestic energy to the majority of the population [...] a problem which may be expected to continue for a long time. It goes without saying that every saving of energy has an immediate effect on both forests and the environment, particularly in large towns where the concentration of population inevitably involves over-exploitation of forests. Furthermore, if the use of charcoal means that energy can be brought in from further afield, it will help ease the pressure on forests near the towns. If the decision to promote the use of charcoal instead of wood in towns is taken, there will be certain implications for both forestry policy and development: - priority must be given to husbanding existing resources. These will be used to meet the fuel needs of the urban populations, wherever they may be; - transport of these resources must assume a prime position in forestry policy in countries where there are both wood-growing and nonwood-growing areas - in considering reforestation in relation to the energy needs of large towns, the prevailing climatic and edaphic conditions must carry more weight than the proximity of the consumer. Thus greater flexibility will be achieved, allowing <b>block</b> <b>plantation</b> in favourable zones. Plantations under these conditions must therefore be considered as economically viable enterprises; - the perfection and distribution of charcoal-burning stoves: any policy aimed at saving energy must start with a reduced consumption of resources. This is where the impact will be most felt; - improvement of carbonization: this is the second most important element in fuel economy. Rapid results can be expected in this field since it is relatively easy to train the small number of people involved. Forestry administrations must make training a priority. In the interests of both energy conservation and environmental protection, accelerating urbanization must bring with it a concerted effort towards promoting the use of charcoal against wood. In this way charcoal will become a highly marketable product that can take its place in lone-distance trade. The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily those of CTA.

In total, about 30 projects of both government and non-governmental agencies have planted perhaps ten million trees and tested some 215 species during the past 60 years. Many of these plantings have taken place as shelterbelts or windbreaks (equivalent to about 1, 600 ha) or for amenity purposes. <b>Block</b> <b>plantations</b> have been established to stabilise both coastal and inland sand dunes on about 1, 500 ha (a lower estimate than the previously published figures), while about 1, 800 ha have been established as community wood lots.

40|$|In {{context of}} energy crisis and global warming, Jatropha curcas offers a great {{potential}} to combat fuel shortage and minimize carbon emissions. J. curcas {{is a potential}} candidate for biofuel as it is drought tolerant, has high seed oil content and is not browsed by animals. The tested advantage of blended biodiesel lies in its use in vehicles without any engine modification. A lot of hype was created earlier for Jatropha as a “wonder shrub”, but {{much of it was}} without supporting data and the outcomes raised questions on its large scale cultivation. Our research showed great variability in germplasm for agronomic parameters, oil content, male: female flower ratio. Agronomic practices experiments showed response to fertility management, spacing, pruning, growth hormones and mycorrhizae application. Jatropha can survive under low water availability, but needs sufficient water for higher yields. Currently available plant material productivity is low (1 – 2 t ha− 1) with variations among years due to rainfall variability. Low or high rainfall in waterlogging prone soils reduces yields significantly (0. 1 t ha− 1 during 2010 in black soils). In <b>block</b> <b>plantations,</b> insect pests and diseases are potential threats. The years 2009 and 2010 witnessed a large number of plant loss in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Chattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh due to black rot disease caused by Botryosphaeria dothidea. In spite of the challenges, Jatropha has the potential of greening degraded lands by converting non-productive evaporation into productive transpiration. During gestation period (4 – 5 years) of Jatropha plantation, yields of one ton or more can be obtained from inter-cropping with sorghum, pearl millet, chickpea and soybean based on soil fertility. In addition to biodiesel, the seed cake which is a by-product is a good source of N (∼ 5 %) and other nutrients for use in plantation and crop production. Jatropha fixes and adds to soil per annum around 1, 500 kg C ha− 1 through deoiled cake, leaf fall plus pruned loppings and builds organic carbon content of degraded lands. Biofuel replacement of 250 kg C equivalent ha− 1 in the fossil fuel and more than 5, 000 kg C ha− 1 sequestered in live plant biomass renders ecosystem service. Jatropha plant cover also reduces soil loss. Along with numerous benefits, being in domain of unprivileged, biodiesel plantation activities generates employment opportunities and social mainstreaming of the weaker sections. Current findings with available material show that with increased labour costs and low productivity, it is not a viable option for biodiesel. But, in remote areas, non-edible vegetable oil as a source of energy produced on degraded lands in decentralized manner is a viable option to meet energy demand in rural areas.

Little is known about agricultural and ecological interactions which might occur combining them in a tree-based intercropping system. This mixed approach, called alley coppice, is currently investigated in an European research Project (www. agrocop. com), and has important advantages: (i) a regular income guaranteed from the SRC component; (ii) light competition between species can often improve the stem form of timber trees; (iii) timber trees can be planted at the final spacing, avoiding expensive thinning; (iv) SRC component protects young timber trees from wind/storm damage; (v) alley coppice {{is expected to have}} positive impacts on biodiversity, and reducing soil erosion. Three system designs are currently investigated: Simultaneous planting (SP); Lagged planting (LP) and Border planting (BP). In SP, timber and SRC components are planted in the same year; the key investigated factor is the distance between timber trees and the first SRC row, comparing 1, 2, 3 m in plantations in Ireland, Germany and Italy. A tree row width of three meters guaranteed satisfying growth rates of Sorbus and Pyrus timber trees in a mixture with 2 -yr SRC poplar (Populus spp) in Italy, improving timber wood quality. LP, with planting SRC under adult timber trees, is studied in France and Ireland, according to timber tree age, species and inter-row spacings.

Annually-burned firebreaks are fundamental to plantation forestry management, as they protect timber compartments from runaway fires. Here, we investigated the effect of annual burning with different levels of domestic cattle grazing in ENs, and annual burning without domestic cattle grazing in the adjacent protected area (PA). Sampling was conducted on three firebreak types, as well as two natural control grasslands (in the EN and PA each). The first two types (PA firebreaks and peripheral EN firebreaks) were {{on either side of the}} PA/plantation fenceline. The third type, plantation EN firebreaks, had forestry compartments on two sides and heavy cattle grazing. Although plant species richness was not significantly affected, plant communities of annually-burned firebreaks differed compositionally from those in the reference grasslands in the EN and PA respectively. Furthermore, plant species turnover was lower in annually-burned firebreaks than in reference EN and PA grasslands. Comparisons among different annually-burned firebreak types showed no difference in plant species richness. However, species composition and turnover of plant communities in peripheral EN fenceline firebreaks were similar to those of PA fenceline firebreaks, but both differed from the plantation EN firebreaks. Plant communities of longer-rotation burned grassland in the EN and PA were similar in species richness, composition and turnover. Overall, these results indicate that annual burning of firebreaks leads to homogeneous plant communities but not necessarily a reduction in species richness. High levels of cattle grazing exacerbate the effect of annual burning, as in plantation EN firebreaks. We recommend that managers should control heavy cattle grazing in annually-burned areas to maintain the natural plant communities as much as possible, while at the same time protecting the <b>plantation</b> <b>blocks</b> from runaway fires through necessary annual burning of appropriate firebreaks...|$|R

Thirty-six soil samples (at depths of 0 - 30, 30 - 60 and 60 - 90 cm) were taken from tree <b>plantation</b> <b>blocks.</b> The treatments were P 0 (none irrigated, as a control) and P 1 and P 2 were irrigated for four and eight years, respectively, and were analyzed for pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), total soluble Na+, Ca++, Mg++ and Cl-. Twenty-one samples of tree leaves were collected from P 0, P 1 and P 2 and analyzed for Na, Ca and Mg. The results showed that at the soil surface (0 - 30 cm) no differences within and between blocks in pH that was about 7. 0 where the CEC of P 0 and P 2 have lower content compared to P 1. Application of the DPPW increased the soluble Na+ of P 1 and P 2 compared to P 0 (2. 2, 0. 46 and 0. 04 Meq/L respectively), and the same trend was shown by soluble Ca++ (74. 5, 18 and 2. 5), and Mg++ (3. 0, 2. 5 and 1. 0). Cl- content increased as irrigation interval increased (4. 5, 104. 5 and 30. 0 Meq/L for P 0, P 1 and P 2, respectively). Systematic decrease of all soil chemical content with depths was shown for P 0, P 1 and P 2. For the plant, {{there was an increase}} in Na as irrigation interval increased (50. 67, 516. 67 and 723. 33 for Po, P 1 and P 2 respectively), whereas Ca and Mg increased in P 1 compared to P 2 and P 0. The risk of accumulation of soluble salts is expected to occur with time, therefore, specific treatments to decrease the salts content of DPPW are crucial...|$|R
40|$|The current {{production}} plan at the Potlatch Hybrid Poplar plantation in eastern Oregon is to haul 8, 000 whole trees per day (170, 000 bone dry Tons of chips annually) to a centrally located processing facility (CPF) where the poplar will be processed. Harvests begin in 2001 and continue on a seven-year rotation. A transportation {{system for the}} Potlatch Corporation plantation is developed. The study provides a "stump to dump" transportation route model, a review of field tests, and a transportation schedule that predicts production based on loads, transportation times and costs from any harvest unit on the plantation to the CPF. Primary objectives are reduced costs through efficiency, workability and safety. The transportation route system computes the shortest and "safest" transportation routes from harvest units to the CPF. Tree transportation speeds and times were obtained from field tests, and {{are included in the}} discussion of tested hauling equipment. For production management, spreadsheets are developed to modify and analyze different routes, and to monitor and maintain transportation efficiency. Data in the spreadsheets include harvest unit in acres, numbers of trees in each harvest unit, and hauling and return distances from corners and centroid of each harvest unit to the CPF. With this information harvest and transportation times, loads, and costs of harvesting any <b>block</b> on the <b>plantation</b> can be simulated. II An average 1. 6 -million trees will be harvested annually (11. 3 -million trees per 7 year rotation) and hauled with an estimated 15, 500 wagonloads in 46, 000 harvester hours. When the constructed transportation route model was analyzed with field data, it was determined that four harvesters are sufficient to meet the 8, 000 -trees/day goal at Potlatch plantation. Eleven tractor/wagon combinations will be required to maintain continuous harvester production on the entire plantation at any time. Analysis indicates that harvest and transportation costs per rotation are approximately seven million dollars (7, 000, 000) or an average of one million dollars (1, 000, 000) annually. The estimated harvest and transportation cost is 0. 625 per tree. In field production/time studies must be performed to fine-tune routes and equipment. Several recommendations are presented that emphasize areas of greatest concern related to transportation speed, safety, productivity and overall profitability...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{expansion}} {{increases the}} need for, and pressure on, green areas. Reforestation {{projects in the}} rural–urban fringe represent an opportunity for enhancing the environmental quality of peri-urban spaces and a means to contribute to cities carbon neutrality policies. Yet, relatively little information exists regarding the long term (10 – 25 years) survival and growth rate in urban and peri-urban plantations. This paper reports and discusses the results achieved by a reforestation in the peri-urban space of Rome (Italy), 25 years after its establishment. The plantation has been periodically surveyed between 6 and 24 years of age by means of continuous inventories, {{with the aim of}} monitoring growth dynamics. Permanent sample plots have been investigated and stratified by tree species composition (broadleaves vs. conifers, single vs. multispecies) for data analysis. On the whole, plantations show suitable results in terms of rate of growth, carbon storage and uptake, especially in coniferous and mixed stands. The average stand volume of the forest plantation, currently ranges from one-and-a third to one-and-a-half times the average values estimated for natural high forest stands of the same age and species groups at country level. The species groups exhibit differential growth patterns over the observed period, that are mainly due to differences in the ecological traits of the planted trees. Ten years after the establishment, the average annual value of carbon uptake in conifer and mixed species group exceeds 10 Mg CO 2 equivalent ha- 1 year- 1, a figure corresponding to 4 times the value of deciduous broadleaves (oaks and other species) and 1. 5 times the value of evergreen oaks. Twenty years after the establishment, the average annual carbon uptake peaks to 25 Mg CO 2 equivalent ha- 1 year- 1 in the mixed species group, exceeds 15 Mg CO 2 equivalent ha- 1 year- 1 in the conifers, and ranks between 6 and 12. 5 Mg CO 2 equivalent ha- 1 year- 1 in the groups dominated by broadleaved species. Overall with a surface area just under 300 ha, the carbon uptake level of the Castel di Guido reforestation allows to offset the 0. 04 % of CO 2 emissions of the city of Rome. Although the spatial coexistence of even-aged <b>plantation</b> <b>blocks</b> characterized by a range of ecological traits, is expected to ensure a more continuous carbon sequestration, being less susceptible to damage of any kind, the current lack of silvicultural management may also lead to degradation processes, by triggering e. g. fuel accumulation and, by consequence, forest fires. In this line, recommendations are provided in order to improve the ecological and functional efficiency of the investigated reforestation. The field experiment demonstrates, ultimately, the capability of the continuous forest inventory to take the pulse over several decades of tree species performance and carbon uptake levels in urban and peri-urban reforestations...|$|R
