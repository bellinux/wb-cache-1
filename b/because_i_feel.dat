Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them. God will not allow you to be the last Governor of the State of India.|$|E

In addition to their creative projects with Lewis and Sarah, Fox wrote a few pieces for The Huffington Post. Like Sarah, they felt a new creative freedom from transitioning: [...] "It's easier to make art now <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like I've got a huge chunk of my life out of the way."

500|$|In later years, Fellini {{explained}} that from [...] "a sentimental point of view," [...] he was [...] "most attached" [...] to La Strada: [...] "Above all, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{that it is}} my most representative film, {{the one that is}} the most autobiographical; for both personal and sentimental reasons, because it is the film that I had the greatest trouble in realizing and that gave me the most difficulty {{when it came time to}} find a producer." [...] Of all the imaginary beings he had brought to the screen, Fellini felt closest to the three principals of La Strada, [...] "especially Zampanò." [...] Anthony Quinn found working for Fellini invaluable: [...] "He drove me mercilessly, making me do scene after scene over and over again until he got what he wanted. I learned more about film acting in three months with Fellini than I'd learned in all the movies I'd made before then." [...] Long afterwards, in 1990, Quinn sent a note to the director and his co-star: [...] "The two of you are the highest point in my life -- Antonio." ...|$|E
500|$|Munnerlyn {{is active}} with March of Dimes charities, a cause {{close to his}} heart as he was a {{premature}} baby himself. When asked why his name is Captain, Munnerlyn said, [...] "My momma promised my grandmomma that she could name the last child. I was the boy of the family, and she named me Captain. Her great grandfather was named Captain, so I got named after my great-great grandfather. My sisters and brothers have normal names. I got the odd name. In the beginning {{it was kind of}} rough. Kids used to tease me a little, but it fits my personality, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like I'm a leader." [...] Munnerlyn majored in criminal justice while at South Carolina, where he was teammates and roommates with former Viking linebacker Jasper Brinkley.

500|$|During the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000), Spears {{revealed}} {{she felt}} inspired by hip hop {{artists such as}} Jay-Z and The Neptunes and {{wanted to create a}} record with a funkier sound. In February 2001, Spears signed a $7–8 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, entitled A Mother's Gift. On the same month, Spears started to record material for her third studio album, with [...] "Overprotected" [...] being recorded at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Additional recording was done in April 2001 at Maratone in Sweden, in which the song's vocals were completed. Background vocals were provided by Spears and Bosslady, with the track being mixed by Martin and Rami at Maratone Studios. Her third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. In an interview with the Daily Record, Spears concluded she can relate to [...] "Overprotected" [...] "on a personal basis, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> kind of overprotected. When I want to go out, everything has to be organized in advance. I think that other kids of my age can relate to it to a certain extent." ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{music is}} {{characterized}} by a metal sound, and the screamed vocals of frontman Josh Scogin. Journalists have frequently referred to the music as [...] "chaotic"; Allmusic writer Alex Henderson described it as a [...] "dense, clobbering sledgehammer", while Brian Shultz of Alternative Press called it [...] "manically pounding, distortion-soaked exercises of catharsis". The Chariot has often been labeled a metalcore band. However, the music generally defies genre standards like melodic/abrasive dynamics and harmonizing vocals; it wouldn't leave room for the [...] "nonstop firestorm of exploding drums, heaving guitars, and visceral shrieking," [...] as Allmusic writer Corey Apar put it. The band utilizes time changes and start-stop shifts, and typically write very short songs. Some journalists believe the music is challenging and an acquired taste. In interviews, Josh Scogin has described the band as “heavy punk rock”, doing away with genres and subgenres, and has also debunked many of these labels. “Sometimes people refer to us as mathcore, which I think is a very incorrect statement, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like that’s a very pre-calculated, ‘this is weird because this time signature doesn’t go with this time…’. It’s very planned out. We’re not that smart.” ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1984, Genesis took a {{break in}} {{activity}} to allow each member to continue with their solo careers. Rutherford formed his group Mike + The Mechanics, Banks worked on his solo album Soundtracks, and Collins released No Jacket Required which achieved worldwide success and increased his popularity as a result. The music press took note that Collins' success as a solo artist made him more popular than Genesis. Before the release of No Jacket Required, Collins insisted {{that he would not}} leave the band. [...] "The next one to leave the band will finish it," [...] Collins told Rolling Stone magazine in May 1985. [...] "I feel happier with what we're doing now, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> it's closer to me. I won't be the one." [...] Collins added, [...] "Poor old Genesis does get in the way sometimes. I still won't leave the group, but I imagine it will end by mutual consent." [...] In June, Collins spoke of the band's intention to start work on a new album that year, ending rumours to a false announcement that aired on BBC Radio 1 suggesting Genesis had split.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} support Cyrus' then newly launched, joint apparel line with Max Azria, sold {{exclusively}} by Walmart stores, an EP was chosen for release. [...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t even like using the word 'rock,' <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like it’s an honor to be put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely {{want to be able to}} step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating.

Though the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his [...] "statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him." [...] His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it [...] "a victory" [...] in a press conference. On his outspoken views on Islam, he said: [...] "I {{have a problem with the}} Islamic ideology, the Islamic culture, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> that the more Islam that we get in our societies the less freedom we get." [...] He opened the press conference with a quote from George Orwell's preface to Animal Farm: [...] "If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they don't want to hear". Lord Pearson, who had invited him, said his arrival was [...] "a celebration of the victory of freedom of speech over those who would prevent it in this country, particularly the Islamists, the violent Jihadists who are on the march across the world and in the UK." ...|$|E

500|$|Fearnet critic Alyse Wax wrote [...] "This episode made {{my brain}} hurt. [...] And I {{mean that in}} the nicest way possible. They were {{throwing}} a lot of weird shit at us. It was great <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like we are finally getting answers, like we will finally get some closure, and just maybe {{get rid of the}} Red universe stiffs. This episode was so ridiculously dense I am sure I missed some of the deeper scientific facts. I got the gist of it, though, and frankly, I much prefer these jam-packed episodes. I like when the puzzle pieces start falling into place. It's calming." [...] SFScope's Sarah Stegall believed the episode [...] "start out interestingly enough", but unlike other reviewers, she was very critical of the First People mythology, stating [...] "This is where my disbelief not only stopped being suspended, it got up {{and walked out of the}} room... I still don't like the premise of the evolution of an entire hominid species that left not one single solitary fossil behind. It's more like fantasy than science fiction." [...] Stegall praised Torv's acting as she plays [...] "two people very subtly, very convincingly", and concluded her review by commenting she will continue to watch the series because she trusts the writers will [...] "supply us with plausible answers from time to time", but is [...] "losing some respect for it".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the tracks on She Wolf, {{according}} to Shakira, have been written from a [...] "very feminine perspective". She attributed this to her growing maturity, noting [...] "I think maybe <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> more like a woman today". Many of the songs focus on [...] "emotions that a woman experiments when you're in love or out of love— jealousy, fantasies, daydreams", which the singer said were based on her conversations with girlfriends who are [...] "struggling with their own romantic lives". This issue is prominently covered in the track [...] "Men in This Town", in which Shakira sings {{about the lack of}} eligible bachelors in Los Angeles. The song contains references to American actors Angelina Jolie and Matt Damon, the latter of whom Shakira knows personally, and popular destinations like the SkyBar. [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV commented that [...] "Shakira wasn't afraid to get a little wacky {{when it came to the}} lyrics on She Wolf". In an interview with Jim Cantiello, the singer was asked for the reason behind lyrics like [...] "I'm so happy I should get sued" [...] (in the track [...] "Long Time"), to which Shakira replied [...] "Maybe it rhymed. It's hard to explain your own lyrics, you know". In [...] "Mon Amour", she wishes that her ex-boyfriend and his new girlfriend have a terrible vacation in Paris and are eaten alive by [...] "French fleas". Other themes the album touches upon include night-life, sex, and seduction, in songs like [...] "Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Spy". Rolling Stone critic Jody Rosen labelled the latter [...] "a meditation on masturbation".|$|E
500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but I want to keep writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
