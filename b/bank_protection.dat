500|$|The {{canal and}} its environs are {{important}} for wildlife conservation. There are several Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which exhibit great biodiversity. Key sites that are home to several rare species include the Aldermaston Gravel Pits, Woolhampton, Thatcham Reed Beds, and Freeman's Marsh, Hungerford. There are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal. More than 100different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over {{the length of the}} canal, of which 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds, including grey heron (Ardea cinerea), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus) and common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis). [...] Fourteenspecies have been confirmed as breeding including sand martins (Riparia riparia), which nest in drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading. Wilton Water by Crofton Locks and the Kennet Valley gravel pits provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl. Several species of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and other invertebrates have also been recorded. Common reed (Phragmites australis) is among the plant species growing along the edges of the canal. Measures to preserve and create water vole (Arvicola amphibius or A. terrestrisis) habitat have had considerable impact on the restoration of the canal, and new [...] "vole-friendly" [...] techniques of <b>bank</b> <b>protection</b> have been developed.|$|E
