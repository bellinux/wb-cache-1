This added the functions of changing between playlists, hearing the song title and artist of the track playing, as well as play/pause, track changes and volume control. It originally was not possible to change songs or volume with most third-party headphones, since they lacked these controls. However, since the device began playing music automatically when it was turned on, third-party headphones could still be used in [...] "autoplay" [...] mode (with no volume or playback controls), and after its release, some third-party headphones and headphone adapters began to include full support for the {{third generation}}.
