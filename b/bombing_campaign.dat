5|$|The Disney bomb saw {{limited use}} by the United States Army Air Forces in Europe from February to April 1945. Although {{technically}} successful, it initially lacked the pinpoint accuracy required for bunker targets. It was deployed late in the war and {{had little effect on}} the Allied <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> against Germany.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{strategic}} <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> {{and individual}} raids of aerial warfare {{have been described}} as [...] "terror bombing" [...] by commentators and historians since the end of World War II, but because the term has pejorative connotations, others have denied that such <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> and raids are examples of [...] "terror bombing".|$|R

5|$|Airborne Interception radar, Mark IV, or AI Mk. IV for short, was the world's first {{operational}} air-to-air radar system. Early Mk. III units {{appeared in}} July 1940 on converted Bristol Blenheim light bombers, while the definitive Mk. IV reached widespread availability on the Bristol Beaufighter heavy fighter by early 1941. On the Beaufighter, the Mk. IV arguably {{played a role}} in ending the Blitz, the Luftwaffe's night <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> of late 1940 and early 1941.|$|E
5|$|Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Walmsley {{joined the}} Army Air Forces {{and spent the}} 1940s as an {{instructor}} pilot in the United States and Japan, but did not see combat. He was deployed with the 8th Bombardment Squadron to the Korean War, flying B-26 Invader aircraft. During this time, Walmsley volunteered for a risky <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign,</b> Operation Strangle.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the Necropolis station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was undamaged {{during the early stages}} of the <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign,</b> and services generally continued as normal.|$|E

The roof was almost completely destroyed by fire and there was substantial water damage. The statues above the rear entrance, on Klosterstraße, were also destroyed. Assessments estimated that 50% of {{the building}} had suffered damage.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} that selective pressure, controlled by Washington, combined with diplomatic overtures, would prevail and compel Hanoi to end its aggression. The military was still not satisfied, since, for the time being, the <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> was {{to be limited to}} targets below the 19th parallel, each of which would have to be cleared individually by the President and McNamara.|$|E

50|$|Strategic {{bombing in}} the post-Cold War era {{is defined by}} American {{advances}} in {{and the use of}} smart munitions. The developments in guided munitions meant that the Coalition forces in the First Gulf War were able to use them, although the majority - 93% - of bombs dropped in that conflict were still conventional, unguided bombs. More frequently in the Kosovo War, and the initial phases of Operation Iraqi Freedom of 2003, strategic <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> were notable for the heavy use of precision weaponry by those countries that possessed them. Although <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> were still strategic in their aims, the widespread area bombing tactics of World War II had mostly disappeared. This led to significantly fewer civilian casualties associated with previous <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns,</b> though it has not brought about a complete end to civilian deaths or collateral property damage.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the other}} <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> in Southeast Asia, the {{northern}} Laotian <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> within Barrel Roll {{would support a}} guerrilla force in action. U.S. Air Force and Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF) tactical air sorties directed by forward air controllers {{cleared the way for}} CIA-sponsored guerrillas commanded by General Vang Pao in their battle for the Plain of Jars. Among these campaigns were Operation Pigfat, Operation Raindance, Operation Off Balance, and Operation About Face. Joining the Ravens in this endeavor were the [...] "Tiger" [...] Fast FACs.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} {{debate over the}} {{morality}} of the air campaign against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies {{had gained}} air superiority over Germany, and bombings of German cities and {{industry}} had become commonplace. However, the Allies in their strategic <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> did not concentrate on industry, and Speer {{was able to}} overcome bombing losses. In spite of these losses, German production of tanks {{more than doubled in}} 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for Kriegsmarine submarines was reduced from one year to two months. Production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were {{defeated}} by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942. The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September. Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany {{and in an}} effort to destroy German morale many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets. Soon German aircraft production could not keep pace with losses and without air cover the Allied <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> became even more devastating. By targeting oil refineries and factories, they crippled the German war effort by late 1944.|$|E

5000|$|Operation Diver was the British codename for {{countermeasures}} {{against the}} V-1 flying <b>bomb</b> <b>campaign</b> {{launched by the}} German Luftwaffe in 1944 against London {{and other parts of}} Britain. [...] "Diver" [...] was the codename for the V-1 itself. Modes of defence used against V-1s included anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, and fighter aircraft; also double agents planted false information about the success of targeting. Anti-aircraft guns proved the most effective form of defence in the later stages of the campaign, with the aid of radar-based technology and the proximity fuse. The <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> ended by the middle of 1944.|$|R

5|$|In June, William Sullivan was {{replaced}} as ambassador by G. McMurtrie Godley, who immediately loosened {{the rules of}} engagement and increased the <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> in the north and northeast. The results were almost immediate. Nearly 50 {{percent of the population of}} the once heavily populated Plain of Jars had moved into refugee camps in the south. Refugee rolls for the Agency for International Development, which had averaged 130,000 between 1964 and 1968, jumped to 230,000 in February 1970.|$|E
5|$|Most {{notably the}} Saigon junta opposed US {{proposals}} to escalate {{the war with}} a large-scale <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> against North Vietnam, as advocated by the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. This plan called {{for the use of}} American resources badged as South Vietnamese. This was objected to {{on the grounds that it}} would lose moral capital for Saigon as they promoted their cause as just and compatible with the physical safety of fellow Vietnamese, as well as fears that it would provoke a communist land invasion from the north.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{approved}} a secret B-52 carpet <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> of North Vietnamese (and, later, allied Khmer Rouge) positions in Cambodia in March 1969 (code-named Operation Menu), {{without the consent}} of Cambodian leader Norodom Sihanouk. In mid-1969, Nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the North Vietnamese, sending a personal letter to North Vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in Paris. Initial talks, however, did not result in an agreement. In May 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all American troops from South Vietnam provided North Vietnam also did so and for South Vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with Viet Cong participation.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2000, {{one analyst}} (Yoram Schweitzer) saw {{a pause in}} <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> and argued that [...] "most of the groups that were {{involved}} in suicide terrorism either stopped using it or eventually reduced it significantly." ...|$|R

5|$|On 10 and 11 April 1994, {{during the}} Bosnian War, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes {{to protect the}} Goražde safe area, {{resulting}} in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction. This resulted in the taking of 150U.N. personnel hostage on 14April. On 16April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces. A two-week NATO <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign,</b> Operation Deliberate Force, began in August 1995 against the Army of the Republika Srpska, after the Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|Operation Overlord was {{the name}} {{assigned}} {{to the establishment of}} a large-scale lodgement on the Continent. The first phase, the amphibious invasion and establishment of a secure foothold, was codenamed Operation Neptune. To gain the air superiority needed to ensure a successful invasion, the Allies undertook a <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> (codenamed Operation Pointblank) that targeted German aircraft production, fuel supplies, and airfields. Elaborate deceptions, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, were undertaken {{in the months leading up}} to the invasion to prevent the Germans from learning the timing and location of the invasion.|$|E
5|$|The Allied <b>bombing</b> <b>campaign</b> {{was one of}} {{the main}} factors which {{influenced}} the Japanese government's decision to surrender in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over the morality of the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of atomic weapons is particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There are a number of other estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the first}} <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> {{utilizing}} primarily suicide attacks had considerable success. In the early 1980s Hezbollah used these bombing attacks targeting first foreign peacekeepers and then Israel. The result in both cases was withdrawal from Lebanon by the targets.|$|R
50|$|Japanese {{strategic}} bombing efforts mostly targeted large Chinese {{cities such}} as Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chongqing, with around 5,000 raids from February 1938 to August 1943 in the later case. Japan's strategic <b>bombing</b> <b>campaigns</b> devastated Chinese cities extensively, killing 260,000-350,934 non-combatants.|$|R
