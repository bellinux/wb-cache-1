5|$|The barrel was of {{one-piece}} forged construction, with uniform rifling (12 grooves, right-hand twist, one turn in 25 calibers). The <b>breech</b> end of {{the barrel}} was screwed into a <b>breech</b> ring. The <b>breech</b> mechanism was of vertical sliding-block type. The barrel was fitted with a hydrospring recoil system.|$|E

5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The gunner responsible for closing and locking the <b>breech</b> failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the <b>breech</b> before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this gunner had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the <b>breech</b> lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the <b>breech</b> was properly locked.|$|E

5000|$|A pair of <b>breeches</b> worn by George IV. The <b>breeches</b> {{are part}} of the royal wear section in the Costume & Textiles collection. They were made in 1827 and are hand {{stitched}} in green wool fabric. <b>Breeches</b> were worn in the 18th and early 19th century, but by 1810 trousers were becoming more popular. George IV preferred to wear <b>breeches</b> and banned trousers from court until 1815.|$|R
50|$|On a {{light vehicle}} with shafts, false <b>breeching</b> is {{sometimes}} fitted to the vehicle, {{instead of using}} harness <b>breeching.</b> A horizontal strap is attached between the shafts of the vehicle, just behind the animal. When the animal slows or goes downhill, the vehicle runs forward, pushing the false <b>breeching</b> against the haunches of the animal, which can then push backwards to slow the vehicle. False <b>breeching</b> is generally limited to use with well-trained, steady animals, because if the animal rears or falls {{there is a risk}} of the false <b>breeching</b> running up over its back. It is sometimes used to help show off the animal's haunches, which would be partly covered by harness <b>breeching.</b>|$|R

5|$|On 12 September 1920, Haruna was {{involved}} in gunnery drills off Hokkaidō when a <b>breech</b> explosion destroyed the starboard gun of the No.1 turret, killing seven men and badly damaging the armored roof of the turret. A later investigation by the Imperial Japanese Navy concluded that a faulty fuse ignited the gunpowder bags in the <b>breech,</b> detonating the shell while still in the barrel. The turret was repaired at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, where the elevation of her 14-inch guns was also increased by seven degrees. Three months later, she was once again placed in reserve.|$|E
5|$|Parsons, the Enola Gays weaponeer, was {{concerned}} about the possibility of an accidental detonation if the plane crashed on takeoff, so he decided not to load the four cordite powder bags into the gun <b>breech</b> until the aircraft was in flight. Parsons and his assistant, Second Lieutenant Morris R. Jeppson, made their way into the bomb bay along the narrow catwalk on the port side. Jeppson held a flashlight while Parsons disconnected the primer wires, removed the <b>breech</b> plug, inserted the powder bags, replaced the <b>breech</b> plug, and reconnected the wires. Before climbing to altitude on approach to the target, Jeppson switched the three safety plugs between the electrical connectors of the internal battery and the firing mechanism from green to red. The bomb was then fully armed. Jeppson monitored the bomb's circuits.|$|E
5000|$|The NWMP wore buff or steel grey <b>breeches</b> [...] {{until they}} adopted dark blue <b>breeches</b> with yellow-gold {{strapping}} (stripes). Members often exchanged kit with U.S. cavalry units, {{and while some}} believe this was the source for the <b>breeches,</b> the NWMP considered adopting blue <b>breeches</b> with a white strap. Dark blue with yellow-gold strapping is a British cavalry tradition, and most cavalry (later armoured) regiments' dress uniforms feature yellow stripes.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>breeches</b> role (also pants role or trouser role, travesti or [...] "Hosenrolle") {{is a role}} {{in which}} an actress appears in male clothing. <b>Breeches</b> ( [...] , also [...] "britches"), tight-fitting knee-length pants, were the {{standard}} male garment at the time <b>breeches</b> roles were introduced.|$|R

5|$|The <b>breech</b> {{refers to}} the mass of solid metal behind {{the bottom of the}} bore {{extending}} {{to the base of the}} <b>breech</b> and including the base ring; it also generally {{refers to the}} end of the cannon opposite the muzzle, i.e., the location where the explosion of the gunpowder begins as opposed to the opening through which the pressurized gas escapes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Breeches</b> may be {{front or}} side zip. Some {{competitors}} believe the side-zip {{to give a}} cleaner appearance and to be more flattering. Styles are also developing to parallel trends in street clothing, including low-rise <b>breeches</b> and brightly colored and patterned <b>breeches</b> & jodhpurs that are aimed primarily at children.|$|R
5|$|The {{weakness}} of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the <b>breech.</b> All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid propellant into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell {{out of the front}} of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the <b>breech</b> or that the <b>breech</b> will break. This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. Warriors Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5in (118mm) armor of Gloire, while sometimes the screw which closed the <b>breech</b> flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1911, {{the ship}} {{suffered}} {{an explosion in}} one of her 12-inch guns when it failed to fire during gunnery practice. After some time passed, the <b>breech</b> was opened and ignited the propellant; the resulting fire killed 16 crewmen and several officers.|$|E
5|$|The gun {{was only}} {{initially}} {{known as the}} 41cm/45 3rd Year Type naval gun before it was redesignated as the 40cm/45 3rd Year Type naval gun on 29 March 1922 {{to comply with the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty which forbade guns larger than 40.6cm (16in). Third year type refers to the Welin <b>breech</b> block on which design began in 1914, the third year of the Taishō period. This <b>breech</b> block design was also used on the 20cm (7.9 inch), 15.5cm (6.1 inch), 14cm (5.5 inch), 12.7cm (5 inch), and 12cm (4.7 inch) naval guns.|$|E
50|$|Rhinegraves are {{a form of}} <b>breeches</b> {{which were}} popular from the early 1660s until the mid-1670s in Western Europe. They were very full {{petticoat}} <b>breeches</b> gathered at the knee. They were worn under petticoat <b>breeches</b> or under an overskirt which was decorated with ribbon loops around the waist and around the knee. Where the knee was gathered, a large frill of lace and stocking tops added further decoration.During the 1670s as the longer coat and long waistcoat became popular, these very full <b>breeches</b> became less full and by the late 1670s and early 1680s they were replaced by more tight fitting <b>breeches</b> with the stockings worn over them.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pants are}} {{petticoat}} <b>breeches</b> or gregüescos normally short and wide, fitted at middle thigh, and tight Spanish <b>breeches</b> fitted under the knee.|$|R
50|$|As coats became cutaway, more {{attention}} {{was paid to}} the cut and fit of the <b>breeches.</b> <b>Breeches</b> fitted snugly and had a fall-front opening.|$|R
5|$|The {{older and}} more-stable forms of cannon were muzzle-loading {{as opposed to}} breech-loading— {{in order to be}} used they had to have their {{ordnance}} packed down the bore through the muzzle rather than inserted through the <b>breech.</b>|$|E
5|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of a hollow metal tube attached to a tripod, with a rudimentary <b>breech</b> at one end. Rounds were fired {{with the use of}} black powder ignited by a standard musket percussion cap, and it had an effective range of between 100 and 150 yards. Although it was cheap and easy to manufacture, it did have several problems; it was difficult to move and the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenades it used as one type of ammunition had a tendency to break inside the <b>breech,</b> damaging the weapon and injuring the crew. Production began in late 1940, and by the beginning of 1943 nearly 19,000 were in service. Like many obsolete Home Guard weapons, it was eventually replaced by other weapons, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|Between 135 and 250 {{men of the}} 5th Regiment, Maryland National Guard mustered {{at their}} armory {{on the corner of}} Fifth and Front streets. Each man was {{equipped}} with full uniform, a Springfield <b>breech</b> loading rifle, and twenty rounds of ammunition. At 7:00pm the group began its march toward Camden Station, with the intention to board a train to Cumberland.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} decade saw Spanish <b>breeches</b> as {{the most}} popular. These were stiff <b>breeches</b> which fell above or just below the knee and were rather moderately fitted. By the mid-1650s, in Western Europe, much looser, uncollected <b>breeches,</b> called petticoat <b>breeches</b> became the most popular. As the 1650s progressed, they became larger and looser, very much giving {{the impression of a}} lady's petticoat. They were usually decorated with many yards of ribbon around the waist and around the ungathered knee {{on the outside of the}} leg. Alongside the petticoat <b>breeches,</b> a collected but still loose fitted <b>breeches</b> called rhinegraves, were also worn. By the early 1660s, their popularity surpassed petticoat <b>breeches.</b> They were usually worn with an overskirt over them. The overskirt was heavily decorated with ribbon on the waist and the bottom of the skirt. Its length was usually just above the knee, but could also extend past the knee so that the rhinegraves underneath could not be seen and only the bottom of the stocking-tops was visible.|$|R
5000|$|Gentlemen wear scarlet {{or black}} hunt coat, either {{ordinary}} pattern or cut away. White <b>breeches</b> must be worn with scarlet coat and boots with tops and white garter straps. White <b>breeches</b> with black patent top boots may be worn with black coats or coloured <b>breeches</b> and plain black boots. Top hat to be worn.|$|R
50|$|Before the 18th century, European men wore <b>breeches</b> and hose. In Tudor times, these <b>breeches</b> were loose-fitting, {{but by the}} 1660s, tight <b>breeches</b> were fashionable. These were popularised by Frenchmen at {{the court}} of Louis XIII, {{as part of the}} three piece suit that also {{included}} a type of frock coat called a Justacorps, a tricorne hat, a powdered wig, and a long waistcoat. During the Restoration era, the tighter <b>breeches</b> were introduced to England, and the rest of Europe, because the cut was deemed more flattering to the leg.|$|R
