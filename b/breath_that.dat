25|$|Deianira feared {{she would}} lose Heracles {{to the younger}} and more {{beautiful}} Iole. Years earlier, the centaur Nessus had ferried her across the river Evenus and attempted to rape her when {{they were on the}} other side. Heracles saved her from Nessus by shooting him with poisoned arrows. She had kept some of Nessus' blood for the centaur told her in his dying <b>breath</b> <b>that</b> if she were to give Heracles a cloak (chiton) soaked in his blood, it would be a love charm. Deianira, being concerned by Heracles' infidelity, believed Nessus’ lie that Heracles would no longer desire any other woman after he was under the spell of the love philter. This seemed like the perfect solution to her problem to reclaim her husband's love from him Iole, the foreign concubine. The cloak was delivered to Heracles and when he put it on the poison went into his body. Deianira had unwittingly poisoned her husband with this purported love potion because of her sadness over her husband's unfaithfulness. Upon realizing the mistake she had made, Deianira then killed herself. Because of his love for his concubine Iole, Heracles asked his eldest son, Hyllus to marry her so that she would be well taken care of. Iole and Hyllus had a son called Cleodaeus, and also three daughters, Evaechme, Aristaechme, and Hyllis.|$|E
500|$|Other lung {{function}} tests include spirometry, measuring the amount (volume) {{and flow of}} air that can be inhaled and exhaled. The maximum volume of <b>breath</b> <b>that</b> can be exhaled is called the vital capacity. In particular, how much a person is able to exhale in one second (called forced expiratory volume (FEV1) {{as a proportion of}} how much they are able to exhale in total (FEV). This ratio, the FEV1/FEV ratio, is important to distinguish whether a lung disease is restrictive or obstructive. Another test is that of the lung's [...] diffusing capacity – this {{is a measure of the}} transfer of gas from air to the blood in the lung capillaries.|$|E

He has {{referred}} to himself as [...] "...too individualistic to be either right-wing or left-wing," [...] describing himself in 1974 as [...] "a political nothing" [...] and [...] "a moderate" [...] and in 1997 as a [...] "libertarian."

2500|$|While Dongalor {{activates}} the Eye of Gulga Grymna, Kröd and Longshaft fight {{each other}} with swords. Longshaft nearly kills Kröd, but Grimshank jumps {{in front of the}} blow and dies, telling Kröd with his dying <b>breath</b> <b>that</b> he remains unconvinced Kröd is the golden one. Longshaft becomes disarmed, but Kröd can't bring himself to kill an unarmed man; when Longshaft pulls out a secret dagger and tries to stab him, Aneka throws a sai into his chest and kills him: however, Ralph [...] "remains classy to the end". Kröd confronts Dongalor, who reveals he is Kröd's brother-in-law, having married (and divorced) Kröd's crazy estranged sister. With the Eye of Gulga Grymna about to explode, Kröd shoves Dongalor and Barnabus aside, accidentally knocking them out a window. Following advice from the disembodied voice of his deceased mentor Arcadius (Roger Allam), Kröd stabs the Eye with his flaming sword, destroying it. Aneka embraces Kröd, although a voice-over narrator reveals she will continue her promiscuous ways. Dongalor and Barnabus have survived by falling into a tree, while Dongalor's bastard son, having survived his father's suicidal task (going on a fishing boat to the middle of a lake with lots of rocks in his pockets knowing he can't swim), pelts them with rocks, and starts chopping down the tree they're in for revenge (the cleverness of which impresses Dongalor enough for him to declare the boy his heir).|$|E

40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the location of}} the breathing movement and its relationship to stress levels. Sixty-three Ball State students voluntarily participated by completing the A-State and A-Trait forms of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Under the pretense that they would be questioned about music later, each participant also listened to preselected music for about 4 minutes in both seated and reclining positions. The participants were unaware that their breathing was being observed. During the listening portion of the study from behind a one-way mirror, 3 trained observers rated each breath as either thoracic or non-thoracic. The percentage of total <b>breaths</b> <b>that</b> were thoracic was calculated for each subject in both positions. Interrater reliability was determined inadequate for data of participants in the reclining position. The scores on the STAI and the percentage of thoracic breaths were the variables analyzed. A Pearson R correlation was then used to test the hypotheses. Null hypothesis 1, that there is no relationship between percentage of total <b>breaths</b> <b>that</b> are thoracic in a seated position and scores for AState, was upheld. Also, no relationship was found between percentage of total <b>breaths</b> <b>that</b> are thoracic in a seated position and scores for A-Trait, therefore, null hypothesis 2 was also upheld. This study also found that 71 % of the participants breathing style is primarily thoracic. These findings and procedural effects on the outcome as well as implications for further research were discussed. Fisher Institute for WellnessThesis (M. S. ...|$|R
