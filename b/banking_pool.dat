In 1990 Tapie purchased Adidas for nearly 1.6 billion francs. He took up a loan unionized with a <b>banking</b> <b>pool</b> with a majority of foreign banks (German and Japanese banks for the main part), and in minority from French backers, in particular with the SdBO, the subsidiary of Crédit Lyonnais group hidden for several years.

The Tapie group also tried to dabble in the online poker world when they tried to acquire Full Tilt Poker. However, they were not able to negotiate a successful deal with the United States Department of Justice, and the deal fell through.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} borrower quality {{and the structure of}} the pool of banks. First, we develop a theoretical model where the size of the <b>banking</b> <b>pool</b> is a credible signal of firm quality. We argue that better borrowers seek to disclose their quality in a credible way through the structure of the <b>banking</b> <b>pool</b> involving fewer banks. Second, we test our prediction using a sample of more than 3, 000 loans from 19 European countries. We perform regressions of the number of bank lenders on various proxies of borrower quality. Our empirical tests corroborate the theoretical predictions. The size of the <b>banking</b> <b>pool</b> is a signal of borrower quality. Hence, good quality firms have fewer lenders in their banking pools...|$|E

Penalties and fouls are similar to one pocket in that the player committing the foul must spot a ball for each foul. This must be done before the incoming player shoots.|$|R
