5000|$|For example, {{transparent}} ceramic armor {{consisting of}} a lightweight composite has been formed by utilizing a face plate of transparent alumina Al2O3 (or magnesia MgO) with a <b>back-up</b> <b>plate</b> of transparent plastic. The two plates (bonded together with a transparent adhesive) afford complete ballistic protection against 0.30 AP M2 projectiles at 0Â° obliquity with a muzzle velocity of 2770 ft per second.Another transparent composite armor provided complete protection for small arms projectiles {{up to and including}} caliber [...]50 AP M2 projectiles consisting of two or more layers of transparent ceramic material.|$|E
40|$|Delamination is {{considered}} as {{a major problem in}} drilling of composite materials, which degrades the mechanical properties of these materials. The thrust force exerted by the drill {{is considered}} as the major cause of delamination; and one practical approach to reduce delamination is to use a <b>back-up</b> <b>plate</b> under the specimen. In this paper, the effect of exit support plate on delamination in twist drilling of glass fiber reinforced composites is studied. Firstly, two analytical models based on linear fracture mechanics and elastic bending theory of plates are described to find critical thrust forces at the beginning of crack growth for drilling with and without <b>back-up</b> <b>plate.</b> Secondly, two series of experiments are carried out on glass fiber reinforced composites to determine quantitatively the effect of drilling parameters on the amount of delamination. Experimental findings verify a large reduction in the amount of delaminated area when a <b>back-up</b> <b>plate</b> is placed under the specimen...|$|E
40|$|An {{atmosphere}} {{sample is}} described {{which includes a}} very thin filter element with straight-through holes {{on the order of}} 1 micron. A sample of air with particles to be examined is driven by means of a pressurized low molecular weight gas, e. g., He to the filter element front side. A partial vacuum may be present at {{the back side of the}} filter element. The pressure differential across the filter element is just below the rupture point of the filter element. Particles smaller than filter holes are deposited on the filter element. When using a filter element of plastic material of a thickness on the order of 10 microns, a stainless steel <b>back-up</b> <b>plate</b> and a diffusion member are used to support the filter element when subjected to a pressure differential on the order of a few hundred atmospheres...|$|E
40|$|To {{maximize}} {{performance in}} starved, multiplate cells, the cell design should rely on techniques which widen the volume tolerance characteristics. These involve engineering capillary pressure {{differences between the}} components of an electrochemical cell and using these forces to promote redistribution of electrolyte to the desired optimum values. This can be implemented in practice by prescribing pore size distributions for porous <b>back-up</b> <b>plates,</b> reservoirs, and electrodes. In addition, electrolyte volume management can be controlled by incorporating different pore size distributions into the separator. In a nickel/hydrogen cell, the separator must contain pores similar in size to the small pores of both the nickel and hydrogen electrodes {{in order to maintain}} an optimum conductive path for the electrolyte. The pore size distributions of all components should overlap {{in such a way as}} to prevent drying of the separator and/or flooding of the hydrogen electrode...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} information about average annual {{use of the}} following automotive lighting equipment by U. S. drivers: low- and high-beam headlamps, turn signals, <b>back-up,</b> license <b>plate,</b> parking, sidemarker, stop, and tail lamps. The data were collected {{as part of a}} naturalistic field study of crash warning systems. Eighty-seven randomly selected drivers from southeastern Michigan were provided with instrumented research vehicles (11 identical 2003 Nissan Altimas) for periods averaging 26 days and instructed to drive the research vehicle in place of their personal vehicle. The results are presented for each lamp type in terms of the average annual hours of use and minutes used per 100 km driven. These findings are discussed in relation to the rated life of various bulbs and the median life of vehicles in the U. S...|$|R
5000|$|Bateman clubbed 22 {{home runs}} for the Modesto Colts in 1962, and made the Colt [...]45s out of spring {{training}} the following season as Jim Campbell's <b>back-up</b> behind the <b>plate.</b> Campbell, however, sputtered, and soon lost his starting job to Bateman. On May 17, , Bateman caught the first ever no-hitter in Houston franchise history. Don Nottebart held the Philadelphia Phillies hitless in a 4-1 Astro win. For the season, Bateman batted [...]210 while leading his team with ten home runs and 59 runs batted in.|$|R
