40|$|Seven {{species of}} native Missouri River {{cyprinids}} {{have been reduced}} in abundance by 70 to 98 %. Several have been extirpated from the reach upstream from Gavins Point Dam. The reasons for the decline are most likely the alteration of sediment dynamics due to dam construction, the elimination of <b>bankful</b> discharge, {{and the elimination of}} critical habitats, such as sandbars and off-channel areas...|$|E
40|$|When {{mountain}} streams receive inputs {{of sediment}} from slope failure, normal downstream trends {{in size and}} sorting may be interrupted. The persistence of these impacts {{in time and space}} will depend on the sediment. The purpose of this project was to describe and explain how stream substrates vary with distance downstream of slope failures in ten steepland drainages or central Oregon Coast Range. Particle sizes and <b>bankful</b> channel morphology were assessed at 248 transects along 151 kilometres of streams. These drainages differ in lithology, geologic structure, modes and rates of slope [...] ...|$|E
40|$|On {{relatively}} high natural levees in the Dinkel valley {{a specific type}} of grassland is found: the Diantho-Armerietum (Dinkel pastures). This plant community is best developed on dry, nutrient-poor, sandy and relatively young soils. Occasional floodingis essential to the conservation and restoration of Dinkel pastures. The altitude above the <b>bankful</b> discharge water-level is of great importance. The lower zone is strongly influenced by the nutrient-rich surface water, the higher zones are vulnerable tosoil acidification. Maintaining the current flooding frequency is favourable to the conservation of existing Dinkel pastures; a higher frequency favours the development of new ones...|$|E
40|$|The paleoflood {{history of}} the lower Salt River was {{documented}} using slackwater sedimentation techniques. Slackwater sediments are finegrained alluvial deposits which accumulate in zones of ineffective flow along the margins of flood channels. The tops of slackwater deposits {{can be used as}} a proxy for the water surface of the flood responsible for their deposition. Slackwater deposits used in this study also included post-abandonment fill in ancient Hohokam Indian irrigation canals. Paleodischarges were estimated using the HEC-II water-surface profile computer model. Cross-section information for the prehistoric Salt River channel was derived from a 1904 contour map of the Salt River Valley. This study is the first application of the slackwater technique to an alluvial river. Flood deposits dating from 1100 years before present to 1976 were analyzed. HEC-II modelling indicates that 27 floods during that time period exceeded the <b>bankful</b> discharge of 175, 000 cfs (5000 cms). Two floods exceeded 420, 000 cfs (11, 900 cms). One of these large floods occurred around A. D. 890. The other occurred within the past 410 years. The largest flood of the historical era was the February, 1891 flood which had a peak discharge of 260, 000 cfs (7400 cms). The findings of this study compare favorably with previous studies of the paleohydrology of the Salt River...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe stage-discharge {{rating curve}} {{is widely used}} in the {{research}} for analysis of flow regime and design of hydraulic structure and river channel. To develop the reliable stage-discharge rating curve, numerous discharge data from the lowest to <b>bankful</b> stage should be observed {{over a long period}} of time. The river environment and topography of Nakdong River in Korea has been changed drastically due to the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project from the end of 2009 to 2012. Moreover, 8 weirs were built dividing the main river into nine sectors and it led the discontinuous flow and backwater effect for each sector. In such situations, the stage-discharge rating curve should be re-determined with new data for the changed topography and flow characteristics. However, it takes long time to get the new stage-discharge rating curve. In this study, the alternative stage-discharge rating curve was developed using the Hydraulic Performance Graph (HPG). HPG is a plot summarizing all the backwater profile for all possible discharge at a channel reach based on the flow equation that is derived from the energy equation. In this study, the 26 cross sections up to a length of 12. 3 km located between Gangjung weir and Dalsung weir in Nakdong River after the project were measured. The HPG for this sector was created. Using the results of discharge and water surface elevation from the HPG, the alternative stage-discharge rating curve was created. Then the discharge from the rating curve was compared with measured data from the several cross sections. The discharge from the rating curve matched the measured data quite well. The alternative stage-discharge rating curve suggested in this study has high applicability for analysis of flow regime and design of hydraulic structure and river channel in drastic environmental changes of the river systems before creating a new stage-discharge rating curve which requires long term measurement data...|$|E
40|$|Sounding of the {{sea floor}} in front of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica {{recently}} revealed large persistent patterns of longitudinal megaflutes and drumlinoid forms, which are interpreted to have formed at the base of ice streams during the list glacial advance. The flutes bear remarkable resemblance to longitudinal grooves and highly elongated streamlined islands found on the floors of some large martian channels, called outflow channels. ln addition, other similarities exist between Antarctic ice streams and outflow channels. Ice streams are 30 to 80 km wide and hundreds of kilometers long, as are the martian channels. Ice stream beds are below sea level. Floors of many martian outflow channels lie below martian datum, which may have been close to or below past martian sea levels. The Antarctic ice stream bed gradient is flat and locally may go uphill, and surface slopes are exceptionally low. So are gradients of martian channels. The depth to the bed in ice streams is 1 to 1. 5 km. At <b>bankful</b> stage, the depth of the fluid in outflow channels would have been 1 to 2 km. These similarities suggest that the martian outflow channels, whose origin is commonly attributed to gigantic catastrophic floods, were locally filled by ice that left a conspicuous morphologic imprint. Unlike the West-Antarctic-ice streams, which discharge ice from an ice sheet, ice in the martian channels came from water erupting from the ground. In the cold martian environment, this water, if of moderate volume, would eventually freeze. Thus it may have formed icings on springs, ice dams and jams on constrictions in the channel path, or frozen pools. Given sufficient thickness and downhill surface gradient, these ice masses would have moved; and given the right conditions, they could have moved like Antarctic ice streams...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies of}} ice streams in Antarctica reveal a {{mechanism}} of basal motion that may apply to channels and valleys on Mars. The mechanism is sliding {{of the ice}} on deformable water-saturated till under high pore pressures. It has been suggested by Lucchitta that ice was present in outflow channels on Mars and gave them their distinctive morphology. This ice may have slid like Antarctic ice streams but on rubbly weathering products rather than till. However, to generate water under high pore pressures, elevated heatflow is needed to melt {{the base of the}} ice. Either volcanism or higher heatflow more than 2 b. y. ago could have raised the basal temperature. Regarding valley networks, higher heatflow 3 b. y. ago could have allowed sliding of ice-saturated overburden at a few hundred meters depth. If the original, pristine valleys were somewhat deeper than they are now, they could have formed by the same mechanism. Recent sounding of the seafloor in front of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica reveals large persistent patterns of longitudinal megaflutes and drumlinoid forms, which bear remarkable resemblance to longitudinal grooves and highly elongated streamlined islands found on the floors of martian outflow channels. The flutes are interpreted to have formed at the base of ice streams during the last glacial advance. Additional similarities of Antarctic ice streams with martian outflow channels are apparent. Antarctic ice streams are 30 to 80 km wide and hundreds of kilometers long. Martian outflow channels have similar dimensions. Ice stream beds are below sea level. Carr determined that most common floor elevations of martian outflow channels lie below martian datum, which may have been close to or below past martian sea levels. The Antarctic ice stream bed gradient is flat and locally may go uphill, and surface slopes are exceptionally. Martian channels also have floor gradients that are shallow or go uphill locally and have low surface gradients. The depth to the bed in ice streams is 1 to 1. 5 km. At <b>bankful</b> stage, the depth of the fluid in outflow channels was 1 to 2 km, according to the height of bordering scarps. The similarity between Antarctic ice streams and martian outflow channels suggests that ice may have flowed through and shaped the outflow channels, and that perhaps the mechanism of motion of Antarctic ice streams also operated in outflow channels. In addition, sliding on deformable rubble may explain the formation of small valley networks. The large Siple Coast Antarctic ice streams are thought to slide over longitudinally grooved, deforming till, where much of the movement is within the till. The till is saturated with water at high pore pressures that nearly supports all of the weight of the ice. The small differential between overburden pressure and pore pressure at the bed {{is more important than the}} volume of water, but water needs to be supplied to the till interface. For pore pressures to remain high, the ice streams have to act as a seal that blocks the flow of water through them, and the rock underneath has to be of low permeability to prevent the water from draining away...|$|E
40|$|That {{the highest}} runoff events occur in arid regions {{is well known}} and proved among others by the works of CRIPPEN & BUE (1977) and COSTA (1987) for arid and {{semiarid}} regions in the U. S. Such studies are not known for the Central Sahara. Looking at the processes of fluvial morphodynamics in different time slices, this thesis attempts to fill this gap. The data base was created within the DFG project "Quaternary landscape evolution and current morphodynamics in the central Sahara (NE Niger). " The work took place in 2005 and 2006 {{in the area of}} the Central Sahara. The selected study site is a small catchment with the name "Seeterrassental". It is located in the south Central Sahara (approx. 22 ° 21 ' N, 12 ° 42 ' E), in the northeastern part of the Republic of Niger. Within the framework of a methodological experiment, different data are used to provide the needed information on fluvial morphodynamics, especially of the rainfall-runoff behavior: Analysis of the actual state The analysis of climate data shows that a good description of the current situation is possible for the macro scale of the Central Sahara. Regionalization can be carried out on the existing data. Due to the data quality a precise climatic characterization on the local scale is difficult. A clarification of the rainfall source for the region around the Seeterassental, for example, is not possible. It is not sure whether the precipitation comes from the westerlies system or the monsoonal system. A detailed documentation of the geomorphological situation is especially needed on the scale of Seeterrassental for process understanding. Even though it is a mapping of the current situation, information about past states or processes are included. The different terrace levels along the stream, for example, show information that does not meet with the present day’s processes. Review of palaeo-situation The evaluation of the palaeoenvironmental situation with the experiment is carried out largely by an intensive literature analysis. Here, an overview of the palaeoclimate of the western and central Sahara can be given, providing information since the glacial maximum. Although these informations are mainly available as point data, they are relatively well distributed over the entire region. Based on the available information the interactions between global climate system parameters and palaeoenvironmental conditions for the considered region can be derived. Data base generation A detailed recording of the stream-morphologic parameters and the derivation of the hydraulic discharge calculations after Manning-Strickler and Costa provide the database. It should be noted that the runoff information is "only" valid for peak discharge (Costa approach, Qmax) respectively <b>bankful</b> discharge events (Manning-Strickler approach). A consistent data set is generated along the entire channel for different terrace levels. A clear separation into a current flood bed (within the meaning of up to a few hundred years old) and two old terrace level is possible. The runoff calculations of current flood bed and the discharge calculation of the two older palaeo-channel generations (T 1 and T 2) show an insight into the flow patterns of the small catchment of the Seeterrassental. A rough chronology for the Seeterrassental can be build up based on the datings by GRUNERT (1983) and BRAUNECK (2010), which can be validated using the results of the literature analysis. Modeling and evaluation of the results The hydraulic discharge calculations according to Manning-Strickler and Costa build the center of the semidistributiv-conceptual model (HEC-HMS). The goal is to reconstruct, based on measured fluvial forms, the precipitation that has led to the formation of these forms. By the chosen methodological structure detailed results for the different channel generations of the Seeterrassental catchment can be calculated and thus the effective precipitation can be reconstructed for the catchment area. The climate date analysis, especially the size frequency analysis, shows that the modeled effective precipitation for the current flood bed is within a plausible range of values. A comparison between the iteratively modeled effective precipitation of the current flood bed with the measured climate station data of surrounding stations show a good consistence. Such a validation is not possible for the two older palaeochannel generation (T 1 and T 2), since there are no measured comparative data. In this case the plausibility control of the results occurs by the literature analysis. The effective palaeoprecipitation values derived from the rainfall-runoff modeling can be considered as plausible. These values have the advantage that they are based on a statistical rainfall-runoff relationship and not like palaeoclimate models on statistical relationships for global atmospheric circulation patterns. In addition, the iteratively modeled effective precipitation is calculated for the study area of the Seeterrassental and thus provides more accurate information than previously available. For the genesis of the different terrace generations following diachronic scenario can be drawn: The palaeochannel corresponding to the terrace level T 2 developed in the mid-Holocene wet phase following a slack water phase. High flood events caused by the outbreak of the former slack water areas may have involved the forming of this first channel phase. There are two hypotheses for the forming of the palaeochannel corresponding to the terrace level T 1 : 1. The incision in the existing channel bed T 2 occurred in a short Late Holocene wet phase (for example 3. 5 to 4 ka B. P.); 2. The incision in the existing channel bed T 2 occurred only with a little time lag to the actual incision of the channel T 2, so in the outgoing mid-Holocene wet phase (up to 5. 7 ka B. P.). In any case, the channel system is set to the potentially higher precipitation of the middle or late Holocene and shows a change in relation to the current channel outflow dynamics. The runoff-precipitation behavior of the current flood bed largely corresponds to the expectations of the few measurements in the region...|$|E
