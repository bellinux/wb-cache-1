50|$|At {{the north}} end of this row is 425 River Street, a {{narrower}} 1892 five-story building showing later influences, with a corbeled brick cornice and molded pediment. The top floor windows are arched; a brick pilaster comes up from beneath to create a rounded arcade. A decorative <b>brick</b> <b>course</b> as well as molded string runs around the building. To its north are two smaller buildings, dating to around 1910, the newest buildings in the district.|$|E
50|$|A mix {{between a}} {{warehouse}} style, {{and a light}} commercial style, the Startup Candy Factory has two stories and a basement. The southern portion of the structure is fairly plain with no decorative elements adorning the outside, it displays an asymmetrical facade. The middle section is more decorative, with a Roman arched door bay and a stone belt course, as well as recessed brick panels encasing window and door bays. The northern section has a corbled <b>brick</b> <b>course</b> along the second level.|$|E
50|$|At the springline of the arches another <b>brick</b> <b>course</b> {{sets off}} the stone, with the brick above it laid in a basketweave pattern. The arches {{themselves}} are segmental, consisting of four vertically laid headers. Above them another projecting stretcher course ends the basketweave, topped by vertical stretchers, {{two rows of}} projecting stretchers, two rows of stretchers and finally a top row of projecting stretchers below a stone cornice. The otherwise flat roof has a hipped section {{in the front of}} the main block behind the pavilion.|$|E
50|$|The {{restrained}} facade is {{countered by}} a decorative peaked parapet above the semicircular window. It {{starts with a}} band of terra cotta panels in alternating circular and foliate motifs between sawtooth <b>brick</b> <b>courses.</b> Above them is a corbeled tier, with similar features serving as end brackets.|$|R
50|$|Craftsmen {{use them}} to mark {{clapboard}} and <b>brick</b> <b>courses</b> so that, for example, a course ends neatly below a window sill or at a door's architrave. They are used in remodelling so that, for example, the new coursing of exterior siding on a wing will match the existing.|$|R
5000|$|Beneath Springfield Road in Swindon, the disused Midland and South Western Junction Railway has {{a complex}} bridge {{consisting}} of a normal arch and a skew arch butted together; the <b>brick</b> <b>courses</b> in the roof change from normal to helical approximately {{two-thirds of the way}} through. This accommodates a road junction above.|$|R
50|$|The western {{elevation}} {{is protected}} by a single storeyed skillion roofed verandah supported on square sectioned timber columns. The northern end of the verandah is infilled with horizontal timber weatherboards. The face of the western wall has six vertical sash four paned windows, symmetrically arranged flanking a centrally located doorway. The rendered sills of the window sit on a projecting <b>brick</b> <b>course</b> supported on brick corbels. The arched brick window surrounds are outlined with a projecting course of bricks. The base of the wall is rendered to {{the underside of the}} brick window sill corbels, and a three tier brick string course runs along the wall at mid-height.|$|E
50|$|The W. B. Davis Hosiery Mill (also {{known as}} the Alabama Builders' Hardware Manufacturing Company Complex) is a {{historic}} industrial complex in Fort Payne, Alabama. The mill opened in 1884, {{in the midst of}} Fort Payne's economic boom, manufacturing building hardware & supplies. The main building, which features Colonial Revival details, is three stories tall, and 12-over-12 sash windows on each floor. An 85-foot (26-meter) chimney has a flared top and corbeled <b>brick</b> <b>course,</b> imitating a doric order column. By 1890, promises of plentiful and high-quality iron ore and other minerals were proven to be exaggerated. Eight of the largest manufacturers in town (including the A.B.H.M.C.) merged in a failed effort to avoid bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|The tower, {{which has}} 13th-century {{foundations}} of flint and rubble has been rebuilt above {{the level of}} the eaves in red brick in the mid 17th century. At the lower level is the western portal with a depressed Tudor arch, recently restored, above which rises a traceried window framed by a <b>brick</b> <b>course.</b> The tower rises in two stages, the first having a square-topped mullioned window in the Tudor style. The belfry level has a large rounded-headed opening with Classical details, including rusticated voussoirs, Ionic pilasters and a brick entablature. The tower is topped by a crenelated parapet, and pinnacles in the Tudor style dating from the 19th century. The tower holds a ring of six bells dating from 1614.|$|E
50|$|The Church of England parish {{church of}} St James, built in 1859 of brick and flint, is towards the {{southern}} end of the village. It was designed by architect, Samuel Sanders Teulon.

50|$|At Beverley Road, Willerby & Kirk Ella, North Cave and Wallingfen were two-storey {{buildings}} with the upper storey accessing the embanked track. Stations {{were built in}} the English Queen Anne revival style - with decorative external <b>brick</b> <b>courses</b> between floors and brick lintels; minor embellishments on other brick structures such as bridge buttresses roughly echoed the same style.|$|R
50|$|The {{school is}} two stories {{along the street}} elevation, with a flat-roofed brick facade accented by {{horizontal}} recessed <b>brick</b> <b>courses.</b> The main entry is a recessed by extending {{to the line of}} the second floor window heads, ornamented with six small relief sculptures above in the brickwork. Glass block lines the inset bay. An arched gymnasium extends to the rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} a {{cruciform}} plan with gable ends and a campanile {{to the northwest}} corner. Large in size, it is built of brick around a steel frame and has pitched roofs of grey pantiles. The gables and walls are edged with concrete slabs; the steel members are expressed in brick and topped with concrete blocks. The nave has four bays to each side before the crossing, three have round-headed windows which each feature a cross. The north, west and south facades have high and large round windows, with cross-shaped intersections. The west front entrance is framed with a curved protruding <b>brick</b> <b>course.</b> Set inside is concrete textured panel and below, a triple set of round-headed windows.

This is supported on timber posts.|$|R
50|$|The {{brickwork}} is banded with sandstone {{courses to}} the 1899 section, and beige <b>brick</b> <b>courses</b> to the later addition. These courses run {{above and below}} the windows, and a deep band of blue-grey brick runs {{around the base of the}} entire building. The windows to the upper level have flat arches with splayed brick voussoirs (excepting to the toilet bay). The ground floor windows have square heads with sandstone lintels and keystones to the 1899 section, and splayed brick lintels to the newer section. All openings to the west are protected with corrugated iron sunshades on timber brackets.|$|R
50|$|Three narrow Gothic lancet windows {{resting on}} a brownstone course are evenly spaced across the front, with a roundel high above. The {{roofline}} {{is marked by a}} corbelled cornice with a metal Latin cross at the gable's apex. The main entrance, {{at the foot of the}} bell tower, has double wooden doors, each with a St. Andrew's cross in the lower corner, set in a Gothic arch surrounded with three <b>brick</b> <b>courses.</b> A louvered, recessed Gothic arch marks the bell stage of the tower, which then gives way after brief corbels to the spire, topped with another cross.|$|R
50|$|The roof is slope {{is under}} Horsham stone. Two brick-built {{chimneys}} {{can be seen}} rising above the roof-line. The northern chimney is original, built {{as part of the}} c. 1575 house comprising a rectangular stack with roll-moulded <b>brick</b> <b>courses</b> reducing the wider base at intervals towards {{the upper part of the}} stack. On the north side, the stack has three sections separated by recess detail. The capping courses have been rebuilt and an additional stack added to the rear. Only two flues remain active, indicated by the pair of modern chimney pots on the east side of the stack.|$|R

50|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} Brick Expressionism is the liveliness of its facades, achieved purely through the deliberate setting of bricks in patterns. This helped to enliven large, otherwise monotonous, walls. In some cases, even brick wasters (pieces {{that had been}} damaged during firing, or had been fired too long, or not long enough, leading to uneven or undesired colouring) were used as decorative elements, exploiting their individual appearance. The angular bricks were combined in various arrangements, creating a rich ornamental repertoire, including specific forms of sculpture. Horizontal <b>brick</b> <b>courses</b> that alternate between protruding and being slightly recessed are another common feature, e.g. on the Hans-Sachs-Haus in Gelsenkirchen (1927).|$|R
40|$|SIM is an {{innovative}} building system for mortar-less walls. It utilises a special method of interlocking SIM bricks that allows relative sliding of <b>brick</b> <b>courses</b> in-plane {{of a wall}} and prevents out-of-plane relative movement of bricks. One of its structural applications is in multistorey frame buildings as earthquake resistant masonry infill panels. It improves energy dissipation of frame structures during earthquakes. The energy dissipation occurs through friction between bricks as they engage in relative sliding by the frame vibrating during earthquake. This paper explains the novelty of SIM and offers classification of SIM panels based on the gap width between the frame {{and the top of}} the panel...|$|R
50|$|The eight-story {{building}} was designed the Prairie School architectural style. It is trapezoidal in shape, and is built with steel-reinforced concrete. The exterior is brick in a stretcher bond, with a polished granite first floor street facade. Casement windows with transoms are wood-framed. Windows {{on the side}} facades are standard double-hung windows. Little effort was put into the side facade because {{it was thought that}} other office buildings would soon be built adjacent to it. Entry doors are recessed 4 ft {{from the edge of the}} openings. The main facades at Stolp Avenue and the Fox River feature decorative terracotta and <b>brick</b> <b>coursing</b> designs below the second story windows.|$|R
5000|$|Sever Hall, Harvard University (1880), brickwork, with molded <b>brick</b> string <b>courses</b> with turrets {{embedded}} in the walls, strips of windows, under a huge hipped roof as well as Austin Hall (Harvard University) (1882-1884) which followed a more traditional Richardson motif.|$|R
5|$|The end bays of {{the west}} (main) facade are framed in pedimented pavilions, which have {{recessed}} brick panels above the impost line, and below it are <b>bricks</b> <b>coursed</b> to resemble rustication. One glazed roundel is at the middle of each tympanum. The pedimented central bay has an arched recessed entrance {{with a pair of}} oversized double wood doors beneath a fanlight. The arch is flanked with blind roundels above the impost line, with rustication below. The bay's tympanum is undecorated. The arch impost line continues as a belt course between the pavilions and forms the sills for recessed wood-framed, fixed-sashed, nine-light windows on the building's second level. The windows are divided by Doric pilasters.|$|R
