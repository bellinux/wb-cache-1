25|$|Shia Muslims {{believe that}} just as a prophet is {{appointed}} by God alone, only God has the prerogative to appoint the successor to his prophet. They <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> chose Ali to be Muhammad's successor, infallible, the first caliph (khalifa, head of state) of Islam. The Shias believe that Muhammad designated Ali as his successor by God's command.|$|E
50|$|Religious {{beliefs of}} US professors were {{examined}} using a nationally {{representative sample of}} more than 1,400 professors. They found that in the social sciences: 23% did not <b>believe</b> in <b>God,</b> 16% {{did not know if}} <b>God</b> existed, 43% <b>believed</b> <b>God</b> existed, and 16% believed in a higher power. Out of the natural sciences: 20% did not <b>believe</b> in <b>God,</b> 33% did not know if <b>God</b> existed, 44% <b>believed</b> <b>God</b> existed, and 4% believed in a higher power. Overall, out of the whole study: 10% were atheists, 13% were agnostic, 19% believe in a higher power, 4% <b>believe</b> in <b>God</b> some of the time, 17% had doubts but <b>believed</b> in <b>God,</b> 35% <b>believed</b> in <b>God</b> and had no doubts.|$|R

25|$|In 1916, 1,000 leading American {{scientists}} were randomly chosen from American Men of Science and 41.8% <b>believed</b> <b>God</b> existed, 41.5% disbelieved, and 16.7% had doubts/did not know; however when {{the study was}} replicated 80 years later using American Men and Women of Science in 1996, results were {{very much the same}} with 39.3% <b>believing</b> <b>God</b> exists, 45.3% disbelieved, and 14.5% had doubts/did not know.|$|R
25|$|Although Calvinists <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> and {{the truth}} of God cannot be plural, they also believe that those civil {{ordinances}} of man which restrain man from evil and encourage toward good, are ordinances of God (regardless of the religion, or lack of it, of those who wield that power). Christians are obligated to be at peace with all men, {{as far as it}} is up to them, and to submit to governments for the Lord's sake, and to pray for enemies.|$|E
25|$|Hale {{was born}} in New York state, {{where he grew up}} with {{aspirations}} of becoming a politician. As an adolescent, he attended the Phillips Academy boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts, where he experienced a spiritual epiphany that led him to <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> wanted him to become a medical missionary. In his search to find his missionary home, Hale stumbled upon a pamphlet that described the ongoing medical need in Nepal. After reading this brochure, he chose Nepal as his future missionary destination.|$|E
25|$|God in Christianity is {{the eternal}} being who created and {{preserves}} all things. Christians <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> {{to be both}} transcendent (wholly independent of, and removed from, the material universe) and immanent (involved in the world). Christian teachings of the immanence and involvement of God and his love for humanity exclude the belief that God is of the same substance as the created universe but accept that God's divine Nature was hypostatically united to human nature {{in the person of}} Jesus Christ, in an event known as the Incarnation.|$|E

25|$|Quakers {{bear witness}} or testify to their {{religious}} beliefs in their spiritual lives, drawing on the James advice that faith by itself, {{if it is not}} accompanied by action, is dead. This religious witness is rooted in their immediate experience of God and verified by the Bible, especially in Jesus Christ's life and teachings. They may bear witness in many ways, according to how they <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> is leading them. Although Quakers share how they relate to God and the world, mirroring Christian ethical codes, for example the Sermon on the Mount or the Sermon on the Plain, Friends argue that they feel personally moved by God rather than following an ethical code.|$|E
25|$|After Christianity, Judaism is {{the next}} largest {{religious}} affiliation in the US, though this identification is not necessarily indicative of religious beliefs or practices. There are between 5.3 and 6.6 million Jews. A significant number of people identify themselves as American Jews on ethnic and cultural grounds, rather than religious ones. For example, 19% of self-identified American Jews do not <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> exists. The 2001 ARIS study projected from its sample that there are about 5.3million adults in the American Jewish population: 2.83million adults (1.4% of the U.S. adult population) {{are estimated to be}} adherents of Judaism; 1.08million are estimated to be adherents of no religion; and 1.36million are estimated to be adherents of a religion other than Judaism. ARIS 2008 estimated about 2.68 million adults (1.2%) in the country identify Judaism as their faith.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Christian punk bands do not advocate anarchy or communism; Officer Negative's logo is a parody of the Circle-A commonly associated with anarchism. Many Christian punk bands, especially pop-punk bands such as Relient K, FM Static, and MxPx, have very few songs about political topics; others, most notably older bands, contain strongly political lyrics in many of their songs. Political Christian punk bands come {{from a variety of}} areas on the political spectrum. The Psalters, who openly advocate the ideas of anarcho-primitivism, Liberation theology) and Christian anarchism, are Christians who <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> is the only true authority. Some politicized Christian punk bands are also socialists. Crashdog operated a section of their website devoted to political issues and candidates that they supported, such as former United States Green Party Presidential candidate Ralph Nader and various human rights causes. Crashdog disbanded in the late 1990s to start Ballydowse, a more political band which also took strong stances on human rights issues.|$|E

500|$|By December 2005, Veitch, Albee, {{and teacher}} Tanya Huerter {{had become the}} organization's leaders. Two months later, Huerter, who also had no {{experience}} with the sex industry, said, [...] "I have a heart for these girls. I <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> created sex for marriage. But God will meet these girls where they are." [...] Veitch, Albee, and Huerter invited Christian women from other churches {{in the area to}} volunteer with JC's Girls and approximately 90 churches responded with interest. JC's Girls received public attention in December 2005, when UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph published an article about the organization's activities. The article prompted additional media coverage from other newspapers, television programs, and radio stations both across the United States and internationally, including news outlets as far away as France and India. Veitch began dividing her time between managing JC's Girls, appearing in the media, and serving as a caregiver for her terminally-ill husband, who had brain cancer.|$|E
500|$|Foreigners like Coey {{who volunteered}} for the Rhodesian Army {{received}} the same pay and conditions of service as local regulars. Ideologically and religiously motivated, Coey viewed himself {{as a kind of}} latter-day crusader. He kept a thorough journal of his thoughts and experiences throughout his army service. [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> intended me to come here for some purpose," [...] he wrote soon after enlisting. [...] "This action has cost me an Officer's Commission, and ... my citizenship may be revoked, [...] this is the most I can do for my country under the circumstances." [...] He told the historian Gerald Horne that he believed communists had already compromised top levels of the US government, and that by serving in Rhodesia he was helping to unify [...] "his people" [...] against a foreign conspiracy. His religious views also affected his views on Zionism: he believed that the State of Israel's existence prior to the Second Coming of Christ was contrary to scriptural prophecies, and that it should therefore be destroyed.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for the Melbourne, Australia newspaper, The Age, Larry Schwartz {{selected}} the documentary as [...] "Critic's Choice". Schwartz {{was critical of}} Theroux's lack of detachment from his subject matter, [...] "He repeatedly distances himself from the church, expressing his disapproval of their views. But so concerned is he, he seems almost evangelical in his determination to show them the error of their ways." [...] The documentary was highlighted in The Sydney Morning Herald among [...] "The week's best", and critic Greg Hassall characterised it as, [...] "Disturbing, perplexing and very entertaining." [...] The Australia newspaper MX highlighted the documentary favorably, in its column, [...] "Best in show". Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun selected The Most Hated Family in America as his [...] "Top Choice" [...] recommendation. Adams wrote, [...] "A truly disturbing, disgusting and sad documentary. The repellent Shirley Phelps is the outspoken nutbag who got publicity by calling Heath Ledger a 'fag enabler' after his death. This jaw-dropping doco infiltrates Phelps' only-in-America church where her 11 spooky kids regularly picket funerals of US soldiers killed in Iraq – they <b>believe</b> <b>God</b> killed them to show his hatred of how 'depraved' America now is." ...|$|E
