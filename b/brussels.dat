5|$|As various {{agreements}} were reached, {{activities in}} Luxembourg gradually shifted to <b>Brussels</b> and the Parliament, although bound {{to remain in}} Strasbourg, also started to work in <b>Brussels</b> while the courts remained in Luxembourg. The final agreement in 1992 set up the present arrangement, including {{the division of the}} Parliament's work between the three cities. In 2002, the European Council, having previously rotated between different cities, decided to base itself in <b>Brussels.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{institutions}} are not concentrated {{in a single}} capital city: instead, their headquarters are spread across four cities, <b>Brussels,</b> Luxembourg, Strasbourg and Frankfurt. The current arrangement was approved in 1992 and attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam. The treaty states that the Commission and Council would be based in <b>Brussels,</b> the Courts in Luxembourg and the Parliament in Strasbourg. However some departments of the Commission and meetings of the Council take place in Luxembourg, while the Parliament has its committees and some sessions in <b>Brussels</b> and its secretariat in Luxembourg. Of the new institutions, the Central Bank is based in Frankfurt while the European Council is based in <b>Brussels</b> (but has some extraordinary meetings elsewhere).|$|E
5|$|Unable {{either to}} stay in France or to move to Germany, Marx decided to emigrate to <b>Brussels</b> in Belgium in February 1845. However, {{to stay in}} Belgium he had to pledge not to publish {{anything}} {{on the subject of}} contemporary politics. In <b>Brussels,</b> Marx associated with other exiled socialists from across Europe, including Moses Hess, Karl Heinzen and Joseph Weydemeyer. In April 1845, Engels moved from Barmen in Germany to <b>Brussels</b> to join Marx and the growing cadre of members of the League of the Just now seeking home in <b>Brussels.</b> Later, Mary Burns, Engels' long-time companion, left Manchester, England to join Engels in <b>Brussels.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to settle in France, he moved to Britain {{and then to the}} capital of present-day Belgium, <b>Brussels,</b> where he settled. He {{intended}} to live there until Mercedes completed her education and then return to Argentina. Rivadavia visited <b>Brussels</b> and San Martín intended to challenge him to a duel, but was dissuaded by Diego Paroissien.|$|E
5|$|Despite the 1965 agreement, the Parliament's seat {{remained}} {{a source of}} contention. Wishing {{to be closer to}} the activities in <b>Brussels</b> and Luxembourg, a few plenary sessions were held by the Parliament between 1967 and 1981 in Luxembourg instead of Strasbourg—against the wishes of France—and in 1981 it returned to holding sessions entirely in Strasbourg. In the previous year it unsuccessfully issued an ultimatum to the national governments, attempting to force them to reach an agreement. Thus, the Parliament moved some of its decision-making bodies to <b>Brussels,</b> along with its committee and political group meetings, and in 1985 it also built a plenary chamber in <b>Brussels</b> for some part-sessions. All the Parliament's attempts in this field were challenged by member states.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Brussels,</b> {{situated}} in a predominantly Dutch-speaking area, 38 percent spoke French in 1842 while 61 percent spoke Dutch; many residents spoke dialects such as Marols instead of the standard languages. By {{the end of the}} period, social change and internal immigration from Wallonia contributed to the growing importance of French in <b>Brussels.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, <b>Brussels</b> Airlines painted an Airbus A320-200 with {{registration}} OO-SNB in {{a special}} Tintin livery.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} institutions, the Parliament's seat {{was not yet}} fixed. The {{provisional}} arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in <b>Brussels.</b> In 1985 the Parliament, wishing {{to be closer to}} these institutions, built a second chamber in <b>Brussels</b> and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would retain its formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in <b>Brussels.</b> This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.|$|E
5|$|Mexico donated a resin {{replica of}} an Olmec colossal head to Belgium; {{it is on}} display in the Musée du Cinquantenaire in <b>Brussels.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 15 February 2010, {{services}} between <b>Brussels</b> and London {{were interrupted}} following the Halle train collision, this {{time after the}} dedicated HSL 1 lines {{in the suburbs of}} the Belgian capital were blocked by debris from a serious train crash on the suburban commuter lines alongside. No efforts were made to reroute trains around the blockage; Eurostar instead terminated services to <b>Brussels</b> at Lille, directing passengers to continue their journey on local trains. <b>Brussels</b> services resumed on a limited scale on 22 February.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September 2007, Eurostar broke {{another record}} when it {{completed}} {{the journey from}} <b>Brussels</b> to London in 1hour, 43minutes.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1916, <b>Brussels</b> left Hoek van Holland {{bound for}} Harwich. Lights were shown {{from the beach}} and a flare was fired. A {{passenger}} {{is reported to have}} remained on deck and signalled to shore. Five German destroyers surrounded <b>Brussels.</b> The passengers were told to prepare to take to the lifeboats and orders were given for official papers to be destroyed, which was done successfully. <b>Brussels</b> was taken by the Germans, and the radio was destroyed. She was escorted into Zeebrugge and then to Bruges.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian Comic Strip Center in the <b>Brussels</b> {{business}} district added exhibits dedicated to Hergé in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Revolution {{broke out}} on 25 August 1830, after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera (La muette de Portici) in <b>Brussels</b> led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city. This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers. The following day, the revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789. To maintain order, several bourgeois militia groups were formed. The situation in <b>Brussels</b> led to widespread unrest across the country. William I rejected his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels, forcing them towards a more radical, pro-independence stance, and sent a large military force to <b>Brussels</b> suppress the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|The Brussels' Comic Book Route in {{the center}} of <b>Brussels</b> added its first Tintin mural in July 2005.|$|E
5|$|The Commission is {{primarily}} based in <b>Brussels,</b> with the President's {{office and the}} Commission's meeting room on the 13th floor of the Berlaymont building. The Commission also operates out of numerous other buildings in <b>Brussels</b> and Luxembourg. When the Parliament is meeting in Strasbourg, the Commissioners also meet there in the Winston Churchill building to attend the Parliament's debates.|$|E
5|$|The European Parliament {{has three}} places of work– <b>Brussels</b> (Belgium), {{the city of}} Luxembourg (Luxembourg) and Strasbourg (France).|$|E
5|$|The Magnet {{trademark}} {{was first}} registered in September 1908 in <b>Brussels,</b> and symbolised strength.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a larger}} press corps in <b>Brussels</b> than Washington D.C.; in 2007 media outlets in every Union member-state had a <b>Brussels</b> correspondent. However, since the global {{downturn}} by 2010 the press corps in <b>Brussels</b> shrunk by a third. There is one journalist covering EU news for Latvia and none for Lithuania. Although {{there has been a}} worldwide cut in journalists, the considerable press releases and operations such as Europe by Satellite and EuroparlTV leads many news organisations to believe they can cover the EU from these source and news agencies. In the face of high-level criticism, the Commission is also due to shut down Presseurop on 20 December 2013.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the long}} nineteenth century, {{as a common}} {{destination}} for political refugees, Belgium was home to important émigré communities, particularly in <b>Brussels.</b> From 1871, many of the Paris Communards fled to <b>Brussels,</b> where they received political asylum. The far-right politician General Georges Boulanger arrived in 1889. Other notable exiles living in Belgium included the writer Victor Hugo and the theorist Karl Marx.|$|E
5|$|Tintin {{has become}} a symbol of Belgium and so was used in a variety of visual {{responses}} to the 2016 <b>Brussels</b> bombings.|$|E
5|$|A {{tapestry}} version woven in <b>Brussels</b> c. 1500 {{is now in}} the Louvre. It {{was probably}} designed using a reversed drawing of the painting.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, in September 1944, the Allies entered <b>Brussels</b> and Hergé's German {{employers}} fled. Le Soir {{was shut}} down and The Adventures of Tintin was put on hold.|$|E
5|$|However, after {{a period}} during which no <b>Brussels</b> trains served the station, to the dissatisfaction of the local communities, on 23 February 2009 Eurostar re-introduced a single daily Ashford-Brussels service.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Eurostar was {{planning}} cheaper fares, {{an example of}} which was an offer of £50 day returns from London to Paris or <b>Brussels.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} days, they escorted 2,000 French prisoners back to <b>Brussels</b> and then marched on to Paris. They finally returned to Brunswick on 6 December 1815.|$|E

5|$|On 14 November 1994, Eurostar {{services}} began between Waterloo International {{station in}} London, Gare du Nord in Paris and Brussels-South railway station in <b>Brussels.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 17 October 2011 a man fell at {{approximately}} 17:40 or 17:50 from the 17:04 service from London to <b>Brussels</b> {{as it passed}} through Westenhanger and Cheriton in Folkestone, near the entry to the Channel Tunnel. The individual was an Albanian who had been refused entry to the United Kingdom and was voluntarily returning to <b>Brussels.</b> The line was handed back at 22:09 after being closed for several hours following the incident. The train itself returned north to Ashford International, where passengers were transferred to a Eurostar service operating from Marne-la-Vallée to London, where passengers arrived again {{at approximately}} 22:30.|$|E

The European Court of Justice, the General Court, and the Court of Auditors are based in Luxembourg along with the European Investment Bank. The Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions are entirely based in <b>Brussels</b> while the European Central Bank is based in Frankfurt and Europol is the only agency to have its seat fixed by the treaties, in the Hague.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo {{position}} {{was a strong}} one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to <b>Brussels.</b> Along {{the crest of the}} ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane. Near the crossroads with the <b>Brussels</b> road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.|$|E
