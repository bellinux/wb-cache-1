5|$|One unique feature {{found on}} most MP 38 and MP 40 submachine guns was an aluminum, steel, or <b>bakelite</b> resting bar or support under the barrel. This {{was used to}} steady the weapon when firing {{over the side of}} open-top armored {{personnel}} carriers such as the Sdkfz 251 half-track. A handguard, made of a synthetic material derived from <b>bakelite,</b> was located between the magazine housing and the pistol grip. The barrel lacked any form of insulation, which often resulted in burns on the supporting hand if it was incorrectly positioned. The MP 40 also had a forward-folding metal stock, the first for a submachine gun, resulting in a shorter overall weapon when folded. However, this stock design was at times insufficiently durable for hard combat use.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, the BBC TV {{programme}} Fake or Fortune investigated {{a copy of}} Dirck van Baburen's The Procuress {{owned by}} the Courtauld Institute. Opinion had been divided {{as to whether it}} was a 17th-century studio work or a van Meegeren fake. The programme used chemical analysis of the paint to show that it contained <b>bakelite</b> and thus confirmed that the painting was a 20th-century fake.|$|E

McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, {{of which he}} is now the patron. An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to Peter Pan at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three. When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a wood and <b>bakelite,</b> fold-away Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bakelite's</b> {{availability}} and ease {{and speed of}} molding helped to lower the costs of production and increase product availability so that both telephones and radios became common household consumer goods. It was also {{very important to the}} developing automobile industry. It was soon found in myriad other consumer products ranging from pipe stems and buttons to saxophone mouthpieces, cameras, early machine guns, and appliance casings.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Union Carbide and Kellex {{had made}} {{researchers}} at the <b>Bakelite</b> Corporation, a subsidiary of Union Carbide, aware of Nix's unsuccessful efforts with powdered nickel barriers. To Frazier Groff and other researchers at Bakelite's laboratories in Bound Brook, New Jersey, it seemed that Nix was not {{taking advantage of the}} latest techniques, and they began their own development efforts. Both Bell and Bound Brook sent samples of their powdered nickel barriers to Taylor for evaluation, but he was unimpressed; neither had come up with a practical barrier. At Kellogg's laboratory in Jersey City, New Jersey, Clarence A. Johnson, who was aware of the steps taken by the SAM laboratories to improve the Norris-Adler barrier, realized that they could also be taken with the <b>Bakelite</b> barrier. The result was a barrier better than either, although still short of what was required. At a meeting at Columbia with the Army in attendance on 20 October 1943, Keith proposed switching the development effort to the Johnson barrier. Urey balked at this, fearing that this would destroy morale at the SAM Laboratories. The issue was put to Groves at a meeting on 3 November 1943, and he decided to pursue development of both the Johnson and Norris-Adler barriers.|$|E
5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, <b>Bakelite,</b> crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Type 94 Nambu pistols {{decreased}} {{towards the end}} of World War II as the Japanese faced bombing raids from allied forces and material shortages increased. This drastic change in quality from late March 1945, onwards with all quality standards appearing to disappear {{towards the end of}} June 1945. The smooth wooden finished grip was replaced by a <b>bakelite</b> checkered pattern. Many pistols were not serialized and no pistols have been reported that bear July 1945 manufacture date. Only four unserialized and undated pistols are known to exist and include mismatch parts with no inspection marks, lanyard loops, and extractors. A small number of pistols made during the final production stages include earlier production dates and appear to have been salvaged from previously discarded pistols that had minor or cosmetic defects.|$|E
40|$|Since their {{discovery}} as by-products in the phenol-formaldehyde condensation {{to prepare}} <b>bakelites,</b> the calixarenes have gained much attention for their application as both surfactants and chemoreceptors. The McKervey {{group has been}} a leader in the development and synthesis of new and novel calixarenes for use as ion-complexing agents as well as for use in many other applications. Many calixarene derivatives prepared by the McKervey group are being used in both environmental and biomedical monitoring. This review covers both the synthesis and sensor applications of the various calixarenes developed by the McKervey group over the past two decades, with emphasis on metal cation detection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{establishment}} of osseointegration following dental implant placement {{is a major}} contributing factor to the clinical success and long-term function of implant-retained prosthesis. Radiographic examination and palpation have been two of the methods often used in clinical assessment for implant stability for years. However, theses radiographs are two-dimensional and difficult to standardize. The investigation was designed to study the use of resonance frequency analysis {{in search of the}} stability of the implant-tissue interface in vitro. Resonance frequency was measured when test implants were embedded in <b>bakelites.</b> The change in stiffness observed during bone healing was modeled by embedding implants in gypsum during setting period. Our results showed that there was an increase in resonance frequency related to stiffness increment during osseointegration...|$|R
5|$|In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee {{approved}} {{the construction of}} a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December, M. W. Kellogg accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents. The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel, and Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the <b>Bakelite</b> Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bakelite</b> items, {{particularly}} {{jewelry and}} radios, {{have become a}} popular collectible. The term <b>Bakelite</b> is sometimes used in the resale market to indicate various types of early plastics, including Catalin and Faturan, which may be brightly colored, as well as items made of <b>Bakelite</b> material.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bakelite</b> was {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for metal in the magazine, pistol grip, fore grip, hand guard, and butt stock of firearms. Some early AK-74 rifles have been identified as using <b>Bakelite,</b> but most were made with AG-S4, commonly mistaken for <b>Bakelite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other lines {{introduced}} {{to expand the}} Revere Ware brand were the heavy duty Institutional line, substituting Stainless Steel handles for the <b>bakelites.</b> A selection of this series was reintroduced as Patio Ware in 1956, attempting {{to cash in on}} the barbecue craze of 50's. The larger, more rugged handles of the 1800 line were marketed as made specifically for men's larger hands. Various aluminum products were also introduced, such as the Galaxy line. The Galaxy line featured Stainless Steel construction with a bonded aluminum lining. The 500 line was a series of miniature 1400 series cookware, marketed as toys for children, but manufactured to the same standards as all their consumer cookware. The mini sets, which were available through 1983, have become quite collectible.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Resistive plate {{chambers}} (RPCs) {{are widely}} used to detect high-energy charged particles, especially muons, due to the high gain, moderate time and spatial resolution, simple design and low cost of these detectors. While the simple streamer mode is adequate for cosmic-ray and low-rate accelerator experiments, the avalanche mode is required for high-rate experiments such as CMS at LHC. In this paper construction of a medium-sized double-gap RPC made of Chinese materials is reported. The experimental set-up of cosmic-ray and muon beam tests are introduced. The avalanche mode was clearly observed. Good efficiency and time resolution {{were obtained from the}} beam test at CERN under normal irradiation conditions. At very high radiation background the chamber efficiency decreases, indicating the necessity to change the resistivity value of the Chinese <b>bakelites.</b> 1...|$|R
25|$|In 1931 L.M. Ericsson {{introduced}} the <b>Bakelite</b> phone, and acquired the patent rights to Tolnai's Centralograph machine-status-recorder. When Ericsson’s <b>Bakelite</b> telephone was first distributed world-wide in 1931 {{it was called}} the Swedish type of telephone and set the standard for how a modern plastic telephone should look. The distinctive Ericsson styles soon became subdued by the increasing use of moulded thermoplastic phones. Ericsson's innovative <b>bakelite</b> telephone, which was launched in 1931, was primarily known for its trend-setting (early adopter) design, but it also contained an important technical innovation called anti-side tone coupling. The line of telephones, the Ericsson DBH 1001 telephone, was the <b>Bakelite</b> phone, officially also called DBH 1001, m33, N1020 or DE 702, was a Swedish standard telephone <b>bakelite</b> produced in over thirty years between 1931 and 1962.|$|E
25|$|Phenolic resins {{have been}} {{commonly}} used in ablative heat shields. Soviet heatshields for ICBM warheads and spacecraft reentry consisted of asbestos textolite, impregnated with <b>Bakelite.</b> <b>Bakelite</b> is also used in the mounting of metal samples in metallography.|$|E
25|$|These {{characteristics}} made <b>Bakelite</b> particularly {{suitable as}} a molding compound, an adhesive or binding agent, a varnish, {{and as a}} protective coating. <b>Bakelite</b> was particularly suitable for the emerging electrical and automobile industries because of its extraordinarily high resistance to electricity, heat and chemical action.|$|E
25|$|Bakelite's {{molding process}} {{had a number}} of advantages. <b>Bakelite</b> resin could be {{provided}} either as powder, or as preformed partially cured slugs, increasing the speed of the casting. Thermosetting resins such as <b>Bakelite</b> required heat and pressure during the molding cycle, but could be removed from the molding process without being cooled, again making the molding process faster. Also, because of the smooth polished surface that resulted, <b>Bakelite</b> objects required less finishing. Millions of parts could be duplicated quickly and relatively cheaply.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bakelite</b> {{continues}} {{to be used for}} wire insulation, brake pads and related automotive components, and industrial electrical-related applications. <b>Bakelite</b> stock is still manufactured and produced in sheet, rod and tube form for industrial applications in the electronics, power generation and aerospace industries, and under a variety of commercial brand names.|$|E

25|$|Bijker gives a {{detailed}} discussion {{of the development of}} <b>Bakelite</b> and the <b>Bakelite</b> Company's production of various applications of materials. As of 1911, the company's main focus was laminating varnish, whose sales volume vastly outperformed both molding material and cast resin. By 1912, molding material was gaining ground, but its sales volume for the company did not exceed that of laminating varnish until the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Faturan is {{phenolic}} resin, also {{similar to}} <b>Bakelite,</b> that turns red over time, {{regardless of its}} original color.|$|E
25|$|Catalin {{was also}} a {{phenolic}} resin, similar to <b>Bakelite,</b> but contained different mineral fillers that allowed the production of light colors.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{commercial use}} of <b>Bakelite</b> in the electrical industry was the molding of tiny insulating bushings {{the size of}} mustard seeds, made in 1908 for the Weston Electrical Instrument Corporation by Richard W. Seabury of the Boonton Rubber Company. <b>Bakelite</b> was soon used for non-conducting parts of telephones, radios and other electrical devices, including bases and sockets for light bulbs and electron tubes, supports for any type of electrical components, automobile distributor caps and other insulators.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, <b>Bakelite,</b> the first fully {{synthetic}} thermoset, {{was reported by}} Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland by using phenol and formaldehyde.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, newer {{materials}} were superseding <b>Bakelite</b> in many areas. Phenolics are less frequently used in general consumer products today {{due to their}} cost and complexity of production and their brittle nature. They still appear in some applications where their specific properties are required, such as small precision-shaped components, molded disc brake cylinders, saucepan handles, electrical plugs, switches and parts for electrical irons, {{as well as in}} the area of inexpensive board and tabletop games produced in China, Hong Kong and India. Items such as billiard balls, dominoes and pieces for board games like chess, checkers, and backgammon are constructed of <b>Bakelite</b> for its look, durability, fine polish, weight, and sound. Common dice are sometimes made of <b>Bakelite</b> for weight and sound, but the majority are made of a thermoplastic polymer such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS).|$|E
