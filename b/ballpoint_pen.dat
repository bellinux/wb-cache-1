It was first launched in December 1950 and is by far the best selling pen in the world – the 100 billionth was sold in September 2006. It has become the archetypal <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> and is considered ubiquitous, {{to the extent that the}} Museum of Modern Art has made it a permanent part of its collection. Its hexagonal form and design mimics a classic lead pencil; it is sold in a variety of colours.|$|E
25|$|A <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> is {{a writing}} {{instrument}} with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber {{is filled with}} a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The first <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> {{is the creation of}} American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a roller ball to mark up his leather hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen,</b> it wasn't a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up. Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888. However, it wasn't until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor László Bíró offered an improved version of the <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> that left paper smudge-free.|$|E

5000|$|Because of a {{reliance}} on gravity to coat the ball with ink, <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> must be held upright in order to properly dispense the ink; {{with the exception of}} Space <b>Pens,</b> <b>ballpoints</b> cannot be used to write upside down.Additionally, [...] "blobbing" [...] of ink on the drawing surface and [...] "skipping" [...] of ink-flow require consideration when using <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> for artistic purposes.|$|R

Their pen was sold in Argentina as the Birome (portmanteau of the names Bíró and Meyne), which is how <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> are still known in that country. This new design was licensed by the British, who produced <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> for RAF aircrew as the Biro. <b>Ballpoint</b> <b>pens</b> {{were found to be}} more versatile than fountain pens, especially at high altitudes, where fountain pens were prone to ink-leakage.|$|R

25|$|The common <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> is {{a product}} of mass production, with {{components}} produced separately on assembly lines.

25|$|Following World War II, many {{companies}} vied to commercially {{produce their own}} <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> design.

25|$|Ballpoint pens are {{sometimes}} provided free by businesses, such as hotels, {{as a form}} of advertising—printed with a company's name; a <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (customers will use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities include ballpoint pens in direct mail campaigns to increase a customer's interest in the mailing. Ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events, such as a pen commemorating the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.|$|E

25|$|The Space Pen, {{also known}} as the Zero Gravity Pen, is a pen that uses {{pressurized}} ink cartridges and is claimed to write in zero gravity, upside down, underwater, over wet and greasy paper, at any angle, and in extreme temperature ranges. The ballpoint is made from tungsten carbide and is precisely fitted in order to avoid leaks. A sliding float separates the ink from the pressurized gas. The thixotropic ink in the hermetically sealed and pressurized reservoir is claimed to write for three times longer than a standard <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen.</b> In 1965, the space pen was invented and patented by Paul C. Fisher. After two years of testing at NASA, the space pen was first used during the Apollo 7 mission in 1968.|$|E

25|$|Famous 20th-century {{artists such}} as Andy Warhol, among others, have {{utilised}} ballpoint pens to some extent during their careers. <b>Ballpoint</b> <b>pen</b> artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st century, with contemporary artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens; for their technical proficiency, imagination, and innovation. Korean-American artist Il Lee has been creating large-scale, ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s. Since the 1980s, Lennie Mace creates imaginative, ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity, applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim. The artist coined terms such as PENtings and Media Graffiti to describe his varied output. More recently, British artist James Mylne has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints, sometimes with minimal mixed-media color. In the mid-2000s (decade), Juan Francisco Casas generated Internet attention {{for a series of}} large-scale, photo-realistic ballpoint duplications of his own snapshots of friends, utilising only blue pens.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Anderson {{appeared}} in a MasterCard television commercial for Super Bowl XL. In it, he manages to cut the ropes binding him to a chair using a pine tree air freshener, uses an ordinary tube sock as the pulley for a zip-line, and somehow repairs and hot-wires a nonfunctional truck using a paper clip, <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen,</b> rubber band, tweezers, nasal spray, and a turkey baster. In contrast to previous MasterCard commercials showing people making extravagant purchases to accomplish some mundane task, MacGyver is portrayed as escaping from some sort of deathtrap using less than $20 worth of common household items. The commercial ends by showing him purposefully buying an assortment of such things at a department store with his credit card (as a tongue-in-cheek explanation for how he seems to always have items he needs on hand no matter where he goes). Although the commercial implies that Anderson is portraying MacGyver, he is not identified.|$|E

Referring to digital cinema Kiarostami said: [...] "Digital video is within the reach of anybody, like a <b>ballpoint</b> <b>pen.</b> I'd even dare to predict that within the next decade, we'll see a burst of interest in film-making {{as a consequence of the}} impact of video".|$|E
