5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded do a <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that {{has proven to be}} a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

5000|$|It was Lippmann {{who first}} {{identified}} {{the tendency of}} journalists to generalize about other people based on fixed ideas. He argued that people, including journalists, {{are more apt to}} believe [...] "the pictures in their heads" [...] than to come to judgment by critical thinking. Humans condense ideas into symbols, he wrote, and journalism, a force quickly becoming the mass media, is an ineffective method of educating the public. Even if journalists did <b>better</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>of</b> informing the public about important issues, Lippmann believed [...] "the mass of the reading public is not interested in learning and assimilating the results of accurate investigation." [...] Citizens, he wrote, were too self-centered to care about public policy except as pertaining to pressing local issues.|$|R
25|$|The {{automatic}} reset design permits higher field efficiencies since stopping for stones is practically eliminated. It also reduces costs for broken shares, beams and other parts.

25|$|Capitalism is {{very far}} from a perfect system, but {{so far we have}} yet to find {{anything}} that clearly does a <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> meeting human needs than a regulated capitalist economy coupled with a welfare and health care system that meets the basic needs of those who do not thrive in the capitalist economy.|$|E
25|$|The {{set theory}} of Set Theory and Its Logic does away with {{stratification}} and {{is almost entirely}} derived from a single axiom schema. Quine derived the foundations of mathematics once again. This book includes the definitive exposition of Quine's theory of virtual sets and relations, and surveyed axiomatic set theory as it stood circa 1960.

40|$|We study one {{potential}} source of urban agglomeration economies: <b>better</b> <b>job</b> matching. Focusing on college graduates, we construct two direct measures <b>of</b> <b>job</b> matching based on how well an individual's job corresponds {{to his or her}} college education. Consistent with matching-based theories of urban agglomeration, we find evidence that larger and thicker local labor markets help college graduates find <b>better</b> <b>jobs</b> by increasing both the likelihood and quality of a match. We then assess the extent to which <b>better</b> <b>job</b> matching <b>of</b> college-educated workers increases individual-level wages and thereby contributes to the urban wage premium. While we find that college graduates with <b>better</b> <b>job</b> matches do indeed earn higher wages on average, the contribution <b>of</b> such <b>job</b> matching to aggregate urban productivity appears to be relatively modest...|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, the AFL {{was doing}} a <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> {{expanding}} into the fast-growing white collar sector, with its organizations of clerks, public employees, teachers, and service workers. Although the AFL building trades maintained all-white policies, the AFL had more black members in all as the CIO. The problem of union corruption was growing in public awareness, and CIO's industrial unions were less vulnerable to penetration by criminal elements than were the AFL's trucking, longshoring, building, and entertainment unions. But Meany had a strong record in fighting corruption in New York unions, and was {{highly critical of the}} notoriously corrupt Teamsters.|$|E
25|$|Investment {{in public}} {{transport}} also has secondary {{positive effects on}} the local economy, with between $4 and $9 of economic activity resulting from every dollar spent. Many businesses rely on access to a transit system, in particular in cities and countries where access to cars is less widespread, businesses which require {{large numbers of people}} going to a same place {{may not be able to}} accommodate a large number of cars (concert venues, sport stadia, airports, exhibitions centres,...), or businesses where people are not able to use a car (bars, hospitals, or industries in the tourism sector whose customers may not have their cars). Transit systems also have an effect on derived businesses: commercial websites have been founded, such as Hopstop.com, that give directions through mass transit systems; in some cities, such as London, products themed on the local transport system are a popular tourist souvenir. Research in the Washington, DC area shows that public transport does a <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> providing high-skill residents with access to high-skill jobs than it does mid-skill residents to mid-skill jobs and low-skill residents to low-skill jobs.|$|E
40|$|The {{human capital}} model predicts that in {{equilibrium}} {{and in the}} absence of discrimination units of human capital possessed by individuals are paid the same rentals. This would hold also when comparing private and government sectors. Only non-pecuniary rewards such as <b>better</b> <b>job</b> security <b>of</b> fringe benefits would lead to acceptance of lower money payment. In Sweden salary differentials standardized for human capital variables are found to be in favour of private sector employment. This result contrasts with recent findings for the USA where the reverse was found...|$|R

50|$|The {{population}} has fluctuated over the years, and decreased from its all-time high in 1861 by 46%. This {{is similar to}} in other rural villages, as many villagers have migrated to cities/large towns searching for work and <b>better</b> <b>jobs.</b> The increase <b>of</b> residents by 14.9% from 1961 to 2001 is an indicator of counter urbanization and peoples desire to live/retire in the 'rural idyll'.|$|R
25|$|On 17 November Dagobert {{was arrested}} for disagreeing with the representatives. He was {{eventually}} acquitted {{and returned to his}} division where he died on 18 April 1794. Meanwhile, on 3 November the government replaced Turreau with François Amédée Doppet, another ex-doctor. Not wanting to wait for Turreau's successor, the representatives reappointed d'Aoust to command from 22 to 27 November. Doppet came to take command on 28 November but was practically ignored by the representatives on mission. On 7 December, d'Aoust with 10,000 men was defeated at Villelongue-dels-Monts by Ricardos with 8,000 Spanish and Portuguese troops. The Allies lost only 56 casualties while inflicting losses of 340 killed and wounded, 312 missing, 26 guns, two colors and 2,000 muskets on the French. Doppet decided to pull back to Perpignan for the winter under cover of a spoiling attack on Villelongue. D'Aoust led the attack on 18 December which overran the Portuguese camp and slaughtered its garrison. Doppet soon came down with illness and spent the next {{two and a half months}} in bed recovering. D'Aoust was finally in full command just in time to be blamed for a disaster. In the Battle of Collioure, a Spanish corps commanded by Lieutenant General Gregorio García de la Cuesta drove the French out of Collioure and Port-Vendres on 20 December, inflicting 4,000 casualties on the French. Fort Saint-Elme was betrayed to the Spanish by its traitorous commander. D'Aoust ordered a retreat on the 21st but the Spanish harassed it severely. Finally, the French fought their way back to the safety of Perpignan but their total losses in the debacle were 7,700 men and 23 guns. The government singled out the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees for disapproval despite the fact that its representatives were in large part responsible for the defeats. D'Aoust was arrested and the representatives on mission were recalled, except Fabre who was killed at Collioure. New representatives Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud and Pierre Soubrany celebrated their arrival by purging the army of both good and bad army officers. However, they subsequently did a <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> keeping the army supplied while letting the army officers do their work. D'Aoust fell victim to the guillotine on 2 July 1794.|$|E
