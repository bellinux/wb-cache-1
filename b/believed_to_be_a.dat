The name Mya was <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> play on the words 'My assistant'.|$|E
5|$|During the night, the {{electrical}} power suddenly turned {{off and the}} radios went silent. Just before 11:30pm, a huge stream of water swept through Armero; it was powerful enough to flip cars and pick up people.

A meta-analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle.|$|E

Key morphological differences that distinguish C. canadensis from C. elaphus are the former's wider rump patch and paler-hued antlers.|$|E
5|$|June was {{considered}} to be a fast linebacker and a specialized talent with a better likelihood of success in a defensive scheme that was built around speed rather than size. On March 17, 2007, he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who used the defensive scheme designed by Dungy. The New York Giants and Colts were also interested in signing June. The contract was <b>believed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> three-year, $12million agreement, but some later reports claim it was a four-year, $17million contract.|$|E
