5000|$|The Taiwan <b>Blackfoot</b> <b>Disease</b> Socio-Medical Service Memorial House (...) is {{a former}} clinic {{building}} in Yonglong Village, Beimen District, Tainan, Taiwan.|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} {{originally}} established in September 1959 as the Beimen Mission. In May 1960, the church began accepting <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> patients. They distributed free clothing and groceries.|$|E
5000|$|Wang King-ho ( [...] ; 23 April 1916 - 13 March 2014) was a Taiwanese {{physician}} {{best known}} for treating residents of Beimen District and surrounding areas after an outbreak of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The {{church was}} {{constructed}} {{to commemorate the}} <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> outbreak in the 1950s. The construction was completed on 10 January 2016 and was opened for trial in February 2016. It was officially opened on 23 July 2016.|$|E
50|$|Chen Shui-bian awarded Wang an Order of Brilliant Star, {{third class}} in 2007. The city of Tainan {{commissioned}} {{a statue of}} Wang in 2013, and placed it at the Taiwan <b>Blackfoot</b> <b>Disease</b> Socio-Medical Service Memorial House, the site of his former clinic. He died in 2014, aged 97.|$|E
50|$|Upon Dickson's {{return to}} Taiwan, her {{intent was to}} evangelize the Taiwanese children. However, it was her medical {{missions}} that attracted her American donors. While she was not herself a licensed medical professional, Dickson's organization provided medical care and promoted hygiene through several missions executed over her lifetime. Some examples of missions included: developing mountain clinics, creating a leper colony, and establishing a <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> clinic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> is {{a disease}} caused by {{environmental}} pollution and causes people to have black, charcoal-like skin in the lower limbs. This is caused by arsenic pollution in water and food source. This {{is an example of}} how disease can affect human variation. Another disease that can affect human variation is syphilis, a sexual transmitted disease. Syphilis does not affect human variation until the middle stage of the disease. It then starts to grow rashes all over the body, affecting people's human variation.|$|E
50|$|An {{outbreak}} of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> began in Beiman in 1956, and Wang partnered with medical professionals at National Taiwan University {{to research the}} disease. Missionary Lillian Dickson moved to Beiman in 1960 and opened the Mercy’s Door Free Clinic, which was funded by her organization Mustard Seed International, with Wang as head physician. , a doctor based in Puli, Nantou, would make weekly round trips to perform amputations on patients at Mercy's Door. After Mercy's Door closed, Wang returned to his own clinic before retiring in 1996.|$|E
50|$|The {{memorial}} house {{used to be}} {{a clinic}} for Wang King-ho, a doctor who had fought against <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> for 25 years by offering free medical services to patients from Beimen and the surrounding regions. Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih and Department of Cultural Affairs Commissioner Ye Tzer-shan then proposed for the reconstruction of the clinic into a memorial house to preserve the history of the disease in Taiwan. Construction began in November 2006 and ended in September 2007. After inauguration, the memorial house was taken over by the Wang King-ho Culture and Arts Foundation.|$|E
50|$|His father, Chen Hsin-an, {{served as}} Kaohsiung County Magistrate from 1954 to 1957. Chen {{obtained}} a master's degree {{in public health}} from the National Taiwan University, and received his Sc.D in human genetics and epidemiology from Johns Hopkins University in 1977 and 1982, respectively. He began his medical career by researching hepatitis B, and helped raise awareness about vaccination for the disease in Taiwan. Chen further researched on the liver cancer risk of people with hepatitis B. Chen also discovered a link from arsenic to <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease.</b> The arsenic research lead to the revision of international health standards for arsenic exposure.|$|E
40|$|In {{a limited}} {{area on the}} {{southwest}} coast of Taiwan, where artesian well water with {{a high concentration of}} arsenic has been used for more than 60 years, a high prevalence of chronic arsenicism has been observed in recent years. The total population of this "endemic " area is approximately 100, 000. A general survey of 40, 421 inhabitants and follow-up of 1, 108 patients with <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> were made. <b>Blackfoot</b> <b>disease,</b> so-termed locally, is a peripheral vascular disorder resulting in gangrene of the extremities, especially the feet. The overall prevalence rates for skin cancer was 10. 6 per 1000, and for <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> 8. 9 per 1000. Generally speaking, the prevalence increased steadily with age in both diseases. The prevalence rates for skin cancer and <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> increased with the arsenic content of well water, i. e., the higher the arsenic content, the more patients with skin cancer and <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease.</b> A dose-response relationship between <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> and the duration of water intake was also noted. Furthermore, the degree of permanent impairment of function in the patient was directly related to duration of intake of arsenical water and to duration of such intake at the time of onset. The most common cause of death in the patients with skin cancer and <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> was carcinoma of various sites. The 5 -year survival rate after the onset of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> was 76. 3 %; the 10 -year survival rate was 63. 3 % and 15 -year survival rate, 52. 2 %. The 50 % survival point was 16 years after onset of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Flame atotnic absoφtion {{spectrophotometric}} {{methods were}} developed for, arsenic, selenium, copper, zinc and iron in hair samples. Data from <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> patients at five clinical stages {{were compared with}} those from healthy controls. The copper and zinc concentrations showed only slight differences in all clinical stages, which indicated the less relation to <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease.</b> The decrease of selenium and iron in all stages was attributed to the antagonistic effect of arsenic; arsenic increased {{in the first and}} second stages, but decreased in the later stages. The decrease of selenium and iron during the Progression of the disease is thought to be due to persistence of the antagonistic effect of arsenic in the initial stages, so that very low concentrations of selenium are found in the advanced stages, despite the later decrease of arsenic. There was also a progressive decrease of iron with advance of the disease, and the later stages also showed a decrease in haemoglobin. It was shown that arsenic is a major cause of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease,</b> and that it antagonises selenium and iron, which decreased in the advanced clinical stages of the disease. !f l...|$|E
40|$|The arsenic-related {{peripheral}} vascular disease {{found to}} be endemic along the southwestern coast of Taiwan is reviewed. In the early 20 th century a strange disease involving the lower extremities characterized by typical clinical symptoms and signs of progressive arterial occlusion was reported in a confined area located along the southwestern coast of Taiwan. The disease was locally called "blackfoot disease " because of its gangrenous appearance involving {{the feet of the}} patients. The prevalence of this disease ranged from 6. 51 to 18. 85 per 1, 000 population in different villages. Epidemiologic studies revealed that <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> was associated with the consumption of artesian well water containing high levels of arsenic. High co-occurrence of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> and arsenic-related skin lesions such as hyperpigmentation, hyperkeratosis, and skin cancer was also observed. Recent studies also confirmed the asso-ciation of preclinical peripheral vascular disease with arsenic exposure in a dose-response pattern. Subclinical arterial insufficiency and defects in cutaneous microcirculation can also be demonstrated in seemingly normal subjects living in the endemic villages. The incidence of clinical manifestation of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> decreased dramatically after the implementation of tap water in these villages over the past 2 - 3 decades. The atherogenicity of arsenic could be associated with its effects on hypercoagulability, endothelial injury, smooth muscle cell proliferation, somatic mutation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. However, its interaction with some trace elements and its association with hypertension and diabetes mellitus could also explain part of its higher risk of developing atherosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|Summary A {{total of}} 69 bladder cancer, 76 lung cancer and 59 liver cancer {{deceased}} cases and 368 alive community controls group-matched on {{age and sex}} were studied to evaluate the association between higharsenic artesian well water and cancers in the endemic area of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD), a unique peripheral vascular disease related to continuous arsenic exposure. According to a standardized structured questionnaire, information on risk factors was obtained through proxy interview of the cases and personal interview of the controls. A positive dose-response relationship was observed between the exposure to artesian well water and cancers of bladder, lung and liver. The age-sex-adjusted odds ratios of developing bladder, lung and liver cancers {{for those who had}} used artesian well water for 40 or more years were 3. 90, 3. 39, and 2. 67, respectively, as compared with those who never used artesian well water. Multiple binary logistic regression analyses showed that the dose-response relationships and odds ratios remained much the same while other risk factors were further adjusted. <b>Blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD) is an endemic peripheral vascular disorder confined to a limited area on the southwest coast of Taiwan (Wu et al., 1961).

40|$|AbstractArsenic is a {{well-known}} toxic element and carcinogenic agent. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate p 63, E-cadherin, and β-catenin proteins in urothelial carcinoma (UC) in both arsenic contaminated areas [so-called <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD) area] and non-BFD areas. The expressions of p 63, E-cadherin, and β-catenin proteins in 20 UC cases of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> and 22 UC cases in non-BFD areas were detected using immunohistochemical methods. The results revealed a high p 63 expression in 20 (47. 6 %) UC cases and high E-cadherin expression in six (14. 3 %) UC cases. Expressions of p 63 and E-cadherin showed no significant correlations with clinicopathologic parameters. However, all 20 BFD cases and 12 of 22 (54. 5 %) non-BFD cases showed aberrant β-catenin expression. Ten out of 22 (45. 5 %) non-BFD cases also had normal membranous immunoreactivity. The β-catenin staining pattern significantly differed between cases in endemic and nonendemic areas of BFD (p= 0. 001). Tumor sites also significantly correlated with β-catenin expression (p= 0. 044). In addition, membranous localization of β-catenin was lower in UC from BFD-endemic areas compared with those from non-BFD endemic areas. In conclusion, it is suggested that relocalization of β-catenin from membrane to cytoplasm may be involved in the tumorigenesis of UC from BFD-endemic areas...|$|E
40|$|Southwest (SW) Taiwan {{has been}} the site for health studies for more than 45 years, {{initially}} because {{of the discovery of}} a unique periph-eral vascular disease, <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD), that led to gangrenous amputation of the extremities and later because of the associa-tions between high arsenic levels in local arte-sian well water and a variety of diseases, including cancers. A review of the history of these studies is useful as they have been used to estimate the carcinogenic risk from the ingestion of inorganic arsenic. Epidemiologic studies on BFD were con-ducted by the Institute of Public Health of the National Taiwan University. All cases of BF...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Chronic arsenic {{poisoning}} {{is reported}} to be associated with peripheral and cardiovascular disease, arteriosclerosis, Raynaud’s syndrome, hypertension, and <b>Blackfoot</b> <b>disease.</b> Monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) is a reactive metabolite of inorganic arsenic and a potent inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Ar-senic is also reported to phosphorylate eNOS in cultured keratinocyte and Human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells, respectively. In the present study, we examined the cyto-toxicity and eNOS phosphorylation by MMAIII exposure in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Results showed that MMAIII is more toxic than arsenite in BAEC cells. The IC 50 values for MMA III and arsenite were determined to be approximately 1. 7 and 24. 1 lmol/L...|$|E
40|$|Summary: Flame atomic {{absorption}} spectrophotometric methods were {{developed for the}} determination of zinc, copper, arsenic, iron and selenium in blood samples. Data from <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> patients in five clinical stages were compared with those from healthy controls. Copper concentrations were {{the same for all}} clinical stages. Arsenic increased in the initial three stages but decreased thereafter, although arsenic was previously considered to be the major causative agent of the disease. The decrease of arsenic in the later stages was attributed to the antagonistic effect of selenium, and the decrease of iron during the progress of the disease is thought to be due to the antagonistic effect of arsenic in the initial stages and the loose of haemoglobin in the later stages...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic (As) {{contamination}} of groundwater {{is a major}} environmental concern (Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002). In Taiwan, high arsenic concentrations in deep well water have been verified {{to be associated with}} <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD), which was once common on the southwestern coastal area (Tseng, 1997). From 1999 to 2004, the Taiwan Sugar Company undertook a groundwater quality survey at monitoring wells in this area (Taiwan Sugar Company, 2004). The As concentration in groundwater was 0. 30 ± 0. 35 mg/L. At around 95 % of monitoring in wells, the As concentrations exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline of 0. 01 mg/L. Nowadays, even though this well water is not directly ingested by most inhabitants in this hazardous region, it is still extensively provided to meet domestic, irrigation, aquacultural and industria...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine whether}} {{biomarkers}} such as sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosome aberrations (CAs) can predict cancer develop-ment, a nested case-control study {{was performed in}} a blackfoot endemic area with a known high cancer risk. A cohort of 686 residents was recruited from three villages in the blackfoot endemic area. Personal characteristics were collected, and venous blood was drawn for lympho-cyte culture and stored in a refrigerator. The vital status and cancer development were followed using the National Death Registry, Cancer Registry, and <b>Blackfoot</b> <b>Disease</b> Registry. The follow-up period was from August 1991 to July 1995. During this 4 -year period, 31 residents devel-oped various types of cancer. Blood culture samples from nine of these subjects were unsuitable for experiments due to improper storage. Finally, a total of 22 cancer cases had cytogenetic samples that could be analyzed.

40|$|Objective: Long-term arsenic {{exposure}} {{has been}} reported to associated with prevalence, incidence, and mortality of diabetes mellitus (DM). A tap water supply system was implemented in the early 1960 s in the <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD) endemic areas. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine whether DM mortality decreased after the improvement of drinking water supply system through elimination of arsenic exposure from artesian well water. Methods: Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for DM were calculated for the BFD endemic area for the years 1971 – 2000. Results: The study results show that mortality from DM declined in females (but not in males) gradually after the improvement of drinking water supply system. Conclusions: Based on the reversibility criterion, the association between arsenic exposure and DM is likely to be casual for females but not in males.

40|$|Abstract This work {{explored}} a risk-based arsenic (As) {{regulation in}} farmed pond water by ingesting tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) in <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> hyper-endemic areas and discussed a rational As regulation in pond water. Monte Carlo {{analysis was used}} to propagate the parameter uncertainty and to assess probabilistically regulation risks. A dynamic scheme of groundwater man-agement was proposed that curves of utilization ratios against As concentrations in groundwater were established based on the risk-based regulation. The 5 th to 95 th per-centiles of risks range from 3. 5 9 10 - 7 to 6. 0 9 10 - 5 via ingesting the farmed tilapia under the current As regulation in farmed pond water in Taiwan, 50 lg/L. To compare to inorganic As regulation in drinking water, the current As regulation in farmed pond water does not pose a great threat to human health, but it is unsafe. Therefore, this study suggests that the regulation of As in farmed pond water is revised to be 25 lg/L...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine multiple risk factors and correlated malignant neoplasms of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD), a unique peripheral vascular disease related to continuous exposure to high-arsenic artesian well water. A total of 241 BFD cases, Including 169 with spontaneous or surgical amputations of affected extremities, and 759 age-sex-resldence-matched healthy community controls were studied to explore the risk factors of BFD. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that artesian well water consumption, arsenic poisoning, familial history of BFD, and undernourishment were significantly associated with the development of BFD. The life-table method used to analyze cancer mortality of 789 BFD patients followed for 15 years showed a significantly higher mortality from cardiovascular diseases, peripheral vascular diseases, and cancers of bladder, skin, lung, and liver among BFD patients as compared with the general population In Taiwan or residents In the BFD-endemic area.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of shallow ground water quality revealed that high arsenic (As) concentrations {{were found in}} both aquifers and aquitards in the southern Choushui River alluvial fan of Taiwan. A total of 655 geological core samples from 13 drilling wells were col-lected and analyzed. High As contents were found primarily in aqui-tards, {{to a maximum of}} 590 mg/kg. The contents were correlated with the locations of the marine sequences. Additionally, strong correla-tions among the As concentrations of core samples, the clay, and the geological age of the Holocene transgression were identified. Most of the As in ground water originated from the aquitard of the marine sequence. The high As content in marine formations with high clay contents may be attributable to the bioaccumulation of As in the sea organisms, which accrued and were deposited in the formation. A preliminary geogenic model of the origin of the high As concentration in the shallow sedimentary basin of the Choushui River alluvial fan of Taiwan is proposed. HIGH ARSENIC CONCENTRATIONS in deep well waterhave been verified to be associated with <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease,</b> which was once common on the Chianan Plai...|$|E
40|$|The Southwest {{coastal plain}} of Taiwan is an endemic area of arsenic contamination. Residents {{who lived there}} before the 1970 s and who used raw {{groundwater}} for drinking have {{a higher risk of}} arsenic poisoning. In 1968, Tseng et al. described <b>Blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> as a peripheral vascular disease caused by chronic exposure to arsenic, thereby introducing the concept of arsenic-induced systemic illness in Taiwan. Multiple Bowen's disease (BD) is one of the characteristic consequences of chronic arsenic poisoning and it usually presents as cutaneous carcinoma in situ. Multiple BD can also be associated with squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma of the skin, as well as lung, liver, gastrointestinal, and bladder cancers. We encountered a 79 -year-old male from Yun-Lin, a county in Southwest Taiwan, who presented with a progressing tumor in his right anterior chest wall. In addition, numerous keratoses and scaly skin lesions were noted on his trunk and extremities, some of which were combined with erosions. The patient was diagnosed with chronic arsenic poisoning with multiple BD and the huge tumor was confirmed as an epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor...|$|E
40|$|The arsenic-containing rural {{drinking}} groundwater {{was treated}} by adsorption method in the paper. It was studied that the varieties and dosages of adsorbents, pH value and adsorption time {{have an effect}} on removal of arsenic. The experimental results indicated that the rate of arsenic removal is able to reach 91. 39 % at room temperature and under the condition of neutral pH values, 2. 0 g of zeolite as adsorbent and 1 h of adsorption time. The content of arsenic in the treated drinking groundwater can be up to the current national hygiene standards of rural drinking water (< 0. 05 mg /L). Arsenic is a kind of highly toxic protoplasmic poison which may cause cancer, mutation or teratogenicity. Chronically drinking the highly arsenic water will cause a lot of diseases, such as <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease,</b> neuropathy, vascular injury and so on [1 - 3]. The toxicity of arsenic is relative to its valence states. Simple substance arsenic is harmless and organic arsenic and arsenic (V) is less toxic. But arsenic (III) is the most toxic to cells, which is able to produce the certain conjugate combining with sulfhydryl group on the protein to exhibit toxicity by preventing cell respiratio...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative {{analysis}} for the risk of human cancer from the ingestion of inorganic arsenic {{has been based on}} the reported cancer mortality experience in the <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD) –endemic area of southwest Taiwan. Linear regression analysis shows that arsenic as the sole etiologic factor accounts for only 21 % {{of the variance in the}} village standardized mortality ratios for bladder and lung cancer. A previous study had reported the influence of confounders (township, BFD prevalence, and artesian well dependency) qualitatively, but they have not been introduced into a quantitative assessment. In this six-township study, only three townships (2, 4, and 6) showed a significant positive dose–response relationship with arsenic exposure. The other three townships (0, 3, and 5) demonstrated significant bladder and lung cancer risks that were independent of arsenic exposure. The data for bladder and lung cancer mortality for townships 2, 4, and 6 fit an inverse linear regression model (p < 0. 001) with an estimated threshold at 151 μg/L (95 % confidence interval, 42 to 229 μg/L). Such a model is consistent with epidemiologic and toxicologic literature for bladder cancer. Exploration of the southwest Taiwan cancer mortality data set has clarified the dose–response relationship with arsenic exposure by separating out township as a confounding factor...|$|E
40|$|Summary Chronic {{exposure}} of humans to {{high concentrations of}} {{arsenic in drinking water}} is associated with skin lesions, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> and a high risk of cancer. Arsenic induces single strand breaks, DNA-protein crosslinks and apurinic sites in DNA, which are prerequisites for induction of cancer. Amelioration of such damages with natural compounds could be an effective strategy to combat arsenic toxicity. Curcumin is the active ingredient of turmeric, a common household spice, which is a rich source of polyphenols and this compound has been extensively studied as a chemopreventive agent against many types of cancer. The present study investigates whether curcumin could counteract the DNA damage caused by arsenic as assessed by single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) using peripheral blood lymphocytes, from healthy donors. It was observed that DNA damage induced by arsenic could be efficiently reduced by curcumin and the effect was more pronounced when lymphocytes were pre-incubated with curcumin prior to arsenic insult. Arsenic caused DNA damage by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhancement of lipid peroxidation levels. Curcumin counteracted the damage by quenching ROS, decreasing the level of lipid peroxidation and increasing the level of phase II detoxification enzymes like catalase, superoxide dismutase an...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic {{exposure}} is a likely cause of <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> {{and a potential}} risk factor for atherosclerosis. The authors performed a systematic review of the epidemiologic evidence on the association between arsenic and cardiovas-cular outcomes. The search period was January 1966 through April 2005. Thirteen studies conducted in general populations (eight in high-arsenic areas in Taiwan, five in other countries) and 16 studies conducted in occupa-tional populations were identified. Exposure was assessed ecologically in most studies. In Taiwan, relative risks comparing the highest arsenic exposure category with the lowest ranged from 1. 59 to 4. 90 for coronary disease, from 1. 19 to 2. 69 for stroke, and from 1. 66 to 4. 28 for peripheral arterial disease. In other general populations, relative risks ranged from 0. 84 to 1. 54 for coronary disease, from 0. 69 to 1. 53 for stroke, and from 0. 61 to 1. 58 for peripheral arterial disease. In occupational populations, relative risks ranged from 0. 40 to 2. 14 for coronary disease mortality and from 0. 30 to 1. 33 for stroke mortality. Methodologic limitations, however, limited interpretation of the moderate-to-strong associations between high arsenic exposure and cardiovascular outcomes in Taiwan. In other populations or in occupational settings, the evidence was inconclusive. Because of the high prevalence of arsenic exposure, carefully performed studies of arsenic and cardiovascular outcomes should be a research priority...|$|E
40|$|Arsenicosis is {{a serious}} {{environmental}} chemical disease in China mainly caused by drinking water from pump wells contaminated by high levels of arsenic. Chronic exposure of humans to high concentrations of {{arsenic in drinking water}} is associated with skin lesions, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease,</b> and high risk of cancers. Lead by the Ministry of Health of China, we carried out a research about arsenicosis in China recently. Areas contaminated with arsenic from drinking water are determined by 10 % pump well water sample method while areas from burning coal are determined by existing data. Two epidemic areas of Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia are investigated for the distribution of pump wells containing high arsenic. Well water in all the investigated villages of Shanxi Province showed polluted by high arsenic, and the average rate of unsafe pump well water is 52 %. In Inner Mongolia, the high percentage of pump wells containing elevated arsenic is found only in a few villages. The average rate of unsafe pump well water is 11 %. From our research, we find that new endemic areas are continuously emerging in China. Up to now, epidemic areas of arsenicosis mainly involve eight provinces and 37 counties in China. In the affected areas, the discovery of wells and coal with high levels of arsenic is continuing sporadically, and a similar scattered distribution pattern of patients is also being observed...|$|E
40|$|Arsenic-related {{peripheral}} vascular {{disease has}} been reported in many countries, including Taiwan, where the disease was called <b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD) after the dry gangrene at its terminal stages. Because the induction period of BFD is twenty to thirty years, the authors speculated that subclinical arterial insufficiency might be present. The {{purpose of this study was}} to detect possible minor arterial insufficiency in the seemingly normal subjects who had consumed the high-arsenic well water for more than thirty years. Twenty-three seemingly normal men living in BFD-hyperendemic villages and 28 age-sex-BMI-matched men from a nearby nonendemic area were recruited. All of them were not obese, had neither diabetes mellitus nor hypertension, did not smoke, and had normal Doppler ultrasound examination findings at rest. Brachial pressures on both arms and ankle pressures on both right and left dorsal pedal and posterior tibial arteries were measured before and after treadmill exercise (1. 2 mph, 10 % grade, ten minutes). Before exercise, brachial pressures, ankle pressures, ankle-brachial index, and ankle-brachial gradients were similar in BFD area and nonBFD area groups. After exercise, ankle pressure increased in correspondence to increased brachial pressure in the nonBFD area group, maintaining ankle-brachial index and ankle-brachial gradient within normal limits. However, in the BFD area group, a paradoxical drop of ankle pressures led to a significant fall of ankle-brachial index and ankle-brachial gradient.

40|$|Globalisation {{contributed to}} the {{introduction}} of novel foods into the Spanish diet, among the seaweed, able to accumulate toxic elements and among them arsenic (As). It is considered necessary to obtain information on the As contents in seaweeds that can be considered safe. Arsenic is a metalloid with four oxidation states, that give rise to a high variety of compounds having different physical and chemical characteristics. The As species differ also in their biological and toxicological properties, depending not only of the valence state, but also of the inorganic and organic forms. The latter have the lowest toxic potential, being therefore the adverse effects determined mainly by the inorganic As fraction, being As (III) toxicity higher than those of As(V). Arsenic specie affects the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. As methylated forms (MMA and DMA), the main forms present in many seaweeds are considered of a lower toxicity, the binding to tissues is lower and the elimination quicker than those of non-methylated species. Organoarseniacal compounds are metabolised in a lower extent and rapidly excreted. Regarding As toxicity, symptomatology of acute intoxication via oral exposition include; diarrhoea, gastrointestinal colic type pains, anorexia, weight lose, severe vomiting, muscular cramps, heart disorders, central nervous system disorders, irritability increase, exanthem and hair lose. These symptoms are observed in adults after a 3 mg As intake per day during several weeks. Chronic exposure causes skin lesions, hipo and hiperpigmentation (<b>blackfoot</b> <b>disease),</b> vaso-occlusive and gangrenous disorders, peripherical neuropaties, encephalopathy, alteration of hemo group metabolism, hepathomegalia, bone marrow depression, diabetes and impairment of renal function (necrosis).

40|$|The {{level of}} arsenic (As) in rice plants can be {{affected}} by the groundwater used for irrigation, type and concentration of As in the soil, and soil properties of paddy fields. In this study, the interrelationships among As levels in various parts of rice plants (Oryza sativa L.) and soils, as well as the As concentrations in soil pore water and groundwater in paddy fields that were irrigated with As-contained groundwater have been investigated at selected locations in an area where there was an endemic <b>Blackfoot</b> <b>disease</b> (BFD) before 1990, in the Chianan Plain of southwestern Taiwan. Results show that the total As concentrations in the groundwater used for irrigation of the sampled paddy fields at Hsuechia, Yichu, and Budai in the Chianan Plain are in the range of 32. 9 to 175. 7 mu g L- 1. Arsenite is present in paddy soils under flooded conditions, as a result of As accumulation from irrigated groundwater, and this As has been taken up into the roots and translocated to the shoots and leaves of the rice plants. The translocation of As from roots to shoots is minor for all the sampled rice plants, keeping the As in the root system and allowing rice plants to survive in high As soil. The lower translocaton factor (< 0. 05) for the translocation from roots to shoots indicates a lower proportion of As transfer from roots to the parts of the plant aboveground, suggesting that root tissues have a strong capability to hold As...|$|E
