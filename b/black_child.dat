We analyzed 791 children in the CCG 2891 trial and confirmed positive findings in 850 children in the CCG 2961 trial. Hispanic and <b>black</b> <b>children</b> treated with chemotherapy in CCG 2891 had significantly inferior overall survival (OS) from study entry compared with white children (37 %± 9 % vs 48 %± 4 % [P =. 016] and 34 % ± 10 % vs 48 % ± 4 %, [P =. 007], respectively). Significantly fewer <b>black</b> <b>children</b> had related donors. Analyses of CCG 2961 confirmed that <b>black</b> <b>children</b> had significantly decreased OS rates compared with white children (45 % ± 12 % vs 60 % ± 4 %; P =. 007) The difference in OS rates between Hispanic and white children approached statistical significance (51 % ± 8 % vs 60 % ± 4 %; P =. 065) Only 7. 5 % of <b>black</b> <b>children</b> on CCG 2961 had an available family donor. In conclusion, Hispanic and <b>black</b> <b>children</b> with AML have worse survival than white children. Access to chemotherapy, differences in supportive care or leukemia phenotype, and reduced compliance are unlikely explanations for this difference because therapy was given intravenously according to CCG protocols.
