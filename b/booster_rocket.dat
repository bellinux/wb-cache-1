5|$|Barbree {{grew up on}} his family's farm in Early County, Georgia, {{and entered}} the United States Air Force in 1950, {{when he was only}} 16 years of age. Following the Air Force, Barbree began his {{broadcast}} journalism career at WALB in Albany, Georgia where, in 1957, he saw Sputnik's spent <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> orbiting in the sky and then wrote radio and TV reports about the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} became operational in {{the summer}} of 1957, {{just in time for the}} launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. While the transmissions from Sputnik itself could easily be picked up by a household radio, the Lovell Telescope was the only telescope capable of tracking Sputnik's <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> by radar; it first located it just before midnight on 12 October 1957. It also located Sputnik 2's carrier rocket at just after midnight on 16 November 1957.|$|E
5|$|EF-84E: Two F-84Es were {{converted}} into test prototypes, to test various methods of air-to-air refueling. EF-84E 49-2091 {{was used as}} a probe-and-drogue test aircraft. The probe was mid-span on the port wing. Production aircraft with probes (removable) had the probe fitted to the auxiliary wing tanks. EF-84E 49-2115 {{was used as a}} FICON test aircraft with a B-36 host. EF-84E 49-1225 and EF-84E 51-634 were test aircraft for the ZELMAL (Zero-length launch, Mat landing) experiments version for point defense, used the <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> from MGM-1 Matador cruise missile.|$|E
50|$|The Abhyas is {{launched}} from a mobile launcher {{with the help}} of two 68 mm <b>booster</b> <b>rockets</b> (being manufactured at ordinance factories). At the end of its launch phase the burnout <b>booster</b> <b>rockets</b> are jettisoned. Thereafter, the main gas-turbine engine powers the vehicle during cruise phase.|$|R

5|$|The China National Space Administration offers NASA the Taiyang Shen, a {{classified}} <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> that {{can carry a}} payload to Mars. Meanwhile, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises a trajectory to divert Hermes back to Mars for a rescue {{more than two years}} earlier, using the Chinese booster to resupply Hermes for an additional eighteen months. Sanders rejects the plan, refusing to risk the crew, but Henderson surreptitiously sends the details to Hermes. The crew unanimously vote for the plan, and NASA — powerless to stop them — resupplies Hermes as it uses Earth's gravity to slingshot back to Mars.|$|E

25|$|High-altitude version to {{intercept}} the Lockheed U-2, {{equipped with a}} self-contained liquid-fuel <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> pack; {{appears to have been}} abandoned because of inability to control the aircraft at very high altitudes and the aircraft's tendency to enter supersonic spins.|$|E
25|$|Cassini–Huygens was {{launched}} on October 15, 1997, from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex40 using a U.S.Air Force Titan IVB/Centaur rocket. The complete launcher {{was made up}} of a two-stage Titan IV <b>booster</b> <b>rocket,</b> two strap-on solid rocket motors, the Centaur upper stage, and a payload enclosure, or fairing.|$|E
25|$|The AAM-A-1 Firebird was a {{two-stage}} weapon, {{fitted with}} cruciform wings and tailfins. Control was by differential {{motion of the}} wings; the tailfins were fixed. The missile's fuselage was constructed from aluminum alloy, while the nosecone and control fins were molded from plastic. Firebird was fitted with a solid-fuel <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> providing initial thrust, before a liquid-fuel sustainer rocket ignited for a 15-second powered flight time.|$|E

50|$|The Titan IIIM was {{a planned}} American {{expendable}} launch system, intended {{to launch the}} Manned Orbiting Laboratory and other payloads. Development was cancelled in 1969. The projected UA1207 solid <b>booster</b> <b>rockets</b> were eventually used on the Titan IV.|$|R
25|$|On November 23, 2015, Blue Origin's New Shepard <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> {{made the}} first {{successful}} vertical landing following an unmanned suborbital test flight that reached space. On December 21, 2015, SpaceX's 20th Falcon 9 first stage made a successful landing after boosting 11 commercial satellites to low earth orbit on Falcon 9 Flight 20. These demonstrations potentially open the way for substantial reductions in space flight costs.|$|E
25|$|ISRO has {{tentatively}} slated the prototype's {{test flight}} from the first launchpad of Sriharikota spaceport for February 2016, but the date would be finalized depending on the completion of construction. The proposed RLV is designed in two parts; a manned space plane rigged atop a single stage, <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> using solid fuel. The rocket is expendable while the RLV would fly back to Earth and land like a normal airplane after the mission.|$|E
25|$|Outside the Soviet Union, the {{satellite}} was tracked by amateur radio operators in many countries. The US government followed {{it from the}} Central Radio Propagation Laboratory of the National Bureau of Standards. The <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> was located and tracked by the British using the Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the only telescope in the world {{able to do so}} by radar. Canada's Newbrook Observatory was the first facility in North America to photograph Sputnik 1.|$|E

[...] His thin-wall structures included missiles, <b>booster</b> <b>rockets,</b> and a movable dome for Palomar Observatory. This work was performed as consultant to NASA and industry.|$|R
50|$|Luna E-1 No.1 was {{launched}} on 23 September 1958 atop a Luna 8K72 carrier rocket, flying from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Ninety two seconds after launch, longitudinal resonance within the <b>rocket's</b> strap-on <b>booster</b> <b>rockets</b> caused {{the vehicle to}} disintegrate.|$|R
50|$|The Ariane 3 {{followed}} the same basic design as the earlier Ariane 1, but incorporated modifications made for the Ariane 2. Unlike the Ariane 2, two solid-fuelled PAP strap-on <b>booster</b> <b>rockets</b> were used to augment the first stage at liftoff.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} years, {{research}} at Wallops concentrated on obtaining aerodynamic data at transonic and low supersonic speeds. Between 1959 and 1961, Project Mercury capsules were tested at Wallops {{in support of}} NASA's manned space flight program - the Mercury program - before astronauts were launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Some of these tests using the Little Joe <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> were designed to flight-qualify components of the spacecraft, including the escape and recovery systems {{and some of the}} life support systems. Two rhesus monkeys, Sam and Miss Sam, were sent aloft as pioneers for astronauts; both were recovered safely.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of his {{background}} and expertise in aeronautical and aerospace risk management and analysis, Grose has received presidential and federal appointments to various panels and committees addressing risk and safety measures related to aircraft and maritime disasters. In 1969, Wernher von Braun, director of the Marshall Space Flight Center, appointed Grose to serve a two-year term on NASA's Safety Advisory Group for Space Flight in Huntsville, Alabama. Under von Braun's leadership, he served {{as a member of the}} team that designed the Saturn V <b>booster</b> <b>rocket,</b> which served as the launching vehicle on the Apollo spacecraft, enabling the first landing of men on the Moon.|$|E
25|$|Pye Wacket {{was planned}} to be tested using a rocket sled launcher, with a Mach 5 <b>booster</b> <b>rocket</b> being used later in the test program. There are {{unconfirmed}} reports that some tests were conducted in 1960. However the high cost and perceived vulnerability of the B-70 against the projected performance of Soviet air defenses, combined with the 1960 U-2 incident in which a high-flying spyplane had been shot down, led to the decision that intercontinental ballistic missiles would, in the future, be the primary nuclear delivery force of the United States, and therefore the B-70 project was cancelled in early 1961. Pye Wacket, its delivery vehicle no longer available, {{is believed to have}} been cancelled soon after, although the ultimate fate of the program remains classified.|$|E
50|$|The {{first stage}} of Soyuz rockets {{consists}} of four identical conical liquid <b>booster</b> <b>rockets,</b> strapped to the second stage core. Each booster has a single rocket motor with four combustion chambers, two vernier combustion chambers, and one set of turbopumps.|$|R
