Forecasting inflation is important in order to assist the government in taking monetary policy to maintain economic stability in the future. In general, forecasting inflation can be done with time series approach, causal approach, and a combination of time series and causal approaches. Models with a combined approach that is widely used for forecasting inflation is ARIMAX model that includes Transfer Function and Intervention Model or also known as dynamic regression models. In addition, Generalized Autoregresive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) for variance has also been applied to models in forecasting inflation.

40|$|Objective: {{to measure}} a {{health-related}} {{quality of life}} in a way that reflects salient features of health as perceived by a representative sample of the adult population of the UK. Choosing a descriptive system: with data from a survey of 600 people in the West Midlands, we appraised 6 existing ways of measuring health-related quality of life and chose EuroQol. Choosing a valuation method: Phase I: two direct methods (Time Trade-Off [TTO]) and Magnitude Estimation [ME]) and two indirect ones (Pairwise Comparison and Category Rating [CR]) were studied. A survey of almost 300 subjects in the City of York led us to discard ME in favour of TTO. Choosing a valuation method: Phase II: {{in the early stages of}} Phase II we tested TTO against SG on a within-subject basis. Our findings were that there was little to choose between them, but TTO had more complex data and more consistent valuations at individual level. The main survey: 1993 pilots: the first pilot indicated that respondents could not handle more than 15 states. The second was a “full dress rehearsal” for the main survey. The main survey: design and execution: each interview consisted of: self-reported health; ranking of states; VAS rating of states; TTO rating of states; personal data. The main fieldwork was conducted in late 1993. The main survey: results: 3395 interviews were achieved, a response rate of 64 %, The data on self-reported health showed that problems generally increase with age, and within every age group, by social class too. With the VAS, median scores were all positive (i. e. every date was rated as better than being dead by a majority of respondents). Higher median scores were given by the lower social classes and by the less educated, meaning that they do not think that poorer health states are as bad as the others do. With the TTO far more states were rated worse than being dead. There were some differences between men and women, and also according to marital status and employment status, but the most marked effect was age. AT retest all 3 methods proved very reliable at both group and individual levels. The main survey: modelling the “tariff”: to interpolate values for the remaining 200 EuroQol states from the 45 on which we had direct valuations, the preferred model (known as “Dolan-N 3 ”) predicts the value of a health state from its components by attaching a (negative) value to each separate deviation from good health. Our <b>basic</b> <b>tariff,</b> for use when a weighting system is required for use in an economic evaluation, is the one of mean values based on the individual TTO scores.

40|$|International audienceDo tariffs inhibit {{trade flows}} by {{limiting}} the entry of exporters (‘firm extensive margin’) or by restricting the average volume exported by each firm (‘firm intensive margin’) ? Using a gravity equation approach, we analyze how the decrease in tariffs promoted during the 90 s by the Uruguay Round multilateral trade agreement affected the trade margins of French firms for 57 sectors and 147 countries from 1993 to 2002. Our main contribution is to estimate the elasticity of trade on both margins, controlling for the unobserved heterogeneity of trade flows thanks to a three-dimensional panel and to time-varying tariffs {{as a measure of}} variable trade costs. Our results show that the number of firms exporting in a given sector to a given destination is related to the level of tariffs.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need to adjust demand to match supply in {{electrical}} networks (rather than vice versa, under the ‘predict and provide’ model). The move towards more dynamic pricing {{is part of the}} development of ‘active demand’, a way of discouraging usage when systems are under stress, and making renewable generation more viable. What is it realistic to expect from time-varying or capacity-related tariffs and associated methods of network management, including direct load control? Electricity tariffs are devised by experts but used by non-experts, and as yet we do not understand much about what different tariff types mean in terms of everyday practices. This paper analyses material from six focus groups carried out in the UK for the ADEPT project (Advanced Dynamic Electricity Pricing and Tariffs). Householders discussed the general principle of time-varying pricing, and considered six options including a static time-of-use tariff, critical day pricing, real-time pricing, and capacity charging/load-capping.

40|$|In this {{teaching}} note, {{we discuss}} the <b>basic</b> principles for <b>tariff</b> setting. Tariff setting {{is very important for}} regulated industries, such as water and power. The tariff should provide an appropriate risk-adjusted return to the investor. If the tariff were too low, then the investors would not be willing to invest. On the other hand, if the tariff were too high, then it would reduce the consumers’ welfare. We examine the Rate of Return method for calculating the tariff in a regulated firm. In the rate of return method, the tariff compensates the investor for all the costs that the investor incurs, including a fair return. We use the discounted cash flow approach to value the return that the investor receives. The results of both calculations must be consistent. In particular, using simple examples, we show that {{in the presence of a}} positive expected inflation rate, the typical tariff calculation, Rate of return method, is an overestimation of the required payment to the equity holder. ...|$|R

Financial {{indicators}} {{for the four}} utilities had been below the Albanian average {{at the beginning of}} the management contract, although the Albanian average was already below the average of other formerly communist countries. From this dismal starting point the collection efficiency and cost recovery improved somewhat, but remained far from satisfactory: Collection efficiency was 56-81% and operating cost recovery 40-60% {{at the beginning of the}} contract. The objective of 79% collection efficiency was reached in only one city, while the objective of operation cost recovery was not reached in any city despite tariff increases. Residential water tariffs almost doubled in two cities and almost tripled in the other two between 2002 and 2008. They were 15-20 Lek per cubic meter in 2002 (11-15 Euro Cent) and stood at 35-43 Lek (29-36 Euro Cent) in 2008. In order to protect the poor from tariff increases, the Government supported the four municipalities to test a free basic water policy. Low-income metered households were to be provided 20 liters per capita per day free of charge beginning in 2004. However, the policy was difficult to implement, because metering is a precondition for free basic water and only about 20% of residential customers were metered.

The approach unanimously recommended for patients with DFU is treatment by a multidisciplinary foot care team, which in Russia mainly is limited to few federal and regional hospitals. Currently, financing schemes for medical institutions are changing, thus raising the issue of setting adequate tariffs. ObjectiveTo identify the cost of treatment in the specialized diabetic foot department and determinants of variation in cost among individual patients with DFU in the Russian setting from the perspective of a health care organization. MethodsWe collected data on treatment cost per admission to the Diabetic Foot Department of the Endocrinology Scientific Center and information on patients’ characteristics derived from medical records. Data on costs were analyzed, and descriptive statistics are reported. A standard multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the main drivers of treatment cost for patients with DFU. ResultsThe mean treatment cost was € 3051. The mean cost of treatment for patients with DFU was significantly higher than that for diabetic patients without this complication. The most relevant predictors of the costs of treatment for patients with DFU were surgery provided and length of stay in hospital. ConclusionsThe cost for treatment of DFU by a multidisciplinary team in the federal medical institution was substantially higher than <b>basic</b> medical insurance <b>tariff</b> for this disease.

40|$|Access to clean, {{affordable}} and appropriate energy {{is an important}} enabler of development. Energy allows households to meet their most basic subsistence needs; it is a central feature of all the millennium development goals (MDGs) and, while a {{lack of access to}} energy may not be a cause of poverty, addressing the energy needs of the impoverished lets them access services which in turn address the causes of poverty. While much is known about the factors affecting the decisions made when choosing between fuel types within a household, few quantitative studies have been carried out in South Africa {{to determine the extent to}} which these factors affect energy choice decisions. It is assumed that the factors traditionally included in economic demand such as price and income of the household affect choice; tastes and preferences as well as external factors such as distance to fuel suppliers are expected to influence preferences. This study follows two typical low-income rural sites in South Africa, Antioch and Garagapola, where the Electricity <b>Basic</b> Services Support <b>Tariff</b> (EBSST) was piloted in 2002. The EBSST is set at 50 Â kWh/month per household for low domestic consumers; this is worth approximately R 201 (Â±US$ 3). This subsidy is a lifeline tariff, where households receive the set amount of units per month, free of charge irrespective of whether more units are purchased. These data (collected in 2001 and 2002), recently collated with detailed electricity consumption data, allow us to determine the drivers of electricity consumption within these households. The sample analysed is taken from the initial phase of the study, when no FBE had been introduced to the households. This enabled the study presented here to make use of the well-populated datasets to assess what affects the electricity use decision in these households. This paper attempts to assess which factors affected the decision-making process for electricity consumption within these households. A brief history of the electricity industry and the electrification is provided and the theoretical background for the electricity consumption model is provided. It was found that income, woodfuel usage, iron ownership and credit obtained were significant in determining consumption levels within these households. Price and cross-price elasticities were difficult to assess due to lack of data within the sample. The results have many possible implications for policy, including the effect that easily obtained credit has for low-income households. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of a survey on {{domestic}} energy use in the community of Nkweletshini in south-western Kwa-Zulu Natal during 2002. The community has a low housing density, below the 50 households per km 2 measure used by Eskom as the limit for future electrification. Houses were modest, with a median number of 3 rooms, and built of either clay or cement blocks, and generally thatched although some had corrugated iron roofs. Many in the community are employed, but it is relatively low-level employment, with a median income of about R 660 /month/household. 96 % of all households cook on wood collected free of charge in the vicinity. 3 % cook on paraffin and 1 % on LP gas. The primary appliance is a wood stove; 4 % of the households use an open brazier (“imbaula”). 78 % of households reported problems with the fuel they used because it made them cough (43 %); it smelled (30 %); or it smoked and hurt the eyes (24 %). 65 % of the households reported a second choice of fuel, which was generally paraffin. The cost of paraffin relative to wood was cited as its major disadvantage. Cleaner fuels were preferred on social occasions, when the household had guests. Cooking took place once or twice a day, rarely in the evening, food cooked earlier in the day being heated for an evening meal. The profiles for space heating and water heating were very similar to that for cooking, with a significant quantity of wood being burned for these purposes even in summer. Space heating took place throughout the day, with a morning peak between 06 h 00 and 08 h 00, starting somewhat earlier in winter. There was little water heating during the day. There were two sources of lighting in the community, candles (70 %) and paraffin lamps (30 %). 59 % of the candle users did not like the source of light, while 62 % of the paraffin users did not like lamps. The average household bought 3 packets (each containing 6 candles) per month. The primary appliances in Nkweletshini were radios (91 %, battery powered); kettles (86 % of households, non-electrical); television (34 %, battery powered), and cell phones (17 %, battery powered). Average radio use was close to 24 h/day. The average household consumed 12. 1 bundles of wood per month, or somewhere between 300 and 400 kg of wood. Most households collected wood themselves – only two relied on neighbours or relatives. Wood collection was clearly a major effort. Most wood was collected first thing in the morning, somewhat earlier in summer than in winter, but even in winter 25 % of the households were collecting wood between 04 h 00 and 06 h 00. It was only between the hours of midnight and 04 h 00 that collection ceased. 94 % of the householders purchased paraffin. Monthly volumes averaged 12. 6 litres per household that bought paraffin. The calculated average price was R 3. 00 per litre, which is very close to the known cost of paraffin in the area. Over 20 % of households made use of car batteries, primarily for television, and recharged them twice a month on average. 67 % of the households purchased the 9 V PM 9 batteries, primarily for radio, using 2 per month on average. Less than 10 % of the households made much use of torches, buying about 4 batteries per month. These results are discussed in terms of the total energy demand of the households (4 000 to 5 500 MJ/month) and the time-of-day requirements that peak in the early morning rather than in the evening {{as is the case in}} urban and semi-urban environments.

40|$|The {{economic}} liberalization policies initiated in 1991 have led India {{along the path}} of increased economic growth and greater macroeconomic stability. Real GDP growth averaged 6 % over the period 1997 - 2001, exceeded 8 % from 2002 - 2005 and is projected to be about 9. 2 % in 2006. This rapid economic growth has been supported by a loosening of trade restrictions which have contributed to a rapid increase in both imports and exports. Between 2000 and 2005, imports increased from $US 50 billion to $US 149 billion while exports increased from $US 36 billion to $US 103 billion. Future economic growth may be tempered by rising inflation, which is projected to be almost 7 % in 2006, and rapidly increasing wage rates for skilled labor. For example, food price inflation rose by 10 % in 2006. In addition, poor infrastructure (especially roads, ports and electrical power distribution), restrictive labor laws and poor quality public services (especially in education and health) also pose serious challenges to continued high levels of economic growth in India. It is estimated that almost 40 % of India’s fruit and vegetable harvest rots before reaching market due to inadequacies in the transportation and electrical distribution infrastructure. India will continue the process of opening its economy {{due to the fact}} that it must create on the order of 15 million new jobs every year simply to provide employment for young people entering the job market. However, future economic growth is dependent on reducing (and eventually eliminating) subsidies and providing improvements in the road and electrical distribution infrastructure, particularly in the rural areas of India. The forest cover in India is estimated to be 637, 293 km 2; 19. 4 % of the total land area. India’s forests are mostly state owned; only 10 % of the forests are classified as community or private forests. A recent survey by domestic and international organizations revealed a moderate increase in India’s forest cover. Forest plantations play a very important role as a source of raw material to the domestic wood-based industry. Since adopting the National Forest Policy of 1988 (NFP), there has been a ban on the felling of trees in all forests located above an altitude of 1, 000 meters. In addition, high priority has been given for planting fuelwood and deciduous fodder producing trees in government forests. Finally, industrial wood production was restricted to farms and wastelands. As a result, there was a drastic reduction in timber harvest volumes as a number of states stopped timber harvesting and a ban was announced on all harvest operations in the national parks and protected sanctuaries. The NFP emphasized meeting the fuelwood, fodder and small timber needs of local communities rather than the raw material requirements of the wood-based industry. It should be noted than even before the NFP was implemented in 1988, the existing forest policy was more conservation oriented than industry oriented. The raw material crisis for the wood-based industries became more acute following the adoption of the NFP. As a result, the forest-based industries have had to increase their dependence on private forests and bamboo from natural forests (bamboo harvesting from natural forests is permitted) for their raw material supply. Though large reforestation programs were proposed in conjunction with the NFP budget, constraints prevented the forestry department from meeting the reforestation targets. To meet the community demand for fuelwood, small timber plantations were designed which provided timber products that were less useful for industry. In order to improve the availability of raw materials, the NFP proposed the liberalization of log, chips and pulp imports. The Indian forest products industry, both the wood products sector and the paper and paperboard sector, have been constrained by severe raw materials shortages. This raw material shortage for the forest products industry has been further accentuated as a result of a Supreme Court ruling limiting the felling and movement of timber within the country. In an effort to alleviate the raw material shortage, the forest products industry is increasingly relying on imported logs, chips, wood pulp and waste paper. Hence, for the wood-based industries, imports have become a very important component of their raw material mix. The graduated structure of tariffs applied on wood product imports clearly indicates that the Indian government encourages the import of unprocessed lumber that can be used by the wood-based industries as raw material inputs. Higher tariff rates are imposed on imported finished and value added products to protect the less efficient domestic manufacturers from international competition. In addition to the <b>basic</b> import <b>tariffs,</b> India also imposes duties such as surcharges, additional customs duties and special additional duties. Other additional levies can be imposed on imported wood products depending on the nature of the product. These additional levies include countervailing duties, anti-dumping duties and safeguard duties. Other non-tariff barriers include state taxes, which can be as high as 18 % of the value of imports and various port of entry restrictions which might add up to a large mark-up on imported items. Such tariff and non-tariff barriers by the government make imported products less competitive in India. Over the past decade the tariff rates and the non tariff barriers have been reduced dramatically and India has started importing large volumes of forest products. Indian trade in forest products has increased tremendously over the period 1999 - 2005. This is in response to both the decline in the domestic timber harvest as well as the increased demand for wood products within the domestic wood processing industry. Over the period 2000 - 2005 Indian exports of wood products jumped from $US 30 million to $US 99 million, a 230 % increase. In contrast, imports of wood products went from $US 528 million to $US 957 million, an 82 % increase over the same period. As a result, India saw its balance of trade in wood products worsen from $US 498 in 2000 to $US 858 million in 2005. It is important to note that over 88 % of India’s wood imports were logs, primarily from Malaysia and Myanmar. Housing has long been neglected in India’s national 5 -year plans. The unfulfilled demand for housing was estimated to be approximately 50 million units in 2001 and was projected to be increasing at a steady rate. This housing shortage stems from a lack of government funding and the inadequacy of financial institutions, coupled with an increase in building material, labor and land costs. In the tenth five-year plan, from 2002 – 2007 special emphasis has been given to the housing sector and some state governments have announced a target of achieving “shelter for all” by 2012. Efforts have also been made to reform the allied institutions in an attempt to provide support to the housing sector. The government is beginning to view the housing sector as a very important driver of economic expansion and increased employment. These new initiatives by the government and the huge latent demand for housing, coupled with an expanding economy, should result in higher housing starts in the country over the next decade. The middle class population in India, which is almost the size of the US population, is becoming more exposed to the western life-style and is showing an interest in western style doors, windows and kitchen cabinets. India has a centuries old tradition of wood use, particularly for interior design and furniture. Although structural wood is rarely used for construction, outside observers have noted that India uses more interior wood than Japan. Recent estimates suggest that the market for high end imported value-added wood products is increasing steadily as a result of continuing economic prosperity in India. This represents one of the largest emerging markets for value-added wood products in the world. New residential construction, primarily multifamily units, are increasingly going to standardized sizes for doors, windows, and interior fittings. This has led to an increased demand for imported doors, windows and cabinets. The total annual demand for furniture in India is estimated to be $US 1. 25 billion of which 90 % is for wooden furniture. The market for branded (higher quality) wooden furniture is estimated to be $US 37 million and growing at an annual rate of 15 %. Imports of wood products into India have been growing rapidly, although the demand for wood products is heavily skewed towards raw materials such as logs, chips and pulp. While the middle class in India is growing and becoming more open towards using imported value-added wood products, much work needs to be done to take advantage of this demand. For example, India must accelerate their rationalization of import tariffs and remove those non-tariff barriers designed to protect inefficient domestic manufacturers from international competition. This will not only ensure compliance with their WTO obligations but will also force the domestic processing industry to invest in more efficient processing technologies. In addition, there remain long-term opportunities to introduce North-American wood frame construction technology in India. The combination of a severe housing shortage and interest in developing energy efficient housing both provide impetus for working to gain acceptance for wood frame construction. However, in order to achieve the successful introduction and adoption of wood frame construction it is important that the US government and industry associations work with the Indian government to develop and adopt wood frame building codes. Finally, acceptance of wood frame construction technology is dependent on increasing the familiarity and understanding of this construction technology within the architect and construction communities. A key element to gaining this acceptance could be in educating architects and residential builders on the superior environmental performance and energy efficiency of North-American wood frame construction technology...|$|R
