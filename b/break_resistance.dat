The county of Holland was split in two when Haarlem was conquered by the Spanish after a costly seven-month siege. Thereafter, Alba attempted to conquer Alkmaar in the north, but the city withstood the Spanish attack. Alba then sent his officer Francisco de Valdez to attack the southern rebel territory, starting with Leiden. In the meantime, due to his failure to quell the rebellion as quickly as he had intended, Alba submitted his resignation, which king Philip accepted in December.

Populations of mixed Meloidogyne spp. having a history of feeding on grape were among the fastest developing populations. Tolerance to nematode parasitism appeared to be based on different mechanisms.

While identifying some of the most sensitive global issues associated with such plastic packaging materials, Natural rubber latex was qualified in terms of many of its unique properties, essentially being a renewable resource. Sample production and testing were carried out at an industrial research and development facility where a comparative analysis was made to establish relative mechanical performance of rubber against Polyvinylchloride (PVC), Polypropylene (PP), and Polyethylene (PE) films.

At present, numerous studies are conducted on antineoplastic effects of the compounds. One of most effective biopolyphenols involves the flavonol quercetin. Our studies aimed at evaluation of antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of quercetin alone and in combinations with daunorubicin on cells of human pancreatic carcinoma lines. The experiments were conducted on two cell lines, sensitive to daunorubicin EPP 85 - 181 P line, and its resistant variant EPP 85 - 181 RDB. Effect of studied substances on cell proliferation was detected using sulphorhodamine B (SRB) protein staining method. Apoptotic damage was estimated using comet and TUNEL techniques.

The stability of a recombinant fusion protein, abatacept (Orencia), and a fully human recombinant immunoglobulin G 1, adalimumab (Humira), was assessed in silicone oil-free (SOF) and silicone oil-lubricated 1 -mL glass syringes and polymer-based syringes in accelerated stress study. Samples were subjected to agitation stress, and soluble aggregate levels were evaluated by size-exclusion chromatography and verified with analytical ultracentrifugation. In accordance with current regulatory expectations, the amounts of subvisible particles resulting from agitation stress were estimated using resonant mass measurement and dynamic flow-imaging analyses. The amount of aggregated protein and particle counts were similar between unlubricated polymer-based and glass syringes. The most significant protein loss was observed for lubricated glass syringes.

40|$|Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is {{the most}} {{important}} disease affecting cassava in Africa. The disease is caused by several whitefly-transmitted geminivirus species. The increasing impact of geminivirus-caused diseases on cassava production due to the recent pandemics has urged the scientific community to provide stable virus resistance in cassava. Advances in engineering virus resistance via RNA-based strategies have opened promising perspectives for the production of transgenic geminivirus resistant plants. In this thesis, three RNA-based strategies are developed to improve the resistance to African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV) in transgenic cassava. The first strategy was based on expression of antisense viral sequences. Three different viral coding sequences were targeted and several transgenic cassava lines expressing antisense viral sequences were ACMV resistant. The second strategy was to express intron hairpin double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) homologous to ACMV bidirectional Promoter. Transgenic cassava lines expressing small dsRNAs homologous to the ACMV promoter were not completely immune to ACMV infection but showed an enhanced recovery phenotype as cornpared to the infected wild-type cassava plants. The third strategy relied on the expression of intron hairpin dsRNAs homologousto viral coding sequences. Transgenic cassava lines expressing high levels of small RNAs homologous to the viral coding sequences were immune under ACMV infection tests in which virus load had been sufficient to <b>break</b> <b>resistance</b> elaborated with the first two strategies.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} and the chronology {{of the great}} crimes committed by totalitarian regimes are now well documented. While they may explain the mechanics of these events, they do not always explain why they transpired. The implementation of Stalin’s policy of collectivization and de-kulakization relied on dissimulation. Moreover, the pace of collectivization was justified by external threats, initially from Great Britain and Poland, and later extending to Japan. This made possible the branding of any political adversary as a traitor. As long as Stalin faced organized political opposition, {{he was unable to}} launch any maximal policies. After the defeat of Trotsky in December 1927 he was able to create crisis situations that ultimately furthered his own power. The offensive he unleashed against the peasants became a means of reinforcing his increasing dictatorship. The collectivization campaign employed the rational argument that the backward countryside needs to modernize production. Its ultimate aim, however, was the crushing of an independent peasantry. There are enlightening comparisons that can be made between collectivization in China and the USSR, which are explored in this essay. The resistance to collectivization was particularly strong amongst Ukrainians. Stalin, who had long regarded the national question as inseparable from the peasant question, deliberately chose mass starvation to <b>break</b> <b>resistance</b> to his will. The history of these events was for a long time shrouded in great secrecy until it began being discussed by Western scholars, becoming a matter of considerable debate between the “totalitarian” and “revisionist” schools of Soviet historiography...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} lateral ice {{pressure}} on the level ice resistance of a 1 / 30 scale model of an OBO is examined experimentally. The model was equipped with an instrumented side panel. The apparatus for producing lateral pressure is described, {{as well as the}} model tests themselves. Ice pressure were recorded using extensimeters mounted in the ice. The results indicate that the compressive pre-stress in the ice had little or no effect on the <b>breaking</b> <b>resistance.</b> However, as the model moved well into the pressurized region ice was forced against the hull and very high lateral loads were generated giving rise to frictional resistance. The test results indicate that bow reamers may be beneficial when operating in pressurized conditions. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

The Nazis were methodically destroying the ghetto, house by house, in order to <b>break</b> the <b>resistance.</b> Among those burning were the houses around Kupiecka 7, including the building where Ziemba was holed up.|$|R
