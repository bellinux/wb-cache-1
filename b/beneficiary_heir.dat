2500|$|Because of his {{opposition}} to the cession, Anthony Brooke was considered a suspect when Duncan Stewart, the second British governor to Sarawak, was assassinated by two people that were believed to be members of a group dedicated to restoring him as Rajah. In fact they were from a political group agitating for union with newly independent Indonesia. [...] He was never prosecuted. Documents released in the late 20th century indicate that the British Government knew that Brooke was not involved, but chose not to reveal {{the truth of the matter}} so not to provoke Indonesia. It had recently won its war of independence from the Netherlands, and the UK was already dealing with the Malayan Emergency to the north-west. Since those events, there has been no serious movement for the restoration of the monarchy, although Anthony's son James Bertram Lionel Brooke remains the principal <b>beneficiary</b> (<b>heir)</b> under the Will of Sir James Brooke.|$|E

50|$|A vested {{interest}} {{refers to an}} inheritance right which has become unconditionally fixed and established in the beneficiary, {{with the result that}} it forms an asset in the beneficiary’s estate; it may be disposed of by him or her inter vivos or mortis causa; and it is normally transmissible to the <b>beneficiary’s</b> <b>heirs</b> on his death (unless the right is purely personal to the beneficiary, such as a usufruct).|$|R
50|$|The Uniform Principal and Income Act (UPAIA) {{is one of}} {{the uniform}} acts that have been promulgated in an attempt to {{harmonize}} the law in all fifty U.S. states. The Act was completed by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1997, and amended in 2000. The purpose of the UPAIA (sometimes referred to as the UPIA) is to provide procedures by which trustees administering trusts, and personal representatives administering estates, allocate receipts and payments to principal and income. The aim of the law is to ensure that the intention of the trust creator or decedent is carried out, and to govern the proper distribution of assets to trust <b>beneficiaries,</b> <b>heirs</b> and devisees.|$|R

40|$|California {{recently}} passed legislation that creates retroactive, descendible rights of publicity. The New York State Assembly {{is poised to}} enact similar legislation. Legal recognition of postmortem rights of publicity permits a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s named <b>beneficiaries</b> or <b>heirs</b> to control (and financially benefit from) use of a deceased personality 2 ̆ 7 s image and likeness. Legislators, proponents of these laws, and legal commentators have overlooked two significant federal estate tax consequences of these new state law property rights. First, a descendible right of publicity likely {{will be included in}} a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes. Second, the estate tax value of rights of publicity easily could exceed the estate 2 ̆ 7 s liquid assets available to pay taxes. These tax concerns could be eliminated, however, by rewriting the statutes to limit a decedent 2 ̆ 7 s ability to control the disposition of any postmortem rights of publicity...|$|R
5000|$|Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are {{visited by}} [...] "the unhappy John Hector McFarlane", {{a young lawyer}} from Blackheath who {{has been accused of}} murdering one of his clients, a builder called Jonas Oldacre. McFarlane {{explains}} to Holmes that Oldacre had come to his office only the day before and asked him to draw up his will in legal language. McFarlane saw to his surprise that Oldacre was making him the sole <b>beneficiary,</b> and <b>heir</b> to a considerable bequest at that, and he cannot imagine why Oldacre would do so. This business took McFarlane to Oldacre's house in Lower Norwood where some documents had to be examined for legal purposes. These were kept in the safe where the murder allegedly took place. McFarlane left quite late and stayed at a local inn. He claims to have read about the murder in the newspaper the next morning on the train. The paper said quite clearly that the police were looking for him.|$|R

The first is a [...] "lead" [...] trust, wherein the charity is paid first, and the remainder, after trust termination, goes to <b>beneficiaries,</b> such as <b>heirs</b> or back to the donor. The second is a [...] "remainder" [...] trust, wherein the charity is paid last after termination of the trust, after other beneficiaries have received payments. Payments may be fixed amount, annuity trust, or a percentage of principal, which is called unitrust.|$|R
50|$|A {{trust is}} a {{particular}} juridical instrument by which a settler (disponente) can transfer a property (movable or immovable property) to a “trustee” who has to exercise and manage this right for a “beneficiary” (to whom the full property will be transferred with the termination of the trust) who has the “equitable right”. In civil law systems the beneficiary’s right is not a “diritto reale” but a “personal right” towards the “trustee”.If it is not foreseen by the constitutive contract, the property assets cannot be alienated by neither by the trustee nor by the beneficiary. Trust property cannot be foreclosed by the personal creditors of the trustee, the <b>beneficiary</b> or their <b>heirs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 Freedom of testation {{is a well}} {{established}} principle in South Africa although there are certain restrictions thereto such as the creation of fideicommissa in regard to fixed property and statutory limitations such as the Maintenance of the Surviving Spouses Act 27 of 1990. It appears that a divorced spouse is in certain circumstances {{in a better position}} than the surviving spouse - a position that appears to be unsatisfactory. The Act brought about an improvement for the surviving spouse who has been disinherited or for whom there has not been sufficiently catered for where there is in fact a need for maintenance. The principle of the Act is based on the need for maintenance by the surviving spouse. It is clear from the Act that the executor has the power to enter into agreements with the surviving spouse, heirs and legatees in terms of which assets may be transferred contrary to the will of the deceased. His assets may be transferred to a trust or the assets may be burdened by certain restrictive rights imposed on them in which case the <b>beneficiary</b> and <b>heir's</b> rights to deal with them are limited. The claim of a surviving spouse ranks concurrent with the claim of minor children for maintenance but does not compete with a claim by creditors of the estate. Estate planners must at all times keep the will of the testator in mind. Should a surviving spouse be disinherited or have received insufficient inheritance to provide for maintenance, the claim of a surviving spouse may have a detrimental effect on the intention of the testator and estate plan of the deceased.

50|$|According to the Bulgarian {{legislation}} regulating local taxes, {{succession tax}} is levied on estate succeeded by law or by will within Bulgaria or abroad by Bulgarian citizens {{as well as}} on the estate located within Bulgaria succeeded by foreign nationals. The succeeded estate includes the movable and immovable property owned by the decedent and the rights over such property, as well as their other property rights, receivables and liabilities at the time of opening of the succession, unless otherwise provided by legislative statute. The inherited estate is subject to deductions as to the obligations and tax reliefs laid down in Bulgarian law, or in those cases where it is inherited by the state.Art. 38 lists the types of property that are tax free:• property passed to the State or municipalities;• ordinary household furnishings;• pensions not received by the decedent;• estate of Bulgarian citizens located abroad to which the succession tax of the respective state has applied.Taxable persons are:• heirs by law, such that as of 2004, succession tax in Bulgaria does not apply to the surviving spouse and the lineal heirs;• testamentary <b>heirs,</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> and legatees;• stateless persons are subject to the succession tax for inherited estate on the territory of Bulgaria, if the person in question has been permanently resident within the territory of Bulgaria (Art. 29 LTFA).The heirs may waive the succession through a unilateral act and as a result, they are subject to the succession tax. The waiver needs to be express, written and recorded in a specific book at the District Court. In case there is more than one heir, the tax is due in accordance with their share, and the taxable amount depends on the degree of kinship and the size of the inherited share. The tax is determined and communicated to each co-heir - Art. 106 and Art. 107 TIPC.|$|R
