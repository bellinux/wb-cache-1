A periodic Si nano-island array was fabricated by nano-imprint-lithography (NIL), with the trench-filling and flattening achieved by resist spin coating followed by reactive ion backetching.

Framing is done by detection of a special synchronization pattern, which appears on the (unscrambled) serial digital signal to be a sequence of ten ones followed by twenty zeroes (twenty ones followed by forty zeroes in HD); this <b>bit</b> <b>pattern</b> is not legal anywhere else within the data payload.|$|E
