40|$|Abstract—In Europe, Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are {{the leading}} source of death, causing 45 % of all deceases. Besides, Heart Failure, the {{paradigm}} of CVD, mainly affects people older than 65. In the current aging society, the European MyHeart Project was created, whose mission is to empower citizens to fight CVD by leading a preventive lifestyle {{and being able to}} be diagnosed at an early stage. This paper presents the development of a Heart Failure Management System, based on daily monitoring of Vital Body Signals, with wearable and mobile technologies, for the continuous assessment of this chronic disease. The System makes use of the latest technologies for monitoring heart condition, both with wearable garments (e. g. for measuring ECG and Respiration); and portable devices (such as Weight Scale and Blood Pressure Cuff) both with <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>capabilities.</b> Index Terms—wearable systems, Bluetooth sensors, web services, health monitoring, personalized application...|$|E
