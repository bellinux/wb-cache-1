25|$|The first {{domestication}} probably {{occurred in}} West Africa, but the <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> is widely grown {{in many countries}} in Asia; it was introduced into the Southern United States {{as early as the}} 17th century in Virginia. Most of the <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> cultivation in the region, however, took firmer hold in Florida and the Carolinas during the 18th century, reaching Virginia in full force following the American Revolution. The crop would also eventually prove popular in Texas. Throughout the South, the <b>black-eyed</b> <b>pea</b> is still a widely used ingredient in soul food and cuisines of the Southern United States. The planting of crops of <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> was promoted by George Washington Carver because, as a legume, it adds nitrogen to the soil and has high nutritional value. <b>Black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> contain calcium (41mg) folate (356 mcg), protein (13.22 g), fiber (11.1 g) and vitamin A (26 IU), among other nutrients, all for less than 200 Calories, in a 171-g, one-cup serving.|$|R

50|$|Hoppin' John, {{also known}} as Carolina Peas and Rice is a peas and rice dish served in the Southern United States. It is made with <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> (or red cowpeas such as iron and clay peas in the Southeast US) and rice, chopped onion, sliced bacon, and {{seasoned}} with salt. Some people substitute ham hock, fatback, or country sausage for conventional bacon; additionally, a popular and healthy modern alternative to pork {{is the use of}} smoked turkey parts. A few use green peppers or vinegar and spices. Smaller than <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas,</b> field peas are used in the Low Country of South Carolina and Georgia; <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> are the norm elsewhere.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> — While these peas {{are almost}} never {{referred}} to as [...] "soup beans", the preparation in the Appalachian region is almost identical. <b>Black-eyed</b> <b>Peas,</b> sometimes called blackeye peas, are most common where Appalachian culture intersects with lowland soul-food and coastal food cultures. Like Hoppin' John, <b>black-eyed</b> <b>peas</b> became common as a new year's dish. However, since rice was {{not a part of}} mountain culture, the peas were cooked with pork (usually hog jowls) like soup beans and served with stewed tomatoes and collard greens. This dish becomes less common as you move into more isolated mountain communities.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Chickpeas and lentils are two {{important}} legumes {{grown in the}} U. S. that need phytosanitary treatments before export to several countries, {{but it is difficult}} to artificially infest them with live cowpea weevil for radio frequency (RF) treatment validation. To evaluate the more readily infested <b>black‐eyed</b> <b>peas</b> and mung beans as surrogates for chickpeas and lentils, the thermal and dielectric properties of <b>black‐eyed</b> <b>peas</b> and mung beans at selected moisture contents were measured and compared with those of chickpeas and lentils. Temperature differences between <b>black‐eyed</b> <b>pea</b> and chickpea or between mung bean and lentil were determined in a pilot‐scale 27 MHz RF unit. The results showed that the dielectric constant and loss factor of <b>black‐eyed</b> <b>pea</b> and mung bean increased with increasing moisture content and temperature, which was in good agreement with the trends observed in chickpea and lentil. After 6 min of RF heating, temperatures in <b>black‐eyed</b> <b>pea</b> (moisture content of 8. 8 % w. b.) were 6 C higher than those in chickpea (moisture content of 7. 0 % w. b.), while after 10 min of RF heating mung bean temperatures (moisture content of 10. 2 % w. b.) were 4 C higher than lentil temperatures (moisture content of 7. 1 % w. b.) under the same treatment conditions. By reducing the moisture contents in <b>black‐eyed</b> <b>pea</b> and mung bean to 2. 6 % and 3. 7 % w. b., respectively, their final temperatures were about 3. 5 C and 3. 7 C lower than those of chickpea and lentil. This would result in conservative insect mortality results when using <b>black‐eyed</b> <b>pea</b> and mung bean as surrogate hosts for validation of pest control treatments in chickpea and lentil...|$|R
