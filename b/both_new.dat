5|$|Born in Bagheria, Sicily, {{to father}} Carlo Sr., Aiello {{was part of}} a large and impoverished family of at least nine other {{brothers}} and multiple cousins. His mother died when he was a child. In July 1907, at age 17, Aiello emigrated to the United States to join family members already residing there. After arriving in New York City by boat, he worked a series of menial jobs in Buffalo and Utica, New York, before connecting with his father, brothers and cousins in Chicago. The family set up several businesses in <b>both</b> <b>New</b> York and Chicago, including the financially successful Aiello Brothers Bakery, and they become importers of such groceries as olive oil, cheeses and sugar.|$|E
5|$|<b>Both</b> <b>New</b> York and Texas entered {{service in}} 1914 and {{immediately}} {{served in the}} occupation of Veracruz, and service reinforcing the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet in the North Sea during World War I, during which time New York {{is believed to have}} sunk a U-boat in an accidental collision. Both ships undertook numerous training exercises and overhauls during the interwar era, and joined the Neutrality Patrol at the beginning of World War II. Outmoded by more advanced battleships in service, both ships served primarily as convoy escorts and naval artillery during the war. New York supported Operation Torch in North Africa, undertook convoy patrols and training in the Atlantic, and supported the Battle of Iwo Jima and the Battle of Okinawa. Texas supported Operation Torch, Operation Overlord, the bombardment of Cherbourg, Operation Dragoon and the battles at Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Following the war, New York was used as a target ship in Operation Crossroads and sunk as a target in 1948, while Texas was converted into a museum ship, and remains permanently moored in San Jacinto State Park today.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{the success}} of Lad: A Dog, Terhune went on to pen thirty {{additional}} canine novels, including two featuring Lad. Further Adventures of Lad, which includes the stories of his arrival at the Place and his death, was published in George H. Doran in 1922. Like the first, it {{went on to become a}} best seller, praised by <b>both</b> <b>new</b> readers and existing fans. Critics, however, gave it more mixed reviews. Though some praised the stories and Lad, others felt Lad was unbelievable and harshly denounced Terhune's writing style. Lad of Sunnybank was released in 1929 by HarperCollins, and included another selection of stories about Lad's life. Two of the collies that appear in Lad: A Dog, Lad's son Wolf and another collie named Bruce, both received their own novels. Bruce was published by E. P. Dutton in 1920 and Wolf was published by Doran in 1925.|$|E

5|$|Combined {{with the}} poached elements, <b>both</b> <b>new</b> {{specimens}} represent {{almost the entire}} skeleton of Deinocheirus, as MPC-D 100/127 includes all material apart from the middle dorsal vertebrae, most caudal vertebrae, and the right forelimb; MPC-D 100/128 fills in most gaps of the other skeleton, with nearly all dorsal and caudal vertebrae, the ilium, a partial ischium, {{and most of the}} left hindlimb. In 2014, the specimens were described in the Nature journal by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang-Jae Lee Lee, Godefroit, Escuillié, and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. A similar series of events was reported earlier in 2014 with Spinosaurus, another sail-backed theropod which had only been known from few remains since 1912. Poached remains were reunited with specimens obtained by scientists, and Spinosaurus was shown to have been quite different from other spinosaurids. The two cases showed that the lifestyle and appearance of incompletely known extinct animals cannot always be safely inferred from close relatives.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the offseason}} problems, New York contended {{for its first}} {{division}} title in a weak AFL East during the 1963 season. By early December, the Jets had compiled a record of 5–5–1, and faced a game in Buffalo with the Bills only a half game ahead. The Jets lost the game, 45–14, {{as well as their}} other two remaining games, and finished 5–8–1. Although the Jets drew just over 100,000 fans to the Polo Grounds in seven home games, they quickly sold 17,500season tickets for the first season in Shea Stadium. Running back Matt Snell was drafted by <b>both</b> <b>New</b> York teams, and the Jets were able to sign him.|$|E
5|$|England {{international}} goalkeeper Jerry Dawson missed three games, two {{because of}} an injury sustained in the opening match. Centre forward Bert Freeman, who had become the first ever Burnley player to score 100league goals, and held the club record for most goals in a season, played only four matches. His final appearance for Burnley came in the FA Cup Third Round defeat to Hull City. Several players made bit-part contributions to the campaign; Tom Brophy and Bob McGrory each made just three first-team appearances and Frank Birchenough, George Douglas, Jack Lane, Len Moorwood and Bill Taylor played in two matches or fewer. George Richardson and John Pearson, <b>both</b> <b>new</b> signings in the 1920–21 season, failed to make a first-team appearance for Burnley during the campaign. Thomas Jackson was a squad member until January 1921, {{but he did not}} play any games for Burnley in the 1920–21 campaign.|$|E

5|$|England's {{most recent}} inductees into the IRB Hall are 19th-century internationals Alfred St. George Hamersley and Robert Seddon, both {{inducted}} in 2013. Hamersley played for England in the first-ever rugby union international against Scotland in 1871, and captained England {{in the last}} of his four appearances in 1874. He went on to play significant roles in the early development of the sport in <b>both</b> <b>New</b> Zealand and Canada. Seddon, capped three times for England in 1887, was most notable as the captain of the unofficial British side that toured Australia and New Zealand in 1888; he died in a boating accident during the tour. This venture proved to be the genesis of the modern British and Irish Lions. The touring team was also inducted alongside Seddon.|$|E
5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, {{and in a few}} cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with what was then a high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require <b>both</b> <b>new</b> satellites and faster communication.|$|E
5|$|Governor Deane C. Davis of Vermont {{declared}} a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard to assist with cleanup efforts. Blowing snow continuously blocked roads after being cleared, and snow removal vehicles, not equipped to withstand the excessive snow, began experiencing mechanical issues.

With roads impassable in <b>both</b> <b>New</b> York and New England, tank trucks could not reach dairy farmers, who were in some cases forced to discard thousands of gallons of milk. In other cases, power outages rendered equipment useless, requiring milking to be done manually. One person in New Hampshire died of exhaustion during the storm.|$|E
