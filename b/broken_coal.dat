40|$|Much {{attention}} should {{be paid to the}} permeability of broken rocks in goaf for the sake of water-preserving mining and disaster prevention. Using a special device together with the MTS 815. 02 Rock Mechanics Test System, we tested the permeability of <b>Broken</b> <b>Coal</b> Gangue during its compacting process, getting the relations between the axial stress and the differential seepage pressure and between the pressure gradient and the seepage velocity. The effect of axial stress, grain size, and seepage velocities on the permeability coefficient is analyzed. The result shows that 1) the permeability varies abruptly when the load reaches the compressive strength of rock samples, 2) for a constant seepage velocity, the differential seepage pressure and the axial stress can be expressed by an exponential function, and 3) for a constant axial stress, the pressure gradient and the seepage velocity can be also expressed by an exponential function, and 4) the permeability coefficient of <b>Broken</b> <b>Coal</b> Gangue with different sizes is closely related with its compaction state and will decrease with the increase of axial stress, having a logarithm functional relation between them...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{permeability}} of coal {{subjected to}} triaxial compression was investigated to relate {{it to the}} change of stresses state, analogous to mining-induced redistribution of stress in the surrounding rock. Results show that the permeability of coal sample under triaxial compression tends to decrease {{with the increase in}} stress in each loading direction, which indicates that permeability of the coal is actually controlled by the evolution of cracks in the coals. It also means that the orientation of cleats and maximum principle stress could significantly controls the permeability of intact coal. In other words, loading stress vertical to face cleats can be much easier to narrow the aperture of face cleats of the intact coal sample. Besides, the <b>broken</b> <b>coal</b> sample under higher stress level shows higher permeability than that of the intact coal under lower stress environment. That is partly because that the higher stress level is applied, the more likely the <b>broken</b> <b>coal</b> is to crush, which can contribute to the formation of the connected crack and in turns increase the permeability of coal...|$|E

The measurement of gas content from cuttings {{is presented in}} two forms, one involving the recovery of cuttings with air drilling and the second involving the collection of all released gas from the hole during overbalanced drilling. The latter approach is suitable for not only coal but all gas bearing formations including siltstones and sandstones, provided they do not have major open pore space such as vugs.

Site experience gained at Spring Creek is presented to compare with the laboratory scale testing results. A key feature that has been identified for the Spring Creek coal in the laboratory is the stage of hot spot development associated with moisture evaporation as the hot spot prepares to migrate towards the air source.

Not only the mechanical model of stope and its relative structure division, but also the failure and behavior characteristic of coal body under different mining stages are built and demonstrated. Namely, the breaking arch and stress arch which influence the mining area are quantified calculated. A systematic method of stress field distribution is worked out. All this indicates that the pore distribution of coal body with different compressed volume has fractal character; it appears to be the linear relationship between propagation range of internal stress field and compressed volume of coal body and nonlinear relationship between the range of outburst coal mass and the number of pores which is influenced by mining pressure.

40|$|As {{coal mines}} get deeper, more {{mechanised}} and more productive the heat {{load on the}} ventilation system increases. In certain cases {{to the point where}} serious environmental problems may arise. To continue mining in these demanding conditions the sources of heat must be identified and evaluated so ameliorative measures may be taken. Due to the trend towards mining at greater rates and further from the shaft, mined coal on the conveyors is being recognised as a heat source of growing importance. This thesis describes its investigation. Reviews of heat sources, psychrometry,heat stress indices and heat transfer are included to provide a background framework. The evaluation of the heat released by conveyed coal itself consists of theoretical treatment and laboratory investigations of heat transfer through <b>broken</b> <b>coal.</b> A model conveyor and its instrumentation constructed in a duct are described along with underground measurements at mines.

40|$|The {{longwall}} {{system of}} mining coal, providing advantages {{in the areas}} of productivity as well as health and safety, is described, and technological developments leading to a full automation of the system are discussed. In the longwall system large blocks of coal (up to 600 feet wide and up to 5000 feet long) are developed, with each block mined out by taking successive slices across the short dimension of the block and loading the <b>broken</b> <b>coal</b> onto a conveyor. A self-advancing system supports the roof over the length of the face throughout cutting and loading, with the supports advanced with the face, and the roof allowed to collapse behind them. A double-ranging drum longwall shearer provides the system with an efficient yaw, roll, and variable-thickness vertical control. Currently two machine operators function as error detectors and controllers. It is shown that electronic sensors can lead to a fully automated vertical control system, and automatic roll control is achievable with available instruments and machine tilt actuators...|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that the parent stratigraphy of a coal seam, i. e. its lithotype and band distribution, {{can be used to}} estimate the input and output size distributions of <b>broken</b> <b>coal</b> for a fragmentation event(s) was tested using the drop-shatter process for core. Coal breakage {{is a function of the}} inherent strength of the material, its particle size, and the amount of impact energy imparted. Coal is composed of a heterogeneous mixture of bright and dull bands, and stone, which generate different daughter particle size distributions in response to impact energy. Lithotypes and bands also exhibit an in situ thickness distribution that can be related to input and output size distributions. The results demonstrate that dull coal that is massive and strong requires more energy to break relative to brighter, more friable coals. As a result, brighter and banded coal lithotypes break into finer band components, resulting in the concentration of bright (vitrinite-rich) coal in the finer progeny fractions. Dull coal and stone concentrate in the coarse fractions, except where stone consists of soft claystones or shales. The frequency distributions of the lithotypes 2 ̆ 7 thickness estimate the feed size, and that of the component bright, dull and stone bands of the daughter particle size distribution at the end of the fragmentation process. This has implications for the prediction of size, and composition of size fractions, resulting from fragmentation events that occur during mining and handling, both of which will impact on the downstream processing behaviour of coal...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} uncomfortably high {{ventilation}} temperatures {{have become more}} common on longwall faces in Australian coal mines. Increasing strata temperatures at relatively shallow depths in combination with high surface ambient temperatures, particularly in Queensland, have led to high intake temperatures. These have approached trigger levels that introduce reduced face operator exposure times. With the addition of heat from coal breakage and goaf caving on high production longwall faces the working environment has become uncomfortable and continuous exposure over a shift is potentially injurious to health. Typical strata temperatures at 200 m depth are 35 ºC increasing to 38 ºC at 350 m depth. The added heat from <b>broken</b> <b>coal</b> and rock on the face and in the goaf together with heat from machinery, that has been progressively increasing in capacity, results in wet bulb temperatures exceeding 30 ºC and humidity of 95 % to 100 % on longwall faces. Management plans have introduced controls to limit continuous working times for personnel on longwall faces in the hot and humid conditions. This impacts on productivity and in some situations requires additional personnel in the panel crews. Increased ventilation quantities are a partial solution because evaporative cooling rates and reduction in effective temperatures are minimal in high humidity conditions and less effective in the already high air velocity currents on faces. High air velocities also introduce other face environment problems with dust, increased pressure differentials and goaf leakage quantities which re-enter as additional warm air back onto the face. Spontaneous combustion risks also increase in thicker seam environments. Depending on seam conditions more attractive approaches can be used such as three heading longwall development allowing a back return airway using the goaf as a partial heat sink {{and the introduction of}} direct cooling of air in the longwall panels by spray systems without disrupting the passage of employees and equipment...|$|E
40|$|Project {{background}} What is {{coal seam}} methane? Methane (CH 4) is formed {{as part of}} the process of coal formation. When coal is mined methane is eventually released from the freshly <b>broken</b> <b>coal</b> face. Methane can also be released as a result of natural erosion or faulting. The depth of the seam predicts the amount of methane content present. Methane is directly exposed to fresh air when mining takes place on surface and is confined when mining takes place underground [...] Methane gas in coal mines Methane gas in underground coal mining is a big concern. Methane explosions are devastating, causing significant loss of life and damage to property, and there is a significant industry effort to prevent these accidents from occurring. Methane becomes explosive only if it is diluted to between 5 %– 15 % by volume in air. Failure to provide adequate ventilation to dilute the methane to less than 5 % by volume increases the threat of an explosion. Following the Pike River disaster in New Zealand in November 2010, it became a major concern at Arnot 10 Shaft to manage its methane levels so as to avoid a similar incident. The Pike River disaster The Pike River disaster shocked the world. On 19 November 2010 at 3 : 45 pm there was an underground methane explosion at the Pike River coal mine which resulted in the loss of 29 lives. Daniel Rockhouse and Russel Smith were the only two people underground that survived the explosion. The emergency response was led by the New Zealand police. A rescue attempt was prevented by a lack of information regarding the conditions underground. On 24 November a second explosion occurred. and all hopes of finding the 29 miners underground alive were abandoned. The focus moved to the recovering of the bodies. However, conditions underground made this impossible. Two further explosions occurred, the second of which ignited the coal underground. The mine entrances were sealed in January 2011. This event raised concerns throughout the coal mining industry to prevent methan...|$|E
40|$|Many Chinese {{coal mines}} are highly gassy with {{abundant}} coal mine methane occurring in complex geological conditions and emitted as a greenhouse gas {{into the atmosphere}} during mining operations. Major accidents due to coal and gas outbursts and gas explosions also frequently occur leading to fatalities and financial losses. Conventional technologies using specialized roadways and extensive short drilling holes are unable {{to meet the demand}} of today 2 ̆ 7 s high production mines with strict safety requirements and environmental regulations such as high carbon emissions. Longhole directional drilling technology has been widely employed in gassy mines due to its obvious advantages such as the high proportion of in-seam boreholes, high efficiency of gas drainage for gas mitigation and reduced cost associated with production down time. The effects were analysed and evaluated based on the application of introduced directional drilling equipment and techniques in Chinese coal mines. These results indicate that the complicated conditions involving soft <b>broken</b> <b>coal,</b> high in situ stress and the presence of faults and folds, present ongoing difficulties and challenges. Longhole directional drilling technology has been successfully applied in some Chinese coal mines for gas exploitation and coal mine gas emission mitigation. Daning Coal Mine (located in the southern Qinshui coalfields) and Baijigou Coal Mine are respectively extracting a thick coal seam. Both coal mines have deployed underground longhole in-seam directional drilling technology for seam gas extraction prior to mining operations. This technology has successfully achieved a high rate of gas recovery therefore reducing mine exhaust ventilation air methane (VAM). However there are still several limitations with the application of longholedirectional drilling technology. These include drilling difficulties in complex conditions, insufficient drill rod strength, poor gas drainage efficiency in low permeability coal seams and the inconsistency of the local Chinese-made equipment. Further studies include systematic evaluation of the drilling applicability within different geological conditions, improving equipment reliability, enhancing the permeability through protective seam mining, hydraulic fracturing and longhole pre-splitting blasting. Applications of directional drilling technology in Chinese gassy mines will make a significant contribution to the overall reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the coal mining industr...|$|E
40|$|In {{numerous}} global coal bearing basins, methane, {{possessing a}} biogenic stable isotope composition, is spatially and temporally associated with groundwater recharge. However, beyond groundwater inoculating the subsurface with microorganisms, the biological mechanisms {{that control the}} distribution of biogenic methane are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the interactions between bituminous coal and a) methanogenic microbial communities sourced from the goaf of a Bowen Basin underground coal mine and b) pure cultures of methanogens. When coal mine microbial consortium was amended with acetate and a low concentration of coal (1 gin 25 mL medium), methane production was stimulated compared to the addition of acetate alone, though the presence of coal {{did not affect the}} methane production from H- 2 /CO 2. To test whether methanogens benefited directly from the addition of coal, 1 g of either quartz sand or bituminous coal was added to a pure culture of Methanococcus maripaludis, a hydro-genotrophic methanogen isolated from the coal mine and grown on H- 2 /CO 2, and to a pure culture of Methanosarcina barkeri, an acetoclastic methanogen grown on acetate. In this experiment coal was not included as an energy source for microbial growth but to test interactions between coal and methanogens. The presence of coal in the medium did not affect methane production by Ms. barkeri but slightly inhibited methane production by M. maripaludis {{at the start of the}} growth phase. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that M. maripaludis cells were attached to both sand grains and coal particles, with preferential attachment to rough surfaces, such as cracks within <b>broken</b> <b>coal</b> pieces and clay-rich areas of coal. When the experiment with M. maripaludis and Ms. barkeri was repeated with a 1 : 1 volumetric ratio of bituminous coal to medium, which more accurately reflects the environmental conditions of a coal seam, methane production by M. maripaludis and Ms. barkeri was completely inhibited. In addition, M. maripaludis cell numbers declined after inoculation. This suggests that at a high coal: fluid ratio, methanogenesis is inhibited by some component of the coal, e. g., bitumens in the coal or coal-sourced hydrocarbons dissolved into the medium. Based on these laboratory results, we propose that in coal seams, the dilution of inhibitory compounds may be one mechanism by which groundwater recharge promotes biogenic methane production.

40|$|The widely {{employed}} IPCC {{models for}} the release of methane from underground coalmining operations are reviewed, and put {{in the context of the}} South African National Communication on greenhouse gas emissions. Then attempts to calibrate the model via measurements on South African coalmines are described. These attempts failed because it rapidly became clear that the IPCC model, involving methane adsorbed by the coal and released (a) by the depressurization of the strata caused by mining, (b) from the <b>broken</b> <b>coal</b> and (c) from coal remaining in roof, floor, pillars or goaf after mining, was not valid. Instead, measurements showed that the methane release was very variable, sporadically falling to zero. Carbon dioxide concentrations were monitored at the same time as methane, and followed methane concentrations. An alternative model was developed, in which methane was largely displaced from the coal and held in fissures, cleats and pores, which, when intersected by mining, released methane into the ventilation stream. In a key test of this hypothesis, methane concentrations around a continuous miner were monitored both during operation and after shutdown. Even during operation, methane became undetectable. It is hypothesized that heating of the South African coal-seams during the emplacement of the igneous dykes that cut so many of the seams caused displacement of the methane from the coal into the pores. This fissure-held methane, or free methane, is released rapidly once a pathway through the coal into the mine atmosphere is established. In contrast, methane adsorbed in the coal, and measured as the seam gas, desorbs relatively slowly. Measurements suggest that on average about 50 % of the adsorbed methane is lost one day after mining. By that time, the coal will have left the mine, so that the remaining seam gas will be released to the atmosphere outside the mine. Attempts to measure methane emissions from surface coalmining operations showed very little detectable methane. Coal from surface operations, which was milled and exposed to atmosphere, adsorbed gas from the air. It is concluded that methane release from surface operations is probably less than 3 Gg/a. It is estimated that the total methane release from the coalmining industry amounts to about 72 Gg/a, as opposed to the National Communication estimates of 323 Gg/a in 1990 and 317 Gg/a in 1994. However, there are large errors associated with these estimates, and it is recommended that the methodology outlined in this report be extended to as many mines as possible to reduce the errors that are inherent in the physical processes underlying the release of methane from South African coalmines...|$|E
