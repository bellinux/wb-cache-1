5|$|Goldschmidt later {{appointed}} {{her as the}} Superintendent of Public Instruction on October 1, 1990. Paulus won {{election to}} a full four-year term in that office later in the year, and was re-elected in 1994. Paulus then ran for the United States Senate in the December 5, 1995, special primary election. The election was for the nominations to replace <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood</b> who resigned. Paulus lost to Gordon Smith in the Republican primary. Smith then lost to Ron Wyden {{in the general election}} before he was elected later in 1996 to fill the vacancy left when Mark Hatfield retired.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{library to}} be {{named in honor of}} alumnus and former faculty member Mark Hatfield were {{announced}} in the spring of 1985. Originally estimated to cost $6.8 million, groundbreaking was on April 13, 1985, with Hatfield in attendance. On September 4, 1986, the new library building was dedicated in a ceremony featuring Hatfield, then Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood,</b> and then Librarian of Congress Daniel J. Boorstin. Then school president Jerry E. Hudson presided over the ceremony that had over 700 people in attendance.|$|E
25|$|The Oregon Democratic Central Committee met in August and {{nominated}} State Senator Betty Roberts {{to replace}} Morse as the Democratic nominee in the Senate race. Roberts {{lost to the}} incumbent <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood</b> in the fall.|$|E

There, he met Julia Brim, a Packwood press aide, who would become his wife.|$|R
25|$|When the Senate Ethics {{committee}} {{needed someone}} to review Republican senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood's</b> diaries, the committee chose Starr. In 1990, Starr was the leading candidate for the U.S.Supreme Court nomination after William Brennan's retirement. He encountered strong resistance from the Department of Justice leadership, which feared that Starr might not be reliably conservative as a Supreme Court justice. George H. W. Bush nominated David Souter instead of Starr.|$|R
25|$|In 1992, AuCoin {{ran for the}} United States Senate against Republican {{incumbent}} <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood,</b> {{giving up}} his seat in the House of Representatives. Both the Democratic primary and the general election were strongly contested, and involved several controversies.|$|E
25|$|The 1980 Oregon United States Senate {{election}} {{was held on}} November 4, 1980 to select the U.S. Senator {{from the state of}} Oregon. Republican candidate <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood</b> was re-elected to a third term, defeating Democratic state senator Ted Kulongoski and Libertarian Tonie Nathan.|$|E
25|$|Smith entered {{politics}} with his {{election to the}} Oregon State Senate in 1992, and became president of that body in 1995. Later in 1995, he ran in a special election for a Senate seat vacated by the resignation of <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood,</b> but was narrowly defeated in the January 1996 special election by then-Congressman Ron Wyden.|$|E

50|$|On {{election}} night, the Merkley-Smith {{race was}} too close to call, but media outlets including The Oregonian called the race for Merkley on the morning of November 6, and Smith conceded later that morning. Ultimately, Merkley defeated Smith by three percentage points, 49% to 46%. While Merkley only carried eight counties, one of them was his home county of Multnomah County, which he won by a staggering 142,000-vote margin—a deficit which proved too much for Smith to overcome. Merkley thus became the first person to unseat an incumbent Oregon senator since <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood's</b> defeat of Wayne Morse in 1968.|$|R
25|$|On October 23, 1987, the Senate denied Bork's confirmation, with 42 Senators {{voting in}} favor and 58 voting against. Two Democratic Senators, David Boren (D-OK) and Ernest Hollings (D-SC), voted in his favor, with 6 Republican Senators (John Chafee (R-RI), <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood</b> (R-OR), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Robert Stafford (R-VT), John Warner (R-VA), and Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-CT) voting against him.|$|E
25|$|In January 1996, Wyden {{narrowly}} defeated Oregon State Senate President Gordon Smith in {{a special}} election to fill the Senate seat vacated by <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood.</b> Smith won a separate November 1996 Senate election to succeed the retiring Mark Hatfield, and Smith and Wyden served together until Smith's defeat in 2008 by Democrat Jeff Merkley. Wyden holds the Senate seat that was once held by the late Wayne Morse, a man whom Wyden worked for {{in the summer of}} 1968 when he served as Morse's driver, and whom Wyden calls his mentor.|$|E
25|$|Morse made a brief {{run for the}} Democratic Party's presidential {{nomination}} in 1960. In 1964, only Morse and Ernest Gruening (D-AK) in the U.S. Senate, opposed the controversial Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. It authorized the president to take military action in Vietnam without a declaration of war. He continued {{to speak out against}} the war in the ensuing years, and lost his 1968 bid for reelection to <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood,</b> who criticized his strong opposition to the war. Morse made two more bids for reelection to the Senate before his death in 1974.|$|E
25|$|In the Republican primary, {{incumbent}} Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood</b> {{was running}} for a third term. With his moderate stance {{on issues such as}} abortion, several conservative challengers filed to challenge Packwood in the Republican primary. These included Brenda Jose, the vice chairman of the Oregon Republican Party, and Rosalie Huss, who was the wife of Walter Huss, an ultraconservative minister who had been chair of the Oregon Republican Party before being ousted by a moderate and liberal coalition, which included Packwood and Republican governor Victor G. Atiyeh. Packwood went on to defeat all challengers by a wide margin.|$|E
25|$|The Senate may expel {{a senator}} by a two-thirds vote. Fifteen {{senators}} have been expelled in the Senate's history: William Blount, for treason, in 1797, and fourteen in 1861 and 1862 {{for supporting the}} Confederate secession. Although no senator has been expelled since 1862, many senators have chosen to resign when faced with expulsion proceedings– for example, <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood</b> in 1995. The Senate has also censured and condemned senators; censure requires only a simple majority and does not remove a senator from office. Some senators have opted to withdraw from their re-election races rather than face certain censure or expulsion, such as Robert Torricelli in 2002.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, Bauman {{resigned}} {{his seat}} in favor of his wife {{to run for the}} Democratic nomination in the 1986 U.S. Senate election in Oregon. To draw attention to his candidacy, he hiked across the state from California to Washington, but came in third in a race won by U.S. Congressman Jim Weaver. However, after the primaries, a House Ethics Committee probe into Weaver's campaign finances led him to withdrew his candidacy and the Oregon Democratic State Central Committee selected Bauman to replace Weaver on the ballot in August, just 10weeks before the general election against three-term incumbent <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood.</b> Packwood went on to defeat Bauman 63%–36%.|$|E
25|$|Hatfield {{would be}} re-elected to five more terms, most comfortably, before {{retiring}} from the Senate in 1996. Duncan sought revenge against Morse in the Democratic primary of the 1968 Senate election, but came in second in a close three-way primary {{that he might have}} won had not a third candidate drawn off some anti-Morse votes. After Morse's loss to <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood</b> in the 1968 general election, Duncan and Morse again squared off for the Democratic nomination in the 1972 Senate election to face Hatfield. Morse won again, and lost to Hatfield in the general election. In 1974, Duncan was re-elected to the House of Representatives. He served three terms before being defeated in the Democratic primary by Ron Wyden in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Government {{officials}} who have graduated from Willamette include members from both the judicial and legislative branches of government. Oregon Supreme Court’s first Hispanic American chief justice, Paul De Muniz, graduated from the College of Law, as did his predecessor, Wallace P. Carson, Jr. Current Oregon State Supreme Court justice Virginia Linder also received her J.D. from Willamette. California Democratic congressman Sam Farr who successfully introduced the 2007 “Oceans Conservation, Education and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act” attended Willamette for his undergraduate studies. Mark O. Hatfield, Oregon's former governor and the longest serving Oregon senator, graduated from Willamette and later returned as a professor at his alma mater. <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood,</b> former Republican senator graduated from Willamette University in 1954. Lisa Murkowski, senior Republican senator on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, also received her JD from Willamette University College of Law.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Roberts ran for {{governor}} of Oregon (the fifth woman to do so), but lost in the Democratic primary to Robert W. Straub. Later that year, {{following the death of}} Democratic nominee Wayne Morse, she was picked by the Democratic Party to run on the November ballot for the 1974 Oregon United States Senate, an unsuccessful bid against incumbent <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood.</b> In 1975, she was named the Education Citizen of the Year Award by the Oregon Education Association and the Woman of the Year by the Oregon Women’s Political Caucus. The next year the Oregon Conference of Seventh Day Adventists gave her their Liberty Award. During this time Roberts also served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1968, 1972, and 1976, while also practicing law at the firm Skelton & Roberts from 1967 to 1977. She served as the Oregon chairperson for Jimmy Carter's Presidential campaign in 1976.|$|E
500|$|In January 2004, Bradley and Gore both {{endorsed}} Howard Dean for President in the 2004 Democratic primaries. [...] In January 2008, Bradley {{announced that}} he was supporting Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary. [...] He campaigned for Obama and appeared on political news shows as a surrogate. Bradley's name was mentioned as a possible replacement for Tom Daschle as nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration after Daschle withdrew from consideration; the position went to Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius. He has occasionally been involved in political matters, most recently consulting the Senate Finance Committee on tax reform along with former colleague <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood</b> ...|$|E
500|$|The {{schedule}} fluctuated {{over the}} next three years, with the train operating daily between Chicago and Seattle in the summers and reverting to tri-weekly west of Minneapolis the rest of the year. Amtrak would also run a daily service during the holiday season (as in 1975, when the train operated daily December 12 [...] January 12), but the train never operated a daily schedule for a full calendar year. In early 1976 the North Coast Hiawatha was threatened with discontinuance, along with the Pacific International and the three daily Portland, OregonSeattle trains, after the Ford Administration proposed budget cuts. Several members of Congress protested the proposed cuts, including Representative Max Baucus (D-Montana), and Senators Warren Magnuson (D-Washington) and <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood</b> (R-Oregon). In the end Congress approved a budget for Amtrak $62 million above the administration's request, saving all three services.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1966 U.S. Senate election, he angered many in his {{own party}} for {{supporting}} Oregon's Republican Governor, Mark Hatfield, over the Democratic nominee, Congressman Robert Duncan, in that year's Senate election, due to Duncan's support of the Vietnam War. Hatfield won that race, and Duncan then challenged Morse in the 1968 Democratic senatorial primary. [...] Morse won renomination, but only by a narrow margin. Morse lost his seat in the 1968 general election to State Representative <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood,</b> who criticized Morse's opposition to continued funding of the war as being reckless, and as distracting him from other issues of importance to the state. Packwood won by a mere 3,500votes, less than one half of one percent of the total votes cast.|$|E
2500|$|Bentsen was {{responsible}} {{for one of the}} most widely discussed moments of the campaign during the vice presidential televised debate with fellow Senator Dan Quayle. In answering a question about his experience, Quayle stated that he had as much political experience as John F. Kennedy had when he ran for the presidency. Bentsen retorted, [...] "Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy." [...] Quayle replied, [...] "That was really uncalled for, Senator." [...] Bentsen responded, [...] "You're the one that was making the comparison, Senator." [...] Peter Goldman and Tom Mathews wrote in The Quest for the Presidency 1988 that Bentsen [...] "was the forgotten man" [...] of the campaign until the exchange with Quayle. Thereafter, [...] his [...] "gray solidarity" [...] was [...] "made luminescent by the pallor of the other three men. However, there have been questions raised as to how well Bentsen really knew Kennedy. Some have claimed they only had a nodding acquaintance." [...] Bentsen had in fact considered in advance how to respond, because Congressman Dennis E. Eckart, who played Quayle in Bentsen's rehearsals, knew that Quayle had previously compared himself to Kennedy, so he worked it into Bentsen's debate preparation. Quayle had been prepped by Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood,</b> as Packwood served with Bentsen on the Senate Finance Committee.|$|E
2500|$|The M.V. Columbia Gorge is a [...] sternwheeler {{in service}} {{on both the}} Columbia and Willamette Rivers. She was built in Hood River by Nichols Boat Works and was {{launched}} on August 30, 1983. [...] The motors driving her [...] paddle wheel are diesel-powered. She was partially modeled on the 1890-built Bailey Gatzert and is named for the Columbia River Gorge. [...] She was built for the Port of Cascade Locks, {{at a cost of}} around $2.5 million, of which $1.1million was funded by federal grants secured by U.S. Senators Mark Hatfield and <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood,</b> with a goal of boosting tourism in the area. After some delay in obtaining certification from the U.S. Coast Guard, Columbia Gorge took her maiden passenger voyage on October 29, 1983. The Port's plans were for the boat to operate on the Columbia River, out of Cascade Locks, during summer months and on the Willamette River, out of Portland during winter months. [...] Her design includes simulated hog chains, described in 1983 by The Oregonian as [...] "upright posts on the top deck [...] used on vintage boats to keep the hulls from vibrating and the wooden boats from warping", but which on this vessel are for appearance only. She is certified to carry up to 599 passengers. [...] In the late 1980s, at least, M.V. Columbia Gorge followed the same seasonal pattern of operating out of Cascade Locks from mid-June through September and spending the remainder of each year in Portland, cruising on the Willamette, where she was joined by the Rose.|$|E
2500|$|Only months old, the Reagan Administration {{announced}} {{its plans to}} sell five of the U.S.-made AWACS to Saudi Arabia. The proposal, part of the largest foreign arms sale ever was not received warmly on Capitol Hill where Congressional consent was required. The AWACS proposal was also harshly rejected by Israel and disapproved of {{by a majority of}} Americans. Upon formal introduction of the AWACS proposal to Congress in the fall of 1981, many Senators reacted coldly. [...] "This {{is one of the worst}} and most dangerous arms sales ever," [...] proclaimed Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy. Senator Donald Riegle said, [...] "We are being asked to submit to a kind of blackmail; the price gouging of oil." [...] These Senators feared that the AWACS sale was not designed to promote stability, as would be claimed by the Administration, but to secure U.S. oil resources. Such a deal would mean technology for oil access, and as Kennedy said, a potentially dangerous deal at that. Senator <b>Bob</b> <b>Packwood,</b> who as a Republican was a member of Reagan’s party, was also a leader of opposition to the AWACS deal in the Senate. Packwood spelled out the danger he saw in arming Saudi Arabia: [...] "They have displayed a hostility that must be interpreted as their deliberate intentions to promote continued instability in the Middle East." [...] Packwood questioned the choice of Saudi Arabia as an arbiter of peace saying, [...] "Let’s think about which nations have been seriously committed to negotiating peace in the Middle East and which have not shared that commitment." [...] With the recently ended American hostage crisis in Iran fresh in mind, Americans were reluctant to sell military equipment to anyone. In fact, a May 1981 poll showed that 52% of those surveyed opposed arms sales to any country, and only 19% wanted the U.S. to sell AWACS to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
