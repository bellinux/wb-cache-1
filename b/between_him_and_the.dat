5|$|The cheering crowds {{greeting}} Jesus as {{he enters}} Jerusalem add to the animosity <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> establishment. In John, Jesus has already cleansed the Second Temple during an earlier Passover visit to Jerusalem. John next recounts Jesus' Last Supper with his disciples.|$|E
5|$|After 1971, {{particularly}} {{after the release}} of Fireball, Gillan started to become disillusioned with the workload of the band, who had not had any holiday since their initial rehearsals at Hanwell. He started drinking, and relationships <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the band became strained, particularly with Blackmore. On 6 November 1971, he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board a plane in Chicago, cancelling the remainder of a US tour.|$|E

5|$|Two American presidents {{had been}} assassinated in the 19th century—Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and James A. Garfield in 1881. Even {{considering}} this history, McKinley {{did not like}} security personnel to come <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> people. When in his hometown, Canton, Ohio, he often walked to church or the business district without protection, and in Washington went on drives with his wife without any guard in the carriage.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Western Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire was the sole {{successor}} of the Roman Empire. Charlemagne's imperial coronation in 800 put strain on Western relations with the Byzantine Empire ruled from Constantinople. When Otto I became emperor in February 962, there was contention <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire, and this issue revived in 967 between Otto and Nikephoros II Phokas over the dominion of Italy. On 25 December 967, Pope John XIII anointed Otto II as Otto I's co-emperor.|$|E
5|$|Barrucand {{dispatched}} Eberhardt {{to report}} on the aftereffects of the 2September 1903 Battle of El-Moungar. She stayed with French Foreign Legion soldiers and met Hubert Lyautey, the French officer in charge of Oran, at their headquarters. Eberhardt and Lyautey became friends and, due to her knowledge of Islam and Arabic, she became a liaison <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> local Arab people. While Eberhardt never ceased protesting against any repressive actions undertaken by the French administration, she believed that Lyautey's approach, which focused on diplomacy rather than military force, would bring peace to the region. Although details are unclear, it is generally accepted that Eberhardt also engaged in espionage for Lyautey. Concerned about a powerful marabout in the Atlas Mountains, Lyautey sent her to meet with him in 1904.|$|E

5|$|Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, 34, a Jordanian {{military}} intelligence officer, {{was killed in}} the attack. He was the Jordanian handler of al-Balawi and the liaison <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> CIA. Bin Zeid was a cousin to King Abdullah II of Jordan. Bin Zeid's wake was held in the Royal Palace. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania attended his funeral. Official Jordanian news reports said that he died while performing humanitarian service in Afghanistan. His death shed light on the U.S.-Jordanian intelligence partnership, which is rarely acknowledged publicly, yet seen by U.S. officials as highly important for their counter-terrorism strategy.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but did not result in any charges. While McBride never said so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mafia may {{have played a role in}} his decision to get out of football.|$|E
5|$|In 1059 {{the same}} papal bull that {{restricted}} suffrage to the cardinals also recognised {{the authority of}} the Holy Roman Emperor (at the time Henry IV), but only as a concession made by the pope, declaring that the Holy Roman Emperor had no authority to intervene in elections except where permitted to do so by papal agreements. Pope Gregory VII (in office 1073-1085) was the last Pope to submit to the interference of the Holy Roman Emperors. The breach <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire caused by the Investiture Controversy led to the abolition of the Emperor's role. In 1122 the Holy Roman Empire acceded to the Concordat of Worms, accepting the papal decision.|$|E

5|$|In 1706, Godolphin and the Marlboroughs forced Anne {{to accept}} Lord Sunderland, a Junto Whig and the Marlboroughs' son-in-law, as Harley's {{colleague}} as Secretary of State for the Southern Department. Although this strengthened the ministry's position in Parliament, it weakened the ministry's {{position with the}} Queen, as Anne became increasingly irritated with Godolphin and with her former favourite, the Duchess of Marlborough, for supporting Sunderland and other Whig candidates for vacant government and church positions. The Queen turned for private advice to Harley, who was uncomfortable with Marlborough and Godolphin's turn towards the Whigs. She also turned to Abigail Hill, {{a woman of the}} bedchamber whose influence grew as Anne's relationship with Sarah deteriorated. Abigail was related to both Harley and the Duchess, but was politically closer to Harley, and acted as an intermediary <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Queen.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the {{citizens}} of Ancona, a town in the Papal States, hoisted Matthias's flag in the hope he would protect them against Venice. Pope Innocent VIII soon protested, but Matthias refused to reject the overture, stating that the link <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> town would never harm {{the interests of the}} Holy See. He also sent an auxiliary troop to his father-in-law, who was waging a war against the Holy See and Venice. The 1482 truce between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire was prolonged for two years in 1488. On this occasion, it was stipulated that the Ottomans were to refrain from invading Wallachia and Moldavia. The following year, Matthias granted two domains to Stephen the Great of Moldavia in Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{decided to}} bring back his other two squads to form a solid line and, expecting to be gone only a few minutes, he left his SCR-300 radio behind. Jones found one squad but the other had gone on farther and was not visible. While he studied the terrain and waited for a {{messenger}} he had sent to bring back that last squad, North Koreans attacked the main company position behind him. Judging by the noise he heard, Jones thought North Koreans had moved in force to the wooded bowl <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> rest of the company. Jones never got back to his 3rd Squad. He {{and the rest of}} the platoon dropped down off the ridge into a gully on the left.|$|E

50|$|Time passed <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{boys were}} out in the world, meeting young women of their age. When Tom decided to marry Mary, thereby abandoning Lil, Roz decided to renounce Ian. Taking it badly, the young man tried to kill himself surfing, but survived and was tended by Mary's friend Hannah. Another wedding followed, with both brides having baby daughters. Then, among Tom's things, Mary {{discovered}} old letters <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Lil, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> story loops back to its opening.|$|R
50|$|Rivalry <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> Arminius, <b>the</b> Cheruscan {{leader who}} inflicted the devastating defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest on the Romans under Publius Quinctilius Varus in 9 AD, {{prevented}} a concerted attack on Roman territory across the Rhine {{in the north}} (by Arminius) <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> Danube basin in the south (by Maroboduus).|$|R
5|$|Military {{tensions}} between the two leaders immediately increased. Theobald mobilised his forces {{along the border with}} Touraine; Henry responded by attacking Chaumont in Blois in a surprise attack; he successfully took Theobald's castle in a notable siege. At the start of 1161 war seemed likely to spread across the region, until a fresh peace was negotiated at Fréteval that autumn, followed by a second peace treaty in 1162, overseen by Pope Alexander III. Despite this temporary halt in hostilities, Henry's seizure of the Vexin proved to be a second long-running dispute <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> kings of France.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra was {{appointed}} {{president of the}} Primera Junta, which took government after it. The local politics were soon divided <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> secretary Mariano Moreno. Saavedra wanted gradual changes, while Moreno promoted more radical ones. Saavedra encouraged {{the expansion of the}} Junta with deputies from the other provinces; this left Moreno in a minority, and he resigned. A later rebellion made in behalf of Saavedra forced the remaining supporters of Moreno to resign as well. He left the presidency after the defeat of the first Upper Peru campaign, and headed to lead the Army of the North. His absence was exploited by political opponents, who established the First Triumvirate and issued an arrest warrant against Saavedra. Saavedra stayed in exile until 1815, when all the charges against him were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} bout of illness subsided, Augustus {{gave up his}} consulship. The only other times Augustus would serve as consul {{would be in the}} years 5 and 2BC, both times to {{introduce}} his grandsons into public life. This was a clever ploy by Augustus; ceasing to serve as one of two annually elected consuls allowed aspiring senators a better chance to attain the consular position, while allowing Augustus to exercise wider patronage within the senatorial class. Although Augustus had resigned as consul, he desired to retain his consular imperium not just in his provinces but throughout the empire. This desire, as well as the Marcus Primus Affair, led to a second compromise <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Senate known as the Second Settlement.|$|E

5|$|The French {{hoped that}} Julius III would be {{hostile to the}} {{interests}} of the Holy Roman Empire. Nevertheless, tensions <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> French boiled over when he reconvened the Council of Trent in November 1550, culminating in the threat of schism in August 1551 and the brief War of Parma fought between French troops allied with Ottavio Farnese and a papal-imperial army. French prelates did not attend the 1551–1552 sessions of the Council of Trent and were slow to accept its reforms; because Henry II would not allow any French cardinals to reside in Rome, many missed the election of Pope Marcellus II, arriving in Rome just in time to elect Marcellus II's successor Pope Paul IV after Marcellus II's brief reign.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Megan tells Don {{that her}} {{audition}} gained her a callback for Little Murders and rehearsals begin shortly in Boston.

5|$|An {{arrangement}} was negotiated whereby al-Adil was to administer Aleppo {{in the name}} of Saladin's son al-Afdal, while Egypt would be governed by al-Muzaffar Umar {{in the name of}} Saladin's other son Uthman. When the two sons were to come of age they would assume power in the two territories, but if any died, one of Saladin's brothers would take their place. In the summer of 1183, after ravaging eastern Galilee, Saladin's raids there culminated in the Battle of al-Fule in the Jezreel Valley <b>between</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Crusaders under Guy of Lusignan. The mostly hand-to-hand fighting ended indecisively. The two armies withdrew to a mile from each other and while the Crusaders discussed internal matters, Saladin captured the Golan Plateau, cutting the Crusaders off from their main supplies source. In October 1183 and then on 13 August 1184, Saladin and al-Adil besieged Crusader-held Karak, but were unable to capture it. Afterward, the Ayyubids raided Samaria, burning down Nablus. Saladin returned to Damascus in September 1184 and a relative peace between the Crusader states and the Ayyubid empire subsequently ensued in 1184–1185.|$|E
50|$|Producer Gil Norton worked {{alongside}} the band.
