5|$|Upheaval {{within the}} band {{occurred}} from 1983 onwards. First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left. Their 1985 release <b>Between</b> <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> and a Hard Place was expensive but sales were disappointing; and they disbanded early in 1986. The band's {{status as an}} icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged by induction into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, {{the band}} {{released}} {{the best of}} their early material as a compilation titled Crawl File, which peaked at numbertwo on the albums charts. Geffen released Semantics, internationally, as a long play album with six newly re-recorded tracks compiled from their first three studio albums. Promotion of the album and the subsequent tour was stalled when Guy McDonough died in June of viral pneumonia. Before Guy's death, he had recorded demos with his brother Bill McDonough, and ex-members of their earlier band, The Flatheads. Bill McDonough assembled the tapes and produced Guy McDonough's posthumous album My Place on Wheatley Records in April 1985. Tracks from these sessions were re-mastered and released on Lost & Found in 1996, credited under the 'Members of Australian Crawl' name. Meanwhile, remaining Australian Crawl members had recorded their fourth studio album, <b>Between</b> <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> and a Hard Place, which was released in 1985 and achieved number11 on the albums charts. This was followed by the announcement that they would disband after another tour. The live album, The Final Wave recorded their performance on 27 January 1986; it was released in October and peaked at number16 on the albums charts.|$|E

[...] The album, which allegedly cost $400,000 to record, was a mishmash of styles and a commercial disaster (it peaked at No. 12 in August 1985 but {{slipped out of the}} Top 40 two weeks later). None of the singles had any Top 40 chart success. Harry Brus (Kevin Borich Express) replaced long-standing bass player Paul Williams in May 1985. The band performed three songs for the July 1985 Oz for Africa concert—part of the global Live Aid program—"Reckless (Don't Be So)", [...] "Two Can Play" [...] and [...] "The Boys Light Up".

2500|$|Simon Cyril Hussey (born 7 July 1960, Lismore) is an Australian multi-instrumentalist, songwriter-arranger, record {{producer}} and audio engineer. In 1984 he formed Cats Under Pressure on keyboards with Mark Greig on guitar and David Reyne (ex-Australian Crawl) on drums and vocals. Hussey and Greig joined Australian Crawl's demo and recording sessions for their fourth studio album, <b>Between</b> <b>a</b> <b>Rock</b> and a Hard Place (August 1985). Hussey provided keyboards and co-wrote material with the band's lead singer, James Reyne (David's older brother). In 1987 when James undertook his solo career, Hussey joined his backing band on keyboards, and co-wrote six tracks for James' debut self-titled album including top10 hit singles, [...] "Hammerhead" [...] (October) and [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] (June 1988). In May 1988 Hussey was the producer, and provided keyboards and song writing, for Edge (November), the comeback album by Daryl Braithwaite (ex-Sherbet), which peaked at No.1 on the ARIA Albums Chart {{for three weeks}} in mid-1989.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{gained some}} much-needed {{publicity}} in September 1969, with the Concerto for Group and Orchestra, a three-movement epic composed by Lord {{as a solo}} project and performed by the band at the Royal Albert Hall in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Malcolm Arnold. Together with Days of Future Passed by the Moody Blues and Five Bridges by the Nice, {{it was one of}} the first collaborations <b>between</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> band and an orchestra. This live album became their first album with any kind of chart success in the UK. Gillan and Blackmore were less than happy at the band being tagged as [...] "a group who played with orchestras", both feeling that the Concerto was a distraction that would get in the way of developing their desired hard-rocking style. Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance [...] "you could put the five smiles together, and it would have spanned the Thames." [...] Lord would also write the Gemini Suite, another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the Concerto for Group and Orchestra wasn't bad but the Gemini Suite was horrible and very disjointed. Roger Glover later claimed Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.|$|E
