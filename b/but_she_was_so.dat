Fishlock made her made her debut against Reading Royals on 29 September 2002 and scored 19 times in 23 {{appearances}} in her first season at the club. Laura McAllister, who was captain of Cardiff City when Fishlock joined the squad said, [...] "Jess joined the junior team <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> good we fast-tracked her. Jess is just a fabulous player. She is technically superb with fabulous skills and among the 2 or 3% in Britain. She's ambitious and adventurous {{and to be a}} top, top sports-player you've got to be like that." [...] At age 16, {{she was a member of}} the senior side that won the 2004–05 SW Combination League Championship without losing a point. The team later beat Everton en route to the last eight of the FA Cup and won the Welsh Cup to move on to the UEFA Women's Cup.|$|E
500|$|Wolstencroft {{stated that}} after {{watching}} the episode with his friends, they both commended and criticised his work: [...] "I got some angry phone calls from my friends the next day saying 'how could you, but well done, but how could you, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> nice, but how could you, but well done'." [...] Oyelowo also responded to the controversy, believing that {{it came from a}} result of Faulkner's male fans. Comedian Charlie Brooker however, commended the scene, as well as the series in general, stating in his Guardian column: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief: here was a major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation." [...] In a January 2010 poll, fans of the show voted Helen's death as the [...] "most shocking death scene" [...] in the series, drawing 49% of the votes.|$|E
500|$|Having {{determined}} {{to obtain the}} highest education she could, Stone enrolled at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary in 1839, {{at the age of}} 21. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> disappointed in Mary Lyons’ intolerance of antislavery and women’s rights that she withdrew after only one term. The very next month she enrolled at Wesleyan Academy (later Wilbraham & Monson Academy), which she found more to her liking: “It was decided by a large majority in our literary society the other day,” she reported to a brother, “that ladies ought to mingle in politics, go to Congress, etc. etc.” Stone read a newspaper account of how a Connecticut antislavery meeting had denied the right to speak or vote to Abby Kelley, recently hired as an antislavery agent to work in that state. Refusing to relinquish her right, Kelley had defiantly raised her hand every time a vote was taken. “I admire the calm and noble bearing of Abby K,” Stone wrote to a brother, “and cannot but wish there were more kindred spirits.” ...|$|E

500|$|As the Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons {{approached}} Japan on 27 May, having sailed {{from the}} Baltic Sea, they were spotted by patrolling Japanese ships early that morning, but visibility was limited and radio reception poor. The preliminary reports {{were enough to}} cause Tōgō to order his ships to put to sea and the 2nd Division spotted the Russian ships {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky at around 11:30. Kamimura closed to about a range of [...] before sheering off under fire to join Tōgō's battleships. Asama was fifth of six when Tōgō opened fire on the 2nd Pacific Squadron at 14:10 and, like most of the ships in the division, engaged the battleship [...] The cruiser was hit by a [...] shell at 14:28 and the shock knocked out her steering mechanism. She fell out of formation for repairs which were completed six minutes later. While she was attempting to rejoin Kamimura, she was struck by two more 12-inch shells that caused serious flooding, enough to increase her draft by [...] and reduce her speed. Despite the damage, Asama was able to join the 1st Division at 15:15. The cruiser attempted to rejoin her own division at 15:50. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> slowed by her damage and a 6-inch hit at 16:10 that holed the base of her rear funnel, which reduced her boiler draught until repairs were completed 20 minutes later, that the ship could not take station aft of Iwate until 17:05.|$|E
2500|$|Preminger {{began to}} {{assemble}} his cast. Harry Belafonte, a folk singer who recently had introduced Calypso music to a mainstream audience, {{had only one}} film to his credit, but he had just won the Tony Award and Theatre World Award for his performance in John Murray Anderson's Almanac, and Preminger cast him as Joe. Pearl Bailey's sole screen credit was the 1948 film Isn't It Romantic?, but she had achieved success as a band singer and was familiar to television audiences from her appearances on Your Show of Shows, so she was assigned the role of Frankie. Joe Adams was a Los Angeles disc jockey with no acting experience, but Preminger felt {{he had the right}} look for Husky. Diahann Carroll auditioned for the title role, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> terrified of the director she could barely focus on the scene, and Preminger cast her in the small supporting role of Myrt instead. Finally, every black actress from Eartha Kitt to Joyce Bryant was tested for the role of Carmen.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 Hilton {{was named}} one of the 100 Hottest Women of All Time by Men's Health, but {{according}} to an Ipsos poll she was the most unpopular celebrity with Americans (with 60 percent of respondents viewing her unfavorably). In 2012 she ranked fifth on Forbes Most Over-Exposed list; according to the magazine, Hilton [...] "is another star who hasn't been on magazine covers for a long time. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> ubiquitous at one point that the public still views her as overexposed." [...] On the May 2, 2013 episode of The Wendy Williams Show, Hilton addressed her absence from the news, saying that she was [...] "staying out of trouble" [...] and had grown up. After her small role in The Bling Ring, writer Nancy Jo Sales said that Hilton was [...] "enjoying a little comeback". Shortly after the film's premiere at Cannes, her deal with Cash Money Records made her a trending topic worldwide on Twitter and media outlets have noted 2013 as Hilton's [...] "pop culture renaissance" [...] year. Birdman, co-founder of Cash Money Records, said that her deal [...] "being so talked about shows the strength of her popularity." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{a superb}} Cyprus cat, all gray; but, alas! {{one day she}} took {{a walk in the}} street, and they caught her, and then indeed it was all over with her.
