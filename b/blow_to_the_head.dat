5|$|Although the {{two sides}} were about even in number, Brant had won a {{lopsided}} victory. All of the Americans were killed or captured; none of Brant's men were injured. According to a detailed list prepared by Brant and sent to Detroit, 37 Americans were killed and 64 were captured. Some of the American dead—some sources say most—had been executed after surrendering. This included Lochry, who {{was sitting on a}} log after the battle when a Shawnee warrior killed him with a tomahawk <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head.</b> According to some accounts, Brant prevented the Indians from killing even more of the prisoners.

5|$|On 10 July 1137 Pain {{was killed}} by a javelin <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> during an ambush by the Welsh as he was leading a relief {{expedition}} to the garrison at Carmarthen. He was buried in Gloucester Abbey, following a funeral service conducted by Robert de Bethune. A number of barons from the Welsh Marches attended, including Miles of Gloucester. Pain's widow continued to hold Ludlow Castle until the middle of 1139, when she was forced to surrender it to King Stephen. Stephen then gave Sybil in marriage to Jocelin de Dinan, who consequently acquired Ludlow Castle through his new wife, setting up the background to Gilbert Lacy's attempts to seize Ludlow from Dinan on which the medieval Welsh romance work Fouke le Fitz Waryn is based.|$|E

After Hugh's store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of Napanee, Ontario), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop.

John Macdonald's mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining a force in his life until her 1862 death.|$|E
5|$|At this {{juncture}} Richard saw Henry at some distance behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with a <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry {{made no attempt to}} engage in combat himself.|$|E
5|$|In {{his sophomore}} year, Fernández {{was moved to}} {{shooting}} guard in the Temple starting lineup, a change that felt strange for {{him as he was}} used to playing point guard. He was still in frequent playmaking positions, and led the team in assists with 3.6 per game. He increased his scoring average to 12.6 points per game, second on the team, and led the Atlantic 10 in three-point percentage (45.3%). Fernández scored in double figures in 23 games. On December 13, he netted a career best 33 points to upset local rival and third-ranked Villanova 75–65; he shot 7-for-10 from beyond the arc. This earned him Philadelphia Big Five Player of the Week honors for the week of December 7–14. As a result of his performance against Villanova and his 21 points versus Seton Hall, Fernández was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week on December 20. In the Fordham game on January 23, 2010, he took a <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> and was forced to leave in the second half.

5|$|In October 1932, Ravel {{suffered}} a <b>blow</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> {{in a taxi}} accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes {{that it may have}} exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, Don Quixote (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.|$|E
