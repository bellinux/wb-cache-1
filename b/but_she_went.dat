25|$|After Fidel Castro led a {{revolution}} in Cuba in 1959, Luce and her husband began to sponsor anticommunist groups. This support included funding Cuban exiles in commando speedboat raids against Cuba in the early 1960s. Luce's continuing anticommunism {{as well as her}} advocacy of conservatism led her to support Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona as the Republican candidate for president in 1964. She also considered but rejected a candidacy for the United States Senate from New York on the Conservative party ticket. That same year, which also saw the political emergence of her future friend Ronald Reagan, marked the voluntary end of Henry Luce's tenure as editor-in-chief of Time.

500|$|Justice Sonia Sotomayor {{was alone}} in her concurring opinion. She was the fifth justice to concur with Scalia's opinion, making hers the decisive vote. [...] "As the majority's opinion makes clear", she noted, [...] "Katzs reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test augmented, but did not {{displace}} or diminish, the common-law trespassory test that preceded it". [...] She agreed with Alito's expectation of privacy reasoning with respect to long-term surveillance, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> a step further, by also disputing the constitutionality of warrantless short-term GPS surveillance as well. Even during short-term monitoring, she reasoned, GPS surveillance can precisely record an individual's every movement, and hence can reveal completely private destinations, like [...] "trips to the psychiatrist, the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS treatment center, the strip club, the criminal defense attorney, the by-the-hour motel, the union meeting, the mosque, synagogue or church, the gay bar and on and on."

[...] Jerkins said the remix has [...] "an old-school-type rhythm, which I think is kinda cool because it's an element [...] never had, but I still gave it her edge. I was up all night rocking that joint. [...] same lyrics, I just reproduced the track." [...] "The Darkchild Remix" [...] was initially being sent to radio stations in the United States in mid-March 2002 and then became the opening track of the compilation album Now That's What I Call Music! 10 later that year; however, it was only released on April 1, 2002. The remix was heavily played in dance clubs, and Jerkins said he wasn't surprised with the popularity of it, since [...] " [...] reinvented herself. Everybody thought she was gonna come back with another 'Oops!... I Did It Again', <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> left and came with the 'I'm a Slave 4 U' joint, which is basically a club banger. You gotta big up people who reinvent themselves. I always said she was gonna {{be one of the}} people that's gonna be around for a minute, because I see that in her."
