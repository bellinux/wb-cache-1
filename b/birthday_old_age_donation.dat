40|$|Background/PurposeBiliary {{complications}} {{remain a}} major weakness of liver transplantation. The {{purpose of this}} retrospective {{study was to determine}} risk factors associated with biliary complications after liver transplantation, and how they were managed. MethodsFrom October 1989 to December 2007, we collected all variables of interest in 253 consecutive liver transplant recipients at the National Taiwan University Hospital. Risk factors and the outcome of different treatments of the biliary complications were analyzed. ResultsForty-three (17. 0 %) of the 253 liver transplant patients developed biliary complications. Bile leakage and biliary stricture rate was 7. 9 % and 6. 7 %, respectively. By univariate analysis, risk factors associated with bile leakage were <b>older</b> <b>age,</b> cadaveric liver <b>donation,</b> and use of a T-tube. The only protecting factor against bile leakage was the use of a straight intrahepatic stent. Risk factors associated with biliary stricture were rejection and male sex. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that T-tube [odds ratio (OR) = 3. 45] and <b>older</b> <b>age</b> group (OR = 7. 98) were the only independent risk factors for bile leakage, whereas graft rejection (OR = 4. 89) and male sex (OR = 5. 56) were the only independent risk factors for biliary stricture. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drainage (37. 2 %) or computed-tomography-guided drainage (27. 9 %) was the most frequent initial treatment. Biliary event-free rate after initial treatment was 67. 6 % and 66. 7 % in the non-surgical and surgical group, respectively. ConclusionThe risk factors for bile leakage and biliary stricture were different due to different pathogenesis. Straight biliary stent in our series showed a protective effect against bile leakage. Non-surgical management can be a highly successful initial treatment, and surgery should be reserved for patients who have failed conservative treatment...|$|R

Renal and Lung Living Donors Evaluation Study surveyed kidney donors (N[*]=[*] 2455; 61 % women; mean age 58, aged 24 – 94; mean time from donation 17 years, range 5 – 48 years) using the Short Form‐ 36 Health Survey (SF‐ 36). The 95 % confidence intervals for White and African‐American donors included or exceeded SF‐ 36 norms. Over 80 % of donors reported average or above average health for their {{age and sex}} (p[*] 1 SD below norm). Obesity, history of psychiatric difficulties and non‐White race were risk factors for impaired physical health; history of psychiatric difficulties was {{a risk factor for}} impaired mental health. Education, <b>older</b> <b>donation</b> <b>age</b> and a first‐degree relation to the recipient were protective factors. One percent reported that donation affected their health very negatively. Enhanced predonation evaluation and counseling may be warranted, along with ongoing monitoring for overweight donors. Questionnaires completed by 2544 living donors 5 to 48 years postnephrectomy show that 80 % have average or better health‐related quality of life for their age and sex based on SF‐ 36 norms and that obesity, history of psychiatric difficulties and nonwhite race are risk factors for poor health‐related quality of life outcomes, whereas being older, having more education and/or being a first‐degree relation to the recipient predict better outcomes...|$|R
40|$|<b>Old</b> <b>age</b> {{has many}} images, {{with the one}} of a crisis regaining momentum. While images of {{activity}} and opportunity gained ground during recent decades, this trend now seems to reverse. The current economic crisis drains the financial resources of older people, which increases <b>old</b> <b>age</b> poverty. Moreover, governments react to the double-pressure of economic crises and population ageing through budget cuts, which reduces support systems for older people. It, moreover, centers public discourses more strongly on social problems associated with <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Both developments underline the needs associated with <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and draw our {{attention away from the}} potentials of <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> In other words, they bring discussions on <b>old</b> <b>age</b> back to the topic of crises. This working paper discusses how the economic crisis affects older people, how governments, labour markets, and families react to the double-pressure of population ageing and economic crisis, and how individuals perceive their <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> It concludes with reflections on the implications of growing crisis-centrism in discussions on <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Such crisis-centrism can lead us to overlook social inequalities in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and to neglect the subjective character of the perception of <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> The public image of <b>old</b> <b>age</b> might, thus, be stronger associated with the idea of crisis than what older people’s lived experience suggests...|$|R
40|$|Background/Purpose: Measures {{to prevent}} the {{development}} of muscle mass decline should be initiated from midlife. However, the impact of physical activity at midlife on muscle mass in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> remains uncertain. The aim of this cross-sectional {{study was to determine}} whether physical activity at midlife influences muscle mass and physical performance in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Methods: A total of 272 Japanese women aged 65 years and older were enrolled in the study. Information about physical activity levels at midlife and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> were collected using a retrospective questionnaire. We calculated the skeletal muscle mass index in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and recorded the participants' walking speed and hand grip strength in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> We then classified the participants into four groups according to their physical activity levels at midlife and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and conducted multiple linear regression analysis to determine whether the physical activity levels at midlife and in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> were associated with skeletal muscle mass index and physical performance in <b>old</b> <b>age.</b> Results: The participants in the groups that were physically inactive at midlife had a significantly lower skeletal muscle mass index in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> than those who were physically active at midlife (p <  0. 01). Participants in the groups that were physically inactive in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> also had significantly slower walking speeds at <b>old</b> <b>age</b> than those who were physically active (p <  0. 01). These associations remained significant after adjustment for age and body mass index. Conclusion: Physical activity at midlife may be associated with a higher muscle mass in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> and physical activity in <b>old</b> <b>age</b> may be associated with higher walking speeds in <b>old</b> <b>age...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{presents}} an alternative assessment method for establishing {{the demand for}} an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home among a community-dwelling older population. The instrument, called 'orientation towards admission into an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home', represents {{the intensity of the}} need for admission as expressed by older people themselves. Therefore it is indicative of the 'subjective demand'. Methods: Using a longitudinal design (1993 - 98), the study tests whether a stronger orientation towards admission into an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home leads to use of an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home. This assessment method is compared with another method of assessing 'subjective demand', that is by those who have applied for and are waiting for admission. Additionally, the method is compared with an 'objective' indicator of demand, that is, the level of physical impairments and age of the elderly person. Results: Results show that the subjective demand as measured by the 'orientation toward admission into an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home' is indeed related to actual use of an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home. The subjective demand as measured by being on a waiting list is not significantly related to the use of an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home. The level of physical impairments (the objective demand) and age are sometimes, but not always, significantly related to the use of an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home. Conclusion: The instrument 'orientation' provides us with a valuable instrument in assessing 'subjective demand' for an <b>old</b> <b>age</b> home among community-dwelling older people. ...|$|R
