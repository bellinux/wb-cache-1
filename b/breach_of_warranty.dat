25|$|Statements of fact in a {{contract}} or in obtaining the contract {{are considered to}} be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through {{a contract}} legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance. Representations are traditionally precontractual statements which allow for a tort-based action (such as the tort of deceit) if the misrepresentation is negligent or fraudulent; historically a tort was the only action available, but by 1778, <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> became a separate legal contractual action. In U.S. law, the distinction between the two is somewhat unclear; warranties are viewed as primarily contract-based legal action while negligent or fraudulent misrepresentations are tort-based, but there is a confusing mix of case law in the United States. In modern English law, sellers often avoid using the term 'represents' in order to avoid claims under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, while in America 'warrants and represents' is relatively common. Some modern commentators suggest avoiding the words and substituting 'state' or 'agree', and some model forms do not use the words; however, others disagree.|$|E
25|$|Even before Anisminic, one {{ground on}} which the courts could quash non-jurisdictional errors of law was where they were errors {{on the face of}} the record. An {{application}} for judicial review could be taken if a mistake of law was revealed on a perusal of the record of the proceedings. According to Re Application by Yee Yut Ee (1978), this ground of review is still applicable in Singapore today. In the case, the applicant, who was a company director, challenged an order of the Industrial Arbitration Court ("IAC") which had made him personally liable for paying the retrenchment benefits of the company's employees. The High Court quashed the order, holding that it was patently illegal as it was not authorized by law. Under well-established company law principles, directors are not liable for their companies' debts unless there is proof of fraud, <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> of authority or other exceptional circumstances, and nothing in the Industrial Relations Act which established the IAC, changed this. Even though the Act contained an ouster clause, the clause did not prevent the High Court from intervening when the IAC had committed an error of law which had caused it to act without jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|One {{party has}} {{performed}} their {{part of the}} contract, but the other party refuses to pay unless the amount owed is reduced. For example, a contractor performs work on a home for $10,000, {{only to have the}} homeowner refuse to pay anything unless the contractor agrees to accept $8,000 (assuming no <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty,</b> etc.). The rule will apply, so the contractor could accept the $8,000 and sue for the remaining $2,000 because there was an 'honest dispute' as to the duty.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of such absurd results, and the {{potential}} for more, statutory reform introduced certain curtailments regarding remedies for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranties.</b> Section 63 <b>of</b> the Insurance Act (the governing legislation at the time) was amended in 1969. The effect of the amendment was that the insurer was not permitted to set aside a contract on the grounds <b>of</b> <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> an affirmative <b>warranty</b> unless the insurer could prove that the correctness of the statement (or representation or warranty) was material to the assessment of the risk at the time the policy was issued or renewed. The purpose of the amendment was to protect the insured against repudiations by insurers based on inconsequential inaccuracies or trivial misstatements in insurance proposal forms, even if they were warranted to be true.|$|R
5000|$|The insurer is now still {{liable to}} pay out on a claim if the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> relates only to inconsequential inaccuracies.

5000|$|Warranties are {{statements}} by a manufacturer or seller concerning a product during a commercial transaction. Warranty claims commonly require privity between the injured {{party and the}} manufacturer or seller; in plain English, this means they must be dealing with each other directly. <b>Breach</b> <b>of</b> warranty-based product liability claims usually focus on one of three types: (1) <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> an express <b>warranty,</b> (2) <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> merchantability, and (3) <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> fitness for a particular purpose. Additionally, claims involving real estate may also take the form <b>of</b> an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> habitability. Express <b>warranty</b> claims focus on express {{statements by}} the manufacturer or the seller concerning the product (e.g., [...] "This chainsaw is useful to cut turkeys"). The various implied warranties cover those expectations common to all products (e.g., that a tool is not unreasonably dangerous when used for its proper purpose), unless specifically disclaimed by the manufacturer or the seller.|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} the legal validity of so-called termination for convenience clauses, which allow {{at least one}} party to the contract to terminate the contract without cause. Such rights are in contrast to more traditional approaches to contractual termination, which distinguished between <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> condition and <b>breaches</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty,</b> allowing termination only for the former. Specifically, it will be asked whether such termination for convenience clauses are consistent with requirements of good faith in contracting, the existence of which is itself contentious. As a result, {{it will be necessary}} to consider the current state of the law in Australia and elsewhere in relation to the extent to which good faith is and should be a feature of contracting. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{suit was}} brought for <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> {{covenant}} <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> title to a {{tract of land}} in Kansas. Plaintiff in error was defendant below. Its title was derived from grants of public land {{to aid in the}} construction of a railway to the Pacific. The tract was within the location of the railroad grants, but was excepted from those grants by reason of a homestead entry and possession. Subsequent to this entry and possession, the party so in possession took title from the railroad company, and the homestead entry was cancelled. The alleged paramount adverse title was derived from a patent from the United States issued on a homestead entry made subsequent to these proceedings. The Supreme Court of Kansas found that there was a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> the <b>warranty,</b> and rendered judgment accordingly. This writ of error was brought to review that judgment.|$|R

50|$|Warranties are {{violated}} {{when the}} promise is broken or the goods {{are not as}} expected. The seller may honor the warranty by making a refund or a replacement. The statute of limitations depends on the jurisdiction and contractual agreements. In the United States, the Uniform Commercial Code § 2-725 provides for a four-year time limit, which can be limited to one year by contract, starting from the date of delivery or if future performance is guaranteed from the date of discovery. Refusing to honor the warranty may be an unfair business practice. In the United States, <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> lawsuits may be distinct from revocation of contract suits; {{in the case of}} the <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty,</b> the buyer's item is repaired or replaced while breach of contract involves returning the item to the seller.|$|E

50|$|In a 1993 paper {{published}} in the Journal of Intellectual Property Law, Heald explored remedies for copyfraud, suggesting that payment demands for spurious copyrights might be resisted in civil lawsuits under a number of commerce-law theories: (1) <b>Breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> of title; (2) unjust enrichment; (3) fraud; and (4) false advertising.|$|E
5000|$|Cancellation of the {{contract}} {{on the basis of}} a <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> <b>warranty</b> does not render the entire contract a nullity.

Accordingly, the insurer may still rely on terms unaffected by the cancellation: an arbitration clause, for example.|$|E

50|$|The {{first is}} to put the tenant in {{physical}} possession of the land {{at the outset of the}} lease (the English and majority rule, as opposed to the American rule which only requires the tenant be given legal possession, or the right to possess); the second is to provide the premises in a habitable condition—there is an implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> habitability. If landlord violates either, the tenant can terminate the lease and move out, or stay on the premises, while continuing to pay rent, and sue the landlord for damages (or withhold rent and use <b>breach</b> <b>of</b> implied <b>warranty</b> <b>of</b> habitability as a defense when the landlord attempts to collect rent).|$|R
