By March 2007, the book had become the top seller on Amazon.com as well as listing on The New York Times bestseller list, and had 1.75 million copies in print. That month Simon & Schuster ordered an additional 2 million copies in what was their largest reorder in their history. By 2003, the Secret had over five million copies in hardcover.|$|E

2500|$|The company’s {{second book}} was Molokai: An Island in Time by {{photographer}} Richard Cooke III {{that came out}} in 1985. The publishing company relocated to Oregon in 1986 where it was incorporated, and by 1988 Bob Goodman had left the company that had failed to turn a profit after putting out 12 titles. <b>Beyond</b> <b>Words</b> settled on Cohn’s [...] farm near Hillsboro. Both of the first two books were printed by Oregon printer Dynagraphics, Inc., with printing costs exceeding $500,000 for the books that were to retail for $2,000 each. <b>Beyond</b> <b>Words</b> had an exclusive distribution with Waldenbooks for the first two titles, but the deal later fell through. The company was left deeply in debt after these two books, with founder Black taking a job to help pay off the debt. In October 1988, a lawsuit between the printer Dynagraphics and U. S. National Bank concerned Beyond Words’ ability to pay its bill to Dynagraphics for the printing. Dynagraphics won the lawsuit for $321,000 when the jury decided that the bank had a duty to warn Dynagraphics that co-owner Cohn lacked the funds to pay for the printing of the two books that were part of their Earthsong Project.|$|E
