25|$|Indira Gandhi {{was brought}} at 9:30 AM to the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences where doctors {{operated}} on her. She was declared dead at 2:20 PM. The post-mortem examination {{was conducted by}} a team of doctors headed by Dr. Tirath Das Dogra. Dr Dogra stated that as many as 30 bullet wounds were sustained by Indira Gandhi, from two sources, a Sten gun and a pistol. The assailants had fired 31 bullets at her, of which 30 had hit; 23 had passed through her body while 7 were trapped inside her. Dr Dogra extracted bullets to establish the identity of the weapons and to match each weapon with the bullets recovered by <b>ballistic</b> <b>examination.</b> The bullets were matched with respective weapons at CFSL Delhi. Subsequently, Dr Dogra appeared in the court of Shri Mahesh Chandra as an expert witness (PW-5), and his testimony lasted several sessions. The cross examination was conducted by Shri Pran Nath Lekhi, the defence counsel. Salma Sultan gave the first news of the assassination of Indira Gandhi on Doordarshan's evening news on 31 October 1984, more than 10 hours after she was shot. She died two weeks and five days before her 67th birthday.|$|E
2500|$|The only {{forensic}} leads left by {{the assassin}} were the two bullets fired, identified as Winchester-Western [...]357 Magnum 158 grain metal piercing. Both bullets matched the lead fragments found in the clothing of Olof and Lisbet Palme. Because the weapon was a revolver (which does not automatically eject cartridge cases) there were no cases to recover for <b>ballistic</b> <b>examination</b> – only the two bullets recovered from the street. From the bullets' lack of certain characteristic deformations, investigators concluded they had been fired from a barrel no shorter than four inches; thus the murder weapon {{would have been a}} conspicuously large handgun. The singularly most used weapon for this type of ammunition is the Smith & Wesson [...]357, which is why great efforts have been made to locate a weapon of this make.|$|E

50|$|On 10 December, Alexis Kougias, {{counsel for}} the defendants, said that {{preliminary}} results of the ballistic tests apparently show that it was indeed a ricochet and that the two policemen will only appear before the public prosecutor after the forensic, toxicological, and <b>ballistic</b> <b>examinations</b> had been completed. However, the results of forensic tests indicated that the bullet that killed Grigoropoulos had entered the youth’s body directly. This cast doubt on claims, by the 37-year-old policeman charged with the boy’s murder, that the bullet had been fired as a warning and ricocheted. On the morning of 11 December, Dimitris Tsovolas, former MP and economic minister under the previous government, formed by PASOK agreed {{to serve as the}} counsel for Grigoropoulos' family.|$|R
50|$|Indira Gandhi {{was brought}} at 9:30 a.m. to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS-New Delhi), where doctors {{operated}} on her.

He stated that as many as 30 bullets struck Gandhi, from two sources, a Sten and a revolver. The assailants had fired 33 bullets at her, of which 30 had hit; 23 had passed through her body while seven were trapped inside. Dogra extricated bullets to establish the identity of the weapons and to correlate each weapon with the bullets recovered by <b>ballistic</b> <b>examination.</b> The bullets were matched with respective weapons at CFSL Delhi. Subsequently, Dogra appeared in the court of Shri Mahesh Chandra as an expert witness (PW-5). The cross-examination was conducted by Pran Nath Lekhi, the defence counsel. Her body was brought in a gun carriage through Delhi roads on the morning of 1 November to Teen Murti Bhavan where her father stayed, and where she lay in state. She was cremated on 3 November, near Raj Ghat, a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, at an area named Shakti Sthal. Her elder (and the then surviving) son and successor, Rajiv Gandhi, lit the pyre.|$|E
50|$|After her death, the Parade Ground was {{converted}} to the Indira Gandhi Park which was inaugurated by her son, Rajiv Gandhi.On 31 October 1984, two of Gandhi's bodyguards, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh, shot her with their service {{weapons in the}} garden of the Prime Minister's residence at 1 Safdarjung Road, New Delhi. The shooting occurred as she was walking past a wicket gate guarded by Satwant and Beant. She was to have been interviewed by the British actor Peter Ustinov, who was filming a documentary for Irish television. Beant Singh shot her three times using his side-arm and Satwant Singh fired 30 rounds. Beant Singh and Satwant Singh dropped their weapons and surrendered. Afterwards they were taken away by other guards into a closed room where Beant Singh was shot dead. Kehar Singh was later arrested for conspiracy in the attack. Both Satwant and Kehar were sentenced to death and hanged in Delhi's Tihar Jail.Indira Gandhi was brought at 9:30 AM to the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences where doctors operated on her.

40|$|The study {{describes}} {{the results of}} static, physicochemical and <b>ballistic</b> <b>examination</b> of double-based gunpowder charges, {{in order to establish}} the deviations from the demanded quality of mortar ammunition. The examinations were carried out on gunpowder samples used for laboration of mortar shells 60, 82 and 120 mm caliber and consisted of periodical measurements of the gunpowder mass loss, basic ballistic parameters, and compatibility testing of gunpowder and celluloid containers as well as chemical stability determination. The estimation of the gunpowder quality was performed by comparative analysis and the suggestions for more efficient production of it were given.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} {{the use of}} <b>ballistic</b> <b>examinations</b> and cross-border information sharing across 14 European countries. The presented data were collected using a mixed methods technique consisting of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires that were completed by participants. The results painted a very heterogeneous picture {{of the use of}} automated ballistic systems across these countries, as well as how ballistic analyses are integrated in the fight against gun-enabled crime. Three super-ordinates themes emerged from the thematic analysis: use of automated ballistic systems; ballistic evidence recovery and analysis; knowledge exchange and best practices. The ability to draw firm conclusions regarding the value of ballistics comparison systems, either on a national or cross-border basis, is hampered by inconsistencies regarding data recording practices and definitions. Therefore, key recommendations are suggested to establish better cross border cooperation between member states and develop a better understanding of data sharing procedures...|$|R
50|$|On Tuesday, 23 December 2008 {{more than}} 3,000 {{chanting}} protesters marched through Athens. During the demonstration, one police car was damaged. At 05:50 local time, {{shots were fired}} at a riot police bus in Athens near the riot police headquarters in Zografou. None of the 19 officers on board were injured, authorities said, but the attack raised concern that violence against police could escalate. The shots were fired from {{the grounds of the}} National Technical University of Athens’s facilities in Zografou, known as Polytechnioupolis. One bullet blew out two tires on the bus, while another struck the engine. The police found 7.62 mm caliber bullet casings {{at the scene of the}} shooting. After <b>ballistic</b> <b>examinations,</b> it was announced that there were at least two shooters who used Kalashnikov type rifles and that the particular weapons used in the attack had not been used in any other attack, robbery, or other criminal incident in Greece.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe Knoop and Vickers {{indentation}} behaviour of spark plasma sintered SiC– 5 wt. % B 4 C, B 4 C and SiC– 2. 5 wt. % AlN– 3 wt. % C armour ceramics {{have been}} investigated and observations correlated with ballistic performance. Surface and sub-surface indentation-induced damage has been characterised via cross-sectioning and serial ceramographic polishing techniques. The nature of the damage appears to be less influential than hardness in relation to ballistic performance, but variability in indentation behaviour appears to correlate with variability in <b>ballistic</b> performance. <b>Examination</b> of the indentation size effect curves shows that both Knoop hardness and predicted transition velocities correlate with V 50 ballistic performance against an armour-piercing threat, further supporting the importance of hardness {{and the potential for}} indentation {{to be used as a}} screening method for armour materials...|$|R
40|$|A case of {{intraprostatic}} cyst is reported. The patient {{presented with}} a completely evacuated hydatid cyst of the prostate. The intraprostatic cystic cavity that was communicating with the urethra developed urinary stones. The patient had transurethral resection of the prostate, the stones in the cyst were pushed into the bladder and fragmented using a <b>ballistic</b> lithotripter. Pathological <b>examination</b> concluded to a prostatic hydatid cyst that had evacuated through the urethra and was complicated by stone formation within the residual cavity. Postoperative course was uneventful and follow-up did not show evidence of recurrence. This is the first case of hydatid cyst of the prostate to present as an intraprostatic stone pouch...|$|R
40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONPortable {{firearms}} have {{a relevant}} medico-legal interest, being {{a major cause}} of injury. Bullet entry wounds generally have a particular appearance, including contusion, skin introflection, and simple or excoriated ecchymosis. The skin wound is typically a hole with frayed margins, whose diameter is smaller than that of the bullet. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe report the case of a 19 -year-old man with <b>ballistic</b> trauma. <b>Examination</b> of the patient's lesions indicated that the bullet had entered from the left mandibular parasymphysis, creating a small hole without the typical bullet wipe and blackening. Subsequently, the bullet seemed to have fractured the left chin region immediately below the lower alveolar process, and it finally stopped in the submandibular area in the suprahyoid region of the neck. DISCUSSIONThis case is peculiar because the distinctive features of a firearm injury were absent; the lack of bleeding and edema made the case difficult to interpret without additional diagnostic investigations. CONCLUSIONBallistic trauma can manifest in different ways; therefore, internal trauma should be suspected {{even in the absence of}} clear external signs. This case report shows how an unusual bullet entry hole can mask quite serious injuries...|$|R
