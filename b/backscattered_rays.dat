40|$|The {{problem of}} {{corrosion}} of steel surfaces under thermal insulation {{is one that}} plagues the petroleum, petrochemical, chemical and pipeline industries [1, 2]. Often internal surfaces, as well, are subject to attack by moisture, acids or other corrosive influences. Thermal insulation renders traditional NDE methods mostly ineffective but is essentially transparent to x-rays in the energy ranges commonly used for industrial radiography. Since transmission radiography is severely hampered by the need for access to “both sides” of the object being tested, the use of NDE methods employing Compton backscattered x-rays is strongly suggested [3, 4]. Through appropriate collimation of incident and <b>backscattered</b> x- <b>rays,</b> depth as well as transverse information concerning the object under examination can be resolved. Access is required only {{to one side of}} the object, making the method potentially useful for examination of large vessels as well as pipelines...|$|R
40|$|An {{electron}} beam polarization of 80 % or greater {{will be a}} key feature of a 1 TeV Linear Collider. Accurate measurements of the beam polarization will therefore be needed. We discuss design considerations and capabilities for a Compton-scattering polarimeter located in the extraction line from the Interaction Point. Polarization measurements with 1 % accuracy taken parasitic to collision data look feasible, but detailed simulations are needed. Polarimeter design issues are similar for both electron-positron and electron-electron collider modes, though beam disruption creates more difficulties for the electronelectron mode. 1. Introduction A Compton polarimeter analyzes either the scattered beam electrons or the <b>backscattered</b> gamma <b>rays</b> from the collision of a longitudinally polarized {{electron beam}} with a circularly polarized laser beam.

Efforts to develop {{predictive}} models of the delamination of carbon fiber composites are hampered by a lack of information about the micromechanics of impact damage and delamination growth. Crack formation and propagation in these materials cannot be observed in sufficient detail to determine micro-damage using currently available nondestructive methods such as acoustic <b>backscattering</b> or x <b>ray</b> imaging.

In addition image processing techniques, developed by the Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Florida (UF), are utilized. Previous buried land mine imaging studies focused on antitank mines buried in screened sand and have included well defined surface features such as a broad or a small diameter rock. In the present study the authors have examined imaging under a variety of practical environmental conditions. They have successfully imaged antitank mines (ATM) buried in sand and rocky New Mexico (NM) soil. Images have been obtained for bare surfaces as well s for surfaces covered with limestone road coarse base (gravel), snow, water, and native grass.

40|$|A new pinhole {{architecture}} incorporates features {{intended to}} reduce the rate of plasma generation in a spatial filter for high-energy laser pulse beams. An elongated pinhole aperture is provided in an apertured body for rejecting off-axis rays of the laser pulse beam. The internal surface of the elongated aperture has a diameter which progressively tapers from a larger entrance cross-sectional area at an inlet to a smaller output cross-sectional area at an outlet. The tapered internal surface causes off-axis rays to be refracted in a low density plasma layer that forms on the internal surface or specularly reflected at grazing incidence from the internal surface. Off-axis rays of the high-energy pulse beam are rejected by this design. The external surface of the apertured body adjacent to the larger entrance cross-sectional area at the inlet to the elongated aperture is angled obliquely {{with respect to the}} to direction of the path of the high-energy laser pulse beam to <b>backscatter</b> off-axis <b>rays</b> away from the high-energy pulse beam.

The effective atomic numbers for the same binary alloys were also computed theoretically using the atomic to electronic cross-section method {{with the help of the}} mass attenuation coefficient database of WinXCom (2001).

The present work compares electron and X ray diffraction as well as Raman microspectroscopy, which provide access to microstrain distributions within individual grains. CuInSe 2 thin amp; 64257;lms for solar cells are used as a model system. High resolution electron backscatter diffraction and X ray microdiffraction as well as Raman microspectroscopy were applied for this comparison.

Random motions of electrons spiraling around the field lines create a Doppler-spread that broadens the spectra of the emission to more or less noise-likedepending on how high radio frequency is used. The radio-auroras are observed mostly at high latitudes and rarely extend down to middle latitudes. The occurrence of radio-auroras depends on solar activity (flares, coronal holes, CMEs) and annually the events are more numerous during solar cycle maxima. Radio aurora includes the so-called afternoon radio aurora which produces stronger but more distorted signals and after the Harang-minima, the late-night radio aurora (sub-storming phase) returns with variable signal strength and lesser doppler spread. The propagation range for this predominantly back-scatter mode extends up to about 2000km in east-west plane, but strongest signals are observed most frequently from the north at nearby sites on same latitudes.|$|R
40|$|An {{instrument}} is demonstrated whereby radiographic {{images of a}} sample 2 ̆ 7 s electron density are compiled from the information encoded in the energy spectra of gamma <b>rays</b> <b>backscattered</b> {{from one side of}} the sample. Nondestructive inspection of aluminum airframes is the application of interest, so it is assumed that access is restricted to only one surface of the object under inspection. Use of energy coding allows imaging in a fan beamrather than independent interrogation of individual volume elements. The Multiplexed Compton ScatterTomograph (MCST) instrument consists of an array of planar high-purity germanium detectors, a set of fan beamcollimators, and a Cd 109 radionuclide source. Instrument signals are converted to electron density images using a penalized weighted least squares image reconstruction algorithm coupled with a deterministic system model that includes effects of finite source and detector size, detector resolution and efficiency, attenuation, and Doppler broadening. The Doppler broadening, resulting from the momentum distribution of bound electrons, is significant at the energies used here.

40|$|Corrosion under {{insulation}} {{is difficult}} to measure by the available techniques of ultrasound and gamma or x-ray radiography. In this work a Lab experiment was performed that simulate a real case where pipe corrosion (wall thinning) was measured by <b>backscattered</b> gamma <b>rays.</b> A collimated gamma ray beam of 1 cm diameter from 10 mCi 137 Cs source was allowed to be incident on carbon steel pipes. The pipes were having different wall thicknesses and different diameters and were wrapped with about 5 cm commercially available insulator. The beam penetrates the insulator without significant interaction. Upon interaction with the pipe wall the scattered radiation, due to Compton process, was measured by 2 x 2 NaI(Tl) scintillation detector located beside the source. Because gamma ray energy of scattered radiation depends on the angle of scattering, which was kept constant, all gamma ray photons reaching the detector were having the same energy. The backscattered radiation made very clear and well resolved peak on the multi-channel analyzer. Counts under the peak versus wall thickness showed almost linear response {{up to more than}} 1 cm wall thickness. The small increase in counts from the insulator are constant can be considered part of the background since corrosion takes place in the pipe only. Data showed that a fraction of a millimeter change in thickness can be detectable for 2 min counting time. This can be improved by extending the collection time or by using a stronger source. This method is non-contact, therefore can be used at any pipe temperature. The counts were, relatively, insensitive to pipe wall diameters; this may be an advantage because it makes the calibration process much easier. On the other hand the counts were sensitive to change in distance between the pipe and the detector. Because the activity used was only few mCi, the system is much safer to use compared to gamma radiography where source strength of about 100 Ci is usually used. The exposure rate was very close to background at about 1 m when the beam was open...|$|R
40|$|We {{test the}} {{effectiveness}} of using an alpha <b>backscatter,</b> alpha-proton, X <b>ray</b> spectrometer on a remotely operated rover to analyze soils and provide geologically useful information about the Moon during a simulated mission to a hypothetical site resembling the Apollo 17 landing site. On the mission, 100 soil samples are "analyzed" for major elements at moderate analytical precision (e. g., typical relative sample standard deviation from counting statistics: Si[11 %], Al[18 %], Fe[6 %], Mg[20 %], Ca[5 %]). Simulated compositions of soils are generated by combining compositions of components representing the major lithologies occurring at the site in known proportions. Simulated analyses are generated by degrading the simulated compositions according to the expected analytical precision of the analyzer. Compositions obtained from the simulated analyses are modeled by least squares mass balance as mixtures of the components, and the relative proportions of those components as predicted by the model are compared with the actual proportions used to generate the simulated composition. Boundary conditions of the modeling exercise are that all important lithologic components of the regolith are known and are represented by model components, and that the compositions of these components are well known. The effect of having the capability of determining one incompatible element at moderate precision (25 %) is compared with {{the effect of the}} lack of this capability. We discuss likely limitations and ambiguities that would be encountered, but conclude that much of our knowledge about the Apollo 17 site (based on the return samples) regarding the distribution and relative abundances of lithologies in the regolith could be obtained. This success requires, however, that at least one incompatible element be determined...|$|R
40|$|Fabry-Perot {{resonators}} are indispensable {{in modern}} optical science and metrology. Such instruments {{are used to}} perform high-precision wavelength measurements in atomic spectroscopy, light scattering, laser physics, astrophysics, and other physical sciences. High resolution instruments of this kind would be extremely useful for measurements in the X-ray range. X-ray Fabry-Perot resonators {{would be able to}} achieve #mu#eV spectral resolution. They could be applied in metrology {{to bridge the gap between}} optical and X-ray wavelengths. They could be used as interference filters of very high spectral resolution for studying the dynamics of solids, liquids, and macroscopic biological molecules. X-ray resonators present an exciting and challenging problem. In this report the results of experimental and theoretical studies are presented detailing solutions aimed at developing X-ray Fabry-Perot resonators. In particular, exact Bragg <b>backscattering</b> of X <b>rays</b> is studied. Sapphire crystals are investigated for use as normal incidence X-ray mirrors. Selected applications of Bragg backscattering are presented including up to #approx =# 0. 2 ppm precise measurements of X-ray wavelengths and crystal lattice parameters. A new easily reproducible and precise wavelength standard is introduced for nano-metrology - the Moessbauer wavelength standard. The theory of perfect and imperfect X-ray Fabry-Perot resonators is propounded and provides insight into the technical challenges that have to be overcome to implement such devices. A test sapphire X-ray resonator for hard X-rays (#approx =# 14. 3 keV) with independently adjustable crystal mirrors has been designed, fabricated and investigated.

40|$|The European Space Agency’s {{cornerstone}} mission Rosetta is due {{for launch}} in January 2003. It will perform a rendezvous with comet 46 P/Wirtanen beyond 3 AU and, following an initial mapping phase, deploy a lander to a selected {{site on the}} nucleus surface. The Rosetta Lander will provide unprecedented access to cometary material. Some of the most uncertain characteristics of the nucleus material are physical properties such as its density, {{the structure of the}} surface layers and its mechanical strength. MUPUS (Multi-Purpose Sensors for Surface and Sub-Surface Science) is one of the experiment packages selected for the Lander payload which will address certain physical properties and their evolution with time. This thesis focuses on the in situ measurement of the density of the surface layers by a radiation densitometer incorporated into the MUPUS thermal probe, and on the penetrometry measurements to be performed by an accelerometer mounted in the Lander’s anchoring harpoon. A concept for incorporation of a gamma ray attenuation densitometer into the thermal probe is presented and explored. A 137 Cs radioisotope source will be mounted near the tip of the probe and semiconductor radiation detectors situated {{at the top of the}} probe will monitor the transmitted count rate during probe insertion, as the intervening material attenuates the radiation. Preliminary experiments to evaluate cadmium telluride (CdTe) detectors for this purpose are presented, as well as results from a specially-developed Monte Carlo computer code designed to model the absorption and scattering of photons in bulk material. Also presented is a control algorithm to dynamically re-budget the integration time and depth resolution of the instrument as it is inserted by the hammering mechanism. This is required due to: a) the wide range of possible densities the instrument may encounter, b) the variation vs. depth of required integration time, and c) the limited time in which the measurement must be performed. For lower than nominal densities, integration time may be wasted when it could be used to improve the accuracy and depth resolution. For higher densities the integration time at particular depths may not be sufficient to obtain acceptable accuracy; in this case some depth resolution could be sacrificed to improve the accuracy. The proposed algorithm uses the density measured at each point to update the time budget and depth resolution for the remaining stages of penetration. Although the use of the gamma <b>ray</b> <b>backscatter</b> type of densitometer was eventually rejected in favour of the aforementioned attenuation technique, investigation of the backscatter technique resulted in an extension to the Single Scattering Model– an analytic approximation of its operation. This extended model adds to our understanding of these devices' response to spatial inhomogeneity. Calculations show that anchoring of the Lander is necessary to avoid possible ejection from the nucleus by gas drag in the case of a landing in an active area. The use of the Lander’s anchoring harpoon to perform penetrometry measurements is reported, including the results of preliminary experiments and techniques for analysing the accelerometry data. It is shown that layers with distinctly different strengths may be identified, and that the mean deviatoric stress– a strength parameter– may be constrained to within a factor of about 2. 2. This would be a significant improvement on current estimates, which vary by several orders of magnitude. Together with other investigations on the Rosetta mission the densitometry and penetrometry measurements will serve to constrain models of the physical state and evolution of the cometary material found at the landing site. In particular both instruments are sensitive to near-surface layering, which may be expected from theoretical models of cometary activity...|$|R
