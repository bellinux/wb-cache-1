In 1976, the club joined the Soviet Second League, to play in its Zone 7, and in 1981 they won the championship [...] In 1990, the team recorded a 10-0 victory over Bulat, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze angular velocities of the hip and shoulders in the transverse plane and resultant linear velocity of the ball during a handball power serve. There has been little research of any type in court handball and no known research reports involving the biomechanics of handball. Eighteen trained, competitive handball players, from the professional <b>division</b> to the <b>B</b> <b>class</b> amateur <b>division,</b> served 10 legal serves in a mock court setup. The serve patterns were digitized and angular velocities of hip and shoulder rotation were compared to ball velocities. The primary findings showed that hip rotation preceded shoulder rotation, the shoulders rotated at a higher angular velocity than the hips (429. 796 deg/sec ?? 154. 067, 801. 237 deg/sec ?? 130. 254 respectively), and better players achieved higher maximum and average linear ball velocities. Hip rotation was not significantly correlated with ball velocity, but shoulder rotation had a significant positive correlation (r =. 206) to ball velocity. This study is the first to confirm the kinetic chain pattern within the handball power serve and to accumulate kinematic data on handball power serves...|$|R

Stephens ran {{the first of several}} marathons as a sophomore, won the <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> <b>division</b> of the Camptown races as a junior, placed 3rd in Districts (and broke the District record) in the 880 as a junior, and won the West Branch conference 880 as a senior, breaking the Conference record.

50|$|In sports, Red Hook High School {{is ranked}} Class A in soccer, basketball, {{softball}} and baseball {{as well as}} <b>Class</b> <b>B</b> in all other sports. It {{is located in the}} Section 9 district. In 2006, Red Hook's varsity volleyball team won the Mid-Hudson Athletic League, and Section IX championships. That same year, the team participated in the NYSPHSAA state championships, finishing in third place in the <b>class</b> <b>B</b> <b>division.</b> In 2007, the team were once again Mid-Hudson Athletic League champions and Section IX champions, this time finishing in second at the NYSPHAA state championships. In 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 the Red Hook Boy's Varsity Lacrosse Team won the Section IX Championship six times in a row, earning six titles in seven years, since the program's creation. However, the school is primarily known for its basketball program and has consistently won sectional titles and contended for state championships. Red Hook High School was ranked at #280 among the thousands of high schools across the country by Newsweek. Over 80% of its graduates go on to two and four year colleges.|$|R
50|$|Rutgers {{began playing}} {{lacrosse}} in 1887. The team lasted 3 years, folding in 1889 after it 2-1 season. The program was re-instated in 1920 {{due in part}} to the efforts of Harland W. “Tots” Meistrell. In 1926 Fred Fitch took over the program and began a period of national prominence. The team joined the USILA and in 1928 was awarded one of the association's gold medals as an outstanding team, along with three other teams that also shared the championship (Johns Hopkins, Maryland, and Navy). In 1932 the Rutgers team, led by “the best attack pair in the country” George Latimer and Frenchy Julien participated in the U.S. Olympic team tryouts. During Fitch's 22 seasons the team posted a record of 106-71-8. Al Twitchell took over the reins in 1950 with the retirement of Fitch. In 1955 he guided the team to a co-national championship of the USILA's Laurie Cox (<b>Class</b> <b>B)</b> <b>Division.</b>|$|R

The SF Haguenau was commanded by Commandant Laherre, then Lieutenant Colonel Schwartz. The command post was located at Reimerswiller, although Schwartz's command post was at Hochwald. The interval troops, the army formations that were to provide the mobile defense for the sector, to support and be supported by the fixed defenses, were under the command of the 12th Corps (12e Corps d'Armee), General Dentz, commander. The 6th Corps was in turn made up of the 16th and 70th Infantry Divisions. Artillery support for the sector was provided by the 156th Position Artillery Regiment (Régiment d'Artillerie de Position (RAP)), which controlled both fixed and mobile artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Duval.

40|$|Introduction: Dental arch width {{measurement}} {{is needed}} to determine diagnoses and orthodontic treatment planning of Angle <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 1 and <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 2  malocclusions that have narrow maxillary dental arch generally. Dental arch width in this study was measured by maxillary and mandibular intercanine width.  This study aimed to compare the differences of intercanine width between Angle <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1 and <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 2 malocclusions. Methods: Descriptive comparative research with total samples of 67 study models, consisted of 34 <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 1 cases and 33 <b>Class</b> II <b>division</b> 2 cases. The minimum age of the samples chosen was 13 years old with no history of orthodontic treatment. A non probability consecutive sampling technique was used. Results: Study results showed the avarage maxillary and mandibular intercanine width of <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 1 were 33, 99 mm and 26, 33 mm. Average maxillary and mandibular intercanine width of <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 2 were 34, 77 mm and 25, 37 mm. Conclusions: T-test analysis showed no statistical significant differences in the intercanine width between Angle <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 1 and <b>Class</b> II <b>Division</b> 2   malocclusions...|$|R

Previous studies of electoral behavior in Israel {{have demonstrated the}} importance of ethnic and religious cleavages while finding little evidence for <b>class</b> <b>divisions</b> as a factor structuring politics and predicting voter preferences. We challenge this empirical consensus by employing three different methodologies: a reanalysis of standard survey data; ecological analysis of aggregate election and census results; and multilevel analysis of pooled individual and aggregate data. All three methods attribute a major role to class along with other social cleavages. They vary however in their answers {{to the question of}} whether class effects are independent of ethnicity and religion or conditional upon them. Several factors explain the divergence between our findings and prior research.

40|$|According to {{the floral}} organ {{development}} ABC model, <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes specify petal and stamen identification. In order {{to study the}} function of <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes in flower development of Tagetes erecta, five MADS-box <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes were identified and their expression and putative functions were studied. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses indicated that there were one PI-like gene-TePI, two euAP 3 -like genes-TeAP 3 - 1 and TeAP 3 - 2, and two TM 6 -like genes-TeTM 6 - 1 and TeTM 6 - 2 in T. erecta. Strong expression levels of these genes were detected in stamens of the disk florets, but little or no expression was detected in bracts, receptacles or vegetative organs. Yeast hybrid experiments of the <b>B</b> <b>class</b> proteins showed that TePI protein could form a homodimer and heterodimers {{with all the other}} four <b>B</b> <b>class</b> proteins TeAP 3 - 1, TeAP 3 - 2, TeTM 6 - 1 and TeTM 6 - 2. No homodimer or interaction was observed between the euAP 3 and TM 6 clade members. Over-expression of five <b>B</b> <b>class</b> genes of T. erecta in Nicotiana rotundifolia showed that only the transgenic plants of 35 S::TePI showed altered floral morphology compared with the non-transgenic line.
