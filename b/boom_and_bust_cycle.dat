5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all the concession companies for human rights abuses in the Congo Free State. Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the Free State which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. The concession companies gave the Free State the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> <b>cycle.</b> Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E

Minerals mined in Utah include copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, zinc, lead, and beryllium.

25|$|Tobacco, {{initially}} {{just one}} of several crops earmarked for wholesale production, soon emerged as Southern Rhodesia's most prominent agricultural product, though its early development was far from stable: aside from the climactic uncertainties of the unfamiliar country and the mercurial quality of the product, the early industry was cursed by a debilitating <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> <b>cycle</b> that continued well into the 1920s. All the same, tobacco endured as the territory's staple crop, while the growers came to dominate Southern Rhodesian politics, holding a majority in the Legislative Council from 1911. Holding considerable political and economic power up to the end of Company rule in 1923, the Southern Rhodesian tobacco industry retained its prominent position for decades afterwards.|$|E

Many recent articles consider that central banks had an important contribution in triggering the global crisis and the collapse of the real estate markets during 2007 - 2009 due to the low monetary policy rates and the inadequate regulation and supervision of the banking system.

500|$|Since {{the origins}} of the modern private equity {{industry}} in 1946, there have been four major epochs marked by three boom and bust cycles. The early history of private equity—from 1946 through 1981—was characterized by relatively small volumes of private equity investment, rudimentary firm organizations and limited awareness of and familiarity with the private equity industry. The first <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> <b>cycle,</b> from 1982 through 1993, was characterized by the dramatic surge in leveraged buyout activity financed by junk bonds and culminating in the massive buyout of RJR Nabisco before the near collapse of the leveraged buyout industry in the late 1980s and early 1990s. [...] The second <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> <b>cycle</b> (from 1992 through 2002) emerged from the ashes of the savings and loan crisis, the insider trading scandals, the real estate market collapse and the recession of the early 1990s.

The third <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> <b>cycle</b> (from 2003 through 2007) came {{in the wake of the}} collapse of the Dot-com bubble—leveraged buyouts reach unparalleled size and the institutionalization of private equity firms is exemplified by the Blackstone Group's 2007 initial public offering.|$|E

Nowhere in the whole Truman record can one point to a single, decisive break-through... All his skills and energies—and he was among our hardest-working Presidents—were directed to standing still." [...] When he left office in 1953, Truman {{was one of the most}} unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon's 24% in August 1974, the month Nixon resigned, but matched by Nixon's all-time low in January 1974.|$|E
2500|$|The {{welfare state}} grew {{gradually}} and unevenly {{from the late}} nineteenth century, but became fully developed following the Second World War, along with the mixed market economy. [...] Also called [...] "embedded liberalism", social liberal policies gained broad support across the political spectrum, because they reduced the disruptive and polarizing tendencies in society, without challenging the capitalist economic system. Business accepted social liberalism {{in the face of}} widespread dissatisfaction with the <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> <b>cycle</b> of the earlier economic system as it seemed to them to be a lesser evil than more left-wing modes of government. Social liberalism was characterized by cooperation between big business, government and labor unions. Government was able to assume a strong role because its power had been strengthened by the wartime economy, but the extent to which this occurred varied considerably among Western democracies.|$|E

40|$|Most {{power market}} {{structures}} {{have been developed}} and implemented without being tested, causing major problems such as shortages and blackouts. The main cause for these problems is the inability of some markets to provide adequate stimulus for new generation investments. The installed generation capacity goes through <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> <b>cycles,</b> exposing consumers to potential shortages during long bust periods. With the realisation that the power market has a strong interaction with generation investment, a System Dynamics (SD) model is developed to study how the market interacts with generation expansion. The SD model also allows for market structures and policies to be evaluated before being implemented. It {{can be an important}} tool in ensuring that generation expansion is done optimally without the expense of energy security. New Zealand’s generation capacity is no exception to the <b>boom</b> <b>and</b> <b>bust</b> trend. Since the commencement of the New Zealand Energy Market (NZEM) in October 1996, energy shortages occurred in the winters of 2001, 2003 and 2008. As a case study, an SD model is developed to study the NZEM.
