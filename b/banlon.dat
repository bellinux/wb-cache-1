The knee-length skirts and dresses were the most oversized items of this 1950s. The introduction of new fabrics, including Terylene, Orlon, <b>Banlon,</b> Acrilan and Poplin, allowed for new fashion styles to be both created and introduced. Among these were the [...] "wash-and-wear" [...] sweater, the permanently pleated skirt, and the [...] "drip-dry" [...] skirt. Skirts of this era known as circle skirts were supported by layers of petticoats, creating a circular look that accentuated the waist line. Essentially, the petticoat reinforced the femininity of this period.|$|E
