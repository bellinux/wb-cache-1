2500|$|Bridles may be {{used with}} any style of cavesson noseband, and there are few rules {{regarding}} the severity of this equipment. The figure-8 cavesson {{is the most popular}} type. Bits may also vary in severity, and competitors may use any bit, or even a [...] "bitless bridle" [...] or a mechanical hackamore. The ground jury at the show has the right, however, based on veterinary advice, to refuse a bit or <b>bridling</b> scheme if it could cause harm to the horse.|$|E
2500|$|The {{number of}} fast days varies {{from year to}} year, but in general the Orthodox Christian can expect to spend a little over half the year fasting at some level of strictness. There are spiritual, symbolic, and even {{practical}} reasons for fasting. In the Fall from Paradise mankind became possessed by a carnal nature; that is to say, became inclined towards the passions. Through fasting, Orthodox Christians attempt {{to return to the}} relationship of love and obedience to God enjoyed by Adam and Eve in Paradise in their own lives, by refraining from carnal practices, by <b>bridling</b> the tongue (...) , confession of sins, prayer and almsgiving.|$|E
2500|$|Following the American Civil War, vaquero culture {{combined}} with the cattle herding and drover traditions of the southeastern United States that evolved as settlers moved west. Additional influences developed out of Texas as cattle trails were created {{to meet up with}} the railroad lines of Kansas and Nebraska, in addition to expanding ranching opportunities in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountain Front, east of the Continental Divide. [...] The new settlers required more horses, to be trained faster, and brought a bigger and heavier horse with them. [...] This led to modifications in the <b>bridling</b> and bitting traditions used by the vaquero. [...] Thus, the Texas cowboy tradition arose from a combination of cultural influences, in addition to the need for adaptation to the geography and climate of west Texas and the need to conduct long cattle drives to get animals to market.|$|E

The <b>bridle</b> cheekpieces sometimes need to be lengthened so that the bit still rests correctly in the mouth.|$|R

2500|$|The natural {{buildup of}} {{sedimentation}} can reduce downstream river flows {{due to the}} installation of irrigation systems. Sedimentation {{is an essential part}} of the ecosystem that requires the natural flux of the river flow. This natural cycle of sediment dispersion replenishes the nutrients in the soil, that will in turn, determine the livelihood of the plants and animals that rely on the sediments carried downstream. The benefits of heavy deposits of sedimentation can be seen in large rivers like the Nile River. The sediment from the delta has built up to form a giant aquifer during flood season, and retains water in the wetlands. The wetlands that are created and sustained due to built up sediment at the basin of the river is a habitat for numerous species of birds. However, heavy sedimentation can reduce downstream river water quality and can exacerbate floods up stream. This has been known to happen in the Sanmenxia reservoir in China. The Sanmenxia reservoir is part of a larger man-made project of hydro-electric dams called the Three Gorge Project Wohl, “The Chang Jiang: <b>Bridling</b> a Dragon”, A World of Rivers p 275, p.283. By calculating the amount of sediment that will be carried downstream to the Sanmenxia reservoir is difficult to estimate. In 1998, uncertain calculations and heavy sediment greatly affected the reservoir’s ability to properly fulfill its flood-control function [...] This also reduces the down stream river water quality. Shifting more towards mass irrigation installments in order to meet more socioeconomic demands is going against the natural balance of nature, and use water pragmatically- use it where it is foundWorster, “ Thinking like a River,” in The Wealth of Nature: Environmental History and the Ecological Imagination (New York: Oxford University Press, (1993), p133ef> ...|$|E

5000|$|Horse halters are {{sometimes}} confused with a bridle.The primary {{difference between a}} halter and a <b>bridle</b> is that a halter is used by a handler {{on the ground to}} lead or tie up an animal, but a <b>bridle</b> is generally used by a person who is riding or driving an animal that has been trained in this use. A halter is safer than a <b>bridle</b> for tying, as the bit of a <b>bridle</b> may injure the horse's mouth if the horse sets back while tied with a <b>bridle,</b> and in addition, many <b>bridles</b> are made of lighter materials and will break. On the other hand, a <b>bridle</b> offers more precise control.|$|R
