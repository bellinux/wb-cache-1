5|$|Seventeen-year-old Andy {{is about}} to leave for college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He intends to take Woody with him, and puts Buzz Lightyear, Jessie, and the other toys in a trash <b>bag</b> <b>to</b> be stored in the attic. Andy's mother mistakenly takes the <b>bag</b> <b>to</b> the curb for garbage pickup. The toys escape and, believing Andy {{intended}} to throw them away, decide to climb into a donation box with Molly's discarded toy, Barbie, bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows them, but is unable to convince them of the mistake.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to them, Harold is {{following}} Merrigan's truck and calls the police. At a warehouse, Harold grabs a gun from a shelf and Dr. Kroger gestures for Harold to shoot Merrigan and his accomplice, who are emptying the vacuum <b>bag</b> <b>to</b> destroy the evidence. However, Harold makes some noise. As Merrigan prepares to shoot Harold, the police arrive to arrest Merrigan, but just then, he shoots at Dr. Kroger. Harold intercepts the bullet {{in his chest}} and Merrigan is taken away.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{original}} autograph manuscripts of the Nos. 3 to 6 {{of the set}} were discovered at a festival arranged in Melbourne, Australia, for the 250th anniversary of Haydn's birth. After a concert at the festival, a woman presented the manuscripts in a plastic shopping <b>bag</b> <b>to</b> the conductor Christopher Hogwood. The Haydn scholar Georg Feder, who was visiting Australia at the time, then verified the scores to be the authentic original manuscripts of the four quartets. It emerged that the woman who presented the manuscripts to Hogwood had inherited them, through successive generations, from an English colonel who had purchased them at an 1851 auction before emigrating to New Zealand. The colonel's heirs were evidently unaware that they owned the only original versions of the quartets in Haydn's pen. Until the 1982 discovery, publishers had been working from incomplete or non-original editions.|$|E

5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a <b>bag</b> <b>to</b> collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping <b>bag</b> <b>to</b> an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and gasping for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E
5|$|The {{succeeding}} year, {{the only}} time since 1851, the school did not hold a commencement. Members of the senior class had decided {{to make fun of}} the professors in the Green Bag—City College's year book since 1896. When the school board was alerted of the matter, it attempted to censor the edition, passing a resolution requiring the Green <b>Bag</b> <b>to</b> be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. However, the year book had already been printed, and the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of the editors of the Green Bag and the business manager, and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, {{became a member of the}} school board in 1926.|$|E

Homer instead runs off with the <b>bag</b> <b>to</b> eat its contents in privacy at a canyon cliff. Unfortunately, Homer trips and falls {{to the bottom of}} the canyon with his arm pinned. Fueled by his need to get the out-of-reach bag of candy, and reluctant to wait twenty minutes for help, Homer is forced to chew off his arm. Though he manages it after a few tries, Homer learns that he was carrying a bag of vegetables, as Bart, Lisa and Maggie had secretly stolen back their candy, inciting an upset Homer to scream in rage.|$|E
5|$|As {{a natural}} force, {{the wind was}} often personified as one or more wind gods or as an {{expression}} of the supernatural in many cultures. Vayu is the Hindu God of Wind. The Greek wind gods include Boreas, Notus, Eurus, and Zephyrus. Aeolus, in varying interpretations the ruler or keeper of the four winds, has also been described as Astraeus, the god of dusk who fathered the four winds with Eos, goddess of dawn. The Ancient Greeks also observed the seasonal change of the winds, as evidenced by the Tower of the Winds in Athens. Venti are the Roman gods of the winds. Fūjin is the Japanese wind god {{and is one of the}} eldest Shinto gods. According to legend, he was present at the creation of the world and first let the winds out of his <b>bag</b> <b>to</b> clear the world of mist. In Norse mythology, Njörðr is the god of the wind. There are also four dvärgar (Norse dwarves), named Norðri, Suðri, Austri and Vestri, and probably the four stags of Yggdrasil, personify the four winds, and parallel the four Greek wind gods. Stribog is the name of the Slavic god of winds, sky and air. He is said to be the ancestor (grandfather) of the winds of the eight directions.|$|E
5|$|In Hyderabad, Gautham accidentally spoils Sameera's {{birthday}} plans, infuriating her. Although he {{is convinced}} {{that he has made}} up an enemy to cope with being an orphan, a mysterious person tries to kill Sameera. Gautham saves her and proposes marriage, which she accepts. Sameera learns that the mysterious person is Antonio Rosarios, a Goa-based crime boss who wants to kill her because she tried to expose the presence of hydrogen cyanide in seeds sold by Rosarios' company, AG1. Gautham meets Rosarios in the lobby of Sameera's office building. Assuming that he is an illusion, he shoots Rosarios in his head. By the time Gautham realises Rosarios is real he is dead, and Gautham learns that his parents were murdered. He catches an aged taxi driver who was stalking him (one of the three men he imagined), and learns that two London-based Indians (one of whom was Rosarios) killed his parents; his father gave the taxi driver a <b>bag</b> <b>to</b> give to Gautham. In the bag is an old Rubik's Cube, a key and a British coin.|$|E

The foundation has distributed 2,700 bags so far since beginning this program in 2012. Bite Me Cancer ships out quantities of <b>bags</b> <b>to</b> these hospitals as often as the foundation can afford to assemble and distribute the bags, based on their fundraising efforts.|$|R
