40|$|Among one of {{the first}} {{particles}} removed from the aerogel collector from the Stardust sample return mission was an approx. 5 micron sized iron sulfide. The majority of the spectra from 5 different sections of this particle suggests the presence of aliphatic compounds. Due to the heat of capture in the aerogel we initially assumed these aliphatic compounds were not cometary but after comparing these results to a heated iron sulfide interplanetary dust particle (IDP) we believe our initial interpretation of these spectra was not correct. It has been suggested that ice coating on iron sulfides leads to aqueous alteration in IDP clusters which can then lead to the formation of complex organic compounds from unprocessed organics in the IDPs similar to unprocessed organics found in comets [1]. Iron sulfides have been demonstrated to not only transform halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons but also enhance the <b>bonding</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> to steel [2, 3]. Bromfield and Coville (1997) demonstrated using Xray photoelectron spectroscopy that "the surface enhancement of segregated sulfur to the surface of sulfided precipitated iron catalysts facilitates the formation of a low-dimensional structure of extraordinary properties" [4]. It may be that the iron sulfide acts in some way to protect aliphatic compounds from alteration due to heat...|$|E
50|$|Natural rubber {{was first}} used as {{material}} for adhesives starting in 1830. In 1839, Charles Goodyear discovered that a rubber and sulfur mixture, when heated, becomes elastic. In 1843, Thomas Hancock named this process vulcanization. In 1862, a British patent (number 3288) was issued for the plating of metal with brass by electrodeposition to obtain a stronger bond to <b>rubber.</b> The development <b>of</b> the automobile {{and the need for}} rubber shock mounts required stronger and more durable <b>bonds</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> and metal.

The results showed that high-dispersed nano-ZnO made natural rubber the scorched time longer, the degrees of cross-linking higher and anti-aging properties remarkably stronger, compared with 99. 5 % of ordinary ZnO under the same vulcanization conditions. Specially, when 0. 8 dosages of high-dispersed nano-ZnO being used, the mechanical properties and anti-aging ability <b>of</b> natural <b>rubber</b> were best and better than that of 5 dosages of 99. 5 % of ordinary ZnO in traditional formula.

25|$|Rubber {{particles}} are {{formed in the}} cytoplasm of specialized latex-producing cells called laticifers within rubber plants. Rubber {{particles are}} surrounded by a single phospholipid membrane with hydrophobic tails pointed inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at the surface <b>of</b> the growing <b>rubber</b> particle, which allows new monomeric units to be added from outside the biomembrane, but within the lacticifer. The rubber particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers <b>of</b> material, the <b>rubber</b> particle, a biomembrane and free monomeric units. The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core due to the high negative charge along the double <b>bonds</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rubber</b> polymer backbone. Free monomeric units and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an allylic compound), which elongates by Mg2+-dependent condensation by the action <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> transferase. The monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer. The process displaces the terminal high-energy pyrophosphate. The reaction produces a cis polymer. The initiation step is catalyzed by prenyltransferase, which converts three monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into farnesyl pyrophosphate. The farnesyl pyrophosphate can bind to rubber transferase to elongate a new rubber polymer.|$|R

The present paper proposes to revisit this seminal work benefiting from the capabilities of new multiaxial fatigue machines. Then, a new mode III fatigue test for elastomers is developed. A thin <b>bonded</b> disk <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> with a circumferential cut is subjected to cyclic torsion to investigate the fatigue crack growth in mode III.

As a results, the method is applied to an unfilled natural rubber and the crack growth rate is related to the fracture energy for several loading cases.

The results showed that both flexural and compressive strength of concrete, especially compressive strength, decreased with the increase <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> content. Moreover, the smaller the particle <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> powder, the greaterer {{the strength of the}} concrete, which was not obvious as effect <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> powder content on the strength of concrete. The impermeability of concrete increased with the increase <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> powder content. The electric flux of concrete with 30 % rubber powder reduced to about 900 C, which was only 1 / 5 of that with 5 %. At the same content, smaller rubber particle has positiveeffects on the impermeability of concrete...|$|R

To obtain the particles up to 8 mm average size {{it is necessary to}} grind or granulate <b>rubber</b> bales. Because <b>of</b> very high stickiness <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> it is necessary to separate single particles of crushed material using a suitable type of parting agent. The amount of the parting agents depends on type <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> and it equals 1 – 5 %. This article describes the influence of type and dosage of parting agents on properties <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> mixture...|$|R

Through stretching and compressing rubber specimens, obtain the stress-strain relationship <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> material. Build finite element model <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> waveform generator, get the maximum static deformation and static stiffness in different forms of constitutive models and take actual tests <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> waveform generator. Compare finite element results with the actual test results, select Arruda-Boyce model as rubber hyperelastic model. This study lay a good foundation for the design <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> waveform generators and study of dynamic characteristics of impact test devices...|$|R

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} mechanics performance <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> concrete steel composite beam, nonlinear analysis on four steel concrete composite beams with different amount <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> {{has been carried}} out using finite element analysis software, and the influence <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> concrete to mechanical properties of composite beam was explored. The results show that ductility, crack resistance <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> concrete slab, shear capacity of shear connector for rubber concrete steel composite beam are improved significantly compared with ordinary steel concrete composite beams. Along with the increase <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> content, the energy consumption of composite beams gradually increases, while the ultimate bearing capacity decreases with small amplitude. As a kind of green environmental protection material Rubber Aggregate concrete has the characteristics of good ductility, crack resistance is strong, energy consumption is obvious and good wear resistance...|$|R

The sampling method using the simple random sample. The collection of data used were primary and secondary data. The results of the research aspects of socio-cultural and economic impact on farmers in developing community forestbased on rubber plant, assessed from the age of farmers belonging to a productive and has experience in planting and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plant. The low productivity <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plant, makes the net income of farmer is not enough for every day. The farmer factor do not conduct replanting,because some <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> crop still young and no farmer budget do not conduct replanting. Strategies SWOT Analysis can be taken is to use superior seeds qualified and revive the tradition <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plant. In order for the production <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plants is better role of the Department of Forestry and required Plantation...|$|R
