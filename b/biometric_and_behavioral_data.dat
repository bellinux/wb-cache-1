40|$|The motion-sensitive {{horizontal}} {{cells in}} the lobula plate of the fly are assumed to {{play a key role}} in the sensory control of yaw torque generated by the flying animal during course-stabilization maneuvers and the fixation of objects. This inference results from comparisons of electrophysiological data obtained from blowflies (Calliphora erythrocephala) <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>data</b> obtained mainly from houseflies (Musca domestica) and fruitflies (Drosophila melanogaster). Apart from few exceptions, the compatibility of these physiological <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>data</b> has not been critically tested. In the present study, the responses of the equatorial horizontal cell HSE of Calliphora and the yaw torque responses of Calliphora and Musca were recorded under identical visual stimulation with moving periodic gratings. The goal of the experiments was to obtain electrophysiological <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>data</b> on Calliphora, on the one hand, <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>data</b> on Calliphora <b>and</b> Musca, on the other hand, that allow direct comparisons between the physiological properties of the HSE and the visually induced torque responses in both species. The dependence of the HSE responses and the yaw torque responses on the direction, contrast frequency, and brightness of a moving periodic grating were evaluated quantitatively. The results of the electrophysiological recordings and torque measurements are in close agreement and thus represent strong evidence that the horizontal cells are, in fact, involved in yaw torque control in both species. Measurements of the cellular <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> responses as function of the stimulus position in the visual field, however, reveal differences between the spatial sensitivity of the horizontal cells and the sensory input to the motor system...|$|R

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of cognition has been advanced by two traditionally non-overlapping and non-interacting groups. Mathematical psychologists rely on <b>behavioral</b> <b>data</b> to evaluate formal models of cognition, whereas cognitive neuroscientists rely on statistical models to understand patterns of neural activity, often without {{any attempt to}} make {{a connection to the}} mechanism supporting the computation. Both approaches suffer from critical limitations {{as a direct result of}} their focus on data at one level of analysis (cf. Marr, 1982), and these limitations have inspired researchers to attempt to combine both neural <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> measures in a cross-level integrative fashion. The importance of solving this problem has spawned several entirely new theoretical and statistical frameworks developed by both mathematical psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists. However, with each new approach comes a particular set of limitations and benefits. In this article, we survey and characterize several approaches for linking brain <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>data.</b> We organize these approaches on the basis of particular cognitive modeling goals: (1) using the neural data to constrain a behavioral model, (2) using the behavioral model to predict neural data, and (3) fitting both neural <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>data</b> simultaneously. Within each goal, we highlight a few particularly successful approaches for accomplishing that goal, and discuss some applications.

40|$|Neuroimaging {{studies in}} Anorexia Nervosa (AN) have shown {{increased}} activation in reward and cognitive control regions {{in response to}} food, <b>and</b> a <b>behavioral</b> attentional bias (AB) towards food stimuli is reported. This study aimed to further investigate the neural processing of food using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Participants were 13 females with restricting-type AN, 14 females recovered from restricting-type AN, and 15 female healthy controls. MEG data was acquired whilst participants viewed high and low calorie food pictures. Attention was assessed with a reaction time task and eye-tracking. Time-series analysis suggested increased neural activity in response to both calorie conditions in the AN groups, consistent with an early AB. Increased activity was observed at 150 ms in the current AN group. Neuronal activity at this latency was at normal level in the recovered group, however, this group exhibited enhanced activity at 320 ms post-stimulus. Consistent with previous studies, analysis in source-space <b>and</b> <b>behavioral</b> <b>data</b> suggested enhanced attention and cognitive control processes in response to food stimuli in AN. This may enable avoidance of salient food stimuli and maintenance of dietary restraint in AN.
