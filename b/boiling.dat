5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial <b>boiling</b> point of about 35°C and a final <b>boiling</b> point of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different <b>boiling</b> range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The <b>boiling</b> range of that cut is from an initial <b>boiling</b> point of about 150°C to a final <b>boiling</b> point of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a <b>boiling</b> range from about 180°C to about 315°C. The <b>boiling</b> ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide <b>boiling</b> ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E

5|$|The closed-shell {{electron}} configuration of flerovium {{results in the}} metallic bonding in metallic flerovium being weaker than in the preceding and following elements; thus, flerovium {{is expected to have}} a low <b>boiling</b> point, and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal, similar to the predictions for copernicium, which also has a closed-shell {{electron configuration}}. The melting and <b>boiling</b> points of flerovium were predicted in the 1970s to be around 70°C and 150°C, significantly lower than the values for the lighter group 14 elements (those of lead are 327°C and 1749°C respectively), and continuing the trend of decreasing <b>boiling</b> points down the group. Although earlier studies predicted a <b>boiling</b> point of ~1000°C or 2840°C, this is now considered unlikely because of the expected weak metallic bonding in flerovium and that group trends would expect flerovium to have a low sublimation enthalpy. Recent experimental indications have suggested that the pseudo-closed shell configuration of flerovium results in very weak metallic bonding and hence that flerovium is probably a gas at room temperature with a <b>boiling</b> point of around −60°C.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the American Civil War, syrup makers started using large, flat sheet metal pans as they were more {{efficient}} for <b>boiling</b> than heavy, rounded iron kettles, because of a greater surface area for evaporation. Around this time, cane sugar replaced maple sugar as the dominant sweetener in the US; as a result, producers focused marketing efforts on maple syrup. The first evaporator, used to heat and concentrate sap, was patented in 1858. In 1872, an evaporator was developed that featured two pans and a metal arch or firebox, which greatly decreased <b>boiling</b> time. Around 1900, producers bent the tin that formed the bottom of a pan into a series of flues, which increased the heated surface area of the pan and again decreased <b>boiling</b> time. Some producers also added a finishing pan, a separate batch evaporator, as a final stage in the evaporation process.|$|E

In warm seasons (summer), the elevated center of the frost <b>boil</b> is moderately well drained compared to the depressed inter <b>boil.</b> The permafrost table surface is also affected by differing activity across the <b>boil.</b> The inner <b>boil</b> is more active and generally has more than twice the active depth than the inter <b>boil,</b> which causes the permafrost table surface to be in a nearly perfect bowl shape.|$|R

5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then <b>boiling</b> the mushrooms, or <b>boiling</b> the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each <b>boiling</b> the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of <b>boiling.</b> Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E
5|$|Strontium is a {{divalent}} silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and {{similar to those}} of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777°C) and <b>boiling</b> (1655°C) points are lower than those of calcium (842°C and 1757°C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727°C), but not in the <b>boiling</b> point (2170°C). The density of strontium (2.64g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54g/cm3) and barium (3.594g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540°C.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{saltwater}} upconing {{caused by}} the preferential groundwater discharge of <b>boils</b> is a key proce ss in the salinization of Dutch deep polders. The factors controlling upconing by <b>boil</b> discharge and <b>boil</b> water salinities are poorly constrained and have not been previously documented. We addressed this knowl- edge gap by investigating upconing mechanisms using field measurements and numerical simulation s of simplified situations. <b>Boils</b> occur as conduits in the upper aquitard connecting the underlying aquifer {{to the surface and}} allowing groundwater to discharge at rates up to 100 m 3 d? 1 with Cl concentrations up to 5 gL? 1. <b>Boils</b> are found as isolated features or clustered in small areas of 20 – 100 m 2. Field observations show that preferential flow through <b>boils</b> creates localized and narrow saltwate r upconing spikes, caus- ing the elevated <b>boil</b> water salinities. Modeling results indicate that <b>boil</b> water in Dutch polders com- prises mixtures of groundwater {{from a wide range of}} depths and salinities with larger contributions from shallower and less saline groundwater than from the deeper and more saline water. Similar to pre- vious numerical studies of pumping-in duced upconing, the numerical results show that the most impor- tant factors controlling the <b>boil</b> salinity in Dutch polders are <b>boil</b> discharge, the horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, the depth of the transition zone and the salinit y (or density) contrast within the aquifer. When <b>boils</b> are clustered, natural saltwater upconing is a function of the total discharge of a <b>boil</b> cluster, whereas the boil-to-boil salinity variations within a cluster are determined by the discharge of individual <b>boils</b> and their position relative to neighboring <b>boils.</b> Regional lateral flow significantly mod- ifies flow patterns by dividing the groundwater flow system into a local <b>boil</b> system overlying the regio- nal flow system. Despite this, regional flow has only a minor effect on the relative contribu tions of saline and fresh groundwater to <b>boil</b> discharge and thus on <b>boil</b> salinity as well...|$|R

A later paper predicts the <b>boiling</b> point of tennessine to be 345°C (that of astatine is estimated as 309°C, 337°C, or 370°C, although experimental values of 230°C and 411°C have been reported).
