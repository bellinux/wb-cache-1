5|$|The second {{aspect of}} the {{compensation}} system involves the start gate position. If the gate is changed at any point during a round after at least one athlete has jumped, then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions the gate was moved up, or awarded additional points for the gate being lowered. In variable wind conditions requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated, {{it is not uncommon}} for many gate changes to be made as a round wears on. In the era prior to gate compensation, athletes who had jumped before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to jump again, which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints.|$|E
25|$|Ramos-Horta was alerted of the gunfight but walked <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to his home. Reinado's men {{opened fire}} on him as he {{approached}} his home. One of Ramos-Horta's guards pushed {{in front of him}} as a human shield. The guard was shot and taken to a hospital in serious condition. The surviving rebels fled the scene.|$|E
25|$|In 1910 Ainsworth Hall was {{constructed}} for the United States Weather Bureau as its central Vermont station. Later {{returned to the}} university in 1948, it served as the Administrative Headquarters of the campus. By 1955, growth of the University forced the relocation of the Administration <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to Dewey Hall. When also in 1955 construction began on Webb Hall to the immediate west of the building, the infirmary moved into the now empty structure. Due to expansion of the university in the 1960s and 1970s the building was converted into {{the home of the}} Division of Social Sciences. The building is named for Mrs. Laura Ainsworth, widow of Captain James E. Ainsworth (NU 1853), who in 1915 worked to bring an infirmary to campus.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Aldritch drove at once <b>back</b> again <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to Bathsheba's. <b>The</b> {{first person}} he met was poor Liddy, who seemed {{literally}} to have dwindled smaller in these few latter hours. [...] "What has been done?" [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Kneeling on the grass, {{the man and}} {{his wife}} made a cup of their hands and drank the milk from it. And no sooner had they done this, than Koumongoe flowed <b>back</b> again <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> and entered <b>the</b> hut.|$|R
25|$|Resting {{in their}} hide {{for the next}} day, the commandos went over their plan of attack and {{withdrawal}} from the area. They left their hideout at 20:00 on 17 September to start their attack on the power plant. On their approach they detected a small craft on the fjord; fearing they would lose {{the element of surprise}} if seen, they retreated <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> By dawn they {{had not been able to}} reach their previous hideout; while they were in an exposed location they decided to stay where they were until that night. The commandos had by now started to run short of supplies, and Captain Black ordered the attack to proceed that night, 19/20 September, no matter what.|$|E
25|$|Scarlett and {{his command}} group, two aides and a trumpeter, {{were the first}} to reach the Russian cavalry. The rest of the brigade {{followed}} closely. As they neared the Russian line, they started to take carbine fire, which killed the Scots Greys' commander and took the hat off of its executive officer. The Scots Greys finally came abreast of the Inniskillings just short of the Russians and the two regiments finally were able to gallop. As the Inniskillings shouted their battle cry, Faugh A Ballagh, observers reported that the Scots Greys made an eerie, growling moan. The Scots Greys charged through the Russian cavalry, along with the Inniskilings, and disappeared into the melee among the mass of Russian cavalry. With both forces disordered by the charge, it became clear to the regimental adjutant of the Scots Greys that, to avoid be overwhelmed by Russian numbers, the Scots Greys had to reform. Pushed back from the centre of the mass, the Scots Greys reformed around the adjutant and drove again into the Russian cavalry. Seeing that the Scots Greys were again cut off, the Royal Dragoons, finally arriving to the fight after disobeying Scarlett's order to remain with the Light Brigade, charged to their assistance, helping to push the Russians back. Amid the hacking and slashing of the sabre battle, the Russian cavalry had had enough, and retreated <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> pursued for a short time by the Scots Greys {{and the rest of the}} regiments.|$|E
2500|$|While on the {{practice}} field, the guardsmen generally faced the parking lot which was about [...] away. At one point, some of them knelt and aimed their weapons toward the parking lot, then stood up again. At one point the guardsmen formed a loose huddle {{and appeared to be}} talking to one another. They had cleared the protesters from the Commons area, and many students had left, but some stayed and were still angrily confronting the soldiers, some throwing rocks and tear gas canisters. About 10 minutes later, the guardsmen began to retrace their steps <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> toward the Commons area. Some of the students on the Taylor Hall veranda began to move slowly toward the soldiers as they passed {{over the top of the}} hill and headed back into the Commons.|$|E
2500|$|On September 30, {{a larger}} Moroccan army {{appeared}} over <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> of Tangier. [...] The Portuguese chroniclers, with probable exaggeration, claim it {{was composed of}} 10,000 horsemen and 90,000 foot Henry moved his army to a hillside, offering battle, but the Moroccans just held {{their position in the}} valley. [...] After three motionless hours, Henry ordered the Portuguese to march against them and force the issue, but the Moroccans just retreated <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> evidently wishing to hold the higher ground. Seeing their motion, Henry called off the attack, and returned with his troops back to the siege lines. [...] The next day (October 1), much the same maneouvers were repeated, with the same results.|$|R
50|$|First race result: Nelson {{does not}} recall {{how well he}} did overall but he was leading his first moto but went <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{starting}} <b>hill</b> which was parallel to the straight. He simply did it automatically and without thinking since it was accidentally ingrained into him during the practice sessions previous to the race to avoid the ride back to <b>the</b> starting <b>hill</b> that would be necessary if he ran the entire track in practice.|$|R
5000|$|On the 2011 United States {{debt ceiling}} crisis, Chamberlain praised House {{minority}} leader Nancy Pelosi for {{standing up to}} GOP demands for cuts to Medicare and Social Security. “What we really need is a strong progressive caucus <b>backing</b> <b>up</b> Pelosi,” <b>The</b> <b>Hill</b> quoted Chamberlain as saying, “When it’s Nancy Pelosi versus the president, it’s a tough internal battle for Democrats. I hope they side with Pelosi because that’s what the American people want.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Burke did {{not long}} survive the morning as Tyson moved a ball <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> to flatten his stumps. Graeme Hole {{had a high}} backlift and failed to get his bat down in time to trap a yorker and was clean bowled by Tyson at 77/4. Hutton now rested his fast bowlers and brought on Trevor Bailey and Bob Appleyard {{to slow down the}} scoring and tie up the batsman. Richie Benaud was not a patient batsman and took a swipe at [...] "Applecart" [...] which he hit sky high to Tyson in the deep, who only managed to snatch it inches above the grass to have Australia 102/5. Neil Harvey was now getting into his stride and in what many {{observers}} thought was the greatest innings of his life, he counter-attacked the bowling, cutting short balls and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side and once hooking Tyson over fine leg's head for four. By lunch he and Ron Archer had taken the score to 118/5 and as long has Harvey was in the Australians thought they could win. After the interval Tyson and Statham were brought back on, with immediate results as Tyson felled Archer's stumps with another fast ball. Alan Davidson lasted only 6 balls before he was caught by the wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans off Statham. Statham was phenomenally accurate, conceding only 45 runs off 19 eight-ball overs. Tyson bled runs at double that rate, as Tom Graveney recalled [...] "I was fielding in the slips and we were having to stand 40 yards off the bat, and still the ball was often going over our heads from edged shots". Ray Lindwall came in fearing the bouncer, and it was his undoing as he turned a Tyson half-volley into a yorker by playing off the back foot and was bowled.|$|E

50|$|Joe calls a local {{doctor to}} come check on Horn. The doctor finds Horn {{to be fit}} and alerts the sheriff, in case Horn's family needs to be found. Horn grabs a bottle of {{penicillin}} that can cure his son's illness, then runs <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sandy <b>hill,</b> followed by Joe and the sheriff. As he runs over the rim, Horn sees the wagon train, then looks back over the rim to find unsettled territory, the power lines and the highway having vanished. After giving his son the medicine, Horn leads the party on toward California.|$|R

60|$|Jerry's outcry, as he sprawled, whirled, sprang, and slashed, was {{a veritable}} puppy-scream of indignation. He slashed ankle and foot as he {{received}} the second kick in mid-air; and, although he slid clear down the slope of deck into the scuppers, he left on the black skin the red tracery of his puppy-needle teeth. Still screaming his indignation, he clawed his way <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steep wooden <b>hill.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Wellington {{concentrates}} {{his forces}} on the village of Fuentes de Onoro. Still in disgrace, Sharpe, Runciman and the Real Compania Irlandese are left guarding the ammunition wagons. Concentrated French assaults push the British out of the village and <b>back</b> steadily <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> Wellington releases his reserves, the 74th, 45th and the 88th Connaught Rangers, who beat back the French into the village. However, the British are in turn counter-attacked by the Loup Brigade. With Sharpe's encouragement, Runciman [...] "offers" [...] to lead the Spanish Regiment to reinforce the Highlanders and Connaught Rangers. They are successful, and as the Loup Brigade falters the French fall back, and Wellington sends the line forward, winning the battle.|$|R
60|$|So {{to the consternation of}} the tandem riders, Jessie and her {{companion}} mounted and rode quietly <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> again.

60|$|The {{lengthening}} shadows lay {{blue and}} cool beneath the alders by the waterside, though the cornfields that rolled <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> glowed a coppery yellow {{in the light}} of the setting sun. It was hot and, for the most part, strangely quiet in the bottom of the valley since the hammers had stopped, but now and then an order was followed by a tramp of feet and the rattle of chain-tackle. Along one bank of the river the reflections of the trees quivered in dark-green masses; the rest of the water was dazzlingly bright.|$|E
60|$|They had {{it ready}} {{at the back}} of the cart in a few moments, and Evelyn, who knew that a four-bushel bag of oats is {{difficult}} to move, was astonished at the ease with which they handled it.

5000|$|The formal {{entrance}} of the temple is the Hall of the Heavenly Kings (...) [...] This hall is a double-eaved building.

The principal statue in this hall is that of the Maitreya Buddha in his manifestation as the cloth bag monk, or the Laughing Buddha. At <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> facing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill,</b> is <b>the</b> Skanda Buddha, or Weituo as he is known in Chinese. This statue dates from the Southern Song Dynasty. Being 800 years old this is the oldest and most important statue in the temple. Arranged along the left and right are the Four Heavenly Kings.

50|$|After a short section {{along the}} A371, <b>the</b> route heads <b>back</b> <b>up</b> into <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> passing close by Draycott Sleights SSSI and the {{airfield}} of the Mendip Gliding Club. At {{the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> is <b>the</b> earthworks of an ancient settlement, and several more roundbarrows are passed {{on the way to}} Priddy. Priddy village green has been the site of a sheep fair since 1348, and the New Inn appeared there in 1373. Heading south from Priddy, the route passes through Ebbor Gorge National Nature Reserve, and on to Wookey Hole, famous for its cave and witch legend. The Monarch's Way long-distance footpath joins here, and shares some, but not all, of the same route on the way to Wells.|$|R
60|$|Unable to {{withstand}} the onslaught, and already disheartened by their failure, the Bretons fled in wild alarm, and rushing towards the centre for protection threw the Normans also into confusion. The panic spread rapidly, the host wavered, and {{had already begun to}} fly, when William, throwing off his helmet, rode among them, and exhorting some and striking others with a lance he had caught up, at last restored order, and the Breton infantry rallied and fell upon their pursuers, killing many and driving the rest <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b>|$|E
60|$|Thorn's eyes {{rested on}} her for another moment, {{and then he}} made a sign of {{acquiescence}} and they went <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> At the top he marked a new line for the next day's sport, and then {{as the sun was}} getting low the party started home by the old stone-boat road. Near the bottom they overtook the Askews, and one or two others walking at their horses' heads as they cautiously descended a steep pitch. Grace noted that although they were not bringing much peat there was a risk of the sledges running down upon the teams.|$|E
6000|$|As {{he climbed}} <b>back</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> toward the corral {{where he had}} left his horse, he was filled with a wordless disgust of the town and its people. The night was still and cool, almost frosty. The air so clear and so rare filled his lungs with wholesomely sweet and reanimating breath. His head cleared, and his heart grew regular in its beating. The moon was sailing in mid-ocean, between the Great Divide and the Christo Range, cold and sharp of outline as a boat of silver. Lizard Head to the south loomed up {{ethereal}} as a cloud, so high it seemed to crash among the stars. The youth drew a deep breath and said: [...] "To hell with the town." ...|$|E
50|$|Two other {{important}} buildings were either constructed, or construction had commenced, while Packer was still alive: {{the other two}} being The President's House, to the West, and slightly downhill of Packer Hall, and Linderman Library (after daughter Lucy Packer Linderman), to the east, and again slightly downhill from the center building, Packer Hall. Both were relatively large prominent structures, and all of stone. The more utilitarian buildings were constructed immediately adjacent to Packer Ave. (south side), while the larger, and more important structures for the university as a whole, tended to be set <b>back,</b> and <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> As a general rule, this stands even until today. After the initial gift of one half million dollars, Packer {{was still able to}} consistently give to the young University. He was quite active in management, though his ideas were not always determinative.|$|R

As they walked home Priscilla spoke of the scenery, and of the country, and {{of the nature of the}} life which she and her mother and sister had passed at Nuncombe Putney. Nora said but little till they were just entering the village, and then she went back to the subject of her thoughts.
