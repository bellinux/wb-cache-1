40|$|AbstractHypokalemic {{respiratory}} paralysis in Sjögren's syndrome (SS) with distal {{renal tubular acidosis}} (RTA) is very rare. In the literature, {{only five}} such cases have been reported. We report a 48 -year-old lady, who presented with respiratory <b>paralysis,</b> <b>bulbar</b> weakness, and flaccid quadriplegia. She had severe hypokalemia (1. 11  mEq/L), metabolic acidosis (pH =  7. 09), hyperchloremia (120. 8  mEq/L), and normal anion gap (11. 2). An ammonium chloride test {{was consistent with the}} diagnosis of distal RTA. She recovered completely with potassium and alkali supplementations. Clinical features, positive Schirmer's test, and autoantibody screening were suggestive of diagnosis of SS. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis and respiratory involvement may occur as a first and rare complication of SS with distal RTA. Immunosuppressive therapy is not indicated except in the presence of systemic vasculitis. Potassium and alkali supplementations are the mainstay of the therapy. Patients with secondary hypokalemic periodic paralysis should be investigated for this possibility...|$|R

This study deals with an outbreak of aseptic meningitis in children caused by EV 71 virus. Methods: The authors report an outbreak of aseptic meningitis in children in and around Calicut in June 2008. Clinical and laboratory study was done in collaboration with National Centre for Disease Control, New Delhi. 149 children with aseptic meningitis were studied and followed up from June 2008 to May 2009. Result: All children had clinical features suggestive of aseptic meningitis and serology showed the rising antibody titre against EV 71 virus infection. CSF analysis also showed four fold rise in antibodies in one and ≥ 1 : 2 neutralising antibodies titer against EV- 71 in four samples indicating meningitis due to EV- 71.

50|$|Aladár Aujeszky (11 January 1869 Pest - 9 March 1933 Budapest) was a Hungarian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{professor of}} bacteriology and microbiologist, noted {{for his work}} on Pseudorabies. Pseudorabies, PRV, Aujeszky's disease, infectious <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> or 'mad itch', is caused by a virus with icosahedral symmetry and belongs to the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae within the family Herpesviridae. This subfamily has a wide host range and attacks the peripheral nervous system of the host. It was first described in 1813 in a situation where cattle and pigs shared a stable. In 1909 Weiss found that pigs are the reservoir host of the virus, and that even though other species such as cattle, sheep, cats, dogs, goats, horses, raccoons, skunks, mice, and rats may transmit the disease, the virus completes its life cycle only in pigs.Aujeszky studied under Endre Högyes. From 1907 to 1933 he worked in the Department of Bacteriology of the Royal Academy of Veterinary Medicine.

40|$|SummaryVaricella zoster virus (VZV) {{infection}} may trigger Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), {{but this}} is rare and almost always {{in the context of}} reactivation disease from latent VZV, ‘shingles’. We report here a case of severe GBS following primary VZV infection in an adult. A 40 -year-old man of Indian origin developed features of GBS including quadriplegia, <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis,</b> and bilateral facial nerve palsies 14 days after primary VZV infection contracted from a known case in a family member. Nerve conduction studies confirmed acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Anti-ganglioside antibodies were negative. The mechanism of Schwann cell attack following VZV infection is poorly understood but this case suggests that primary VZV infection may be a sufficient stimulus to drive antibody generation and precipitate severe clinical symptomatology. The morbidity associated with the complications of VZV infection in adulthood could be avoided if patients who are seronegative for VZV (frequently from the Asian subcontinent) are offered prophylaxis after an exposure in adulthood...|$|E

40|$|Chapter 12 of: Manual for the {{surveillance}} of vaccine-preventable diseases. 5 th edition, 2012. Poliomyelitis {{is a highly}} contagious disease caused by three serotypes of poliovirus. Infection with poliovirus results in a spectrum of clinical manifestations from inapparent infection to nonspecific febrile illness, aseptic meningitis, paralytic disease, and death. Two phases of acute poliomyelitis can be distinguished: a nonspecific febrile illness (minor illness) followed, in {{a small proportion of}} patients, by aseptic meningitis and/or paralytic disease (major illness). The ratio of cases of inapparent infection to paralytic disease among susceptible individuals ranges from 100 : 1 to 1000 : 1 or more. Following poliovirus exposure, viral replication occurs in the oropharynx and the intestinal tract. Viremia follows, which may result in infection of central nervous system cells. The virus attaches and enters cells via a specific poliovirus receptor. Replication of poliovirus in motor neurons of the anterior horn and brain stem results in cell destruction and causes the typical clinical manifestations of poliomyelitis. Depending on the site of infection and paralysis, poliomyelitis can be classified as spinal, bulbar, or spino-bulbar disease. Progression to maximum paralysis is rapid (222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 4 days), usually associated with fever and muscle pain, and rarely progresses after the temperature has returned to normal.

40|$|After an {{incubation}} period {{of one to}} two months rabies presents with non-specific prodromal symptoms and often with paraesthesiae of the bitten area. As in canine rabies there are furious and dumb forms of the disease. In man, furious rabies is characterised by hydrophobia: terror and excitation with spasms of inspiratory muscles, larynx and pharynx precipitated by attempts to drink and {{by a variety of}} other stimuli. Hydrophobia may represent an exaggerated respiratory tract irritant reflex with associated arousal potentiated by the selective destruction of brain stem inhibitory systmes. Also typical of furious rabies are intermittent episodes of excitement, hallucinations and maniacal behaviour. Focal neurological abnormalities are surprisingly uncommon. Other signs include hypersalivation, tachycardia and hyperpyrexia. Paralysis and coma supervene after a few days: survival rarely exceeds seven days. Dumb or paralytic rabies is an ascending flaccid paralysis with sphincter involvement and sensory disturbances. Death from respiratory and <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> occurs after a longer illness than furious rabies. In a minority of cases hydrophobia develops before the terminal coma. Complications include respiratory arrest, pneumonitis, cardiac arrhythmias and interstitial myocarditis, posterior pituitary disorders, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Differential diagnoses of furious rabies include hysterical pseudo hydrophobia, tetanus, other encephalitides, delirium tremens and various other intoxications. Paralytic rabies may have to be distinguished from postvaccinal encephalomyelitis, poliomyelitis and other causes of Landry-type ascending paralysis.

40|$|SUMMARY Haptoglobin (Hp) {{groups were}} {{investigated}} in 81 patients with motor neuron disease. A significant excess of heterozygotes was observed, accentuated among males {{and in the}} {{progressive spinal muscular atrophy}} subgroup. The results are discussed in terms of a possible influence of Hp in the immunological response. Motor neuron disease is a progressive disorder of the upper and lower motor neurons. Affected individuals become severely disabled and many die within a few years. Most cases are sporadic but 5 - 10 % occur in a familial pattern suggesting autosomal dominant in-heritance. 1 A slight male overrepresentation is often observed. Three clinical varieties are recognised, de-pending on involvement of upper or lower motor neu-rons: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) shows signs of upper and lower motor neuron disorder, whereas progressive <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> (PBP) and progressive spinal muscular atrophy (PSMA) show only lower motor neuron signs. With time the symptomatologies of these variants often merge and in late stages of the disease subgroups are difficult to distinguish. The cause and pathogenesis of motor neuron dis-ease are unknown and various aetiologies, such as viral, immunological, genetic and environmental, have been proposed. 2 3 On the island of Guam, with a focus of high incidence for motor neuron disease, ex-tensive investigations of genetic markers have been performed without finding any striking associ-ations. 46 Apart from histocompatibility antigens genetic markers have not, to our knowledge, pre-viously been investigated in cases of motor neuron disease outside the high incidence areas. 7 Haptoglobin (Hp), the major haemoglobin-binding serum protein, is an acute phase reactant with various properties of unknown biological significance.

When {{the pulse of}} the patient became weak and frequent and the general condition was getting more serious after the operation, the author injected Gynergen (Sandoz) hypodermically, and found the quick improvement of the conditions both subjectively and objectively. Case 2. This case was a typical form of the vagotonic exophthalmic goitre after Eppinger and Haas in which goitre, cardiac disturbances, increased perspiration and chronic diarrhoea in long period were chief complaints without noticiable exophthalmos. The author performed thyroidresection when the basal metabolism was lowered by iodine treatment. Two days after the operation the irregular pulse was seen temporarily, but recovered by injection of Gynergen. On the fourth day after the operation suddenly appeared the symptom of socalled “Coma Basedowicum Zondek” and heart became quite out of order showing auricular fibrillation, perpetual arhythmia, ventricular and auricular extrasystole, and never recovered until death followed even by injections of Gynergen, physostigmin, quinine derivatives and other cardiacs and also blood transfusion as well. As an imoirtent factor of causal conditions of “Coma Basedowicum Zondek” the author believes that the changes of heart due to intoxication by thyroidsubstance play a Principal role. That is to say, the operative manipulation results easily temporary increase of thyroidsubstance in blood vessels, and the balance of metabolism may be broken, {{and on the other hand}} the disturbances of blood circulation of whole body due to the changes of heart accelerate the development of serious comatose condition like <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> and lead to death.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} reports {{the case of}} a 68 -year-old male patient who {{presented}} to Tokyo Rosai Hospital for the treatment of alcoholic liver disease. A high density was observed in liver segment S 2, while a tumor, 30 mm in size, exhibiting a low density was observed in the delayed phase upon contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), which was performed prior to admission. The tumor appeared slightly poorly defined upon abdominal ultrasound and was observed as a 30 mm low-echoic nodule that was internally heterogeneous. A 5 -mm thick contrast enhancement effect was observed in the tumor border in the vascular phase on Sonazoid contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, while a defect in the entire tumor was observed in the post-vascular phase. Dysphagia had commenced three months prior to presentation and a weight loss of ~ 3 kg was observed. Therefore, the patient was admitted to Tokyo Rosai Hospital due to the presence of a hepatic tumor, and to undergo a close inspection of the cause of the tumor. Upon close inspection, it was determined that the weight loss and aphagia were caused by progressive <b>bulbar</b> <b>paralysis.</b> A contrast-enhanced CT was performed on post-admission day 29 as a follow-up regarding the hepatic tumor. As a result, although no change in the tumor size was observed, the contrast enhancement in the tumor borderline had disappeared. Necrosis of the tumor was considered. However, as viable persistence of the malignant tumor could not be excluded, a hepatic left lobe excision was performed. The patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on the morphology of the cellular necrosis. In addition, occlusion due to thrombus was observed within the blood vessels passing inside the fibrous capsule. It was hypothesized that the formation of a thick fibrous capsule and occlusion due to thrombus in the feeding vessel were possibly involved as the cause of complete spontaneous necrosis.

40|$|DISTRIBUTION: • Mainly {{utilized}} as {{a pasture}} or a lawn grass, {{but it also}} escapes and grows in moist fertile places in the wild. • It grows naturally in the highlands of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, DRC, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Burundi. • It has been introduced to {{many other parts of}} the world. BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION: General: This is a dense mat-forming perennial grass that has both stolons and creeping rhizomes. Leaves: Leaf blades are flat, folded or rolled with a prominent midrib and leaf sheaths are overlapping. Flowers: During the flowering season (August - April) long white filaments can be seen, but there are no visible inflorescences. TOXIC PRINCIPLE: • Grass invaded with Spodoptera exempta (army worms, kommandowurms). • The worms themselves are not toxic and the kikuyu grass in itself appears to be non-toxic, but a combination of these two results in toxicity through an unknown mechanism. • It takes ± 10 days for the grass to become toxic after an army worm infestation and the toxicity is retained for 4 - 6 weeks after the worms have gone (life-cycle is completed, or they are killed by insecticides). Rumenitis can also occur when the grass was not previously invaded by army worms, but when there was a growth spurt during hot weather, following high nitrogen fertilization and irrigation of kikuyu. SYSTEMS AFFECTED: Gastro-intestinal system. CLINICAL SIGNS: Latent period of 24 hours or longer. 1. Gastrointestinal signs: • Ruminal atony and tympany. • Colic: Grunting and kicking at the abdomen • Usually a constipation. • Ruminal irritation results in an excess accumulation of fluids, sloppy ruminal contents which may gush from the mouth and nose at death. • It also results in severe dehydration with sunken eyes and a unpliable skin. 2. Neuromuscular signs: • <b>Bulbar</b> <b>paralysis</b> (“shamdrinking” and severe salivation due to inability to swallow). • Muscle tremors• Ataxia, the animal lies down and rises with difficulty. Dies 2 - 4 days later. Most deaths within 48 hours.
