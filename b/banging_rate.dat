40|$|Previous {{research}} reports mixed results concerning infants’ differential interest {{for a specific}} age group. Most of these findings are based on studies using static photographs and drawings as stimuli. Moreover, only behavioral data were used to investigate infants’ attentional preferences. In the present study, we showed video sequences of differently aged models (peers, 3. 5 -year-olds, and adults) manipulating an object, and measured heart rate as an objective psychophysiological measurement of infants’ attention, in addition to looking time and <b>banging</b> <b>rate.</b> The results showed that 12 -month-olds preferred watching older children's object-related actions compared to those of peers and adults, but 6 - and 9 -month-olds did not. In subsequent control experiments, alternative explanations that this preference relied merely on the visual appearance or a higher activity level of older children were excluded. We explain this observed developmental shift by the increasing importance of social learning and object use at this age. Thus, 12 -month-olds prefer watching more knowledgeable individuals who provide an action repertoire that infants of this age are about to develop...|$|E
40|$|Very recently, the IceCube Collaboration {{reported}} a flux of neutrinos {{in the energy}} range 50 TeV < E_ν < 2 PeV, which departs from expectations from atmospheric background at the 5. 7 σ level. This flux is in remarkable agreement with the expected diffuse flux of neutrinos from starburst galaxies, and the 3 highest energy events have uncertainty contours encompassing some of such systems. These events, {{all of which have}} well-measured energies above 1 PeV, exhibit shower topologies, for which the angular resolution is about 15 ^∘. Due to this angular uncertainty and the a posteriori nature of cuts used in our study {{it is not possible to}} assign a robust statistical significance to this association. Using muon tracks, which have angular resolution < 1 ^∘, we compute the number of observations required to make a statistically significant statement, and show that in a few years of operation the upgraded IceCube detector should be able to confirm or refute this hypothesis. We also note that double <b>bang</b> topology <b>rates</b> constitute a possible discriminator among various astrophysical sources.

40|$|If muon neutrinos {{produced}} in cosmological sources oscillate, neutrino telescopes {{can have a}} chance to detect tau-neutrinos. In contrast to muon neutrinos the Earth is completely transparent for tau neutrinos thanks to the short life time of tau-leptons {{produced in}} charged current interactions. Tau-lepton decaysin flight producing another tau neutrino (regeneration chain). Thus, tau neutrinos cross the Earth without being absorbed, though loosing energy both in regeneration processes and in neutral current interactions. Neutrinos of all flavors can be detected in deep underwater/ice detectors by means of Cherenkov light emitted by charged leptons produced in neutrino interactions. Muon and tau-leptons have different energy loss features, which provide opportunities to identify tau-events among the multitude of muons. Some signatures of tau-leptons that can be firmly established and are background free have been proposed in literature, such as 'double bang' events. In this paper we present results of Monte Carlo simulations of tau-neutrino propagation through the Earth accounting for neutrino interactions, tau energy losses and tau decays. Parameterizations for hard part and corrections to the soft part of the photonuclear cross-section (which contributes a major part to tau energy losses) are presented. Different methods of tau-lepton identification in large underwater/ice neutrino telescopes are discussed. Finally, we present a calculation of tau neutrino double <b>bang</b> event <b>rates</b> in cubic km scale detectors.
