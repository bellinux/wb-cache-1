50|$|Beryllium {{hydroxide}} <b>Be(OH)2</b> is amphoteric. The hydroxide {{itself is}} insoluble in water, with a solubility product log K*sp of −11.7. Addition of acid gives soluble hydrolysis products, including the trimeric ion Be3(OH)3(H2O)63+, which has OH groups bridging between pairs of beryllium ions making a 6-membered ring. At very low pH the aqua ion Be(H2O)42+ is formed. Addition of hydroxide to <b>Be(OH)2</b> gives the soluble tetrahydroxo anion Be(OH)42−.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are three}} forms reported, anhydrous, a tetrahydrate and basic {{beryllium}} carbonate. The anhydrous form {{is reported to}} be unstable, decomposing to BeO and carbon dioxide, and requiring storage under CO2. The tetrahydrate is said to be formed when CO2 is bubbled through a solution of <b>Be(OH)2</b> and is also reported to be similarly unstable.|$|E
50|$|Beryllium hydroxide, <b>Be(OH)2,</b> is an {{amphoteric}} hydroxide, dissolving in both {{acids and}} alkalis. Industrially, it is produced as a by-product in {{the extraction of}} beryllium metal from the ores beryl and bertrandite. The natural pure beryllium hydroxide is rare (in form of the mineral behoite, orthorhombic) or very rare (clinobehoite, monoclinic). When alkali is added to beryllium salt solutions the α-form (a gel) is formed. If this left to stand or boiled, the rhombic β-form precipitates. This has the same structure as zinc hydroxide, Zn(OH)2, with tetrahedral beryllium centers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{amphoteric}} hydroxide Al(OH)3 {{has four}} major crystalline forms: gibbsite (most stable), bayerite, nordstrandite and doyleite.All these polymorphs are built up of double layers of hydroxide ions - the aluminium atoms on {{two-thirds of the}} octahedral holes between the two layers - and differ only in the stacking sequence of the layers. The structures {{are similar to the}} brucite structure. However, whereas the brucite structure can be described as a close-packed structure in gibbsite the OH groups on the underside of one layer rest on the groups of the layer below. This arrangement led to the suggestion that there are directional bonds between OH groups in adjacent layers. This is an unusual form of hydrogen bonding since the two hydroxide ion involved would be expected to point away from each other. The hydrogen atoms have been located by neutron diffraction experiments on α-AlO(OH) (diaspore). The O-H-O distance is very short, at 265 pm; the hydrogen is not equidistant between the oxygen atoms and the short OH bond makes an angle of 12° with the O-O line. A similar type of hydrogen bond has been proposed for other amphoteric hydroxides, including <b>Be(OH)2,</b> Zn(OH)2 and Fe(OH)3 ...|$|E
