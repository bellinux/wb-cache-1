40|$|Background: Early {{detection}} of hearing loss {{has been a}} long-standing priority {{in the field of}} audiology. Currently available auditory testing methods include both behavioural and non-behavioural or objective tests of hearing. This study was planned with an objective to assess hearing loss in children using behavioural <b>observation</b> <b>audiometry</b> and brain stem evoked response audiometry. Methods: A total of 105 cases suffering from severe to profound hearing loss were registered. After proper history and clinical examination patients were subjected to behavioural <b>observation</b> <b>audiometry</b> (BOA) and brainstem evoked response audiometry test (BERA). Results: Out of 105 cases in 62 cases (59. 05 %) the findings of both BOA and BERA tests were similar but in 43 cases the findings of both tests were not similar. In total 18 cases (17. 14 %) diagnosis of severe hearing loss could be made by BERA test only because of in 10 cases there was inconclusive BOA finding and in 8 cases there was no response in BOA test. Conclusions: Behavioural <b>observation</b> <b>audiometry</b> can detect hearing loss but in developmentally retardrd children in whom responses are difficult to elicited, this test is not so conclusive. BERA is the tool which can confirm the normal sensitivity of hearing in such persons whenever required and is very useful in early {{detection of}} hearing loss and planning rehabilitative procedures.

A model is presented to guide choice of strategies for the measurement of five core elements in theoretically informed, randomized prevention trials: (1) training intervention agents, (2) delivery of key intervention conditions by intervention agents, (3) responses of clients to intervention conditions, (4) short-term risk reduction in targeted client behaviors, and (5) long-term change in client adjustment. It is argued that the social processes typically thought to mediate interventionist training (Element 1) and the efficacy of psychosocial interventions (Elements 2 and 3) may be powerfully captured by <b>behavior</b> <b>observation.</b> It is also argued that <b>behavior</b> <b>observation</b> has advantages in the measurement of short-term change (Element 4) engendered by intervention, including sensitivity to behavior change and blinding to intervention status.

40|$|Implantation: A Review of Assessment Procedures and a Research Plan Abstract. “Universal Newborn Hearing Screening ” {{law will}} result in many more infants {{identified}} with hearing loss. Thus, many more infants will receive interventions such as cochlear implants {{at a very young}} age. In order to evaluate the benefits of receiving cochlear implants during infancy, speech perception and language skills of infants who receive cochlear implants must be assessed. However, most current procedures used to test infant speech perception and language skills have only been used with normal-hearing infants. This paper reviews procedures that have been used to assess sound detection (Behavioral <b>Observation</b> <b>Audiometry</b> (BOA) and Visual Reinforcement Audiometry (VRA)), speech discrimination (VRA, High Amplitude Sucking (HAS), Visual Habituation (VH) Procedure), word learning (VH and Preferential Looking Paradigm (PLP)), and sensitivity to regularities in the ambient language (Headturn Preference Procedure (HPP)). A research plan is outlined and described to adapt the PLP and VH procedures for use with infants who use cochlear implants...|$|R
50|$|There {{are cases}} where {{conventional}} PTA {{is not an}} appropriate or effective method of threshold testing. Procedural changes to the conventional test method may be necessary with populations {{who are unable to}} cooperate with the test in order to obtain hearing thresholds. Sound field audiometry may be more suitable when patients are unable to wear earphones, as the stimuli are usually presented by loudspeaker. A disadvantage of this method is that although thresholds can be obtained, results are not ear specific. In addition, response to pure tone stimuli may be limited, because in a sound field pure tones create standing waves, which alter sound intensity within the sound field. Therefore, {{it may be necessary to}} use other stimuli, such as warble tones in sound field testing. There are variations of conventional audiometry testing that are designed specifically for young children and infants, such as behavioral <b>observation</b> <b>audiometry,</b> visual reinforcement audiometry and play audiometry.|$|R

Design: PTA was performed at six frequencies at the screening level 20 dB HL. Referral criteria were threshold levels ≥ 25 dB HL at two or more frequencies for one ear or both. Study sample: 1478 participants aged 7 – 91 years were included. Results: 1470 (99. 5 %) people cooperated in screening of which 1325 (90 %) could be tested on both ears at all six frequencies. A majority, 987 (66. 8 %), performed ordinary PTA, 234 (15. 8 %) conditioned play audiometry, and 249 (16. 9 %) behavioural <b>observation</b> <b>audiometry.</b> Six hundred and sixty-nine (45 %) passed and 809 (55 %) failed according to referral criteria.

30|$|This {{study has}} taken an {{opportunistic}} sensing approach for real-life <b>behavior</b> <b>observation,</b> as human subjects {{are also part of}} the sensing infrastructure. For billing purposes, telecom operators keep records of their mobile phone customers’ usage logs. Each of these usage logs, also known as Call Detail Records (CDRs), includes a caller ID, callee ID, caller’s connected cell tower ID, callee’s connected cell tower ID, duration of the call, and timestamp. Each time the mobile phone user makes or receives a call, i.e., connecting to a cell tower, the nearest cell tower location is recorded. Thus, collectively CDR data provides fine-grained longitudinal information about the individual’s mobility and sociality. In this study, we capitalized on the opportunity that this kind of data can provide such a detailed <b>behavior</b> <b>observation</b> concerning mobility and sociality. We used anonymized CDR data of mobile phone users in Portugal over the period of one year.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the audiological journey {{of a group}} of infants with auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) following the fitting of hearing aids, and to investigate the potential benefits of including cortical auditory-evoked potentials (CAEPs) and a measure of functional auditory behaviour during early audiological management. DESIGN: Results from chart revision of estimated hearing threshold, early behavioural testing, parental observation, and functional auditory behaviour assessments were described, and compared to visual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) thresholds obtained at a mean corrected age of 10 months (SD 3). The relationship with CAEPs and functional performance was examined. STUDY SAMPLE: The study included 12 infants diagnosed with ANSD and fitted with amplification. RESULTS: The estimated 4 FA at a mean corrected age of four months (SD 5) was within ± 10 dB of VRA results in 75 % of infants when unaided and aided behavioural <b>observation</b> <b>audiometry</b> (BOA), together with unaided and aided parental observations was combined. Infants with a greater proportion of CAEPs present had higher PEACH scores. CONCLUSIONS: Delaying amplification until VRA results were available would have led to a significant period of auditory deprivation for infants in this study group. None of the assessments could accurately determine hearing thresholds when used in isolation, however when used in combination clinicians were able to obtain sufficient information to fit hearing aids early, and identify infants requiring closer monitoring. 12 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the role of}} the Banking Time intervention on student-teacher relationships and problem behaviors in early childhood. Ninety elementary students (5 - 7 year-olds) were placed in either an experimental or control group. Students in the experimental group participated in the Banking Time intervention with their classroom teacher. Students in the control group participated in one-on-one reading sessions. Students in both groups were evaluated pre- and post-intervention using the Student Teacher Relationship Scale (STRS; Pianta 2 ̆ 6 Hamre, 2001), Teacher Report Form (TRF; Achenbach, 1991) and a <b>behavior</b> <b>observation</b> tally form. A sample of students from both groups were administered a questionnaire pre- and post-intervention. Lastly, teachers completed a likert-type survey regarding their opinions of the Banking Time intervention to maintain fidelity pre-intervention and mid-intervention. It was hypothesized that the Banking Time intervention would help to foster student-teacher relationships and ultimately lead to decreases in problem behaviors, as measured by the STRS, the TRF and the <b>behavior</b> <b>observation</b> tally form. A significant decrease in problem behavior was found in the experimental and control group when measuring behavior with the Teacher Report Form. There were no significant findings to indicate that the Banking Time intervention improved student-teacher relationships. Implications for future research are also presented...|$|R
