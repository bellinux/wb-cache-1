40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} watershed response to climate change and forest fire impacts, {{to better understand the}} hydrologic budget and inform water management decisions for present and future needs. The study site is 2, 365 km 2, located in the upper Umatilla River Basin (URB) in northeastern Oregon. The Precipitation Runoff Modeling System, a distributed-parameter, physical-process watershed model, was used in this study. Model calibration yielded a Nash Sutcliffe Model Efficiency of 0. 73 for both calibration (1995 - 2010) and validation (2010 - 2014) of daily streamflow. Ten Global Climate Models using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 experiments with Representative Concentration Pathways 4. 5 and 8. 5 (RCP), were used to observe hydrologic regime shifts in the 2020 s, 2050 s, and 2080 s. Mean center timing of flow occurs earlier in the year in both pre- and post-fire conditions, where there are increased winter flows and decreased summer flows throughout the 21 st century. Change in temperature and percent change in precipitation is more variable in the summer than winter increasing over time, with a slight decrease in winter precipitation in the 2080 s in RCP 8. 5. Temperature increases 1. 6 °C in RCP 4. 5 and 3. 3 °C in RCP 8. 5 {{by the end of the}} 21 st century. The ratio of Snow Water Equivalent to Precipitation decreases 96 % in the 2080 s in RCP 8. 5 before forest cover reduction, and decreases 90 - 99 % after forest cover reduction. Potential <b>basin</b> <b>recharge</b> and the base-flow index are both sustained throughout the 21 st century with slight declines before forest cover reduction, with an increase in <b>basin</b> <b>recharge</b> and increase in base-flows in the 2080 s after fire-burns. However, the simulated sustained base-flows and area-weighted <b>basin</b> <b>recharge</b> in this study, do not take into account the complex geologic structure of the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG). A more robust characterization and simulation of URB aquifer recharge would involve coupling the PRMS model with a groundwater model in a future study.

50|$|Since every {{groundwater}} <b>basin</b> <b>recharges</b> at {{a different}} rate depending upon precipitation, vegetative cover and soil conservation practises, the quantity of groundwater that can be safely pumped varies greatly among {{regions of the world}} and even within provinces. Some aquifers require a very long time to recharge and thus the process of overdrafting can have consequences of effectively drying up certain sub-surface water supplies. Subsidence occurs when excessive groundwater is extracted from rocks that support more weight when saturated. This can lead to a capacity reduction in the aquifer.|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzed}} watershed {{response to}} climate change and forest fire impacts in the upper Umatilla River Basin (URB), Oregon, using the precipitation runoff modeling system. Ten global climate models using Coupled Intercomparison Project Phase 5 experiments with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4. 5 and 8. 5 were used to simulate the effects of climate and fire-burns on runoff behavior throughout the 21 st century. We observed the center timing (CT) of flow, seasonal flows, snow water equivalent (SWE) and <b>basin</b> <b>recharge.</b> In the upper URB, hydrologic regime shifts from a snow-rain-dominated to rain-dominated basin. Ensemble mean CT occurs 27 days earlier in RCP 4. 5 and 33 days earlier in RCP 8. 5, in comparison to historic conditions (1980 s) {{by the end of}} the 21 st century. After forest cover reduction in the 2080 s, CT occurs 35 days earlier in RCP 4. 5 and 29 days earlier in RCP 8. 5. The difference in mean CT after fire-burns may be due to projected changes in the individual climate model. Winter flow is projected to decline after forest cover reduction in the 2080 s by 85 % and 72 % in RCP 4. 5 and RCP 8. 5, in comparison to 98 % change in ensemble mean winter flows in the 2080 s before forest cover reduction. The ratio of ensemble mean snow water equivalent to precipitation substantially decreases by 81 % and 91 % in the 2050 s and 2080 s before forest cover reduction and a decrease of 90 % in RCP 4. 5 and 99 % in RCP 8. 5 in the 2080 s after fire-burns. Mean <b>basin</b> <b>recharge</b> is 10 % and 14 % lower in the 2080 s before fire-burns and after fire-burns, and it decreases by 13 % in RCP 4. 5 and decreases 22 % in RCP 8. 5 in the 2080 s in comparison to historical conditions. Mixed results for recharge after forest cover reduction suggest that an increase may be due to the size of burned areas, decreased canopy interception and less evaporation occurring at the watershed surface, increasing the potential for infiltration. The effects of fire on the watershed system are strongly indicated by a significant increase in winter seasonal flows and a slight reduction in summer flows. Findings from this study may improve adaptive management of water resources, flood control and the effects of fire on a watershed system...|$|E

Environmental isotope data, as well as other methods provide support for determining recharge areas of the aquifers, especially for karst aquifers, residence time and interconnections between aquifer systems.

40|$|The {{hydrogeology}} of {{a portion}} of the Santa Catalina Mountains just north of Tucson, Arizona was studied. Groundwater level contour maps for 1930 and 1972 were made by establishing a well net, use of well logs and field observations. Water levels were measured in March, 1972. Water level records and well logs provided water level information for 1930. The resulting maps showed hydraulic gradients ranging from 400 feet per mile to 60 feet per mile, and seven possible groundwater recharge channels to the Tucson Basin aquifer. Comparing the 1930 and 1972 water level maps showed that the greatest water level change of about 60 feet has occurred along Rillito Creek because of heavier aquifer development. Less change in water levels has occurred in the foothills. Chemical quality analysis and temperature measurements were used to further define three local aquifers. Groundwater was generally of good quality, except in one mine well that had high salt concentrations because of ore deposits.

40|$|Environmental context. Recognising {{that road}} flares and air bags may {{contribute}} perchlorate to road runoff, we analysed perchlorate in runoff from two accident-prone suburban highways {{during a period}} of five rain events. This runoff reaches <b>recharge</b> <b>basins</b> where it then infiltrates into the groundwater. The concentrations of perchlorate averaged ∼ 2 µg L− 1, high enough to be of concern if the drinking water standard for perchlorate were in the low µg levels. Abstract. First flush samples of road runoff were sampled in April 2006 corresponding with five rain events at 12 catch <b>basins</b> and two <b>recharge</b> <b>basins</b> in Suffolk County, NY. Most runoff here is directed into <b>recharge</b> <b>basins</b> or sumps that drain directly into the sole source aquifer. Thus, contaminants from road runoff can contaminate groundwater. In addition to ClO 4, we present data for Cl, Na, Br, Sr, and nitrogen as nitrate (N-NO 3) as they are the dominant ions in the most probable sources of ClO 4 to road runoff, presumably road flares, road salt, air bags and road-side fertilizers. Correlations between the ions indicate that road salt elevates concentrations of Na, Br and Cl in road runoff. The average ClO 4 value is 2. 18 ± 0. 66 (standard error of the mean) µg L− 1 for the catch basins and 2. 98 ± 0. 87 µg L− 1 for the two <b>recharge</b> <b>basins.</b> Excess ClO 4 in the present study appears mainly from road flares.

30|$|The aim of {{the current}} study is to develop new {{analytic}} model for prediction of groundwater mound in a sloping ditch–drain aquifer system due to multiple localized recharge. The study uses a simple approach to develop analytical expressions for water head distribution in the aquifer due to uniform percolation from a single <b>recharge</b> <b>basin.</b> The solution is then extended to multiple <b>basins</b> of varying <b>recharge</b> rate which are arbitrarily located in the model domain. Unlike previous works based on Laplace transform technique, the current study treats the entire aquifer as a single zone system. Closed form analytic expressions for water head distribution in the aquifer and discharge rate into the ditches are obtained by solving the linearized Boussinesq equation with eigenvalue–eigenfunction method. Some special cases such as no slope and uniform localized recharge are derived as limiting cases of the analytic results.

40|$|An {{estimation}} of long-term achievable recharge rates {{is necessary to}} evaluate proposed spreading <b>basin</b> <b>recharge</b> projects, and is often not obtained until full-scale or at least pilot project operations occur. The potential effect of subsurface heterogeneities on downward flow is usually {{based on data from}} a few point measurements of near-surface infiltration and geologic logging of vadose zone exploration boreholes. These limited data are often insufficient to accurately estimate large-scale recharge rates. The judicious use of in-situ vadose zone testing methods, however, can provide robust data that greatly improves initial estimates of groundwater recharge rates and can eliminate the need for a pilot test, resulting in significant cost savings. The proposed approach integrates near-surface infiltration testing, exploratory drilling, geological logging, and multiple-scale in-situ vadose zone testing. In-situ testing in instrumented exploratory boreholes quantifies vadose zone hydraulic properties {{in much the same way}} that aquifer tests quantify hydraulic properties of the saturated zone. Testing at multiple scales provides a better understanding of subsurface heterogeneities and the efficiency of vadose zone sediments to transmit groundwater recharge. This approach maximizes field-based data collection, resulting in a more cost-effective investigative program. In addition, in-situ testing is well suited for comparing relative recharge characteristics between proposed sites...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of GeologySaugata DattaIn {{specific}} lithologic and hydrogeological settings, Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) projects using vadose zone wells {{have the}} potential to outperform infiltration basins in terms of volume of water recharged. Numerical modeling can assist in determining which recharge method is most efficient in infiltrating water to unconfined alluvial aquifers of differing unsaturated zone lithologic complexities. The Sagamore Lens Aquifer (SLA) in Cape Cod, Massachusetts is an example of an aquifer with minimal lithologic complexity while the Hueco Bolson Aquifer (HBA) near El Paso, Texas has greater lithologic complexity. This research combines two U. S. Geological Survey numerical models to simulate recharge from infiltration basins and vadose wells at these two locations. VS 2 DTI, a vadose zone model, and MODFLOW- 2005, a saturated zone model, were run sequentially at both sites and with both vadose well and infiltration <b>basin</b> <b>recharge</b> methods simulated.

At the HBA location, soil samples were tested for conductivity and grain size distribution and a microgravity survey was begun to constrain the models. The infiltration basin structure proved to be more efficient, infiltrating more water volume at both locations. Lithologic complexity formed perched conditions in the HBA model, significantly affecting infiltration rates from both infiltration methods at that location.

The average thickness of the aquifer is some 90 feet, and its average transmissivity and storage coefficient are 100, 000 gallons/day/foot, and 0. 2 respectively. The storage capacity of the ground water reservoir is some 140, 000 acre feet. Ground water is discharged from the basin by evapotranspiration, effluent seepage, and underflow out of the <b>basin.</b> <b>Recharge</b> to the ground water is from direct precipitation over the basin area, by influent seepage, and by underflow into the basin. The ground water supplies of the area have small amounts of dissolved solids, mostly bicarbonates and, carbonates.

40|$|Anomalous {{concentrations}} of silica in ground {{water of the}} eastern San Joaquin Valley originate from several diverse sources and are subsequently modified by recharge or diagenesis. Statistics, geochemical models, and column studies identified potential sources of silica in ground water and those parameters most important in influencing its distribution. Principal components analysis indicated inverse time and potassium as the parameters which best relate to silica. Inverse time relates to ground-water recharge while potassium relates to either the rhyolitic Friant Pumice, the hardpans of the eastern San Joaquin Valley, or diagenetic losses. A lumped parameter model suggests that recharge {{is responsible for the}} drop in silica concentrations beneath Fresno since 1971. The Madera County model indicates higher silica concentrations associated with the Friant Pumice, older geologic units with hardpans, finer grained sediments, and areas of ground-water discharge. Lower silica concentrations are associated with unweathered sediments, areas receiving recharge, and areas underlain by the Corcoran Clay. Column leaching studies produced silica concentrations from the Friant Pumice of up to 90 mg/ 1, Turlock Lake and Riverbank Formation hardpans from 40 - 50 mg/ 1, and younger Modesto Formation sediments from 10 - 40 mg/l. Spatially, volcanogenic sediments impart the highest silica concentrations to the ground water, 70 - 95 mg/ 1, and occur along the eastern margin of the valley, north of the San Joaquin River, or in San Joaquin River fluvial deposits. Iron-silica hardpans, found at various depths along {{the east side of the}} valley, are associated with silica {{concentrations of}} 40 - 70 mg/l. The typical arkosic sediments of the eastern valley have silica concentrations of 20 - 40 mg/l. Silica concentrations in ground water are modified by recharge and diagenetic processes. Either natural or artificial recharge having 4 - 16 mg/ 1 silica may lower ambient silica concentrations in ground water. Recharge occurs beneath some rivers and in transmissive paleochannel deposits; artificial sources include agricultural overirrigation and <b>basin</b> <b>recharge.</b> The down-gradient loss of silica to the sedimentary column, more prevalent at depth, apparently is by the sorption of silica on clays, the formation of clays, or deposition of amorphous silica...|$|E

30|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of the recharge rate {{is the result of}} the effect of several different parameters, including the lithology, slope gradient, rock fracturing, land use and soil type. The lithology directly affects the permeability of the rocks and therefore the rate of infiltration. The geology varies in the three basins (Dauteloup 1958; Piqué et al. 2007). The Rheraya basin has a low permeability compared with the rest of the region and consists of continental Permo–Triassic sandstone formations, marly limestone continental facies of Senonian age, and multiple ferromagnesian rocky outcrops that are almost impermeable. The part of the Ourika basin in the study area is composed of middle Eocene and continental Miocene formations dominated by early-to-middle Quaternary and modern formations, all highly permeable. To the north, up to 80  m of breccia conglomerate promotes infiltration. In addition, the very friable brown soils, which cover almost the entire <b>basin,</b> promote <b>recharge.</b> Apart from its lithological and soil characteristics, lineaments correspond to fault zones and fractures with secondary porosity and high permeability. These lineaments are very important as they promote the passage of water towards the aquifer.

This layer of accumulated fine-grained detrital sediment reduces {{the capacity of the}} basin to transmit water to the underlying aquifer, and is the primary contributor to percolation decay. Laboratory studies indicate that the majority (> 90 %) of this “fouling layer” consists of inorganic solids less than 62. 5 microns in apparent diameter (silt- to clay-sized particles). Removal of suspended solids in this size range by gravity settling is ineffective. Hypothesized is that loss of percolation is primarily a function of the accumulation of detritus.

40|$|The thesis {{covers the}} {{investigation}} of the storm water runoff and artificial recharge components of the Atlantis Water Resource Management Scheme in the Southwestern Cape. The objective {{of the study was to}} obtain an in-depth knowledge of the process of artificial recharge of urban storm water runoff, in order to identify the most efficient recharge management strategy for the Atlantis aquifer. To achieve the objective it was necessary to first study the existing knowledge on urban storm water hydrology and artificial recharge by spreading, and to create a conceptual model of what might be expected. The study area was then investigated to examine how closely the actual situation was reflected by the conceptual model, enabling recommendations to be made for the sound management of the system. The stormwater runoff component was found to differ from most urban hydrological studies as a result of its large baseflow component. The sandy nature of the catchment, small percentage area of effective impervious surface, and high groundwater table resulted in the baseflow constituting more than 40 % of the total storm water runoff and accounting for over 60 % of the pollution load. The "first flush" effect established as a major source of pollution in other studies, was found to be of minor significance in this study area. The overall stormwater quality (excluding the noxious industrial baseflow) was found acceptable for artificial recharge within the study area, although the baseflow from the industrial sub-catchments showed the potential for being a major source of pollution in the future. The treated wastewater used for artificial recharge prior to 1987 was found to be unacceptable for recharge purposes. The treated industrial effluent should under no circumstances be recharged up-gradient of the Witzand well field. The treated domestic effluent although of a poorer quality than the resident Witzand well field groundwater could be recharged in order to boost recharge volumes and form a buffer against further intrusion by the poor quality groundwater from the Brakkefontein area. This would however only be acceptable if strict water quality control is maintained and recharge does not take place west of the present <b>basin.</b> The <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> was found to be well situated with respect to influencing the Witzand wellfield and maintaining a groundwater buffer against poor quality groundwater flow from the northeast towards the central area of the wellfield. Unfortunately the surrounding low-lying topography and sandy retaining walls have resulted in return flow and raised groundwater-levels. The raised groundwater mound does not comply with the conceptual model and together with the sandy nature of the unsaturated zone resulted in less effective purification during infiltration. The practice of letting large portions of the basin floor dry-out during summer was shown to be beneficial and the periodic cleaning of the deeper portions of the basin essential. The artificially recharged water was found to have influenced the upper portion of the aquifer well beyond the West Coast Road. The study of groundwater quality being a good method for tracing artificially recharged water. The groundwater quality has improved as a result of artificial recharge since the removal of treated wastewater from the <b>recharge</b> <b>basin.</b> The groundwater was (ii) found to be very responsive to the slightest changes in <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> water quality or/and quantity. Management of the <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> therefore had to be very much of a compromise between qualitative and quantitative approaches. The present approach of recharging all the stormwater runoff throughout the year providing the most efficient compromise under the present conditions. The study revealed that the most efficient recharge management strategy would be the recharge of treated domestic sewage effluent in the present <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> and all residential storm water runoff plus industrial "storm flow" starmwater runoff in a new <b>recharge</b> <b>basin</b> located northwest of the present basin. Strict water quality control must be maintained on the water discharged into the basins and an annual wet/dry cycle implemented within the basins to boost infiltration. The entire system should continue being monitored to safe guard the groundwater resource from pollution and over exploitation. FoolJ 1 ote:-...|$|R
30|$|To {{assess the}} {{potential}} groundwater resource for the <b>basin</b> the <b>recharge</b> {{has been estimated}} using the groundwater model. The estimated sustainable safe yields from the groundwater model for each catchment are compared to the estimated current domestic groundwater usage with a 20 % contingency added for stock watering, small scale irrigation, commercial, institution (schools and Government buildings) and losses. Industrial, Mining and large scale agriculture are not included, they are considered socio-economic demands which may be developed after domestic uses are covered. It can be seen (Table  6) that currently the percentage of annual safe yield extracted ranges between 6.8 and 62 %, averaging around 29 %. This suggests {{there is room for}} socio-economic expansion of groundwater usage within all catchments.|$|R
