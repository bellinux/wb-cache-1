40|$|This article {{reports the}} {{preliminary}} {{findings on the}} morphology, chemical structure, antimicrobial and UV-screening properties of <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres.</b> <b>Bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> provide a very promising alternative to other natural fibres {{by virtue of their}} distinctive characteristics such as eco-friendly farming, inherent antimicrobial, UV-protective and highly· breathable properties. However, these novel properties are moslly claimed by fibre manufacturers, with little scientific evidence.   Moreover, those properties may largely depend on the manufacturing process, which is not widely disclosed by the manufacturers, Common manufacturing processes may require the use of a large amount of chemicals which would not make the product truly eco-friendly. Therefore, there is a strong need for unbiased laboratory experiments being conducted in a rigorous manner to elucidate the origin of those unique properties of <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> and to develop new processing methods to effectively utilise the properties in the final products.

40|$|In {{the present}} communication, {{the effect of}} {{positional}} density on the DC electrical conductivity of <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> was studied. A comparative study was made between the DC conductivity behavior of <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> taken from upper and lower portions of bamboo. Four samples from each portion going from centre to periphery were taken. Bamboo fibers taken from the upper portion were less dense, hence showing lower values of DC conductivity. In spite of the lower portion of bamboo being more dense, it showed higher values of DC conductivity, which is attributed to moisture content. <b>Bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> from centre to periphery {{were taken from the}} strips cut at 2 mm distance from centre.

5000|$|The Swiss company Litrax is {{one company}} {{involved}} in the manufacturing of <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre.</b> Litrax claims to use a more natural way of processing the bamboo into fibre. In this the woody part of the bamboo is crushed mechanically before a natural enzyme retting and washing process is used {{to break down the}} walls and extract the <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre.</b> This bast fibre is then spun into yarn. [...] In fine counts the yarn has a silky touch. The same manufacturing process is used to produce linen fabric from flax or hemp. Bamboo fabric made from this process is sometimes called bamboo linen. The natural processing of litrax bamboo allows the fibre to remain strong to produce an extremely high quality product. This process gives a material that is very durable.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{concrete}} {{is highly}} contributed {{in the construction}} works for its various advantages such as low cost, availability, fire resistance and others. Generally, concrete is high in compressive strength but relatively low in tensile strength. Steel is the mostly used for the reinforcement of concrete due to its high tensile strength. Alternate materials such as fibres are used to increase the tensile strength of the concrete. Bamboo is natural, cheap and readily available material. Most importantly, bamboo has a high tensile strength. This research is aimed at studying the performance of concrete with <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> as additives in it. The objective {{of this research was}} to experiment the structural behaviour of <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> reinforced concrete (BFRC) with various length of <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> as additives. In this paper, 2 % of <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> by volume of the concrete with the length of 40 mm and 60 mm are added into concrete and compare with the plain concrete which act as the control specimen. 2 tests are tested which are the cube compression test and flexural test. From the test result has shown that the compressive strength of different length of BFRC is lower as compared to the controlled cube specimen. For flexural strength, the 40 mm BFRC is the most optimum length as it has shown the almost similar strength with the controlled beam specimen. The flexural strength for the 60 mm BFRC is slightly lower than that of the controlled beam specimen...|$|R

40|$|Functionality {{of natural}} fibre-reinforced {{composites}} continually attracts attention {{and offers a}} unique possibility. We fabricated several types of unidirectional and random <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre</b> green composites, and examined their damping properties {{as a function of}} <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre</b> content, fibre length, and fibre morphology. The loss factors of the <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre</b> green composites decreased with increasing <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre</b> content.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} that <b>bamboo</b> and coir <b>fibres,</b> with an epoxy resin matrix, can be fabricated to produce unidirectional composites. A secondary aim was to demonstrate the production of intra-ply hybrids with unidirectional <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> and spread E-glass fibres. The methods explored in this work to produce the unidirectional arrays of <b>bamboo</b> and coir <b>fibre</b> preforms involved the use of a carding process to align the as-received <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres.</b> A new method for spreading E-glass bundles or tows was developed in the author’s research group. The feasibility of using the spread E-glass fibre bundles with the uni-directional bamboo preforms to manufacture a new class of intra-fibre hybrids was undertaken. A resin infusion fabrication method was used to manufacture the uni-directional bamboo and E-glass/bamboo. Tensile testing was used to determine the mechanical properties of the bamboo and E-glass/bamboo hybrid composites. The as-fabricated cross-sections and the post-tensile tested fracture surfaces were characterised using optical and scanning electron microscopy respectively.

40|$|This article {{describes}} ultra violet (UV) light shielding behaviour of Australian grown bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens). Optical reflectance showed that untreated bamboo plant has UV absorption properties. To reveal {{the origin of}} the UV absorption property, its chemical components were extracted using several polar and non-polar solvents. The extracts in most of the polar and non-polar solvents showed UV absorption property. Protic polar solvents showed better ability to extract UV absorbing chemicals than aprotic and non-polar solvents, except hexane. The chemical components of bamboo were analysed by FT-IR spectroscopy and the findings were correlated with the UV absorbance characteristics. The results confirmed that the UV absorption ability of bamboo originates from nothing but lignin. It is thus indicated that the conventional methods to manufacture <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres,</b> such as complete degumming or viscose methods, that involve the removal of lignin, cannot retain the unique UV absorption property of bamboo plant in <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} filler loading and bonding agent on the dynamic {{properties}} and swelling behaviour of <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre</b> filled natural rubber composites were carried out. <b>Bamboo</b> <b>fibre</b> {{was used as}} a filler and the loading range was from 0 to 50 phr. Dynamic properties were determined using a Monsanto moving die rheometer (MOR 2000) at 150 'C. Results show that the maximum elastic torque (S-raw) and minimum elastic torque (S 'ML) increase with increasing filler loading and the addition of bonding agent. However, the viscous torque (S-MN) and tan Sae decrease with the addition of bonding agent. For swelling behaviour, the water absorption of the composites increases with increasing filler loading but decreases with the addition of bonding agent.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Bamboo fibres were {{carbonized}} at 600 0 C {{and used}} as particulate filler in natural rubber vulcanizates. Carbon black {{was used as the}} reference filler, while maleic anhydride-grafted-polyisoprene was used as a compatibilizer. The natural rubber vulcanizates were compounded on a two-roll mill, and test samples were prepared by compression moulding. The cure characteristics and physico-mechanical properties of the natural rubber vulcanizates were studied at filler loadings of 0, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 15 phr (parts per hundred parts rubber). The carbonized <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre</b> was characterized for filler properties and sieved to 0. 08 µm and 0. 35 µm particle sizes. Results obtained showed that compatibilized carbonized <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre</b> filled vulcanizates exhibited improvement in the cure properties investigated over the non-compatibilized vulcanizates. Carbon black exhibited higher tensile strength, modulus, hardness and elongation at break in the vulcanizates than carbonized <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre.</b> However, at any given loading of carbonized <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibre,</b> these properties increased with a reduction in particle size of the filler.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{characterize}} <b>bamboo</b> (Guadua angustifolia) <b>fibres</b> mechanically, single fibre (SFT), dry fibre bundle (DFB) and impregnated bundle (IFB) tests were performed. It {{was found that}} the strength of the fibres follows a Weibull distribution, furthermore showing that the variability of the material (obtained from the shape parameter m= 8. 3) is relatively low. The tensile strength of the fibres was around 800 MPa (SFT). In order to determine experimentally the two Weibull parameters from load-strain (P-ε) curves in the DFB, it {{was found that the}} alignment of the fibres and therefore the uniform tensile loading of the fibres is a critical aspect in order to obtain consistent results. For this, a methodology including techniques to evenly spread the fibres in a UD configuration and strain measurements with an optical extensometer, were developed. For the DFB configuration the tensile strength of the <b>bamboo</b> <b>fibres</b> dropped 20 % in comparison with the SFT and the Weibull shape parameter reduced to 5. 3, indicating higher variability. In the case of the IFB, the characteristic tensile strength (σo= 254 MPa) was found 14 % higher than the results from standard UD bamboo fibre/epoxy composites previously reported.
