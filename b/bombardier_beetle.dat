25|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} is {{also one}} of the two chief chemicals in the defence system of the <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetle,</b> reacting with hydroquinone to discourage predators.|$|E
25|$|The large {{majority}} of known organisms use catalase in every organ, with particularly high concentrations occurring in the liver in mammals. One unique use of catalase occurs in the <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetle.</b> This beetle has two sets of liquids that are stored separately in two paired glands. The larger of the pair, the storage chamber or reservoir, contains hydroquinones and hydrogen peroxide, while the smaller, the reaction chamber, contains catalases and peroxidases. To activate the noxious spray, the beetle mixes {{the contents of the}} two compartments, causing oxygen to be liberated from hydrogen peroxide. The oxygen oxidizes the hydroquinones and also acts as the propellant. The oxidation reaction is very exothermic (ΔH = −202.8 kJ/mol) and rapidly heats the mixture to the boiling point.|$|E
25|$|The full {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} beetle's unique defense mechanism is unknown, but biologists {{have shown that the}} system could have theoretically evolved from defenses found in other beetles in incremental steps by natural selection. Specifically, quinone chemicals are a precursor to sclerotin, a brownish substance produced by beetles and other insects to harden their exoskeleton. Some beetles additionally store excess foul-smelling quinones, including hydroquinone, in small sacs below their skin as a natural deterrent against predators—all carabid beetles have this sort of arrangement. Some beetles additionally mix hydrogen peroxide, a common by-product of the metabolism of cells, in with the hydroquinone; some of the catalases that exist in most cells make the process more efficient. The chemical reaction produces heat and pressure, and some beetles exploit the latter to push out the chemicals onto the skin; this is the case in the beetle Metrius contractus, which produces a foamy discharge when attacked. In the <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetle,</b> the muscles that prevent leakage from the reservoir additionally developed a valve permitting more controlled discharge of the poison and an elongated abdomen to permit better control over the direction of discharge.|$|E
25|$|Rarely seen, most Paussinae are obligate or facultative myrmecophiles, {{living within}} the nests of ants, predatory on ant larvae and workers. Many have {{elaborate}} antennal structures and body parts flattened. Paussines are moderate sized (6–20mm), characterised by glandular hairs that produce secretions attractive to ants {{and by the}} odd antennal structures of many species. Their pygidial glands can produce explosive secretions, giving them the other name of flanged <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetles</b> although they are not particularly close relatives of the typical <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetles</b> (Brachininae).|$|R
25|$|Ant nest beetles ({{subfamily}} Paussinae) or paussines, {{some members}} of which are known also as flanged <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetles,</b> are a large subfamily within the ground beetles (Carabidae).|$|R
25|$|The unique {{combination}} of {{features of the}} <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetle's</b> defense mechanism—strongly exothermic reactions, boiling-hot fluids, and explosive release—have been claimed by creationists and proponents of intelligent design to be examples of irreducible complexity.|$|R
500|$|Besides birds, toads and insectivorous mammals, {{the predators}} of mole crickets include {{subterranean}} assassin bugs, wolf spiders, and various beetles. [...] The South American nematode Steinernema scapterisci kills Neocapteriscus mole crickets by introducing bacteria into their bodies, causing an overwhelming infection. Steinernema neocurtillae {{is native to}} Florida and attacks native Neocurtilla hexadactyla mole crickets. Parasitoid wasps of the genus Larra (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) attack mole crickets, the female laying an egg on the external surface of the mole cricket, and the larva developing externally on the mole cricket host. Ormia depleta (Diptera: Tachinidae) is a specialized parasitoid of mole crickets in the genus Neoscapteriscus; the fly's larvae hatch from eggs inside her abdomen; she is attracted by {{the call of the}} male mole cricket and deposits a larva or more on any mole cricket individual with which she comes in contact. [...] Specialist predators of mole cricket eggs in China and Japan include the <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetle</b> Stenaptinus jessoensis whereas in South America they include the <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetle</b> Pheropsophus aequinoctialis (Coleoptera: Carabidae); the adult beetle lays eggs near the burrows of mole crickets, and the beetle larvae find their way to the egg chamber and eat the eggs. Fungal diseases can devastate mole cricket populations during winters with sudden rises of temperature and thaws. The fungus Beauveria bassiana can overwhelm adult mole crickets and several other fungal, microsporidian and viral pathogens have been identified.|$|E
500|$|Other {{proposals}} were more physical in nature. As mentioned above, William Parks {{suggested that it}} was joined to the vertebrae with ligaments or muscles, and helped with moving and supporting the head. Othenio Abel proposed it {{was used as a}} weapon in combat among members of the same species, and Andrew Milner suggested that it {{could be used as a}} foliage deflector, like the helmet crest (called a 'casque') of the cassowary. Still other proposals made housing specialized organs the major function. Halszka Osmólska suggested that it housed salt glands, and John Ostrom suggested that it housed expanded areas for olfactory tissue and much improved sense of smell of the lambeosaurines, which had no obvious defensive capabilities. One unusual suggestion, made by creationist Duane Gish, is that the crest housed chemical glands that allowed it to throw jets of chemical [...] "fire" [...] at enemies, similar to the modern-day <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetle.</b>|$|E
500|$|Many animals {{make use}} of {{poisonous}} chemicals for self-defence. These may be concentrated in surface structures such as spines or glands, giving an attacker {{a taste of the}} chemicals before it actually bites or swallows the prey animal: many toxins are bitter-tasting. A last-ditch defence is for the animal's flesh itself to be toxic, as in the puffer fish, danaid butterflies and burnet moths. Many insects acquire toxins from their food plants; Danaus caterpillars accumulate toxic cardenolides from milkweeds (Asclepiadaceae). The <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetle</b> has specialized glands on the tip of its abdomen that allows it to direct a toxic spray towards predators. The spray is generated explosively through oxidation of hydroquinones and is sprayed at a temperature of 100°C. Armoured crickets similarly release blood at their joints when threatened (autohaemorrhaging). Several species of grasshopper including Poecilocerus pictus, Parasanaa donovani, Aularches miliaris, and Tegra novaehollandiae secrete noxious liquids when threatened, sometimes ejecting these forcefully. Spitting cobras accurately squirt venom from their fangs at the eyes of potential predators, striking their target eight times out of ten, and causing severe pain. Termite soldiers in the Nasutitermitinae have a fontanellar gun, a gland on the front of their head which can secrete and shoot an accurate jet of resinous terpenes [...] "many centimeters". The material is sticky and toxic to other insects. One of the terpenes in the secretion, pinene, functions as an alarm pheromone.|$|E

5000|$|Brachinus is a genus {{of ground}} beetle {{native to the}} Nearctic, Palearctic, the Near East and North Africa. Beetles in this genus are {{commonly}} referred to as <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetles.</b> The genus contains the following species: ...|$|R
2500|$|Typical for {{the ancient}} beetle {{suborder}} Adephaga {{to which they}} belong, they have paired pygidial glands in the lower back of the abdomen. These are well developed in ground beetles, and produce noxious or even caustic secretions used to deter would-be predators. In some, commonly known as bombardier beetles, these secretions are mixed with volatile compounds and ejected by a small combustion, producing a loud popping sound and a cloud of hot and acrid gas which can injure small mammals, such as shrews, and is liable to kill invertebrate predators outright. To humans, getting [...] "bombed" [...] by a <b>bombardier</b> <b>beetle</b> is a decidedly unpleasant experience. This ability has evolved independently twice as it seems – in the flanged bombardier beetles (Paussinae) which {{are among the most}} ancient ground beetles, and in the typical bombardier beetles (Brachininae) which are part of a more [...] "modern" [...] lineage. The Anthiini, though, can mechanically squirt their defensive secretions for considerable distances and are able to aim with a startling degree of accuracy; in Afrikaans, they are known as [...] ("eye-pissers"). In {{one of the very few}} known cases of a vertebrate mimicking an arthropod, juvenile Heliobolus lugubris lizards are colored similar to the aposematic oogpister beetles, and move in a way that makes them look surprisingly similar to the insects at a casual glance.|$|E

25|$|The spray is {{produced}} from a reaction between two chemical compounds, hydroquinone and hydrogen peroxide, which {{are stored in}} two reservoirs in the beetle's abdomen.
