25|$|Designing {{a strong}} curved jib {{required}} Fairbairn's advanced theoretical {{understanding of the}} mechanics of a box girder. The tension forces were carried by the outer, convex surface of the girder which was made of <b>back</b> <b>plates</b> being chain-riveted together. The inner surface carried a compressive load. To avoid plate crumpling, it was made as a cellular structure: an inner plate and webs formed three rectangular cells, effectively box girders in their own right. The character of a box girder is to resist torsional twisting, so a composite face built up of them is also good at resisting crumpling.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for attaching strain gages to substrates is described. A strain gage having a <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> {{is attached to}} a substrate by using a foil of brazing material between the <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> and substrate. A pair of electrodes that are connected to a current source, are applied to opposite sides of the <b>backing</b> <b>plate,</b> so that heating of the structure occurs primarily along the relatively highly conductive foil of brazing material.

40|$|Brush seal dynamic {{behavior}} is {{strongly related to}} pressure and flow fields. Developments in brush seal design have led to geometric modifications to control flow field and consequent brush seal issues including blow-down, hang-up, and pressure stiffening. Some of the geometric enhancements {{have been found to}} have common use as <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> modifications. Over the two decades of brush seal evolution, many <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations have been suggested in numerous patent disclosures. Even so, literature on the effects of geometric modifications on pressure and flow fields remains limited. This study numerically investigates brush seal pressure and flow fields for such common conceptual <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations as single and multiple grooves, with and without by-pass passages. The CFD analysis presented employs a bulk porous medium approach for the bristle pack. The effectiveness of various <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations outlining important flow features is discussed. Results indicate that <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> configurations have a decisive role in shaping seal pressure fields. In general, it has been found that all cases having bypass configuration leak more. Moreover, the major portion of the seal leakage through fence height is fed from the <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> cavity. The single <b>backing</b> <b>plate</b> groove forms a constant pressure behind the bristle pack. In contrast, multiple grooves form multiple constant pressure regions...|$|R

25|$|The various {{published}} {{descriptions of}} Hesperosaurus contradict {{each other because}} of changes and differences in interpretation. Originally, Carpenter reconstructed the disarticulated skull elements into a very convex head, modelling it on the shape of Huayangosaurus. The discrepancies in the vertebral count are caused by applying different criteria to the problem whether (and which) cervicodorsal vertebrae should be {{considered part of the}} neck or the back. The exact shape of the plates is hard to determine due to erosion. Paul considered the neck plates to be low, but the <b>back</b> <b>plates</b> as taller. Also the Aathal specimens are as yet undescribed. A complete description of the entire material is in preparation by Octávio Mateus.|$|E
25|$|The holotype, HMNH 001 (later HMNS 14), {{was found}} in the Windy Hill Member, stratigraphic zone 1 of the lower Morrison Formation, dating from the early Kimmeridgian, about 156 million years old.

25|$|In 2015, a {{study by}} Evan Thomas Saitta based on the finds in the JRDI 5ES Quarry {{concluded}} that Hesperosaurus showed sexual dimorphism. Plates found in the quarry came in two types: a taller one, and a low broad one. Though the <b>back</b> <b>plates</b> of the various individuals were not articulated, Saitta managed to order them into cervical, dorsal and caudal series for each type. This seemed to show that some individuals had tall plates exclusively while others bore broad plates only, which was confirmed by earlier specimens also possessing plates of one kind. Saitta suggested that the tall plates typified the females, while the males were equipped with low plates. The findings {{of the study were}} questioned by palaeontologists Kevin Padian and Kenneth Carpenter although no formal scientific studies were published as a rebuttal.|$|E

25|$|The {{researchers}} had previously shown {{that there were}} differences in parka design between Akulmiut (in the present-day tundra villagers of Nunapitchuk, Kasigluk, and Atmautluak), the coast (Caninermiut), lower Kuskokwim (Kusquqvagmiut) and lower Yukon (Pastulirmiut, Kuigpagmiut) river areas, and natives could identify villages that shared a design. The Akulmiut woman's parka typically featured a design along the bodice or culuksugun (also known as culuksuk; hanging decoration on a parka; spine, backbone) or qemirrlugun (piece of calfskin {{in the middle of}} a traditional Yup’ik parka with three tassels hanging from it, often having a “drawn bow and arrow” or a fish-tail design stitched on it; smaller plate below the large front and <b>back</b> <b>plates</b> on parka) which represented the tail of an Alaska blackfish (Dallia pectoralis). Occasionally the blackfish tail design in the early part of the 20th century was seen on women's parkas of the Nelson Island people (Qaluyaarmiut) and lower Kuskokwim but were never seen, as one elder woman reported, for example, on parkas of Hooper Bay (Naparyaarmiut) or Chevak (Qissunarmiut) women.|$|E

Her remains were interred at Twyford, Middlesex. The monument back plate is straight sided with top and bottom curved and facetted. The raised inscription plaque is oblong with a 45° cut at each corner, over which is a moulded shelf, on which sits an urn with 'cloth' swagging attached and topped with a flambeau. Floriate devices are a boss {{each side of the}} urn, bell flower ribbons hanging from the shelf either side of the plaque, and an oval flower and leaf spray below. The second is a double dedication: firstly to Sir Montague Cholmeley (died 1851 aged 59 years); secondly to Dame Elizabeth, his wife (died 1822), daughter and co-heiress of John Harrison of Norton Place, north from Lincoln. This monument back plate is straight sided with top deeply curved and bottom partly curved. The raised inscription plaque is rectilinear, and sits on a square-edged stepped shelf supported by curved brackets with embossed acanthus decoration, with a device of two strapped palm leaves below. At each side of the plaque is a hanging folded drape attached to a moulded cornice. At each side of the cornice top is a conch shell which provides the holding point for a plain swag that springs from a knot above; between the swagging is a raised cross. The monument was provided by George Wilcox of Piccadilly. Above this monument is one smaller to James Harrison Cholmeley (1808–1854), of a scrolled plaque on a straight sided back plate with a pointed top; above the scroll sits a decorative crest.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 Carpenter {{provided}} a diagnosis. Due to his conclusion that Hesperosaurus were rather basal, in it many comparisons {{were made with}} the basalmost known stegosaurian Huayangosaurus, that lost their relevance once {{it became clear that}} the phylogenetic position was in fact quite derived. In 2008 Maidment indicated three autapomorphies: the possession of eleven back vertebrae; the fourth sacral not being fused to the sacrum; <b>back</b> <b>plates</b> that are longer (from front to rear) than tall. Maidment also provided some traits in which Hesperosaurus was more basal than Stegosaurus armatus. In the atlas, even in adult specimens the neural arches are not fused to the intercentrum. The postzygapophyses, the rear joint processes, of the rear neck vertebrae do not prominently protrude upwards. In the back vertebrae, the neural arches, above the level of the neural canal, are not especially lengthened to above. At the hip region ossified tendons are present. The ribs are expanded at their lower ends. The neural spines of the tail vertebrae are not bifurcated. The lower end of the pubic bone is expanded (spoon-shaped in side view). To Carpenter this differential diagnosis was problematic because he considered Stegosaurus armatus, the type species of Stegosaurus, a nomen dubium and rejected Maidment's lumping of all North-American Stegosaurus material into a single species, the great variability of which making it difficult to establish any differences with Hesperosaurus. He considered Stegosaurus stenops, the name historically given to several well-preserved specimens, a separate species and {{provided a}} new differential diagnosis of Hesperosaurus compared to S. stenops. The antorbital fenestra is large instead of very small. The maxilla is short and deep, half as tall as long, instead of having a height a third of the length. The basisphenoid of the lower braincase is short instead of long. Thirteen neck vertebrae are present instead of ten. Thirteen dorsal (back) vertebrae are present instead of seventeen. The middle dorsals have a basal form in possessing a low neural arch rather than a high one. The cervical ribs have expanded lower ends. In the front tail vertebrae, the tops of the neural spines are rounded instead of bifurcated. The front edge of the shoulderblade is indented instead of running parallel to the rear edge. The front blade of the ilium diverges strongly sideways instead of weakly. The rear blade of the ilium has a knob-shaped expansion at the rear end. The front end of the prepubic process has an upward expansion. The plates of the hip and tail base are oval and low instead of high and triangular.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1880s, {{the gentleman}} farmer Alfred Nicholson Leeds {{collected}} large fish fossils from loam pits near Peterborough, England. In May 1886 these were inspected by John Whitaker Hulke, who in 1887 partially reported {{them as the}} <b>back</b> <b>plates</b> of the stegosaurian Omosaurus. On 22 August 1888, the American dinosaur expert Professor Othniel Charles Marsh visited Leed's farm at Eyebury and quickly concluded that the presumed dinosaurian armour in fact represented the skull bones of a giant fish. Within two weeks British fish expert Arthur Smith Woodward examined the specimens and began to prepare a formal description published in 1889. In it he named the species Leedsichthys problematicus. The generic name Leedsichthys means [...] "Leeds' fish", from Greek ἰχθύς, ichthys, [...] "fish". The fossils found by Leeds gave the fish the specific epithet problematicus because the remains were so fragmented that they were extremely hard to recognize and interpret. After a second publication in 1889, objections were raised against the perceived [...] "barbaric" [...] nature of the generic name, which simply attached a non-Latinised British family name to a Classical Greek word. Woodward therefore in 1890 changed the genus name to Leedsia, resulting in a Leedsia problematica. However, by modern standards this is a non-valid junior synonym.|$|E

40|$|B. Schlegel, K. Wiebusch, 2 ̆ 6 S. Otto, PhD, Gustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, MN In {{recent years}} {{starting}} block platforms in swimming have been modified {{to include an}} adjustable <b>back</b> <b>plate,</b> which has drawn the attention of some researchers. Beretić, Đurović, and Okičić (2012) reported that the kick-start {{with the use of}} the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> resulted in a significantly faster ten-meter swim time (p= 0. 04) compared to a traditional track start without a <b>back</b> <b>plate.</b> The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of adding a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> to the platform of a starting block in swimming on reaction and 12. 5 -yard swim time. This study included male and female athletes from a Division III swim team. A one-sample design was used. Subjects were allowed time to familiarize themselves with both styles of starting block. They then performed three starts followed by a 12. 5 -yard freestyle swim using the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> style and three using the traditional platform style in a randomized sequence. The average of each block style was calculated and used for analysis. The independent variable was the starting block style. The dependent variables were reaction time and 12. 5 -yard swim time. Two paired sample t-tests were used to compare the difference in reaction and 12. 5 -yard swim time between the two starts. Significance was determined at the p ≤. 025 level controlling for Familywise error rate due to the multiple t-tests needed. Results revealed that there was not a significant difference in reaction time between starting block style at the p≤ 0. 025, t (24) = 1. 955, p = 0. 063. The results indicated a statistically significant difference in 12. 5 -yard time at the p ≤. 025 for the start with the <b>back</b> <b>plate,</b> t (24) = 9. 98, p = 0. 000. The mean score for the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> reaction time (0. 429 ± 0. 109) was not significantly less than the mean score for the traditional starting block reaction time (0. 464 ± 0. 099). The mean score for the 12. 5 -yard swim time from the <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> (4. 823 ±. 388) was significantly less than the mean 12. 5 -yard swim time from the traditional starting block (4. 972 ±. 399). In conclusion, this study may suggest that a <b>back</b> <b>plate</b> could be utilized to improve reaction time and 12. 5 -yard swim time for collegiate swimmers. Future research might look at force generated from different starting style. IRB# 1314 - 0265. NACSM Professional Sponsor: Stephanie Ott...|$|R
