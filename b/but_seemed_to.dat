In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> arise spontaneously from uranium itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the battle saw four {{divisions}} (9th Australian, 51st Highland, 2nd New Zealand and 1st South African) in {{the assault on the}} north of the Axis positions. RWY was in support of the 5th New Zealand Brigade (Brigadier Howard Kippenberger); the aim was for infantry to secure the Miteiriya Ridge during darkness, with the armour to pass beyond them at first light to establish a screen. By now, the regiment was equipped with a mix of M4 Sherman, Crusader and Grant (M3 Lee) tanks. On the morning of 24 October 1942, A and C squadrons were ahead of the infantry on the western slopes of the ridge. B squadron had been delayed in the devil's gardens minefields and had lost numerous tanks. Throughout that day, A and C Squadrons engaged German panzers on the plain below, and were in turn hit by anti-tank fire. Initially, the heavier Sherman tanks were not vulnerable to this, but, when the German 88mm anti-tank guns joined in, they took severe casualties. By midday, the two squadrons were reduced to one Sherman and three Grants and the commanding officer had been badly wounded and evacuated. The 10th Armoured Division, under the command of Major-General Alexander H. Gatehouse, was at this stage supposed to pass through and onwards to start the break-out, <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be reluctant to do so.|$|E

25|$|There {{are various}} {{theories}} {{about the origins of}} the Piraeus Athena. Because the room the statue was found in was very close to the main harbor, many scholars believe that the statue had been stored in a harbor’s stoa and were just about to be shipped. Additionally, the Piraeus Athena and other statues were not in random order <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be packed. A coin found near the statues had a date equivalent to 87/86 BC on it, along with a picture of King Mithridates VI. Because it is known that Piraeus was captured by Sulla in 86 BC, many have further speculated two theories. One theory is that the statues were going to be shipped in order to save them from the Roman attack. The second theory is that the statues were being shipped by the Romans to Italy as part of their spoils. It is thought that the statue may have originally come from the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira in Piraeus. This is because the peplos in the statue is similar to the drapery of the peplos in the statue of Eirene by Cephisodotus the Elder, who was also known to have made a statue of Athena that resided in the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira. Other scholars believe that the statue may have come from Delos, since three of the statues found with the Piraeus Athena were of Artemis, and Delos was considered the birthplace of Artemis. Additionally, the Romans had captured Delos in 88 BC and therefore the statues could {{have been part of the}} scared funds Mithradates’ general had sent to Delos. Due to the dating, it has been estimated that the Piraeus Athena probably dates back to 360-340 BCE.|$|E

500|$|Dennis Wayne Johnson {{was born}} the eighth of sixteen children, to a social worker and a {{bricklayer}} who lived in Compton, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. Originally a baseball fan and a Little Leaguer, Johnson learned basketball from his father, <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have neither the size nor the talent to compete with his peers: as a teenager at Dominguez High School, Johnson measured just 5'9" [...] and played only [...] "a minute or two each game". After high school, he worked several odd jobs, including a $2.75-per-hour job as a forklift driver, and played with his brothers in summer league games after work. During this period, Johnson grew to a height of 6'3", and developed what some later described as [...] "rocket launcher legs", which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents.|$|E
500|$|After the {{abolition}} of apartheid {{and the establishment of}} a majority government in 1994, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established to investigate past human-rights abuses. The Commission made plans to investigate Biko's death, but his family petitioned against this {{on the grounds that the}} Commission could grant amnesty to those responsible, thereby preventing the family's right to justice and redress. In 1996, the Constitutional Court ruled against the family, allowing the investigation to proceed. Five police officers (Harold Snyman, Gideon Nieuwoudt, Ruben Marx, Daantjie Siebert, and Johan Beneke) appeared before the Commission and requested amnesty in return for information about the events surrounding Biko's death. In December 1998, the Commission refused amnesty to the five men; this was because their accounts were conflicting and thus deemed untruthful, and because Biko's killing had no clear political motive, <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have been motivated by [...] "ill-will or spite". In October 2003, South Africa's justice ministry announced that the five policemen would not be prosecuted because the statute of limitations had elapsed and there was insufficient evidence to secure a prosecution.|$|E

500|$|The Litigators {{is said to}} be [...] "an amusing and appalling {{look into}} the machinations of a {{nationwide}} class-action suit," [...] according to Tobin Harshaw of Bloomberg L.P. [...] The Wall Street Journals Christopher John Farley noted that the book is lighter than Grisham's other works. Publishers Weekly called it a [...] "bitingly farcical look at lawyers {{at the bottom of the}} food chain". CNN described the book as an original perspective of [...] "the best and worst the American system of justice has to offer". Louis Bayard of The Washington Post, who described himself as someone who abandoned Grisham after his first three novels, noted that this book might be a good starting point for those who have tired of Grisham. [...] Andrea Simakis of The Plain Dealer describes the book as a [...] "heartier meal" [...] than Grisham's usual [...] "potato-chip fiction". Publishers Weekly also notes that the fairy tale ending is not really in keeping with the introduction's dark humor. Rick Arthur of The United Arab Emirates publication The National describes the book unfavorably as a cross between prior Grisham works The Street Lawyer and The King of Torts and similarly describes the protagonist unfavorably to those of The Firm and The Rainmaker. Geoffrey Wansell of the Daily Mail presented one of the more favorable reviews describing the book as [...] "a spectacular return to form, displaying the clarity and passion that were there in his first thrillers <b>but</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> ebb away." [...] Wansell notes that Grisham returned to one of his seminal themes of the idealistic young lawyer fighting with the realization that corporations only care about maximizing profits.|$|E
