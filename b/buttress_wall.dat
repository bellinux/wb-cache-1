5000|$|In 1923, {{under the}} {{direction}} of H.C. Lawlor, restoration works were undertaken by the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society. As part of this work, ivy was removed from the wall, cracks were grouted with cement, the top was waterproofed and a <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> was built to support the northeast corner of the tower.|$|E
50|$|The entire {{construction}} process consisted of eight stages: clearing and concreting of territory around reactor unit 4, erection of initial reinforced concrete protective walls around the perimeter, construction of separation walls between units 3 and 4, cascade wall construction, covering of the turbine hall, mounting of a high-rise <b>buttress</b> <b>wall,</b> erection of supports and {{installation of a}} reactor compartment covering and finally the installation of a ventilation system.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{proposed}} a new method {{of improving the}} seismic stability of reinforced concrete dam with <b>buttress</b> <b>walls.</b> He uses a number of horizontal, struts, each of which spans over the canyon, connecting the <b>buttress</b> <b>walls.</b> Both ends of each strut are to be rigidly anchored to the side slopes of the canyon, in most cases at footings of <b>buttress</b> <b>walls.</b> Horizontal component of seismic force acting on the dam is to be transmitted to the anchores by the struts, of which larger part is in compression and another in tension. The author studied statical properties {{of this type of}} structure and {{made it clear that the}} horizontal deflection of <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> due to seismic force is remarkably decreased and the material provided against the danger is considerably saved...|$|R
40|$|To {{prevent the}} {{adjacent}} structures from damage, some auxiliary methods {{were used to}} control the ground movements induced by deep excavation. Cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> are common construction methods used in Taiwan for protection of adjacent buildings during excavation. It is generally recognized, but not verified, that both methods have good effects in reducing wall movement and ground settlement. However, the design methodologies for cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> in excavations are still highly empirical {{because of lack of}} behavior research. The present analysis and the design method are all pause at the experience stage. Therefore, the related cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> behavior urgently awaits the further research. As this result, a series of behaviors, cases study, and parameter analysis of cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> are then studied using the numerical analysis method in this study. According to the analysis results, the best design proposal will be put forward. And the simplification empirical design graph will be proposed also. In addition, this study will recommend the simplification analysis methods that coordinate the theory of elasto-plastic single beam model and plane strain numerical analysis. Finally, the stability of excavation increased by cross <b>walls</b> and <b>buttress</b> <b>walls</b> will be investigated.

50|$|Mahee Castle, {{also known}} as Nendrum Castle, is a small ruined tower house near Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island in Strangford Lough, County Down, Northern Ireland. It was built in 1570 by Captain Thomas Browne. It was {{abandoned}} by the early 17th century, and fell into disrepair. In 1923, H.C. Lawlor and the Belfast Natural History and Philosophical Society partly renovated the tower house to avoid further erosion and built a <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> to support {{the northwest corner of}} the tower.|$|E
5000|$|The {{excavations}} {{and studies}} of the pyramid have revealed that the construction quality was inconsistent and this caused serious structural issues, especially concerning the cladding, which threatened to crack at the base, break off, and collapse under its own extraordinary weight. The ancient architects responded to this issue by building a wall {{all the way around}} the pyramid, embedded in the paving of the enclosure, under the cladding. This wall was built from carefully dressed waste stone, which gave it enough solidity for its role as a [...] "buttress". In the process of building this wall, they destroyed the north chapel, reusing the stone in the wall, which indicates that the <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> was built as a result of events subsequent to Pepi II's funeral.|$|E
5000|$|The DSSS is {{a yellow}} steel object {{that has been}} placed next to the wrecked reactor; it is 63 meters (207 ft) tall and has a series of {{cantilevers}} that extend through the western <b>buttress</b> <b>wall,</b> and is intended to stabilize the sarcophagus. This was done because if {{the wall of the}} reactor building or the roof of the shelter were to collapse, then large amounts of radioactive dust and particles would be released directly into the atmosphere, resulting in a large new release of radioactivity into the environment. In December 2006 the [...] "Designed Stabilisation Steel Structure" [...] (DSSS) was extended until 50% of the roof load (about 400 tons) was transferred from the axis 50 wall to the DSSS.|$|E

50|$|In 1714, {{the tower}} was {{heightened}} and in 1830 an octagonal spire with gables was added. The <b>buttressed</b> <b>wall</b> of the chancel dates from 1340-50. In 1725, dormer windows {{were added to}} provide better lighting for the gallery.|$|R
5000|$|... "About {{two miles}} from the village lie the ruins of the rich and {{important}} Monastery of Chrysolakhourna. The original thirteenth-century church consists of a central nave and two side aisles ending in a semicircular apse. Over the west door was a small lancet window of two lights. In the sixteenth century, owing to an earthquake, the church was much remodelled. The west front was covered with a heavy <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> four feet thick at the base, which blocked the two entrances into the side aisle. The north wall was rebuilt, and the windows in the west and east end of the church were blocked up. All the paintings which remain are of the period of the rebuilding, save a figure of St. John the Baptist in the west end, and even this has been chipped to form a key for the later series of frescoes. The monastic buildings are of considerable size, but are now much ruined.|$|E
50|$|Water is fed to the {{powerplant}} {{from a low}} dam about 1.75 mi upstream. Overflow {{is controlled}} by two tainter gates between concrete piers. A 3 ft wide fish ladder climbs {{the north side of}} the dam. On the south side a large sluice gate allows the small reservoir to be drained. The intake structure is between the sluice gate and the south <b>buttress</b> <b>wall,</b> housed in a small wood frame intake house.A one-story wood-frame watchman's house is just downstream from the intake house, and is joined to the intake house. The power plant intake conduit is a 74 in diameter reinforced concrete pipe for the first 125 ft, transitioning to a welded steel pipe. This replaced 2000 ft of concrete pipe and 7075 ft of wood stave pipe in 1949. The conduit is buried along most of its length. It crosses the river on a 99 ft-span riveted steel Howe truss bridge made by the American Bridge Company downstream from the dam. Total head is about 120 ft to 140 ft. Since the conduit has been altered and is partly buried under the rail line it is not included in the historic district designation.|$|E
50|$|Between 1859 and 1862 three explosions {{claimed a}} dozen {{lives at the}} Ballincollig Mills. The first of these explosions {{took place in the}} dusting house on a Saturday in August 1859. In this {{building}} the dust was removed from the gunpowder. Early in the morning the pure gunpowder was removed between 30 and 40 barrels were brought alongside the barge-boat and 20-year-old John Corcoran looked after the barge-horse. The dusting house workers were William Looney, the foreman; Timothy Lyons and James Merrick. As the unloading proceeded, a sudden explosion demolished the dusting house and the adjoining press house; a <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> of stone and earth which separated the two timber buildings was also levelled. The five men were killed instantly and the huge crater left by the explosion was soon filled with canal water. Three of the bodies were recovered and brought to a nearby shed; a search commenced for the others.A more melancholy sight then this could not be imagined, surrounded as if it were relatives of the deceased, bewailing their fate with loud and incessant lamentations; but it was horrible in the extreme to see from time to time persons coming in, bringing in, wrapped in grass or cloth, a blackened cinder that was once a hand, a foot, or other portions of one of the dead men. Those awful relics were scattered far and wide, some of them having been found on the brow of the hill {{on the opposite side of}} the river, nearly half a mile away from the scene of the catastrophe.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{adjacent}} constructions from being damaged in deep excavation project, a certain auxiliary measurement is usually adopted in restraining the ground movements due to excavation so as to protect the adjacent buildings. In recent years, <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> has been adopted as an auxiliary measurement in protecting the adjacent buildings in excavation; however, in concerning the way how it performances is still lack of consolidated result of verification. Neither domestic nor foreign is still in lack of regarding the study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology of the <b>buttress</b> <b>wall.</b> Thus, until so far, concerning the analysis and designing of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> is still staying in the empirical stage that the configuration of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall,</b> including space, length and depth does not have a consistent agreement. Thus, in some cases there came with relatively large space between the buttress walls; some with longer length; some with depth started from near ground surface downward {{to the bottom of the}} diaphragm wall; some only ended to 1 / 2 depth of the diaphragm wall penetrated to underground; some started from the final excavation downward a certain depth, etc. in various configurations where each revealed different performance separately either in reducing the diaphragm wall displacement effectively or in minor. Therefore, the further study of mechanism, behavior and analysis methodology of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> is required. For this reason, the study shall focus on a series of complete research of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall.</b> As the lateral displacement of diaphragm wall in deep excavation after <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> has been set is a 3 -D moving behavior, we decided to apply 3 -D numerical analysis for case studies in simulating the analysis and verification, then studied the various <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> models in configuration so as to clarify the mechanism and behavior of diaphragm wall, in the mean time, recommend the methodology of 3 -D simulation analysis in simulation. Then, we proceed with parametric study via 3 -D numerical analysis to investigate the performance of <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> as the basis in suggesting the principle of optimal design as well as the simplified designing chart for industrial reference. Finally, as currently the beam on elastoplastic foundation method or 2 -D plane strain numerical analysis is broadly adopted in the designing stage of excavation by the industrial field, this study shall follow these two guidelines and propose reasonable analysis method in simulation of setting up <b>buttress</b> <b>wall</b> in excavation. Expect it is helpful in the practical analysis and designing tasks.
