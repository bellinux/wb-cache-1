5|$|Calgary {{had been}} served for 30 {{years by the}} Stampede Corral when the Calgary Flames arrived in 1980. With a total {{capacity}} of 8,700, the Corral was the largest arena in Canada west of Toronto in 1950, but had fallen below major league standards by the 1970s. The Corral was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than hope to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> selected to merge with the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Though often {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> {{with a strong}} classics pedigree, and active in most races with several top tens, they did not win any single-day race in the spring season. Greg Van Avermaet won the late-season Paris–Tours, along with two stages in stage races earlier in the season. The team's ostensible classics leader, Italian Alessandro Ballan, did not win any race in 2011 and was again briefly suspended from racing pursuant to the ongoing Mantova doping investigation, {{as he had been}} in 2010.|$|E

25|$|After {{becoming}} a permanent fixture as the Phillies' second baseman, Utley demonstrated versatility, {{spending some time}} at first base as well. As his fielding has improved over his career, Utley was seen in combination with Jimmy Rollins {{as one of the}} best middle-infield combinations in the NL, until Rollins was traded to the Dodgers in the winter of 2014. Utley was considered by fans to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> leader of the Phillies, alongside Rollins and Ryan Howard, and he has been noted for his leadership qualities with the Dodgers. Utley was known for his quiet understated demeanor, instead setting an example for teammates with his exhaustive preparation in the video room and the batting cage. Utley's seven career World Series home runs are the most for a second baseman, and he shares the single-series postseason record of five home runs with Reggie Jackson and George Springer. He is also noteworthy for having participated in seven no-hitters, of which he was on the winning side in four.|$|E
25|$|The Lightning {{first took}} the ice on October 7, 1992, playing in Tampa's tiny 11,000-seat Expo Hall at the Florida State Fairgrounds. They shocked the visiting Chicago Blackhawks 7–3 with four goals by little-known Chris Kontos. The Lightning {{shot to the}} top of the Campbell Conference's Norris Division within a month, behind Kontos' initial torrid scoring pace and a {{breakout}} season by forward Brian Bradley. However, they buckled under the strain of some of the longest road trips in the league—their nearest division rival, the Blues, were over 1,000 miles away—and finished in last place with a record of 23–54–7 for 53 points. Their 53 points in 1992–93, however, was one of the best-ever showings by an NHL expansion team. Bradley's 42 goals gave Tampa Bay fans optimism for the next season; it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> record until the 2006–07 season when Vincent Lecavalier passed it with a career-high 52 goals.|$|E

500|$|Although {{predominantly}} a striker, Samaras {{can also}} {{play as a}} left midfielder. During his time at Manchester City, Samaras expressed his disappointment at being used on the left of midfield too often, he publicly said to manager Sven-Göran Eriksson; [...] "I am not a left-midfielder, I am a striker and I like to play there," [...] However, after his move to Celtic, Samaras was more open to playing as a left midfielder. The Daily Mail {{said that this was}} because he was happier at Celtic and more willing to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> player. In addition to being able to play as a target man, Samaras can also be used in several different roles when playing up front. His natural style of play is to drift off the front line and provide a link between the attack and midfield. In doing this he can use his pace and skill to run at the defence, while also creating chances or opening up space for his teammates. He can also run beyond the centre-backs and his pace means he can run on to through balls hit over the defence.|$|E
500|$|An own goal {{scored by}} Touré meant Fredrik Ljungberg's opener against Aston Villa was {{cancelled}} {{out and the}} match ended in a draw, albeit helping Arsenal back to first position on goal difference. Leading up to the potential championship decider against Manchester United on 16 April 2003, Wenger was adamant his team were mentally ready to retain the title: [...] "We want to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> who makes history. That's what's really driving us on. We are not worrying about United too much. We are just concentrating on expressing our togetherness, our mental strength and our qualities. We have enough players who can win this game." [...] Having conceded a first half goal scored by Ruud van Nistelrooy, Arsenal overturned Manchester United's lead before Ryan Giggs equalised for the away team. The match ended 2–2; Campbell was sent off for elbowing Ole Gunnar Solskjær and was banned {{the rest of the}} season, whereas Vieira limped off with an injury. Although the result helped Manchester United move back top, they had played one game more than Arsenal. Arsenal won their next match at Middlesbrough, but squandered a two-goal lead away to Bolton Wanderers in the last ten minutes. The result, [...] "a big blow" [...] for Arsenal's title hopes, meant the championship was now in Manchester United's favour.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Charlotte Observer, Redick said, [...] "I think I'll be a role player like 80 percent of the players in the league are. I don't expect to be a star, I'll just shoot, <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> player." [...] He moved up into the backup shooting guard position behind well-known veteran and Duke alum Grant Hill. As a professional, Redick was getting limited playing time, but after an injury to Hill, Redick moved up in the rotation. Redick, compared to the rest of his rookie season, caught his stride in the beginning of February, hitting double figures in 4 out of 5 games and averaging 9 points in all.|$|E

2500|$|Before the 2004 NBA draft, Gordon {{thought that}} he would be drafted {{anywhere}} from 7th to 12th, but as the draft got closer he claimed to have an inkling that the Bulls might draft him third as they did with Michael Jordan 20 years earlier in the 1984 NBA draft. [...] "I'm a guy who looks at the significance of numbers a lot. Before the draft, I had no idea I'd get drafted third. I thought I was going to go anywhere from 7th to 12th. As we started getting closer and I started to get an inkling that the Bulls could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> that I could end up playing for, I started to look at the numbers. Michael Jordan was drafted by the Bulls and he was the third pick just like you." [...] Gordon wore the number 4 on his jersey in high school and college, but had to wear the number 7 with the Bulls due to the number 4 being retired. Gordon said, [...] "I wore No. 4 my whole career but, of course, Jerry Sloan already had that number beforehand so there wasn't much I could do about it. So all I did was just [...] being the third pick with my old No. 4. That's why I wear No. 7." [...] The Bulls also acquired Luol Deng in the same draft.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{cover was}} {{unveiled}} on July 8, 2010 {{and met with}} positive reception. 'Idolator' said [...] "Ciara has been tempting us with her sexy new single 'Ride' ... but if you're looking for her goodies keep on looking because their [...] not on her Basic Instinct album cover (unless it's a seductive Playboy-esque fold out). The songstress, whose music video proved to be too hot for BET, kept things simple for the cover art." [...] Ciara then outlined plans for a mixtape to precede the album's release, in preparation she recorded remixes to Soulja Boy Tell 'Em's [...] "Pretty Boy Swag" [...] ("Pretty Girl Swag") and Waka Flocka Flame's [...] "Hard in Da Paint", {{as well as a}} cover of Young Jeezy's [...] "Lose My Mind". When asked by Gerrick D. Kennedy. from the Los Angeles Times, if the label [...] {{had anything to do with}} the delays in release or late promotion, Ciara replied [...] "I did see a few comments and I said, 'You know what? I one day look forward to being able to share with my fans (things that happen).' Right now, this is about living in a world of possibility and doing my best, [...]. Getting the record out there, I just want my fans to hear it. This album is really for my fans, and it's good to know the energy and the feedback has been great. It really is just the beginning". In February 2011, following rumors that Ciara had been dropped by Jive Records, Ciara released an official statement to her Facebook page. Amongst her complaints, were a lack of funding and support from the label with regards to promoting Basic Instinct. In addition to disagreeing with the label over single choices, Ciara personally funded the $100,000 video for her third single [...] "Gimmie Dat". [...] "I'm dedicated to my music, performance and to my fans! I've tried to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> player with the label only to have compromised what I truly believed..
