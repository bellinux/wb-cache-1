40|$|The {{nutritional}} quality of Australian <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> is not systematically monitored despite {{the importance of}} breakfast for general health. We examined whether the {{nutritional quality}} of Australian <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> has improved between 2004 and 2010, and whether any change could be detected after the introduction of Daily Intake Guide (DIG) front-of-pack labelling. Supermarket surveys were conducted in 2004 and 2010 using the same methodology to collect information from the nutrition information panels of Australian <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> and the nutrient content of cereals was compared by year. <b>Breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> with and without DIG labelling in 2010 were also compared.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of zearalenone exposure, {{based on the}} consumption of high-fibre <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> among Norwegian 2 -, 4 -, 9 - and 13 -year olds and the same zearalenone occurrence data as used by EFSA, indicates that the current zearalenone exposure among mean and high consumers is well below the TDI for all age groups. A short-term exposure scenario among Norwegian children based on the presumption that the zearalenone concentration is 50 μg/kg in <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> (current maximum level) indicated that at this concentration, exposure from <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> will slightly exceed the TDI only among 4 -year old high consumers (i. e. the 95 -percentile of consumers only). Short-term exposure scenarios based on zearalenone concentrations of 100 and 150 μg/kg <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> indicated that all high consumers among Norwegian children would exceed the TDI. In case that a child consumes the same batch of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> containing zearalenone at an increased maximal level daily for some weeks, the TDI could be exceeded during this period. However, the TDI has been set for long-term exposure and does not apply directly for shortterm exposure. The long-term exposure scenario considering a 3 -fold increase in the mean zearalenone concentration {{as a result of}} increasing the ML 3 -fold to 150 μg/kg in <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> indicates that the exposure will probably be well below the TDI for all age groups of Norwegian children, including high consumers of <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} policy reforms aimed at achieving two policy objectives for grain consumption; (a) to double the intake of bread and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> and (b) to ensure {{that half of the}} bread and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> consumed are whole grain products. The overall aim of these policy objectives are to increase the dietary fibre intake from grain consumption so as to significantly contribute to the general recommended (minimum) increase of the fibre intake. Based on parameter estimates from a demand system we simulate the resulting changes in volumes purchased and fibre intake from two policy reforms entailing differentiated VAT on grain products. In the first reform we remove the VAT on "keyhole labelled" bread and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals,</b> in the second reform we consider a more extensive policy package of subsidizing the keyhole labelled bread and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> by 20 percent while removing the VAT on all other grain products. Our results indicate that both reforms are likely to be successful in ensuring that the consumers attain the nutrition recommendations that half of the bread and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> consumed are whole grain products, but that additional policy instruments are needed to reach the recommendation that the intake of bread and <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> should be doubled.

5|$|A {{native of}} Indiana, Sadler moved to Michigan as a {{teenager}} {{to work at the}} Battle Creek Sanitarium. There he met the physician and health-food promoter John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of corn flakes <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereal,</b> who became his mentor. Sadler married Kellogg's niece, Lena Celestia Kellogg, in 1897. He worked for several Christian organizations and attended medical school, graduating in 1906. Sadler practiced medicine in Chicago with his wife, who was also a physician. He joined several medical associations and taught at the McCormick Theological Seminary. Although he was a committed member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church for almost twenty years, he left the denomination after it disfellowshipped his wife's uncle in 1907. Sadler and his wife became speakers on the Chautauqua adult education circuit in 1907, and he became a highly paid, popular orator. He eventually wrote over 40 books on a variety of medical and spiritual topics advocating a holistic approach to health. Sadler extolled the value of prayer and religion but was skeptical of mediums, assisting debunker Howard Thurston, and embraced the scientific consensus on evolution.|$|E

In New Zealand, new regulations are being implemented to restrict nutrition and health claims to products that meet certain 'healthy' criteria. This {{study investigated the}} difference in nutritional quality, labelling and promotion between 'healthy' and 'less healthy' <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals,</b> and between <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> intended for children compared with other <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> on the New Zealand market. The cross-sectional data collection involved taking pictures of the nutrition information panel (NIP) and front-of pack (FoP) for all <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> (n[*]=[*] 247) at two major supermarkets in Auckland in 2013. A nutrient profiling tool was used to classify products into 'healthy'/'less healthy'. In total 26 % of cereals {{did not meet the}} 'healthy' criteria. 'Less healthy' cereals were significantly higher in energy density, sugar and sodium content and lower in protein and fibre content compared with 'healthy' cereals. Significantly more nutrition claims (75 %) and health claims (89 %) featured on 'healthy' compared with 'less healthy' cereals. On the 'less healthy' cereals, nutrition claims (65 %) were more predominant than health claims (17 %). Of the 52 products displaying promotional characters, 48 % were for 'cereals for kids', and of those, 72 % featured on 'less healthy' cereals. In conclusion, most <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals</b> met the 'healthy' criteria; however, 'cereals for kids' were 'less healthy' and displayed more promotional characters than other cereal categories. Policy recommendations include: food composition targets set or endorsed by government, strengthening and enforcing current regulations on health and nutrition claims, considering the application of nutrient profiling for nutrition claims in addition to health claims, introducing an interpretative FoP labelling system and restricting the use of promotional characters on 'less healthy' <b>breakfast</b> <b>cereals...</b>|$|R
