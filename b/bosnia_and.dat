5|$|The Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation between <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina and Croatia {{was signed}} by Alija Izetbegović, President of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, and Franjo Tuđman, President of the Republic of Croatia, in Zagreb on 21 July 1992 during the Bosnian and Croatian wars for {{independence}} from Yugoslavia. It established cooperation, albeit inharmonious, between the two {{and served as a}} basis for joint defense against Serb forces. It also placed the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) under the command of the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina (ARBiH).|$|E
5|$|The Split Agreement was {{a turning}} point in the Bosnian War as well as an {{important}} factor in the Croatian War of Independence. It led to a large-scale deployment of the HV in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina and the capture of strategic positions in Operation Summer '95. This in turn allowed the quick capture of Knin, the capital of the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK), and the lifting of the siege of Bihać soon thereafter, during Operation Storm. Subsequent HV offensives in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, supported by the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), as well as NATO air campaign in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, shifted the military balance in the Bosnian War, contributing to the start of peace talks, leading to the Dayton Agreement.|$|E

5|$|The {{capabilities}} of the HV increased dramatically {{in the first few}} months of 1992 because it acquired large stockpiles of JNA's weapons in the Battle of the Barracks. After the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The move followed the Bosnian Serb declaration of the Serbian Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February1 March 1992 referendum on <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina's independence. The referendum would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War, which commenced in early April 1992, when the VRS's artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina were confronted by the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed to <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina to support the HVO.|$|E

An August 2010 poll showed that 70 percent of the country supports NATO membership, but results were very different in the two constituent entities. While 90 percent of the Federation of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina supported NATO membership, only 33 percent in Republika Srpska did.|$|E

5|$|As the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA) {{withdrew from}} Croatia {{following}} the acceptance and start of {{implementation of the}} Vance plan, its 55,000 officers and soldiers born in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina were transferred to a new Bosnian Serb army, which was later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). This reorganisation followed the declaration of the Serbian Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February 1 March 1992 referendum on independence of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina. This declaration would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serbs began fortifying the capital, Sarajevo, and other areas on 1 March. On the following day, the first fatalities of the war were recorded in Sarajevo and Doboj. In {{the final days of}} March, the Bosnian Serb army bombarded Bosanski Brod with artillery, drawing a border crossing by the HV 108th Brigade in response. On 4 April, JNA artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina faced the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina (ARBiH) and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively, as well as the HV, which occasionally supported HVO operations.|$|E

On 2 October 2009, Haris Silajdžić, the Bosniak Member of the Presidency, announced official application for Membership Action Plan. On 22 April 2010, NATO agreed to launch the Membership Action Plan for <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, but with certain conditions attached. Turkey is thought to be the biggest supporter of Bosnian membership, and heavily influenced the decision.|$|E

5|$|By 1995, the ARBiH and the HVO had {{developed}} into better-organised forces employing comparably {{large numbers of}} artillery pieces and good defensive fortifications. The VRS was not capable of penetrating their defences even where its forces employed sound military tactics, for instance in the Battle of Orašje in May and June 1995. After recapture of {{the bulk of the}} Republic of Serb Krajina (the Croatian Serb-controlled areas of Croatia) in Operation Storm in August 1995, the HV shifted its focus to western <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina. The shift was motivated by a desire to create a security zone along the Croatian border, establish Croatia as a regional power and gain favours with the West by forcing an end to the Bosnian War. The government of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina welcomed the move as it contributed to their goal of gaining control over western <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> the city of Banja Luka—the largest city in the Bosnian Serb-held territory.|$|E
5|$|Croatia {{is located}} in Central and Southeast Europe, {{bordering}} Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina to the southeast, Montenegro to the southeast, the Adriatic Sea to the southwest and Slovenia to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected {{to the rest of}} the mainland by territorial waters, but separated on land by a short coastline strip belonging to <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina around Neum.|$|E
5|$|During 1992 and 1993, an {{estimated}} 225,000 Croats, {{as well as}} refugees from <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina and Serbia, settled in Croatia. Croatian volunteers and some conscripted soldiers participated {{in the war in}} <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina. In September 1992, Croatia had accepted 335,985 refugees from <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, most of whom were Bosniak civilians (excluding men of drafting age). The large number of refugees significantly strained the Croatian economy and infrastructure. The American Ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, tried to put the number of Muslim refugees in Croatia into a proper perspective in an interview on 8 November 1993. He said the situation would be the equivalent of the United States taking in 30,000,000 refugees.|$|E

5|$|During the {{following}} months, international efforts mainly concerned the largely unsuccessful United Nations Safe Areas {{set up in}} <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina and {{trying to set up}} a more lasting ceasefire in Croatia. The two issues virtually merged by July 1995 when a number of the safe areas in eastern <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina were overrun and one in Bihać was threatened. In 1994, Croatia had already signaled that it would not allow Bihać to be captured, and a new confidence in the Croatian military's ability to recapture occupied areas brought about a demand from Croatian authorities that no further ceasefires were to be negotiated; the occupied territories would be re-integrated into Croatia. These developments and the Washington Agreement, a ceasefire signed in the Bosnian theater, led to another meeting of presidents of Croatia and <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina on 22 July, when the Split Agreement was adopted. In it, <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina invited Croatia to provide military and other assistance, particularly in the Bihać area. Croatia accepted, committing itself to an armed intervention.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic {{cleansing}} in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina {{happened on}} a larger scale than in the RSK, and all the major ethnic groups became victims of ethnically motivated violence. The conflict produced a vast number of displaced persons. It is estimated that there were over a million refugees in areas of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina outside VRS control at the end of 1994, while the area's total population was about 2.2 million. About 720,000 Bosniaks, 460,000 Serbs and 150,000 Croats fled the country. Croatia hosted {{a large proportion of the}} Bosniak and Croat refugees; by November 1992 there were around 333,000 registered, and an estimated 100,000 unregistered, refugees from <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina in Croatia. The refugees left their homes under varied circumstances. The ethnic violence committed by Bosnian Serbs against civilians resulted in the greatest number of civilian victims in the Bosnian war, culminating in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Graz agreement, {{negotiated}} by Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats aiming to partition <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina in early May, proclaimed {{cessation of hostilities}} between the two groups, heavy fighting broke out between the HVO and the VRS in June, in eastern Herzegovina (Operation Jackal), and in the Sava River basin (Operation Corridor 92), {{in the north of}} <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|Following a US {{military}} strategy endorsed by President Bill Clinton in February 1993, the Washington Agreement {{was signed in}} March 1994. This ended the Croat–Bosniak War, abolished Herzeg-Bosnia, established the Federation of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina and forged the ARBiH–HVO alliance against the VRS. In addition, {{a series of meetings}} between US and Croatian officials were held in Zagreb and Washington, D.C. In November 1994, the United States unilaterally ended the arms embargo against <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovinain effect allowing the HV to supply itself as arms shipments flowed through Croatia. In a meeting held on 29 November 1994, Croatian representatives proposed to attack Serb-held territory from Livno in <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina to draw off part of the force besieging Bihać and prevent its capture by the Serbs. U.S. officials made no response to the proposal. Operation Winter'94 was ordered the same day; it was to be carried out by the HV and the HVOthe main military forces of the Bosnian Croats.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Croat-Bosniak {{conflict}} {{erupted in}} <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina, just as each was {{fighting with the}} Bosnian Serbs. The war was originally fought between the Croatian Defence Council and Croatian volunteer troops {{on one side and}} the Army of the Republic of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina (ARBiH) on the other, but by 1994, the Croatian Army had an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 troops involved in the fighting. Under pressure from the United States, the belligerents agreed on a truce in late February, followed by a meeting of Croatian, Bosnian, and Bosnian Croat representatives with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington, D.C. on February 26, 1994. On March 4, Franjo Tuđman endorsed the agreement providing for the creation of Federation of <b>Bosnia</b> <b>and</b> Herzegovina and an alliance between Bosnian and Croatian armies against the Serb forces.|$|E
