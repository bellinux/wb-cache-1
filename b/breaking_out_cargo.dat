We're all on results, and partners in the thing. There's no respect in this ship. I don't want it. Why should any man touch his hat to me? Oh, I know we use the fist and handspike on American ships--when it's necessary--and I skipped round the Sachem's deck-house once with the cold steel {{an inch or two}} behind me; but that's not the point at all. I want a hundred cents' worth for my dollar from every man, and I'm going to get it, but I'm boss because I can drive a winch and <b>break</b> <b>out</b> <b>cargo</b> better than any of the rest of them. At least, that's one big reason." ...|$|R
25|$|Following the torpedo hit panic {{broke loose}} on board Palatia, with prisoners {{attempting}} to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of the <b>cargo</b> holds. During the rescue work {{the crew of}} UJ 1704 prioritized saving Germans, {{to the extent that}} small arms were used against prisoners if they proved to be a hindrance for the rescue of Germans. Only prisoners on rafts or floating debris in the company of German survivors were retrieved. The rescue work was concluded at 18:45. In all only 78 prisoners and 108 Germans survived the sinking. After the incident the crew of Palatia was criticized in German reports for not having conducted the evacuation of the ship in an orderly manner, the sinking thus costing more German lives than might have been the case had the crew acted according to regulations.|$|R

This paper focuses on the {{challenges}} associated with <b>breaking</b> <b>out</b> of cycles of violence and why futures thinking may provide a potential solution.

40|$|In {{order to}} keep shared access {{computers}} secure and stable system administrators resort to locking down the computing environment {{in order to prevent}} intentional and unintentional damage by users. Skilled attackers are often able to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of locked down computing environments and intentionally misuse shared access computers. This misuse has resulted in cases of mass identity theft and fraud, some of which have had an estimated cost ranging in millions. In order to determine if it is possible to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of locked down computing environments an assessment method is required. Although a number of vulnerability assessment techniques exist, none of the existing techniques are sufficient for assessing locked down shared access computers. This is due to the existing techniques focusing on traditional, application specific, software vulnerabilities. <b>Break</b> <b>out</b> path vulnerabilities (which are exploited by attackers in order to <b>break</b> <b>out</b> of locked down environments) differ substantially from traditional vulnerabilities, and as a consequence are not easily discovered using existing techniques. Ontologies {{can be thought of as}} a modelling technique that can be used to capture expert knowledge about a domain of interest. The method for discovering <b>break</b> <b>out</b> paths in locked down computers can be considered expert knowledge in the domain of shared access computer security. This research proposes an ontology based assessment process for discovering <b>break</b> <b>out</b> path vulnerabilities in locked down shared access computers. The proposed approach is called the ontological lockdown assessment process. The ontological lockdown assessment process is implemented against a real world system and successfully identifies numerous <b>break</b> <b>out</b> path vulnerabilities...|$|R
