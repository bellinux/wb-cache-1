5|$|La Grange draws {{attention}} to the notably high tessitura for the sopranos, for soloists and for choral singers. He characterises the alto solos as brief and unremarkable; however, the tenor solo role in PartII is both extensive and demanding, requiring on several occasions to <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> choruses. The wide melodic leaps in the Pater Profundus role present particular challenges to the bass soloist.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} {{featured}} many new characters such as Seymour Skinner, Milhouse Van Houten, Sherri and Terri, Moe Szyslak, Mr. Burns, Barney Gumble, Patty and Selma, Ned and Todd Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Snowball II, Dewey Largo, and Lewis. Snowball I is mentioned {{for the first}} time and Waylon Smithers can <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> speaker at the power plant, but he is not seen.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} of COPD {{is defined}} as increased shortness of breath, increased sputum production, {{a change in the}} color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow, or an increase in cough in someone with COPD. This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing, a fast heart rate, sweating, active use of muscles in the neck, a bluish tinge to the skin, and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations. Crackles may also <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> lungs on examination with a stethoscope.|$|E

5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After the doors were shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> engines.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, {{he could barely}} <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sound of the group. After about three months, {{he realized that he}} needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When someone stole his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E
25|$|The {{station has}} played a {{significant}} role in the promotion of hyphy music in the San Francisco Bay Area by playing tunes from many of the local artists associated with hyphy. KMEL's mixshows have long contained exclusive hyphy music which can seldom <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> airwaves elsewhere in the country. Because the station broadcasts live via streaming audio from their website, it gives the genre a platform for possible worldwide exposure.|$|E

25|$|During halftime of the 1992 rivalry {{game at the}} University of Georgia, {{the band}} {{executed}} a prank that drew media attention and gained a level of notoriety. As the band took the field for its halftime performance, several band members carried a large tarp with the GT logo painted on it onto the field {{and used it to}} cover the logo painted at midfield commemorating UGA's football program's centennial. The band's performance could not <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> boos that were elicited from the home crowd. Reportedly, the stands remained full during the Georgia Tech band's performance and cleared out when the Redcoat Band took the field, as spectators delayed making trips to the concession stands in order to boo the Tech band's actions.|$|E
25|$|ELO's debut concert {{took place}} on 16 April 1972 at the Greyhound Pub in Croydon, Surrey with a line-up of Wood, Lynne, Bevan, Bill Hunt (keyboards), Andy Craig (cello), Mike Edwards (cello), Wilfred Gibson (violin), Hugh McDowell (cello), and Richard Tandy (bass). However, this line-up did not last for long. First Craig departed, and then Wood, during the {{recordings}} for the band's second LP and taking Hunt and McDowell with him, left the band to form Wizzard. Both cited problems with their manager, Don Arden, and an unsatisfactory tour of Italy, where the cellos and violins could not <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> electric instruments. Despite predictions from the music press that the band would fold without Wood, {{who had been the}} driving force behind the creation of ELO, Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan, Edwards, Gibson and Tandy (who had switched from bass to keyboards to replace Hunt) remaining from the previous line-up, and new recruits Mike de Albuquerque and Colin Walker joining the band on bass and cello respectively.|$|E
500|$|Like all {{episodes of}} The Simpsons, [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] {{features}} {{a variety of}} references to popular culture. As Bart fills out the 20-question psychiatry quiz, Homer watches America's Funniest Home Videos where the three nominated clips are all violent. Many of the scenes in the mental institution are references to the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Several of the characters at the institution are based on those in the film, such as Chief. Floyd from the film Rain Man also appears at the mental home. When Marge calls the institution, a muzak version of [...] "Crazy", sung by Patsy Cline, can <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> phone.

500|$|The assault troops rose {{early on}} 3 January 1941, ate a meal and drank a tot of rum. The leading {{companies}} began {{moving to the}} start line at 0416. The artillery opened fire at 0530. On crossing the start line the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Eather, came under Italian mortar and artillery fire. The lead platoons advanced accompanied by sappers of the 2/1st Field Company carrying Bangalore torpedoes— pipes packed with ammonal—as Italian artillery fire began to land, mainly behind them. An Italian shell exploded among a leading platoon and detonated a Bangalore torpedo, resulting in four killed and nine wounded. The torpedoes were slid under the barbed wire at [...] intervals. A whistle was blown as a signal to detonate the torpedoes but could not <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> din of the barrage. Colonel Eather became anxious and ordered the engineering party nearest him to detonate their torpedo. This the other teams heard, and they followed suit.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 June 1929 {{the first}} two-way, radiophone {{communication}} {{took place over}} the skies of the Packard Proving Grounds in Utica, (now Shelby Township, Michigan). [...] Heretofore, gasoline powered aircraft caused too much electro-magnetic interference for the weak voice signal to <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> static. [...] Only a strong Morse code signal could be heard. [...] As diesel engines neither have spark plugs, nor spark plug wiring the EM static was greatly reduced and allowed voice communication to be used. The two-way ground to plane voice communication was witnessed by the U.S. Department of Commerce.|$|E

2500|$|During a Test {{match between}} South Africa and Sri Lanka on 7 August 2006, Australian TEN Sports {{commentator}} Dean Jones referred to Amla as a [...] "terrorist" [...] {{after he had}} taken a catch; after incorrectly assuming that broadcasting switched to a commercial break, he had said [...] "The terrorist gets another wicket". The broadcast was aired around the world, including South Africa, and he was subsequently widely condemned by South African fans, players and several former cricketers and commentators, leading to the channel terminating its contract with Jones. After the incident Jones reportedly apologized to Amla, stating that his comments were never [...] "supposed to <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> air", which he accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Hardcore vocalists often shout, scream or chant {{along with}} the music, using [...] "vocal intensity" [...] and an {{abrasive}} tone. [...] The shouting of hardcore vocalists is often accompanied by audience members who are singing along, making the hardcore vocalist like the [...] "leader of a mob". Steven Blush describes one early Minor Threat show where the crowd was singing the lyrics so loud they could <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> PA system. Hardcore vocal lines are often based on minor scales [...] and songs may include shouted background vocals from the other band members. Hardcore lyrics expressed the [...] "frustration and political disillusionment" [...] of youth who were against 1980s-era affluence, consumerism, greed, Reagan politics and authority. The polarizing socio-political messages in hardcore lyrics (and outrageous on-stage behaviour) meant that the genre garnered no mainstream popularity.|$|E
2500|$|The French {{governor}} {{attempts to}} speak to Dulness but cannot <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> French horn sound that emerges, so the pupil tells his story. The [...] "governor" [...] is an English nobleman who went to school and college without learning anything, then went abroad on the Grand Tour, on which [...] "Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too" [...] (294). He went to Paris and Rome and [...] "he saunter'd Europe round,/ And gather'd ev'ry Vice on Christian ground" [...] (B IV 311–312). At {{the end of his}} travels, he is [...] "perfectly well bred,/ With nothing but a Solo in his head" [...] (323–4), and he has returned to England with a despoiled nun following him. She is pregnant with his child (or the student's) and destined for the life of a prostitute (a kept woman), and the lord is going to run for Parliament so that he can avoid arrest. Dulness welcomes the three—the devious student, the brainless lord, and the spoiled nun—and spreads her own cloak about the girl, which [...] "frees from sense of Shame." ...|$|E

2500|$|As soon as our line, set on its jolting way, emerged, I {{felt that}} two men close by had been hit, two shadows {{fell to the}} ground and rolled under our feet, one with a high-pitched scream and the other in silence like an ox. Another {{disappeared}} with a movement like a madman, {{as if he had been}} carried away. Instinctively, we closed ranks and pushed each other forward, always forward, and the wound in our midst closed itself. The warrant officer stopped and raised his sword, dropped it, fell to his knees, his kneeling body falling backwards in jerks, his helmet fell on his heels and he remained there, his head uncovered, looking up to the sky. The line has promptly split to avoid breaking this immobility. [...] But we couldn't see the lieutenant any more. No more superiors, then... A moment's hesitation held back the human wave which had reached the beginning of the plateau. The hoarse sound of air passing through our lungs could <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> stamping of feet. [...] Forward! cried a soldier. So we all marched forward, moving faster and faster in our race towards the abyss.|$|E
2500|$|Ally Ross from The Sun {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, noting several {{continuity}} errors {{when the show}} went live, including Lola's hair being dyed, Derek Branning's (Jamie Foreman) being washed and longer, Shirley Carter's (Linda Henry) hair being undyed and restyled, and Lola having a spray tan. He commented: [...] "EastEnders goes live and the makeover miracle of Albert Square is born." [...] He said that character Alfie Moon [...] "made the unfortunate transition into his very own Mr Hyde, Shane Richie" [...] {{and said that the}} cast were shouting every line so they could <b>be</b> <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> extras. However, he concluded that he enjoyed the episode more than any other, due to the Olympic occasion, the [...] "used, abused and underrated" [...] Billy being in the limelight, and [...] "the fact that, for seven precious minutes, the arm-folding, door-slamming, crockery-smashing life-suckers actually had a smile on their miserable faces." [...] Talking about Billy being stuck on the train, the Elstree & Borehamwood Times wrote: [...] "Viewers sat biting their nails on tenterhooks, waiting to see if he would make it back to Walford in time." [...] Karen Edwards from Heat called the episode [...] "quite the special night" [...] and said that it was [...] "Not an easy task" [...] for Fenwick. She called his wink [...] "cheeky" [...] and [...] "brilliant", saying it [...] "just showed how real the whole thing was". She added that it was [...] "emotional" [...] to watch, and said that Harold [...] "did the best fake birth screaming we've seen in a long while. [...] Pretty impressive work, we're sure you'll agree." [...] Matt Brito from Comedy Central UK said the fact that nothing went wrong in the live broadcast was [...] "boring". Laura Morgan from All About Soap said the live segment was [...] "seamless", saying it deserved a gold medal for [...] "the best thing on TV last night". She said she loved Fenwick's wink to the camera and praised Harold, saying the birth finished off the live segment [...] "perfectly", adding: [...] "Hats off to relative newbie Danielle Harold (aka Lola) for making the birth scenes look so realistic on live TV... That's no mean feat!" [...] She also said it was [...] "the perfect way to kick off the 2012 Olympic Games". After the episode, five of the ten top trending topics on social networking site Twitter related to the live event.|$|E
