5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there {{does not seem to have}} been an hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> places there is no sign of a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E

Washington learned to organize, train, drill, and discipline his companies and regiments.

25|$|Angelika Kratzer {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} fake indexicals are ambiguous between bound variable pronouns and a referential interpretation, creating a theory where a pronoun must be formed with feature transmission from a v in a vP.

25|$|In {{his early}} books, such as The System of Objects, For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign, and The Consumer Society, Baudrillard's main focus is upon consumerism, and how {{different}} objects are consumed in different ways. At this time Baudrillard's political outlook was loosely associated with Marxism (and situationism), <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> books he differed from Karl Marx in one significant way. For Baudrillard, {{as for the}} situationists, it was consumption rather than production {{that was the main}} driver of capitalist society.|$|E
25|$|In most {{instances}} {{this may have}} been equivalent to a death sentence in practice, but the actual death penalty seems to have been foreseen only for very rare cases, such as sexual crimes (rape, promiscuity), religious crimes (incest) or crimes against the king (treason).

Fortunately, Pantops Academy, a boys' school founded just up the road from the UVA Grounds, agreed to a game on November 13, 1887.

25|$|Among {{the reasons}} of {{unification}} of accents in, for example, mixed diphthongs, there possibly {{is the absence}} of necessity to distinguish between them. For example, in the case of várna 'crow' - var̃nas 'raven', the r would probably usually be emphasized in var̃nas, but in a case of var̃das 'name', where there is no relative acute word, there can be no feeling for a speaker, that he / she should emphasize a sound r. <b>But</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> cases the distinction can be understood through quantity of a sound – the acute variant has lengthened a, and the circumflex – not lengthened. So, in diphthongs, the problematic leave i, u starting diphthongs, where a standard language speaker have no means to hear, directly know what type of the accent they should have (if they are stressed).|$|E
25|$|Glaciation {{during the}} most recent ice age and the {{presence}} of man affected the distribution of European fauna. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top predator species have been hunted to extinction. The woolly mammoth was extinct {{before the end of the}} Neolithic period. Today wolves (carnivores) and bears (omnivores) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the Middle Ages the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the brown bear lives primarily in the Balkan peninsula, Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>these</b> areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, polar bears may be found on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The wolf, the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of Western Europe (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).|$|E
