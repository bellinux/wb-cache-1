40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for depalletizing and/or picking up pliable flat sack bundles not collected by auxiliary means. The device comprises a gripper unit and a mobile bottom-support part and a clamping cylinder to grip the parts to be raised. The gripper unit has a first holding-down clamp which is lowered onto the parts to be raised, and a second holding-down clamp which is placed form-fitting on the parts lying below. A contact gap is thus created for the <b>bottom</b> <b>support</b> element arranged in the second holding-down clamp and movable relative to the latter. The <b>bottom</b> <b>support</b> element leaves {{the area of the}} second holding-down clamp during the travel movement and supports the parts from below whereby it is in form-fitting contact with the lower parts during the entire travel movement. After the travel movement, a clamping cylinder is placed on the parts to be raised. It grips the parts together with the <b>bottom</b> <b>support</b> element...|$|R
