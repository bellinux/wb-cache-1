40|$|Precast {{reinforced}} concrete (RC) segments {{have been widely}} used to construct tunnels for mass rapid transit lines in Singapore. However, the reinforcement bar cages are labour intensive to fabricate and install in moulds. Then the cages must be adjusted in moulds to achieve minimum cover at critical locations such as <b>bolt</b> <b>sockets</b> and cover to external face. Supervision has to be tight to achieve good quality segments. However, with the use of steel fibre {{reinforced concrete}} (SFRC), steel reinforcement bars have been eliminated. Steel fibres are added during the batching of concrete. Concrete is then poured in moulds and compacted. Compaction is done by using external vibrators mounted on moulds. For downtown line stage 3 contract 933, SFRC segments were used as tunnel lining. C@nspecs Pte Ltd supervised the production of SFRC segments in the factory. This paper outlines the quality control tests done on the fresh and hardened concrete. International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and			 Construction (CIB...|$|R
60|$|Dick's {{form was}} dropped on {{a heap of}} dirty {{newspapers}} and straw. Then Girk and Baxter left the bin. There was a heavy door to the place, and this they closed and shoved the rusty <b>bolt</b> into the <b>socket.</b> In a second more {{they were on their}} way upstairs again, and Dick was left to his fate.|$|R
50|$|The {{axle load}} of the {{locomotive}} could be switched between 18 t and 20 t by inserting <b>bolts</b> into different <b>sockets</b> in the equalising beams. This {{was supposed to}} enable the locomotive to be more versatile in its use. Little or no use was made of this flexibility however. The Deutsche Bundesbahn and East German DR later left the bolts in the 18 t setting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} interchangeable sockets is that, {{instead of a}} separate wrench {{for each of the}} many different fastener sizes and types, only separate sockets are needed for each size and type. Because of their versatility, nearly all screw and bolt types now have sockets of different types made to fit their <b>bolts</b> or nuts. <b>Sockets</b> often come as a [...] "socket set" [...] with many different sizes or types of sockets to fit the heads of different-sized fasteners. A ratchet of the [...] "set size" [...] is often included with the socket set. Sockets are commonly available in fractional inch and metric sizes, and in short (shallow) and longer (deep) varieties.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{wooden frames}} with a middle section {{consisting}} of springs {{held in place}} by wire (to be put into the wooden bedframe as a unit) used to be the standard for most of the 20th century. The springs have mostly been replaced by pre-bent wooden slats (usually glulam made from beech or birch) which are joined to the outer wooden frame by some form of flexible rubber <b>bolt,</b> shoe or <b>socket.</b> This lath floor provides suspension, allows the mattress to ventilate, and can be designed to be vertically adjustable in order to elevate the legs and / or the torso. A more simple approach is to join straight laths with a textile strap {{so that they can be}} rolled up for transport and placed right into the bedframe.|$|R
60|$|In {{the midst}} of her frenzied rejoicing at {{the death of the}} man, and Smith-Oldwick could {{attribute}} her actions to no other cause, she suddenly desisted from her futile attacks upon the insensate flesh and, leaping to her feet, ran quickly to the door, where she shot a wooden <b>bolt</b> into its <b>socket,</b> thus securing them from interference from without. Then she returned {{to the center of the}} room and spoke rapidly to the Englishman, gesturing occasionally toward the body of the slain man. When he could not understand, she presently became provoked and in a sudden hysteria of madness she rushed forward as though to strike the Englishman. Smith-Oldwick dropped back a few steps and leveled his pistol upon her. Mad though she must have been, she evidently was not so mad but what she had connected the loud report, the diminutive weapon, and the sudden death of the man in whose house she dwelt, for she instantly desisted and quite as suddenly as it had come upon her, her homicidal mood departed.|$|R
5000|$|Male bit {{drivers are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} [...] "sockets", but are in fact the opposite of a socket, in that bit drivers fit into a {{socket head cap screw}} or pipe plug, rather than fit over a male drive head on a nut or <b>bolt</b> as a <b>socket</b> does. A socket is a [...] "female" [...] recess or opening which receives another object, together as a fitting connection. A socket is not a protruding [...] "male" [...] connection. Common male bit drivers of this type include Allen hex wrenches (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 thru T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized screw heads that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various screw head types and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a [...] "socket spinner" [...] screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to many different types of sockets, bit drivers and extensions.|$|R
2500|$|For 1981, the Spirit sedan-based VAM Gremlin saw the {{greatest}} changes since 1979. Both versions obtained a 55-amp alternator, coolant recovery tank and fan shroud regardless of trim level or {{the presence of}} the air conditioning system, as well as a new shared grille design with vertical bars and a single horizontal one in the bottom plus a shared new seat pattern design. For the first time, door panels completely covered all previously exposed metal parts. International symbols appeared in the instrument cluster warning lights and the light beam switch was integrated to the steering column marker light lever. The Gremlin X received numerous updates. All chromed items were deleted other than the front end and rear licence plate light housings while the rear spoiler passed on to the option list. Both bumpers changed to blacked out units. Side decals were almost gone, with only a small [...] "Gremlin X" [...] one at the bottom corner of each C-pillar. A new leather-wrapped sports steering wheel with six simulated hex <b>socket</b> <b>bolts</b> on the horn button was used. A four speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage and a 3.07:1 rear gear ratio became standard. Units with automatic transmission retained the 3.31:1 rear gear ratio of all previous years. The optional equipment list now included eight-spoke sports-style steel wheels using the same volcano hubcaps as the standard wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{truck was}} a {{development}} of the conditions controlling {{the adoption of the}} permanent way. It consisted of a horizontal rectangular wrought iron frame, stiffened by cast iron pieces and provided with stiff pedestals bolted to its under side, in which was a fixed short axle for the wheels. Each truck had four wheels set at an angle of about 45 degrees, the axles being properly inclined. Between the supporting wheels were two horizontal wheels, one {{on each side of the}} upper girder, upon vertical axles attached to the frame. These wheels bear upon the rails of the upper truck beam, and were kept in yielding contact with the rails by springs outside the boxes, and served as balancing wheels to take the side oscillations of the cars. They were formed with flanges that passed under the lower edges of the rails, thus tying the truck to the rails, so that no lifting or jumping could take place, and there was no possibility of the trucks running off the track. The wheels were 42 inches in diameter, had a tread of 3Â½ inches, and rotated independently of each other. In case any or all of the wheels should break, provision was made to prevent the cars from overturning or leaving the track, by means of a strong shoe, which would slide upon but could not leave the way. On top of the truck frame was a movable iron frame carrying four posts containing heavy spiral springs. These posts interlock with similar spring <b>sockets</b> <b>bolted</b> to the framing of the floor of the car, which was directly above the truck and within 18 inches of the top of the girder. The truck was guided in turning by a center pin, and was securely tied to the car body, as the horizontal flanges of its frame castings overlap the rim of the upper turntable. In passing curves and switches, the trucks turned upon the balancing wheels, placed centrally between the supporting wheels, which were 4 feet apart.|$|R
