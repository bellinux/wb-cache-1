Depending on the application, the filler material can be pre-placed at the desired location or applied during the heating cycle. For manual <b>brazing,</b> <b>wire</b> and rod forms are generally used {{as they are}} the easiest to apply while heating.

40|$|The Al-Si-Cu alloy {{system is}} {{considered}} to be a promising choice of filler metal for aluminium alloys brazing due to its high strength and low melting point. The greatest obstacle is its lack of plastic forming ability and being difficult to be processed by conventional methods. This disadvantage is ascribed to the considerable amount of brittle CuAl 2 intermetallic compound which forms when alloy composition is around the ternary eutectic point. In order to overcome this deficiency, authors of this article proposed to synthesize Al-Si-Cu filler metal by using in situ synthesis method, and the structure and properties of brazing joints were studied. The results show that AlSi alloy is used as the wrap layer, and CuAl alloy is used as the powder core in the composite <b>brazing</b> <b>wire,</b> the two alloys have similar melting points. The machinability of the composite <b>brazing</b> <b>wire</b> is much superior to the traditional Al-Si-Cu filler metal. During the induction brazing of 3 A 21 alloy, when using AlSi-CuAl composite filler wire, AlSi and CuAl alloys melt almost simultaneously, then after short time holding, Al-Si-Cu braze filler is obtained, the brazing seam has uniform composition and good bonding interface, also, the shearing strength of the brazing joints is higher than the joint brazed by conventional Al-Si-Cu filler metal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Fixed-abrasive wires, such as {{electroplated}} diamond {{wires and}} resinoid diamond wires, employed for slicing ingots have {{the problems of}} high tool wear. A novel <b>brazed</b> diamond <b>wire</b> has been developed to overcome these problems. This paper investigates the effect of process parameters, including brazing temperature, brazing time and brazing filler composition, on the <b>brazed</b> diamond <b>wire</b> manufacturing with CuSnTi brazing filler. The 3 D micro-video system was used to observe the <b>brazed</b> diamond <b>wire</b> surface. Tensile, bending and torsional test were carried out to evaluate the mechanical properties of <b>brazed</b> diamond <b>wire.</b> A <b>brazed</b> diamond <b>wire</b> with 3 km length was fabricated with the optimization process parameters, which was successfully used to slice glass. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fixed-abrasive wire saw, {{with its}} ability to cut hard brittle material, such as silicon ingots, {{crystals}} and quartz, {{has emerged as a}} leading technology for production in semiconductor and photovoltaic industry. There are some defects in conventional fixed-abrasive wire saw such as significant low holding abrasive ability, low machining efficiency, high running costs, etc. A new fixed-abrasive <b>wire,</b> namely <b>brazed</b> diamond <b>wires</b> have been developed to overcome these problems. In this paper, <b>brazed</b> diamond <b>wire</b> were carried out to braze two different size diamond grits onto two different thin steel wires by using a nickel-based powder as brazing alloy. The mechanical properties of <b>brazed</b> diamond <b>wire</b> were evaluated by tensile and breaking twist experiment. The experimental results showed that the heating in the brazing process has litter influence on the wire mechanical properties. The addition of brazed alloy and diamond grits sharply decreased the wire mechanical properties significantly, both in the tensile strength and breaking twist angle. Bigger diamond grit would make the accumulation of brazed alloy which leaded to the deterioration of diameter consistency of wires...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. An {{investigation}} was undertaken to elucidate the mechanisms for the fracture failure of <b>brazed</b> diamonds in <b>wire</b> sawing. Diamonds were brazed by high-frequency induction in vacuum. The changes of compressive {{strength and the}} appearances of the diamonds at different brazing temperatures were obtained. The morphologies of the diamonds after sawing were also observed. Together with the stress analysis of a brazed grit, {{it is found that}} the fracture failure of brazed grit {{is the result of the}} brittle fracture happening on the root section of the grit, the interface between the grit and the brazing alloy. The degradation of mechanical properties of grits in brazing is a key factor to the reduction of their resistance to fracture. Lower machining forces as well as grit exposure are in favor of preventing grits from fracture...|$|R
40|$|The Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) {{consists}} of 1080 conical tubes, which are furnace brazed themselves, manifolds, and surrounding structural jacket making almost four miles of braze joints. Subsequent furnace braze cycles are performed due to localized braze voids between the coolant tubes. SSME nozzle experiences extremely high heat flux (180 mW/sq m) during hot fire. Braze voids between coolant tubes {{may result in}} hot combustion gas escape causing jacket bulges. The nozzle can be disqualified for flight or result in mission failure if the braze voids exceed the limits. Localized braze processes were considered to eliminate braze voids, however, damage to the parent materials often prohibited use of such process. Being the only manned flight reusable rocket engine, it has stringent requirement on the braze process. Poor braze quality or damage to the parent materials limits the nozzle service life. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop a laser brazing process to provide quality, localized braze joints without adverse affect on the parent materials. Gold (Au-Cu-Ni-Pd-Mn) based high temperature braze alloys were used in both powder and wire form. Thin section iron base superalloy A 286 tube was used as substrate materials. Different Laser Systems including CO 2 (10. 6 micrometers, 1 kW), ND:YAG (1. 06 micrometers, 4 kW). and direct diode laser (808 nm. 150 W) were investigated for brazing process. The laser process variables including wavelength. laser power, travel speed and angle of inclination were optimized according to bead geometry and braze alloy wetting at minimum heat input level, The properties of laser brazing were compared to that of furnace brazing. Microhardness profiles were used for braze joint property comparison between laser and furnace brazing. The cooling rate of laser brazing was compared to furnace brazing based on secondary dendritic arm spacing, Both optical and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were used to evaluate the microstructures of the braze materials and tube substrate. Metallography of the laser braze joint was compared to the furnace braze. SEM Energy Disperse X-Ray Spectra (EDX) and back scattered imaging were used to analyze braze alloy segregation. Although all of the laser systems, CO 2, ND:YAG, and direct diode laser produced good braze joint, the direct diode laser was selected for its system simplicity, compactness and portability. Excellent laser and braze alloy coupling is observed with powder alloy compared to <b>braze</b> alloy <b>wire.</b> Good wetting is found with different gold based braze alloys. The laser brazing process can be optimized so that the adverse affect on the parent materials can be eliminated. Metallography of the laser braze joint has shown that quality braze joint was produced with laser brazing process. Penetration of the laser braze to the substrate is at neglectable level. Zero penetration is observed. Microstructure examinations shown that no observable changes of the microstructure (grain structure and precipitation) in the HAZ area between laser braze and furnace braze. Wide gaps can be laser brazed with single pass for up to 0. 024 inches. Finer dendritic structure is observed in laser brazing compared with equiaxial and coarser grain of the furnace brazing microstructure. Greater segregation is also found in the furnace braze. Higher hardness of the laser braze joint comparing to furnace braze is observed due to the fast cooling rate and Finer microstructure in the laser brazing. Laser braze joint properties meet or exceed the furnace joint properties. Direct diode laser for thin section tube brazing with high temperature braze alloys have been successfully demonstrated. The laser's high energy density and precise control has shown significant advantages in reducing process heat input to the substrates and provide high quality braze joints comparing to other localized braze process such as torch, TIG, and MPTA processes. Significant cost savings can be realized particularly with localized braze comparing to a full furnace braze cycle...|$|R
