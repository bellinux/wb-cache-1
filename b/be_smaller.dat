5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could <b>be</b> <b>smaller,</b> terrestrial planets orbiting closer to the star. The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E

30|$|The roadway {{deformation}} rate versus load can reflect {{the ability of}} the surrounding rock to resist deformation due to external load. The variation of the roadway {{deformation rate}} versus load exhibits the following trends: it <b>is</b> <b>small</b> in the load-bearing stage before the peak stress is reached, it <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> for higher-density bolt supports, it <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> for longer bolt lengths, and it <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> for larger-diameter bolts.|$|R
5|$|If the Sun–Neptune {{distance}} is scaled to 100 metres, then the Sun {{would be about}} 3cm in diameter (roughly two-thirds the diameter of a golf ball), the giant planets would be all smaller than about 3mm, and Earth's diameter along {{with that of the}} other terrestrial planets would <b>be</b> <b>smaller</b> than a flea (0.3mm) at this scale.|$|E
5|$|M. l. leuconotus is {{endemic to}} {{mainland}} Australia and distinct {{in that it}} is the only subspecies to have nuptial males that show prominent blue-and-white plumage. The name of this species is derived from the Ancient Greek leukos 'white' and notos 'back'. Birds in the southern parts of its range tend to <b>be</b> <b>smaller</b> than those in the north.|$|E
5|$|Some proofs that 0.999... = 1 {{rely on the}} Archimedean {{property}} of the real numbers: {{that there are no}} nonzero infinitesimals.

5|$|The 1885 herd book {{describes}} {{two distinct}} types of Highland cattle. One was the West Highland, or Kyloe, originating and living {{mostly on the}} Western Islands, which had harsher conditions. These cattle tended to <b>be</b> <b>smaller,</b> to have black coats and, due to their more rugged environment, to have long hair. These cattle were named due {{to the practice of}} relocating them. The kyles were narrow straits of water the cattle were driven across to get to market.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of smokeless powder, based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor Paul Vielle in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the pre-Dreadnought battleships of the 1890s tended to <b>be</b> <b>smaller</b> in calibre {{compared to the}} ships of the 1880s, most often 12in (305mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.|$|E
5|$|The {{life history}} {{characteristics}} of the silky shark differ across its range (see table). Northwestern Atlantic sharks tend to be larger {{than those in the}} western-central Pacific at all ages, while eastern Pacific sharks tend to <b>be</b> <b>smaller</b> than sharks in other regions. Eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean sharks seem to match or exceed the size of northwestern Atlantic sharks, but the figures are based on relatively few individuals and more data are needed.|$|E

50|$|Eurycoma <b>is</b> a <b>small</b> genus {{of three}} or four species of {{flowering}} plants in the family Simaroubaceae, native to tropical southeastern Asia.

5|$|Tracks are an {{important}} factor in distinguishing coyote from dog predation. Coyote tracks tend to be more oval-shaped and compact than those of domestic dogs, and their claw marks are less prominent and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely than those of dogs. With the exception of sighthounds, most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride. Coyote kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by less damage to the underlying tissues in the former. Also, coyote scat tends to <b>be</b> <b>smaller</b> than wolf scat.|$|E
5|$|Yorks {{design was}} based on the earlier County classes but was {{intended}} to <b>be</b> <b>smaller</b> and cheaper, although better armoured. She was easily distinguishable from her sister ship, , as the latter had straight masts and funnels, while those of York were angled to the rear. In addition, York also had a very tall bridge designed to clear the aircraft catapult originally planned to be carried on the superfiring ('B') gun turret forward.|$|E
5|$|According to {{developer}} Matthew Dillon, {{progress is}} being made to provide both device input/output (I/O) and virtual file system (VFS) messaging capabilities that will enable the remainder of the project goals to be met. The new infrastructure will allow many parts of the kernel to be migrated out into userspace; here they will be more easily debugged as they will <b>be</b> <b>smaller,</b> isolated programs, instead of being small parts entwined in a larger chunk of code. Additionally, the migration of select kernel code into userspace has the benefit of making the system more robust; if a userspace driver crashes, it will not crash the kernel.|$|E

5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to <b>be</b> <b>smaller</b> and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} other {{alternatives}} were discarded, consensus gradually grew for the Flåm alternative, and the Railway Committee for Nordre Bergenhus County recommended this proposal. New plans from NSB criticized {{the mix of}} rack and adhesion railway, and instead proposed a conventional adhesion line all the way. Engineer Ferdinand Bjerke traveled to Continental Europe to study several combined railways. He published a preliminary report in 1911, which recommended an adhesion railway, although he also felt {{the need for a}} detailed study of a rack railway. His final report was finished in 1913, and although it recommended adhesion, it pointed out that the line's capacity would <b>be</b> <b>smaller</b> than predicted and that costs would be three times as high—NOK5.5 million. The plans were approved by the Ministry of Labour and NSB's main board in 1915.|$|E
5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the entry of another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the entry of Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would <b>be</b> <b>smaller</b> than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E
