On Rotten Tomatoes, {{the first season}} holds an approval rating of 100% with an average score of 9.2 out of 10 based on 33 reviews and a critics' consensus of, [...] "A pleasant change from typically gory zombie shows, The Returned is a must-see oddity that's both smart and sure to disturb".

6000|$|... "Aye! I {{would have}} gone myself," [...] said a grizzly, weatherbeaten old sailor, [...] "if {{they would have had}} me. There was Will Trelawney, who went on such another {{expedition}} as this, and came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> bags <b>of</b> Spanish dollars than he could carry. Truly they are a gold mine, these Western seas; but even better than getting gold is the thrashing of those haughty Spaniards, who seem to look upon themselves as gods, and on all others as fit only to clean their worships' boots." ...|$|R
60|$|Day {{and night}} the ship throbbed to the tireless {{pulse of the}} propeller, and though one day was very like another, it was {{apparent}} to Buck that the weather was steadily growing colder. At last, one morning, the propeller was quiet, and the Narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of excitement. He felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change was at hand. Francois leashed them and brought them on deck. At the first step upon the cold surface, Buck's feet sank into a white mushy something very like mud. He sprang <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a snort. <b>More</b> <b>of</b> this white stuff was falling through the air. He shook himself, but <b>more</b> <b>of</b> it fell upon him. He sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. It bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. This puzzled him. He tried it again, with the same result. The onlookers laughed uproariously, and he felt ashamed, he knew not why, for {{it was his first}} snow.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Horsball {{knew his}} customers, {{and did not}} like being slapped on the <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> than {{ordinary}} vigour by such a customer as Lieutenant Cox.

5000|$|Long {{after the}} {{cancellation}} of the show, Thomas Dekker, who portrays John Connor in the series says in an interview [...] "I loved the way it ended. I think the only thing that’s frustrating about how it ends is that it ended, at all. I {{think it was an}} ingenious cliffhanger to come <b>back</b> <b>with.</b> It was just sad that we didn’t come <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more,</b> but them’s the breaks." ...|$|R
50|$|Having been {{revealed}} {{as a girl}} in Hidden Warrior, Tamír (previously Tobin), tries to rule her kingdom with the wizard Arkoniel at her side, and trying to hide the love she feels for Ki.

Hill behind him, {{continued}} his attack, despite orders from Lee to hold his ground. His assault was beaten <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> casualties.|$|R

50|$|This {{leads into}} the chorus, sung in coded Japanese. The chorus' {{arrangement}} is <b>backed</b> <b>with</b> a <b>more</b> complex variety <b>of</b> instruments.

This then leads into the chorus twice more, and finally one single abridged chorus <b>backed</b> only <b>with</b> piano.|$|R

50|$|Niko Price, Curtis Blaydes and Abel Trujillo all tested {{positive}} for marijuana in in-competition drug tests. All three have been suspended 90 days and fined $1,000 by the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR), sources said. Despite their test failures for marijuana, none are facing any sanctions from USADA, as it only suspends fighters for cannabis if their drug test comes <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> than 150 ng/ml of the substance’s metabolites. Victories by Price and Blaydes have been overturned to no contests.|$|R
5000|$|Tamír is much {{loved by}} the people and very popular, but she faces {{problems}} of her own.

25|$|The BNCR {{purchased}} {{a share in}} the lease of the long-standing and well thought of Antrim Arms hotel at Portrush and in 1883 formed a separate company to manage what was renamed the Northern Counties Hotel.

The hotel was enlarged and improved in 1884 and 1892 and in 1902 the BNCR purchased the freehold outright from the Earl of Antrim.|$|R
50|$|Cleitus was {{the mastermind}} behind the well {{structured}} Illyrian Revolt of 335 BC. Cleitus entered into {{an agreement with}} the Taulantii State under Glaucias and the Autariatae State under Pleurias. Cleitus had captured and garrisoned the city of Pelion and waited for Glaucias' troops to arrive. However, Alexander arrived on the scene first and blockaded Cleitus within the city walls. Glaucias came to Cleitus' aid, and the Macedonians were forced to retreat. Alexander came <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> equipment and supplies and skillfully drove Glaucias' army from the surrounding heights, preventing Cleitus from engaging with Glaucias.|$|R
40|$|It is {{only eight}} months since we saw UK band Muse at Big Day Out, {{but now they}} are <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> fans and a lot more fanfare. Their stocks have risen with the release of their latest album, Absolution, a recent tour with The Cure, and their steady {{determination}} to prevail. There have been comparisons - with Radiohead, for instance, and the latter end of Britpop - but increasingly, Muse is taking inspiration from such brazen exhumations of the flamboyant as The Darkness and the We-Will-Rock-You community singalongs of the Queen revival...|$|R

5000|$|One {{exception}} {{to the use of}} a special lightweight bolt was the Colt Service Ace, offered as a complete pistol or as a conversion kit for the M1911. While still nominally a blowback conversion, the Service Ace used a special [...] "floating" [...] chamber in the barrel that acted like a gas operated firearm's piston, helping push the bolt <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> force than a typical [...]22 Long Rifle blowback action. This additional force allowed the small [...]22 Long Rifle cartridge to cycle a standard weight slide, which made the pistol handle more like the standard [...]45 ACP version.|$|R
