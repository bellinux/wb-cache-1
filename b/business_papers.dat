5|$|Diana {{discovers that}} Paul {{has written a}} story about her in his {{newspaper}} and she confronts him. Diana tells him that she {{will have a lot}} of job offers in New York, but Paul says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his <b>business</b> <b>papers</b> in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, {{and at the same time}} she takes his house keys from his pocket and she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells him to speak to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul. Andrew, Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) follow Diana and see her meeting with Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey), a hitman she called on the night Paul was pushed. Natasha retrieves Jack's phone and the group listen to a message left by Diana, telling him to leave town. Andrew confronts Diana at her hotel and Mark arrives to arrest her for conspiracy to commit murder. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives some emails telling her that Diana did not push Paul and she goes to see her. Diana tells Susan that she has been formally charged, but insists that she is innocent. She realises that Susan believes her and she begs Susan to help. Diana is later released.|$|E

500|$|Washburn had a {{long and}} abiding {{interest}} in local and state history. [...] In 1826 he published a short history of Leicester in a Worcester magazine. [...] This work {{formed the basis for}} his Historical Sketches of the Town of Leicester, Massachusetts, published in 1860. [...] He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1827, beginning a lifelong association with that organization. He served as the society's secretary for foreign correspondence from 1866-1867, and then secretary of domestic correspondence from 1867-1877. A large portion of his personal and <b>business</b> <b>papers</b> also resides within its collections. [...] He later became a contributing member to the New England Historical and Genealogical Society and {{was a member of the}} Massachusetts Historical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. [...] In 1840 he published Sketches of the Judicial History of Massachusetts, which provides a basic history of the colonial Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature (antecedent to the current Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court) and its justices. [...] Biographer Robert Spector describes it as [...] "the starting point and basis" [...] for legal historical work relating to the court. [...] Washburn considered himself to be more of an antiquarian than a historian: he believed it important to conserve artifacts and historical information, leaving the interpretation of those to others. [...] He wrote of the importance, for example, of the need for the state to preserve its own historical documents (something not given much attention in its early years).|$|E

60|$|Winter had now set in, with {{occasional}} {{wind and rain}} and frost, yet Washington still kept up his active round of in-door and out-door avocations, as his diary records. He was in full health and vigor, dined out occasionally, and had frequent guests at Mount Vernon. For some time past he had been occupied in digesting a complete system on which his estate was to be managed for several succeeding years; specifying the cultivation of the several farms, with tables designating the rotations of the crops. It occupied thirty folio pages, and was executed with that clearness and method which characterized all his <b>business</b> <b>papers.</b> This was finished on the 10th of December, and {{was accompanied by a}} letter of that date to his manager or steward.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{he went to}} his desk, but not to bury {{himself in}} <b>business</b> <b>papers,</b> as usual, for, after rummaging in several drawers, he took out a small bunch of keys, and sat looking at them with an {{expression}} only seen on his face when {{he looked up at the}} portrait of a dark-eyed woman hanging in his room. He was a very busy man, but he had a tender place in his heart for his children; and when a look, a few words, a moment's reflection, called his attention to the fact that his little girl was growing up, he found both pride and pleasure in the thought that this young daughter was trying to fill her mother's place, and be a comfort to him, if he would let her.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Fletcher, who had {{received}} him on his arrival with singular effusiveness and cordiality, had put off their final arrangements until after dinner, on account of pressing business. It was therefore with some surprise that {{an hour before the}} time he was summoned to Fletcher's room. He was still more surprised to find him sitting at his desk, from which a number of <b>business</b> <b>papers</b> and letters had been hurriedly thrust aside {{to make way for a}} manuscript. A single glance at it was enough to show the unhappy John Milton that it was the one he had sent to Mrs. Ashwood. The color flashed to his cheek and he felt a mist before his eyes. His employer's face, on the contrary, was quite pale, and his eyes were fixed on Harcourt with a singular intensity. His voice too, although under great control, was hard and strange.|$|E
60|$|Sanda Pasha then {{received}} {{a number of}} <b>business</b> <b>papers</b> from {{an officer of the}} household, to which he applied himself with great apparent earnestness, paying no attention whatever to his visitors. Lancey observed, however, that his absorbed condition did not prevent a few of these visitors, apparently of superior rank, from approaching and whispering in his ear. To some of them he was gracious, to others cool, as they severally stated the nature of their business. No one else dared to approach until the reading of the papers was finished. Suddenly the Pasha appeared to get weary of his papers. He tossed them aside, ordered his carriage, rose hastily, and left the room. But this uncourteous behaviour did not appear to disconcert those who awaited his pleasure. Probably, like eels, they had got used to rough treatment. Some of them ran after the Pasha and tried to urge their suits in a few rapid sentences, others went off with a sigh or a growl, resolving to repeat the visit another day, while Sanda himself was whirled along at full speed to the Sublime Porte, to hold council with the Ministers of State on the arrangements for the war that had by that time begun to rage along the whole line of the Lower Danube--the Russians having effected a crossing in several places.|$|E
60|$|Townshead {{was wrong}} in one respect, for it was the {{weakness}} of an over-sensitive temperament which, while friends were ready to help him, had driven him to hide himself in Western Canada when, {{as the result of}} unwise speculations, financial disaster overtook him. His daughter, however, did not remind him of this, as some daughters would have done, though she understood it well enough, and a memory out of keeping with the patter of the snow and moaning of the wind rose up before her as she looked into the twinkling stove. She could recall that night five years ago very well, for she had spent most of it amidst lights and music, as fresh and bright herself as the flowers that nestled against her first ball dress. It was a night of triumph and revelation, in which she had first felt the full power of her beauty and her sex, and she had returned with the glamour of it all upon her to find her father sitting with {{his head in his hands}} at a table littered with <b>business</b> <b>papers.</b> His face had frightened her, and it had never wholly lost the look she saw upon it then, for Townshead was lacking in fibre, and had found that a fondness for horses and some experience of amateur cattle-breeding on a small and expensive scale was a very poor preparation for the grim reality of ranching in Western Canada.|$|E
