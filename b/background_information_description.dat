40|$|CIFOR's ACM {{program has}} been {{carrying}} out participatory action research with local communities to devise models for forest management by multiple stakeholders. One of the early requests by communities {{has been for the}} mapping of their villages. This report describes the facilitation team's observations during the process of mapping these territories (villages along the Malinau river, Kalimantan, Indonesia). Central theme is the question what caused conflicts within and between villages and how were these handled and overcome by the communities. The role that the participatory mapping process played in identifying as well as solving the conflicts is discussed. After a general overview and analysis of the situation, each village is also described in more detail: <b>background</b> <b>information,</b> <b>description</b> of the conflicts and approach to solving them...|$|E

The aim of this work is to describe how EuroFIR guidelines for assessment of methods of analysis are created and made available to users. Comprehensive information for macronutrients, vitamins, minerals and trace elements addressing all aspects of analytical procedures was obtained from international standards, and scientific literature. Documentation was compiled in a confluence wiki format provided for each component: <b>background</b> <b>information,</b> <b>description</b> of reference methods of analysis and critical steps, available reference materials, proficiency testing schemes, other analytical methods and relevant references. The information for each nutrient was collated, edited and presented with hypertext links to additional pages where more detailed information can be accessed using full text searches. The wiki format is a useful tool for preparing information and disseminating to users.

40|$|This {{inventory}} of the glaciers in mainland Norway in book form consists of two parts: a text section with <b>background</b> <b>information,</b> <b>description</b> of the methods used and main results, and a map and table section that includes all identified glaciers. To derive this new inventory satellite images from the Landsat sensors from the period 1999 - 2006 were analysed. The sui- tability of a semi-automatic band-ratio method was first applied to map glaciers in a test region in Jotunheimen, before the method was applied to map all glaciers in Norway. All automatically mapped snow and ice polygons were visually inspected using composites of satellite image bands, digital topographic maps and orthophotos where available. The po- lygons were manually classified as ‘glaciers’, ‘possible snowfields’ or ‘snow’. Manual corrections for debris cover, glacier- lake interfaces, clouds or cast shadow were made where necessary. All polygons {{to be included in}} this new inventory were assigned a unique ID. Glacier complexes were divided into glacier units using drainage divides. Many smaller polygons which had been classified as possible snowfields due to size, shape or due to uncertainty regarding ice content were not as- signed IDs and were therefore not included in this inventory book. Glacier names were assigned both to individual glacier units and to glacier complexes. To be consistent we used the spelling from the digital N 50 topographic maps produced by the Norwegian Mapping Authority, although in some cases these are different to those used in the previous inventories. In total 2534 glaciers (3143 glacier units) were defined in the new inventory. Of these 1252 glaciers (1575 glacier units) were in southern Norway and 1282 (1568 glacier units) were in northern Norway. The total glacier area is 2692 km 2 ± 81 km 2 (using ± 3...|$|E

Specifically, this study examined how the EFL learners 2 ̆ 7 spoken production changed by measuring and comparing the following temporal variables in the pre- and post-tests: speech rate, articulation rate and pause phenomena. Also, the same temporal variables were measured {{for each type of}} task to determine whether the type of task affected the spoken production. The study examined the participants 2 ̆ 7 reactions and feelings about the experience with voice chat in real time. Finally, the study looked at whether voice chat in real time- conversational partnerships with English native-speakers could be a resource for learning the language more effectively in EFL environments.;The participants were two Spanish speaking learners of English who were enrolled in an intermediate English course at the Department of Languages at a university in Ambato [...] -Ecuador, and two native speakers of English who were enrolled at Iowa State University. The research included a pre-test, a task-treatment process, and a post-test. The pre-test and post-test contained 15 questions each whose topics were descriptions (people, places, situations and stories), celebrations (food and festivals), recommendations (home remedies, environment, education and public services), and special topics (skills, and plans). The task-treatment contained 11 tasks categorized as Information Gap (<b>Background</b> <b>information,</b> <b>Description</b> of countries and Favorite Food), Decision Making (Argumentation (for and against), Create a recipe and Special Dinner), Opinion Exchange (Environmental problems and School systems), Questions and Answers (Recent trip and Favorite festival), and Problem Solving (Student 2 ̆ 7 s arrivals). Participants fill out a reflection journal after each voice chat sessions. Finally, each participant was interviewed regarding the voice chat experience they had had.;The results showed that the task interactions using voice chat with native speakers helped EFL learners improve their fluency, acquire new vocabulary and feel more confident in speaking the target language and interacting with native speakers of the language. Moreover, the results showed that dysfluency markers such as filled pauses and pauses {{played an important role in}} the development of fluency and in the perception that native speakers have about the speech of learners. In addition, the findings of this case study suggested that the most reliable measurements of fluency are speech and articulation rates. Moreover, contrary to the belief that filled pauses and pauses are dysfluency markers, filled pauses bridge the gap between actual utterances and silence which seem to be one of the key elements of fluid and smooth speech, and pauses seem to not disrupt the speech if their length does not cause excessive interruption of speech. The data also suggested that voice chat seems to be an effective classroom aid that instructors may want to encourage learners to use in order to practice the target language in a more informal, meaningful and authentic form...|$|E

In this paper, we first introduce the local <b>background</b> <b>information</b> into target <b>description,</b> and represent it {{as a set of}} weighted feature points.

The proposed method has the following two advantages: 1) The local <b>background</b> <b>information</b> is integrated into the target description, which enhances the target model. Thereby, the discriminative ability is promoted in the tracking process, which further makes the tracker more robust and accurate. 2) In the initialization stage, the mean-shift is applied to relocating the target, which can solve the problem that the tracking algorithm is prone to failure in inexact initialization. Extensive experiments in different video sequences are conducted to evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively.

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about the {{efficacy}} and the working mechanisms of physical and occupational therapy interventions for children with cerebral palsy (CP). In recent years a shift from a child-focused intervention approach to a more context-focused intervention approach can be recognized. Until now the evidence on the efficacy and the working mechanisms of these interventions for children with CP is inconclusive. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and working mechanisms of two intervention approaches compared to regular care intervention in improving mobility and self-care skills of children (2 - 3 years) with CP and their families: a child-focused intervention approach and a context-focused intervention approach. Methods/Design: A multi-centre, randomized controlled trial research design will be used. Ninety-four children with CP (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level I-IV; age 2 to 3 years), their parents, and service providers (physical and occupational therapists) will be included. During a period of six months children will receive child-focused, context-focused or regular care intervention. Therapists will be randomly assigned to deliver either a child-focused intervention approach, a context-focused intervention approach or regular care intervention. Children follow their therapist into the allocated intervention arm. After the six months study-intervention period, all participants return to regular care intervention. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, after six months and at a three months follow-up period. Primary outcome is the capability of functional skills in self-care and mobility, using the Functional Skills Scale of the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI). Other outcomes will be quality of life and the domains of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health - for Children and Youth (ICF-CY), including body function and structure, activities (gross motor capacity and performance of daily activities), social participation, environmental variables (family functioning, parental empowerment).

40|$|As {{part of the}} European Commission Health Monitoring Programma, health {{indicators}} have been developed which contribute {{to the establishment of}} an European health monitoring system. Epidemiological information of this system will be derived from various information sources. To study the appropriateness and comparability of primary care as a source of epidemiological information, the indicators need to be structured into profiles. This will also facilitate international comparisons of the information and thus permit valid comparisons between countries. Primary care networks that monitor diseases on a continuous basis participated in the current study. Methods: Primary care networks from Belgium, England & Wales, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain delivered epidemiological data on diseases mainly managed in primary care. Specific health indicator profiles (HIPS) were developed for each disease. Results: A total of 9 diseases was selected based upon the feasibility and appropriateness of primary care data for each individual disease. This selection consisted of acute diarrhoea/gastroenteritis, asthma, low back pain, chickenpox, depression, diabetes mellitus, herpes zoster, stroke/TIA and viral exanthemic disease. For each disease nominator and denominator information from at least 3 countries available. HIPs which were developed include the following categories: health indicator, information on case definition and contextual information per country. HIPs for a selection if diseases will be presented here. Conclusions: Primary care data {{can be used as a}} tool for public health monitoring. <b>Background</b> <b>information</b> and a <b>description</b> of the data source is necessary in order to make valid comparisons. Profiles containing information on {{health indicators}} can be developed which allow for such comparisons. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
