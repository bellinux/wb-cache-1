5|$|The Battle of Barnet was an {{important}} engagement in the Wars of the Roses: it brought {{about the death of}} a prominent figure and secured the throne for another. Despite its importance to history, contemporary records about the battle are rare. The sole chronicle based on an eyewitness account—The Arrivall of Edward IV—was written by someone within Edward's council, which presents a biased account of the battle. Another first-hand observation was found in the Paston Letters, written by the Lancastrian Sir John Paston. Other records, such as The Warkworth Chronicle, offer only <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> about the battle. Therefore, deficits in historical understanding must be filled through field research and discoveries of mediaeval documents.|$|E
5|$|In early 1929 Robey {{returned}} to South Africa and then Canada for another tour with <b>Bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pieces,</b> {{after which he}} started another series of variety dates back in England. Among the towns he visited was Woolwich, where he performed to packed audiences {{over the course of}} a week. Here he met the theatre managers Frank and Agnes Littler, with the latter briefly becoming his manager. In 1932 Robey appeared in his first sound film, The Temperance Fête, and followed this with Marry Me, which was, according to his biographer A. E. Wilson, one of the most successful musical films of the comedian's career. The film tells the story of a sound recordist in a gramophone company who romances a colleague when she becomes the family housekeeper.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of some {{of these}} songs were used in the film. Most of the songs' scenes were cut entirely (*).|$|E
50|$|Two cars (there {{were only}} three built) were crashed while testing at AVUS. Young {{designer}} Luigi Colani bought the leftover <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieced</b> together a fibreglass-bodied design of his own, which still exists although it is currently powered by a 1.3 litre Giulietta Veloce engine.|$|R

25|$|The {{video game}} Everything, {{released}} on March 21, 2017, features a soundtrack and narration from Alan Watts. It relates heavily to the game's theme of perspective. <b>Bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of his lectures are also played {{during the game}} at certain times.|$|E
25|$|In 1848, all {{of these}} settlements, {{including}} Merrillville (that is, the old McGwinn Village) were collected into one and called Ross Township. As time went by, <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of Ross Township were taken by Hobart and Crown Point when those towns incorporated.|$|E
25|$|The webs are permanent. Over time, {{they will}} begin {{gathering}} leaves and other debris. Double-tailed tent spiders will regularly clean their webs, usually at night, though they will retain some <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of debris for camouflage. The webs {{sometimes have to}} be rebuilt when severely damaged.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDrilling is {{a highly}} {{demanding}} machining process due to complex tool geometry and the progressive material failure on the work piece. In this study, a 3 D model is developed using commercial finite element software ABAQUS/Explicit. The proposed model simulates the drilling process by taking into account of the damage initiation and evolution of the work piece material, a contact model at the interface between drill <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> work <b>piece</b> <b>and</b> the process parameters. The results of the simulations demonstrate the effects of machining parameters on drilling. The results also confirm the capability and advantage of FE simulation of the drilling process...|$|R
50|$|That {{exposure}} led to Maca {{getting a}} show of his own in October 2005 - the aptly named One Man Show - Niko kao ja on OBN television in Bosnia. Conceptualized as a free format with street <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> in-studio <b>pieces</b> such as wrestling with strippers in chocolate and turbo-folk performances, the show often bordered on vulgarity with profanity, sexual innuendo, and street lingo being the norm. Following the controversy that erupted after the episode that aired on New Year's Day 2006, the show {{was taken off the}} air.|$|R
25|$|As the {{evidence}} {{came to light}} in <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> {{at a time when}} Smenkhkare was assumed to have also used the name Neferneferuaten perhaps at the start of his sole reign, it sometimes defied logic. For instance, when the mortuary wine docket surfaced from the 'House of Smenkhkare (deceased)', it seemed to appear that he changed his name back before he died.|$|E
25|$|I {{like them}} all. There's <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> {{of books that}} I think are good. I never rework a book. I'd rather use what I've learned on the next one, {{and make it a}} little bit better. The worst of it is that I'm no longer a kid and I'm just now getting to be a good writer. Just now.|$|E
25|$|Although Cage started {{painting}} in his youth, {{he gave it}} up in order to concentrate on music instead. His first mature visual project, Not Wanting to Say Anything About Marcel, dates from 1969. The work comprises two lithographs {{and a group of}} what Cage called plexigrams: silk screen printing on plexiglas panels. The panels and the lithographs all consist of <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of words in different typefaces, all governed by chance operations.|$|E
60|$|The clergyman pounced {{upon him}} with a growl of a hyena, <b>and</b> <b>bit</b> a <b>piece</b> out of his ear. Yes, he did, reader. Just imagine a clergyman biting a boy in open daylight! Yet that happens in New York every minute.|$|R
30|$|To {{verify that}} the larvae {{underwent}} ecdysis or pupated during periods of no AE detection, additional larvae were inoculated in bamboo pieces by placing inside holes made with a 1.5 -mm drill <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> the <b>pieces</b> were subjected to AE monitoring. When AE detection from these pieces stopped, the larvae were extracted {{and the process of}} ecdysis was observed using a microscope (VH- 5000, Keyence Corp., Japan). A microscope image of the larva was recorded every 300  s in the environmental chamber. Two first instar larvae and five larvae in middle or later instars were used for observation.|$|R
2500|$|Blacha {{started as}} a local Chicago Comedy writer, where he met Andy Richter. Richter {{eventually}} landed Blacha {{a job with the}} Conan O'Brien show in 1993.

25|$|For {{this reason}} and others, kabuki plays are almost never {{performed}} {{in their entirety}} today, and Sugawara is no exception. The fullest standard version of any play is called tōshi kyōgen, which {{in the case of}} Sugawara consists of six of the full twelve scenes. However, again {{as is the case with}} most plays, individual scenes or elements of Sugawara may be performed alone as part of a day's program of other such <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some poems {{similar to}} those found in Codex Regius are also {{included}} in some editions of the Poetic Edda. Important manuscripts include AM 748 I 4to, Hauksbók and Flateyjarbók. Many of the poems are quoted in Snorri's Edda but usually only in <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces.</b> What poems are included in an edition of the Poetic Edda depends on the editor. Those not in Codex Regius are sometimes called Eddica minora from their appearance in an edition with that title edited by Andreas Heusler and Wilhelm Ranisch in 1903.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, work on the Great Hall ceased. Some of the students enlisted {{in the armed forces}} while others assisted on the home front. Montsalvat was turned into a farm and market garden. Jörgensen and his now smaller 'team' turned their creative abilities to these new projects, building the barns and sheds. Materials were scarce, but they managed to scrounge odd <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> – from discarded broken bricks and rusty galvanized iron to timber poles cut from the bush. Additional to the market garden was the dairy and poultry farm with the produce being sold through the local markets.|$|E
5000|$|In the DC Infinite Halloween Special, Victor Zsasz {{revealed}} the final fate of Young Frankenstein in a tale called [...] "...In Stitches". As {{his remains were}} being carried away in a helicopter, it was struck by lightning. His body was blown to <b>bits,</b> <b>and</b> the individual <b>pieces</b> began moving on their own, killing anyone in their path for new flesh. Young Frankenstein {{was finally able to}} pull himself back together in Albania and began walking {{on the bottom of the}} Ionian Sea with a need for revenge.|$|R
50|$|Vicki and {{the police}} stake out the cemetery, where they watch one of the robbers make the drop, and wait for Thomas to show up so they can arrest him. When his Rolls Royce arrives, however, she sees that Thomas has sent a {{messenger}} in his place, with a telegram asking her to bring the money and join him—or else keep the Rolls Royce. She tears the telegram to <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> throws the <b>pieces</b> to the wind, {{looking up at the}} sky with tears in her eyes. Crown flies away in a jet.|$|R
50|$|Through retcon, <b>bits</b> of <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of the Atlas and Silver Age characters' history meshed, so {{that the}} unnamed infant son of {{settlers}} the Clay family, orphaned by a Cheyenne raid, was raised by Texas Ranger Ben Bart on a ranch near Rawhide, Texas. Older brother Frank Clay, captured by Native Americans, eventually escaped and became a gambler, while eldest brother Joe Clay became sheriff {{of the town of}} Willow Flats; neither were in the regular cast, and each died in a guest appearance. Shortly after Johnny's 18th birthday, Ben Bart was murdered; Johnny, an almost preternaturally fast and accurate gunman, wounded the killers and left them to be taken into custody. A later misunderstanding between the Kid and a sheriff over a cattle rustler the Kid wounded in self-defense led to the hero's life as a fugitive.|$|R
25|$|On 29 April 1921 Blackmore's held {{an auction}} at the Works Yard in Bideford {{and sold the}} six {{carriages}} and also possibly the trackbed in separate lots. One carriage was cut in half and used {{on the beach at}} Westward Ho! near Nassau Baths as Beach Huts, whilst the others were taken to the Midlands for scrap. Some of the line's equipment was purchased for further use by Colonel H. F. Stephens, through his company Associated Railways. The fate of the signal boxes is unclear (see <b>Bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pieces),</b> however the Westward Ho! box was still being used as sweet shop on its original site as late as 1970.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1980s, {{the station}} {{produced}} {{a series of}} classic public service shorts titled <b>Bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pieces,</b> often featuring two talking puppets, Charley and Humphrey, which Pat McCormick had brought over to KTVU from his tenure at KGO-TV. The shorts, which often aired during children's programs shown on the station, were aimed at delivering positive and educational messages to kids. In the late 1970s, Charley and Humphrey were spun off into a daily children's program on KTVU, which was hosted by McCormick. Channel 2 also served as the Bay Area's originating station for the children's television program franchise Romper Room; originally hosted by Nancy Besst, the half-hour program aired at 8:30a.m. on weekday mornings {{for much of the}} 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{target of}} the first Fujimori Administration, was to stop the runaway course of inflation. Beyond that, the goals included repudiating protection and import substitution, returning to full participation in the world trading and financial systems, eliminating domestic price controls and subsidies, raising public revenue and holding government spending strictly to the levels of current revenue, initiating a social emergency program to reduce the shock of adjustment for the poor, and devoting a higher share of the country's resources to rural investment and correction {{of the causes of}} rural poverty. In practice, new measures came out in <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces,</b> dominated by immediate concern to stop inflation; actions taken in the first year did not complete the program.|$|E
40|$|The "Waubuno" was {{a wooden}} sidewheel steamer built in 1865 at Port Robinson, Ontario, Canada by {{the sons of}} William Beatty. She carried freight and {{passengers}} in the Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. Under the command of Captain J. Burkett, the "Waubuno" set sail from Collingwood, Ontario, Canada November 22, 1879 bound for Parry Sound. It was the last run of the season, and the ship was heavily laden with freight and passengers. The "Waubuno" {{was caught in a}} storm and sank some time after 4 : 00 a. m. Over the years <b>bits</b> of cargo <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of the ship have been recovered, but the bodies of the 24 crew members and passengers were never found...|$|R
40|$|The {{informant}} {{showed how}} he makes skis. The recording has video and lasts around 10 minutes. The craftsman explains his technique, how he learned {{it and what}} is important in it. Niko Partanen asks questions about the ski-making process. The video and audio that have been annotated have been slightly edited, mainly the audio levels have been brought a <b>bit</b> down <b>and</b> a <b>piece</b> of 20 seconds was cut from the middle. In the removed part a third person was briefly present, however {{as there is no}} data to identify him it felt better to remove the small portion where his speech was audible...|$|R
50|$|Dereivka (Деріївка) is {{an archaeological}} site {{located in the}} village of the same name in Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine, on the right bank of the Dneiper. The site dates to ca. 4500 - 3500 BC and is {{associated}} with the Sredny Stog culture. This site is known primarily as a probable site of early horse domestication due to a high percentage of horse bones found at the site. A horse burial with <b>bit</b> wear <b>and</b> cheek <b>pieces</b> was long considered evidence for horseback-riding at an early date, but in 1997 radiocarbon dates showed that the burial was intrusive, the horse having died circa 700-200 BC, thereby re-opening the question of when horseback-riding was invented.|$|R
25|$|In 1946, Gilmore posthumously {{described}} {{a more complete}} specimen, USNM 15660 found on 15 June 1937 on the North Horn Mountain of Utah by George B. Pearce. It consists of a complete tail, a right forelimb complete except for the fingers — which later research showed do not ossify with the Titanosauridae — and both ischia. Since then, hundreds of other <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> from Texas, New Mexico, and Utah have been referred to Alamosaurus, often without much description. Despite being fragmentary, until {{the second half of}} the twentieth century they represented much of the globally known titanosaurid material. The most completely known specimen, TMM 43621-1, is a recently discovered juvenile skeleton from Texas, which allowed educated estimates of length and mass.|$|E
25|$|As this {{subsurface}} {{movement of}} salt shaped the landscape, erosion removed the younger rock layers from the surface. Except for isolated remnants, the major formations {{visible in the}} park today are the salmon-colored Entrada Sandstone, in {{which most of the}} arches form, and the buff-colored Navajo Sandstone. These are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park. Over time, water seeped into the surface cracks, joints, and folds of these layers. Ice formed in the fissures, expanding and putting pressure on surrounding rock, breaking off <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces.</b> Winds later cleaned out the loose particles. A series of free-standing fins remained. Wind and water attacked these fins until, in some, the cementing material gave way and chunks of rock tumbled out. Many damaged fins collapsed. Others, with the right degree of hardness and balance, survived despite their missing sections. These became the famous arches.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the events}} of the Infinite Crisis limited series, DC Universe {{continuity}} was revamped in a way that both kept and altered previous elements in canon, and Superman's origin was no exception. The first revelations of this revised origin came only in <b>bits</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces.</b> In Action Comics Annual #10 (2007), Krypton is shown to have characteristics that resemble the version that appears in the Richard Donner Superman films. In Action Comics #850, a more complete recap was presented: Krypto appears on Krypton, Jor-El's frustrations with the Council, Clark's awareness about being adopted during grade school, a friendship with Lex Luthor when they are both teenagers, Clark wearing glasses in his teens, using his powers to help people while not in costume, and showing Lois Lane trying to secure interviews with Superman and being friends with Clark. Finally, the Geoff Johns/Gary Frank Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes arc revealed that Clark's membership in the Legion of Super Heroes when he is a teenager is now back in canon.|$|E
5000|$|The tunes on [...] "Sampooran" [...] {{were written}} {{incorporating}} traditional {{material from the}} eastern classical tradition and adapting these with music {{which was based on}} the jazz rock fusion explosion of the seventies. It possesses arguably the finest musical arrangements that have ever been experienced in the country, and the compositions really light up the album. The album starts with the lukewarm “Sajan” whose lyrics have been taken from a kaafi written by Shah Hussain. A moderate mix of acoustic guitars and percussion and some sweet flute playing renders this a really good opening track. “Waris Shah” is next, with its Yanni-isque musical intonations and lyrics inspired from texts by Amrita Preetam. The album seems to be getting into a groove, as the vocals start getting tuned up and the music gets more and more passionate. A classically inspired flute arrangement mixed with soft bass drums and Javed Bashir does total justice with the lyrics. The song has probably lingered on a <b>bit</b> <b>and</b> some <b>pieces</b> seem a bit lengthy, but overall it is the vocals that stand out on “Waris Shah” more than anything else.|$|R
50|$|Friction between Monk {{and owner}} Irving Haber {{prompted}} the former {{to leave and}} in 1962 he and Thomas Hammond opened a new nightclub — the Rendezvous Room (Plaza 9) — at the Plaza Hotel. There his troupe continued with revues such as Dime A Dozen (1962), Baker's Dozen (1964), <b>and</b> <b>Bits</b> & <b>Pieces</b> XIV (1964). Many unknown performers who worked at Monk's cafe revues, including Ken Berry, Ruth Buzzi, and Liz Sheridan, among others, went on to achieve varying degrees of fame. Monk’s last revue at the Plaza, Four In Hand, closed on 29 June 1968 after which he retired.|$|R

It remains in print to this day as it has proven quite popular. Several counterfeit posters have turned up over the years. In 1988, Proverbidioms was published as a jigsaw puzzle by <b>Bits</b> & <b>Pieces</b> <b>and</b> then by SunsOut, and is still in print. It has been licensed for other products as well. It has appeared as a set piece on the TV shows [...] "Beverly Hills, 90210", [...] "As the World Turns", and on a Disney pilot.|$|R
