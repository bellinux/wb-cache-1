Alongside reassurance, explanation and habit reversal, patients are shown how to breathe using their diaphragms prior to and during the normal rumination period.

40|$|Chronic {{respiratory}} diseases (CRD) commonly {{present with}} abnormal <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> at rest. There is some limited evidence that <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> during speech (speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns),</b> differ in CRD compared to healthy individuals. Monitoring speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> could provide useful information {{about changes in}} respiratory health, however, little is currently known about speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> in CRD. This research aimed to explore and evaluate speech protocols, and characterise speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> in health and CRD. Information gathered was taken forward to explore the impact (if any) on speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> in patients with CRD before and after Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR). Respiratory Inductive Plethysmography (RIP) was used to quantify breathing/speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> during various speech tasks in three studies. In the first study, 29 healthy adults and 11 adults with self-reported asthma were characterised and speech breathing protocols were evaluated. The second study characterised 20 healthy older adults, and 20 patients with CRD (COPD= 14, bronchiectasis= 6) were assessed before and after a six week PR programme in the third study. Key novel findings were: 1) <b>Breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> were task specific between speech in healthy younger adults, but this finding could not be generalised to healthy older adults or patients with CRD. 2) Speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> differed between health and CRD, but were not disease specific. 3) A recording period of two minutes was sufficient to provide stable breathing parameters 4) Conversational speech was most useful for assessing speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns.</b> 5) No changes in speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> were observed after PR, but no changes in resting breathlessness or oxygen saturation were observed either. Conclusion: This research has permitted the optimisation of speech protocols for future research and produced new evidence from patient groups that contradicts previous assumptions about task specificity. This research has not produced any {{evidence to support the}} hypothesis that speech <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> are responsive to an intervention...|$|R

40|$|Background circle Heart rate {{variability}} (HRV) biofeedback is a self-regulation strategy used {{to improve}} conditions including asthma, stress, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Respiratory muscle function affects hemodynamic influences on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and HRV and HRV-biofeedback protocols often include slow abdominal breathing to achieve physiologically optimal patterns of HRV with power spectral distribution concentrated around the 0. 1 -Hz frequency and large amplitude. It is likely that optimal balanced <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> and ability to entrain heart rhythms to breathing reflect physiological efficiency and resilience and that individuals with dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> may have difficulty voluntarily modulating HRV and RSA.

2500|$|The Buteyko {{method is}} based on the concept that [...] "hidden" [...] or undiagnosed {{hyperventilation}} is the underlying cause of numerous medical conditions, including asthma. [...] It is known that hyperventilation can lead to low carbon dioxide levels in the blood (or hypocapnea), which can subsequently lead to disturbances of the acid-base balance in the blood and lower tissue oxygen levels. [...] Advocates of this method believe that the effects of chronic hyperventilation would have even wider effects than is commonly accepted. [...] These effects include widespread spasms of the muscle in the airways (bronchospasm), disturbance of cell energy production via the Krebs cycle, as well as disturbance of numerous vital homeostatic chemical reactions in the body. [...] The Buteyko method is a purported method of [...] "retraining" [...] the body's <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> to correct for the presumed chronic hyperventilation and hypocapnea, and thereby treat or cure the body of these medical problems.|$|E
2500|$|The Buteyko method or Buteyko Breathing Technique {{is a form}} of {{complementary}} or alternative {{physical therapy}} that proposes the use of breathing exercises primarily as a treatment for asthma and other respiratory conditions. The method takes its name from Ukrainian doctor Konstantin Pavlovich Buteyko, who first formulated its principles during the 1950s. [...] This method {{is based on the assumption}} that numerous medical conditions, including asthma, are caused by chronically increased respiratory rate or deeper breathing (hyperventilation). [...] However, this theory is not widely supported in the medical community due to the lack of evidence supporting either the theory behind the method or that it works in practice. [...] This method purportedly retrains the <b>breathing</b> <b>pattern</b> through chronic repetitive breathing exercises to correct the hyperventilation, which, according to the method's proponents, will therefore treat or cure asthma as well as any other conditions purportedly caused by hyperventilation. [...] At the core of the Buteyko method is a series of reduced-breathing exercises that focus on nasal-breathing, breath-holding and relaxation.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{verify the}} {{influence}} of crying and <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> in the effectiveness of inhalatory therapy in children. Data sources: Systematic search of scientific studies on the subject in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Database, MedLine and Science Direct, published from 1994 to 2009. The descriptors "crying", "inhalation", "aerosol", "work of breathing" and "child", in Portuguese and in English, were applied. Data synthesis: 13 studies were selected, 12 in English and one in Portuguese. Most studies reported the effects of inhalation therapy in children, without discussing {{the influence of}} crying and <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> on the deposition of the medication. Studies related to this subject found that the respiratory pattern, especially the cry, reduces the amount of drug that reaches the peripheral airways. Authors discuss the anatomical and physiological differences between adults' and children's respiratory system that may interfere with the effectiveness of inhalation. However, {{most of them do}} not examine the qualitative and quantitative influence of the <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> and crying on pulmonary mechanics. Conclusions: Crying and <b>breathing</b> <b>patterns</b> influence the inhalation therapy. The presence of cry significantly reduces the amount of drug deposition in the airways.
