5|$|The {{inner product}} between two state vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, {{the probability that a}} system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the initial and final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real.

5|$|The number 1 (expressed as a {{fraction}} 1/1) is {{placed at the}} root of the tree, and the location of any other number a/b can be found <b>by</b> <b>computing</b> gcd(a,b) using the original form of the Euclidean algorithm, in which each step replaces the larger of the two given numbers by its difference with the smaller number (not its remainder), stopping when two equal numbers are reached. A step of the Euclidean algorithm that replaces the first of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its right child, and a step that replaces the second of the two numbers corresponds to a step in the tree from a node to its left child. The sequence of steps constructed in this way does not depend on whether a/b is given in lowest terms, and forms a path from the root to a node containing the number a/b. This fact can be used to prove that each positive rational number appears exactly once in this tree.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between the preoperative volume of the right liver lobe (as determined <b>by</b> <b>computed</b> tomography) and the intraoperative graft weight with or without the middle hepatic vein. Sixty-three patients who underwent liver transplantation were included in this study. the preoperative volumes of both the left and the right liver lobe were measured in all patients using computed tomography. the intraoperative weight of the right liver lobe was also measured with (group 1, n = 29) and without (group 2, n = 34) the middle hepatic vein. the results were compared with respect to gender, age, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), weights of the left and right liver lobes as measured <b>by</b> <b>computed</b> tomography, and intraoperative weight of the right liver lobe. A 21. 64 % difference was observed between the weight of the right liver lobe as measured <b>by</b> <b>computed</b> tomography and the weight of the right lobe without the hepatic vein as measured intraoperatively (group 2). Moreover, a 12. 38 % difference was observed between the weight of the right liver lobe as measured <b>by</b> <b>computed</b> tomography and the weight of the right lobe plus the middle hepatic vein as measured intraoperatively (group 1). The weight of the right liver lobe graft in a living-donor transplantation is less than that calculated <b>by</b> preoperative <b>computed</b> tomography, and the inclusion of the middle hepatic vein in the right liver lobe graft resulted in a statistically significant decrease in this difference.
