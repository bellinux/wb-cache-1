5|$|Tomorrow Never Dies was {{the first}} of three Bond films to be adapted into books by then-current Bond novelist Raymond Benson. Benson's version is {{expanded}} from the screenplay including additional scenes with Wai Lin and other supporting characters not in the film. The novel traces Carver's background as the son of media mogul Lord Roverman, whom Carver blackmails into suicide, later taking over his business. The novel also attempts to merge Benson's series with the films, particularly by continuing a middle-of-the-road approach to John Gardner's continuity. Notably it includes a reference to the film version of You Only Live Twice where he states that Bond was lying to Miss Moneypenny when he said he had taken a course in Asian languages. Tomorrow Never Dies also mentions Felix Leiter, although it states that Felix had worked for Pinkertons Detective Agency, which is thus exclusive to the literary series. Subsequent Bond novels by Benson were affected <b>by</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> Never Dies, specifically Bond's weapon of choice being changed from the Walther PPK to the Walther P99. Benson {{said in an interview that}} he felt Tomorrow Never Dies was the best of the three novelisations he wrote.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} {{constructed}} in the verse-pre-chorus-chorus form. It begins with guitar strumming, and Beyoncé sings the hook-intro, [...] "To the left, to the left: everything you own in a box to the left". In bar seven, she sings the first verse, arguing with her boyfriend about the indifference of their relationship, and tells him to walk away. The pre-chorus and chorus follow, [...] "You must not know 'bout me...I can have another you <b>by</b> <b>tomorrow</b> / I could have another you in a minute...Don't you ever for a second get to thinking / You're irreplaceable". In the second verse, Beyoncé recollects the moment she discovered her boyfriend's infidelity. The same pattern leads to the second chorus. Towards the end, Beyoncé sings the bridge, where she tells her lover, [...] "Replacing you is so easy". The song closes with an ad-libbed chorus. The Boston Globe noted that Beyoncé sings some parts {{of it in a}} higher register [...] "that complements the lyrics' wounded sensibility".|$|E

After Chocobo wins, Mog confronts Cid over his vehicle's poor performance, but Cid replies that Chocobo won because of the differences in their abilities (i.e., Chocobo's [...] "Dash"). He explains that the secret of Chocobo's [...] "Dash" [...] ability is the Blue Crystal on his leg-ring. Mog mulls over his inferior [...] "Flap" [...] ability and decides he wants a Blue Crystal as well, so Cid recommends that the two go on an adventure to find out the secret of the Blue Crystal.|$|E

There are no new injuries so far. Hopefully <b>by</b> <b>tomorrow</b> morning it will be a definite." [...] He believed it was important to substitute Giggs and Keane early in the second half {{in order for them to}} recuperate in time for the Dinamo București game. Scholes, however, [...] "…needed a game, which is why I left him on that bit longer." [...] Ferguson felt Manchester United's preparations to the new season were hampered because of the injuries: [...] "It's got a lot to do with summer football. It's not down to the European Championship, but you do wonder why the Copa América can't be at the same time. That harmony is never quite right, from Africa to America to Europe. Something should be done about that." [...] Giggs said Manchester United needed to take the positives out of the match and anticipated Arsenal as their main rivals in the league: [...] " [...] know what to do and how to handle the pressure when it comes around." ...|$|E

I want it settled <b>by</b> <b>tomorrow</b> morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E

2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} <b>by</b> <b>Tomorrow</b> Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! But I wonder if we can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E
