5|$|At {{the same}} time, on the {{northern}} flank, the 10th Division was much more successful. Instead of waiting for orders from General Żeligowski, the commanding officer of the 10th Division, Lieutenant Colonel Wiktor Thommée, started a push along the southern bank of the Bugonarew. The 28th and 29th Kaniów Rifles Infantry Regiments managed to reach the village of Mokre, on a small hill overlooking Radzymin and the Białystok-Warsaw road, directly behind the Russian lines. The Russians tried to push the Poles <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> position, but ultimately failed. Their assault on the village of Wiktorów also ended in failure. Soon the Polish positions in Mokre were secured, and further reinforced with {{the remainder of the}} 1st Battalion, 28th Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E

He did not play for a while but when he did he played very well, hitting 108 against Border B. In 1998 he played for Kenilworth in England, hitting 1207 runs in 98, followed by 1218 in 1999.|$|E

25|$|The Wallabies's unbeaten run {{stretched}} to 8 matches with a 12-all draw with New Zealand, prompting optimism that Australia could finally reclaim the Bledisloe Cup {{for the first}} time since 2002, in addition to ending their 28-year winless run at Eden Park. However, Australia came crashing back to earth, suffering a 51-20 defeat during the second Bledisloe test, staged at the venue, stretching Australia's Bledisloe Cup drought to a 12th year. Australia managed to bounce <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> defeat, with hard fought 24-23 and 32-25 wins over South Africa and Argentina, with the latter win ensuring that Australia retained the Puma Trophy.|$|E
25|$|Legislation for a Connecticut Tercentenary half dollar was {{introduced}} in the House of Representatives by that state's Francis T. Maloney on March 26, 1934. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures. It was reported <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> committee on April 30 by New York's Andrew Somers with a one-page report recommending that the bill pass after being amended. The most significant changes were an increase in the authorized mintage from 10,000 to 25,000, and a requirement that the Federal government not be put to any expense {{in the creation of the}} models from which dies to strike the coins could be prepared. Thus, the Tercentenary Commission was supposed to pay for a sculptor to design the coin.|$|E
25|$|When {{writing the}} stories, {{he started with}} their twist endings, and then worked his way <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that.</b> He {{designed}} {{the flow of the}} story by using a spreadsheet, and wrote prototypes of potential outcomes of the different scenarios in the game; after this, he matched it with the flowchart he had made, and came up with the details of each story. As he wrote each scene, he imagined what the player might be thinking as they play through it, and decided what to write based on it; {{this was one of the}} most important things to him when writing. A key element to Uchikoshi when writing the outcomes of player decisions is that the importance of the decision usually is much greater after the player has made it, with the consequences only being revealed later on as the player learns more information; this was to maintain the high suspense level, and to avoid situations where choices end up not actually mattering. One big challenge for him was to maintain player interest through all branches; he tried to have each branch develop differently, as to avoid repetition and fatigue, and keep the player motivated. While he came up with the set-up, the setting, and the characters on his own, he had a sub-writer helping him with writing the second game, and two sub-writers for the third game. They would help with brainstorming ideas and finding what does not work so well and how to improve scenarios.|$|E

500|$|Despite this praise, McNamara of IGN {{commented that}} he finds {{implementing}} regenerating health to be [...] "a little troublesome", {{and that it}} allows players to [...] "experience a kind of combat only a mythical super-soldier could withstand" [...] which, therefore, [...] "propels the game from gritty authenticity to John Woo fantasy". GameSpot's Colayco was critical of the game's pricing, stating it had a [...] "higher pricepoint than its PC counterpart". He also complained that the multiplayer aspect could only support eight players. For the PC version, his main critique was for performance, stating [...] "performance can chug at times". The PC version multiplayer was criticized as being a step <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of [...]|$|E
500|$|One of the {{challenges}} the writers faced was scaling down their ideas to make them feasible for production. [...] Cuse said that he let such ideas flourish because of his relative inexperience with writing for television series. An example given by the writers was Boam's idea for a full-sized [...] "pirate ship on wheels". The writers quickly realized they needed to scale the idea down to something the production designers could create. They settled on putting a full pirate crew on a stagecoach with cannons. Kern said {{it was better to}} [...] "shoot past the mark, and come back to it, rather than start below it". He elaborated on this, saying, [...] "if you envision the 40-foot galleon and go <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that,</b> you'll always end up with more than if you start out with a pirate on a horse." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Geek Code is {{a series}} of letters and symbols used by {{self-described}} [...] "geeks" [...] to inform fellow geeks about their personality, appearance, interests, skills, and opinions.

Then other geeks can read the geek code and work <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> to discover what the writer looks like, what interests they have, and so forth. This is deemed to be efficient in some sufficiently geeky manner.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{their arrival}} in France, the former prisoners were brought {{together}} to undergo medical examinations. Then {{they were sent}} to different barracks to fill out forms and be interrogated. The authorities sought to assemble proof of ill-treatment, which the prisoners tended to deny {{so as to be}} reunited more quickly with their families. The poor condition of accommodations in France was noted by a number of men, including Charles Gueugnier: [...] "Entering there, the heart tightened; one was caught by an irrepressible disgust. They dared call this Augias pigsty American Park! Really, we were better and more properly housed by our Prussian enemies! Poor mothers, what will they do with your children?

2500|$|The Valkyrie A or Valkyrie I {{took place}} over the summer of 1910 and the {{aircraft}} was first flown in October 1910 at the newly established Hendon Aerodrome, where the ASL had leased three hangars next to those occupied by the Blériot school. [...] Although this aircraft shared the same canard configuration as its predecessor, there were significant alterations. It was powered by a 35hp 4-cyl Green C.4 engine mounted {{in front of the}} leading edge of the wing, driving a 7ft 3 in (2.21 m) pusher propeller directly in front of the centre-section of the wing, the leading edge of which was set <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> of the outer sections. A pair of foreplanes, one fixed and the other moveable, were mounted on a pair of widely spaced wire-braced mahogany side-frames, each having a straight upper boom and a curved lower member. The twin rudders were initially mounted on the kingposts at the rear of these frames, in line with the trailing edge of the wing but after trials were moved aft, each being mounted on two short booms. In addition a small area of the sideframes at the front of the aircraft was given a fabric covering.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the album shifted when Maida traveled to Sudan and Darfur to shoot a documentary with War Child {{in the middle of}} recording. [...] "We were there for a couple of weeks, and we came <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> and went right back into the studio, and it was like: 'God, this song sucks. I’m not saying that anymore.' You start reflecting on lyrics and any message you’re trying to get out there, and it really altered everything again." [...] The band recorded in six-week spurts, traveling between studios in Toronto, Los Angeles and Maui, recording more songs. With no deadline from the record company, they kept recording and gaining more perspective. [...] "We'd get together, write, record, take two weeks off, go back in and we ended up doing that on and off for the last two-and-a-half or three years," [...] By this time, over forty songs were recorded including [...] "Picture", [...] "Don't Ask Why" [...] (Where Are You), [...] "Holy Ghost" [...] (Angels/Losing/Sleep) and [...] "Vampires", which was briefly considered for the album's title. The sessions became strained at times as the band couldn't figure out where the album was going. [...] "We had so many songs," [...] said Taggart, [...] "and we just started to go crazy." [...] Many songs went through multiple incarnations such as [...] "Boy", which caused the band a lot of stress and took over three weeks to break down and re-record. They were also butting heads with their producer. [...] "There were some fucking horrible sessions," [...] Maida admitted.|$|E

All three of the No. 1 Audi drivers felt their turbocharger problem cost them the victory, with Lotterer saying, [...] "When we had the turbo problem we were very disappointed because it's impossible to come <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that.</b> We were a bit unlucky, but at Le Mans {{you never know what}} is going to happen and the team motivated me again - they did a great job." [...] Fässler added the team attempted to pressure Toyota but they were unable to catch the Japanese manufacturer: [...] "But this time everyone had problems. We had to be flat out and have no penalties - it isn't easy to do that when you are pushing." [...] Tréluyer stated that winning Le Mans was [...] "emotional" [...] and praised the engineers strategy. The driver felt their approach was like their 2011 victory: [...] "We concentrated on our own race and took the car through until morning. It was the car which had the least bad luck that won.” Kristensen stated he was not unhappy to finish in second and that while his team would have liked to have had their [...] "little fairy tale" [...] it was still a good result. Di Grassi said it had been [...] "a difficult race" [...] for his team but hoped to return to Le Mans in the future while Gené revealed that did not expect a strong result but that second was [...] "like a fairytale for me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Xavier Thaxton, {{protagonist of}} Count Geiger's Blues: A Comedy (Tor Books, 1992), is {{the fine arts}} editor for a {{newspaper}} in the fictional Southern metropolis of Salonika (a satirical/alternate reality version of contemporary Atlanta) with a particularly low opinion of pop culture. [...] When he is accidentally exposed to illegally dumped nuclear waste, the radiation exposure turns him into a superhero (or, as Bishop has designated, a [...] "stalwart"). Analog reviewer Tom Easton writes about the novel's resolution: [...] "This is where Bishop falters. The satire he has painstakingly [...] created now teeters {{on the brink of}} farce. He quite properly makes the decision to yank it <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>that</b> brink, but then he loses the satire. [...] He becomes heavy-handed and obvious." [...] Faren Miller disagrees: [...] "The most ambitious comic books are no longer merely comic – may even incorporate tragedy in a critique of modern life as savage and acute, in its way, as the ferocious satire of Dante's Inferno. Count Geiger's Blues also goes beyond humor – well beyond, in its remarkable closing chapters. [...] But they build on all that has gone before. In unleashing a startling talent for comedy and a wide-ranging knowledge of pop culture in both its absurdity and its splendor, Michael Bishop has written his best book yet." [...] John Kessel writes [...] "Comedy is certainly a new tone from Bishop, and he demonstrates a talent for it…But it seems to me Bishop doesn't really want to write comedy. It's as if Bishop is running riffs on whatever wacky ideas come to hand, without much plan, holding his characters at arm's length; as if, trying to avoid sententiousness, he has to avoid caring – but in the end can't. The result being a loose, baggy sort of book." ...|$|E
