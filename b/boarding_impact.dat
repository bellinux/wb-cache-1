40|$|The {{following}} study {{presents a}} combined numerical-experimental {{investigation into the}} impact and injury response of long track speed skaters when impacting the protective boarding around the track. The high speeds common within the sport combined with the inherent slipperiness of the ice create a high probability for falls. When falling, racers inevitably impact the safety boarding surrounding the track with a high velocity. Despite the safety measures taken, severe injuries are still occurring. The methods used within this study include an accident analysis study, experimental <b>boarding</b> <b>impact</b> and friction testing, and numerical simulation of both the experimental boarding impacts and recreated human skater impact cases. The method is applied to a modern boarding design, showing skater impact injury sensitivity to impact velocity and angle. Further skater injury response increases were observed when boarding pressure, friction and attachment height were varied. The approach developed here is considered applicable for other boarding designs and a useful approach/tool for establishing safety response requirements as it allows for objective comparison between boardings of a completely different design. © 2008 SAE International...|$|E

In common with post-Cadbury research, we find no significant evidence that board structure variables, including chairman/chief executive officer split and the proportion of non-executive directors on the <b>board,</b> <b>impact</b> significantly on external audit fees. Also, while prior research has shown that the aggregated level of institutional and managerial ownership are negatively associated with audit fees, we find that only one constituent of this variable, namely directors' ownership, has a significant impact...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{advances}} {{the resource}} dependence and social networks literature by investigating a board’s structural social capital {{created as a}} consequence of interlocking directorates. Using approaches and measures developed by social network analysis we compare the interpersonal directorship networks of the top 250 companies in the United States and Australia. We find that the smaller, sparser Australian network is only marginally less compact and connected than the larger US network at the firm level of analysis. However, at the director level of analysis the US network is much larger and more connected than its Australian counterpart. As a result, we argue that scholars studying the resource dependence role of boards should consider using measures of interpersonal links as well as traditional measures of inter-firm links. Understanding how <b>boards</b> <b>impact</b> on corporate performance is a question central to the corporate governance research agenda. Agency theory, for example, argues that the key way a board adds value is by ensuring the interests of the managers of the firm are aligned with the interests of the owners (Eisenhardt 1989; Jensen & Meckling 1976). A quite distinct area of inquiry, however, relates to the role that the board plays in providing access to importan...|$|R
