5|$|Malagasy cuisine {{encompasses}} the many diverse culinary {{traditions of the}} Indian Ocean island of Madagascar. Foods eaten in Madagascar reflect the influence of Southeast Asian, African, Indian, Chinese and European migrants that have settled on the island since it was first populated by seafarers from Borneo between 100 CE and 500 CE. Rice, {{the cornerstone of the}} Malagasy diet, was cultivated alongside tubers and other Southeast Asian staples by these earliest settlers. Their diet was supplemented by foraging and hunting wild game, which contributed to the extinction of the island's bird and mammal megafauna. These food sources were later complemented by <b>beef</b> <b>in</b> the form of zebu introduced into Madagascar by East African migrants arriving around 1,000CE. Trade with Arab and Indian merchants and European transatlantic traders further enriched the island's culinary traditions by introducing a wealth of new fruits, vegetables, and seasonings.|$|E
5|$|Oral history {{attributes}} numerous {{significant and}} lasting {{political and cultural}} innovations to King Ralambo. He is credited with popularizing the consumption of <b>beef</b> <b>in</b> the Kingdom of Imerina and celebrating this discovery {{with the establishment of}} the fandroana New Year's festival which traditionally took place on the day of Ralambo's birth. According to legend, circumcision and polygamy were also introduced under his rule, as was the division of the noble class (andriana) into four sub-castes. Oral history furthermore traces the tradition of royal idols (sampy) in Imerina to the reign of Ralambo, who made heavy use of these supernatural objects to expand his realm and consolidate the divine nature of his sovereignty. Due to the enduring cultural legacy left by this king, Ralambo is often considered a key figure in the development of Merina cultural identity.|$|E

25|$|Beef is {{the culinary}} name for meat from cattle, {{particularly}} skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef {{is a source}} of high-quality protein and essential nutrients. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The meat from older bulls is usually tougher, so it is frequently used for mince (known as ground <b>beef</b> <b>in</b> the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} forest {{to make way}} for cattle {{ranching}} was the leading cause of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon from the mid-1960s. In addition to Vargas's earlier aim for commercial development in the country, the devaluation of the Brazilian real against the dollar had the result of doubling the price of <b>beef</b> <b>in</b> reals and gave ranchers a widespread incentive to increase the size of their cattle ranches and areas under pasture for mass beef production, resulting in large areas of forest removal. Access to clear the forest was facilitated by the land tenure policy in Brazil that meant developers could proceed without restraint and install new cattle ranches which in turn functioned as a qualification for land ownership.|$|E
