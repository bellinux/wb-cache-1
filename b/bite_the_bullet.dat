Upon his return a month later, Mads de facto reduces Jørgen's salary by half. Jørgen seeks help from his brother who is unable to provide any relief. Hans-Christian <b>bites</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> and seeks out Mads to speak for Jørgen. When Daniel gets pneumonia, Mads holds Daniel's teacher, Mr. Andersen, responsible. But Andersen lands on his feet. Kristen and Iben's marriage becomes further strained and Mr. Schwann dies (off-screen).

Keywords: Example-based MT, Corpus-based NLP Introduction The growth rate of theoretical studies of language structure and use stubbornly remains higher than the improvement rate of large-scale applications. It has been repeatedly proved that large-scale realistic NLP applications carry a prohibitive price tag of large-scale, routine acquisition of knowledge about language and about the world, collected in computational grammars, lexicons and domain models. Strategically, {{there are several ways}} of dealing with this problem: ffl <b>biting</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> and going through a massive knowledge acquisition effort, either generalpurpose (e. g., the CYC project, Lenat et al., 1990) or domain-specific (e. g [...] . ...|$|R

It is worth exploring which responses to such objections may be less promising than others.

5000|$|Under this [...] "possible worlds idiom," [...] to {{maintain}} that Bigfoot's existence is possible but not actual, one says, [...] "There is some possible world in which Bigfoot exists; but in the actual world, Bigfoot does not exist". However, {{it is unclear what}} this claim commits us to. Are we really alleging the existence of possible worlds, every bit as real as our actual world, just not actual? Saul Kripke believes that 'possible world' is something of a misnomer - that the term 'possible world' is just a useful way of visualizing the concept of possibility. For him, the sentences [...] "you could have rolled a 4 instead of a 6" [...] and [...] "there is a possible world where you rolled a 4, but you rolled a 6 in the actual world" [...] are not significantly different statements, and neither commit us to the existence of a possible world. David Lewis, on the other hand, made himself notorious by <b>biting</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullet,</b> asserting that all merely possible worlds are as real as our own, and that what distinguishes our world as actual is simply that it is indeed our world - this world. That position is a major tenet of [...] "modal realism". Some philosophers decline to endorse any version of modal realism, considering it ontologically extravagant, and prefer to seek various ways to paraphrase away these ontological commitments. Robert Adams holds that 'possible worlds' are better thought of as 'world-stories', or consistent sets of propositions. Thus, it is possible that you rolled a 4 if such a state of affairs can be described coherently.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{suggestion}} {{they put}} forward was {{to introduce a}} new drill, in which the cartridge was not <b>bitten</b> with <b>the</b> teeth but torn open with the hand. The sepoys rejected this, pointing out that they might very well forget and <b>bite</b> <b>the</b> cartridge, not surprising given the extensive drilling that allowed 19th century British and Indian troops to fire three to four rounds per minute. British and Indian military drills of the time required soldiers to <b>bite</b> off <b>the</b> end of the Beeswax paper cartridge, pour the gunpowder contained within down the barrel, stuff the remaining paper cartridge into the barrel, ram the paper cartridge (which included the ball wrapped and tied in place) down the barrel, remove the ram-rod, return the ram-rod, bring the rifle to the ready, set the sights, add a percussion cap, present the rifle, and fire. The musketry books also recommended that, [...] "Whenever the grease around <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> appears to be melted away, or otherwise removed from the cartridge, the sides of <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> should be wetted in the mouth before putting it into the barrel; the saliva will serve the purpose of grease for the time being" [...] This meant that biting a musket cartridge was second nature to the Sepoys, {{some of whom had}} decades of service in the Company's army, and who had been doing musket drill for every day of their service. The first sepoy who rebelled by aiming his loaded weapon at a British officer was Mangal Pandey who was later executed.|$|R
