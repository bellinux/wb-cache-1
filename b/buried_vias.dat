The transition from the original solder filled holes to BGA wiring vias, subcomposite <b>buried</b> <b>vias,</b> and today’s microvias has resulted in many new failure mechanisms, not only in the copper interconnections but also in the surrounding laminate, especially with Pb free reflows. This presentation surveys the most significant via and via-related laminate failure mechanisms from past to present using data from current induced thermal cycling (CITC) testing, failure analysis, and other sources. The relative life and failure modes of thru vias, <b>buried</b> <b>vias,</b> and microvias (stacked vs. non-stacked) are compared, along with the affect of structure, materials, and peak temperatures on the above. The origin of via-induced laminate failures such as “eyebrow cracks ” and Pb free related internal delamination is also explored. Video clips of laminate coupons during Pb free reflows are shown, including examples of failure mechanisms as they occur, to vividly illustrate the challenges involved and to help reveal the root causes. Finally, an extrapolation to future technology trends for laminate substrates is attempted to address the question—what might be the failure modes of tomorrow, and will via/laminate reliability be better or worse...|$|E

40|$|Trend towards {{downsizing}} {{the product}} size {{and at the}} same time to bring more functionality in electronic products, demands electrically interconnecting several miniaturized electronic components with high counts of I (Input/Out put) on smaller and smaller size printed wiring boards [PWB]. These miniature components occupy lower foot print area but require higher routing interconnection densities. However, the conventional multilayer board technologies exhibit limitations when there is need to connect very high IØ components such as ball grid arrays, which require blind and buried interconnections within the multilayer mono-block. This limitation has given raise to newer methods of multi layer construction. Build–up multilayer PWB is now the technology of choice for enhanced routing capability including blind and buried interlayer connections. Build up methods are based on making very small vias within dielectric layers followed by metalisation. Typically blind and <b>buried</b> <b>vias</b> are very small, and hence called “micro vias” connecting the layers selectively within the multilayer mono-block. <b>Buried</b> <b>vias</b> make the interconnection between the consecutive layers, and blind vias connect the surface layers to any one of the interior layers in the build up multilayer board. If the blind vias are filled with a dielectric, the entire top and bottom surface area becomes available for high -density component mounting. The crux in build up board technologies is the method of creating micro-holes; a micro hole is a hole, which is less than 150 micro meter in diameter. Efforts are made to replace existing metalising techniques with “paste filling” methodologies, which would result in “SOLID CONDUCTING VIAS” CALLED AS “MICRO -INTERCONNECTS” The work reported in this thesis aims at demonstrating one such innovative ‘solid conducting via’ formation without using any of the known micro-hole formation techniques. Based on the results obtained some useful conclusions have been drawn which will perhaps go a long way in the name of “PRINTED PILLAR TECHNOLOGY” a novel methodology for building multilayer suitable for very high IØ components such as “ball grid arrays. ...|$|E
40|$|As die {{sizes are}} shrinking, and circuit {{complexities}} are increasing, the PCB routing problem {{becomes more and}} more challenging. Traditional routing algorithms can not handle these challenges effectively, and many high end designs in the industry require manual routing efforts. In this paper, we propose novel routing algorithms that can handle these new challenges effectively. The first algorithm we propose is a Lagrangian relaxation based length matching algorithm for routing high-speed bus structures. Then, we focus on a more restricted yet common problem: routing highspeed bus structures between two components across a channel. For this problem, we propose an algorithm to route nets on x-y layer pairs. However, for some board designs, <b>buried</b> <b>vias</b> are forbidden due to high manufacturing costs. For these types of designs, we propose a routing algorithm that can route nets within tight minimum and maximum length bounds on a single layer. After that, we propose an escape routing and layer assignment algorithm that finds the routing solution within multiple components simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Design and {{manufacturing}} techniques of {{printed circuit boards}} (PCB's) have advanced from early one or two-layer structures to the multilayer boards where ten or more layers are no longer uncommon. These give additional routing space, potential decrease in device size and various design possibilities like solid ground and power planes. Unfortunately multilayer boards are vulnerable to high coupling between signal vias especially due to PCB resonances. In this study via crosscoupling is investigated on multilayer PCB's. Special attention {{is given to the}} coupling due to resonances and vertically aligned blind vias. Problem is approached from the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) point of view and high accuracy of measurements or models is not the objective. Instead ways to increase isolation are considered important. EMC is considered to include internal functionality of the device. Analytical methods are used to calculate resonant frequencies, fields and quality factors for simple rectangular structures. The PCB cavity is reduced to two-dimensions for numerical calculation of same quantities. Aplac finite-difference time-domain simulator is used to model coupling due to PCB resonances. Isolation between vertically aligned blind vias is estimated analytically. A quasi-static numerical model is used to study a coaxial via structure. Multilayer test boards are constructed for measurement purposes. Simplified resonator structures on two-layer boards are used to test different methods to increase isolation. Measurements show that high coupling between vias may occur due to PCB resonances. This leads to the situation, where previously used isolation methods between vias are not necessarily effective enough. Several means to reduce effects of PCB resonances are described in this study. Measured and modelled results agree well from an EMC point of view. Coupling due to vertically aligned blind vias is also shown to be high. A simple capacitance model may be used to approximate this up to frequencies where the dynamic wave nature of the board starts to be important. From a PCB designer's point of view these results mean that when the board size is not small compared to the wavelength, there is a possibility of resonances and reduction methods have to be taken into account. Also placement of the vias have to be carefully selected especially if blind or <b>buried</b> <b>vias</b> are used...|$|E

40|$|In many power {{electronic}} applications galvanic isolated IGBT/MOSFET drivers are advantageously used. The main reasons are safety issues, driving high voltage power semiconductors with blocking voltages of typically 600 V or above and avoiding or minimizing unwanted ground current loops. The last can disturb the driver or the whole {{power electronic}} system. In this paper a new method for achieving galvanic isolation in high voltage drivers based on {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) integrated capacitive coupling elements will be described. The suggested coupling element consists {{of a pair of}} plate capacitors by using copper layers and prepregs of a PCB. First, the influence of the isolation barrier coupling capacitance, {{which is one of the}} main important parameters of a galvanic isolated d river, is illustrated by a simple model of the capacitive current loop. As a result it is stated that the coupling capacitance should be lower than 5 pF to achieve high dU/dt levels of at least 100 kV/μs with the modeled driver circuit. Hereby and taking into account the isolation characteristics of the commonly used FR 4 PCB material, an integrated capacitive coupling element is designed. With 360 μm isolation distance, and a plate surface of approximately 8 mm², a capacitance of about 1 pF is achieved. A comparison of the developed capacitive coupling element with a comparable inductive coupling element (transformer) shows that the former has advantages due to a much lower current consumption and less dependency on parasitic inductancies. Therefore using galvanic isolat ed drivers in system integrated power electronics means achieving very small solutions. On the other side high isolation voltages on PCBs require wide creepage and clearance distances, especially at higher humidity levels. For solving this conflict a special layout is suggested, were the both sides behind the isolation barrier of the driver are placed on different sides on the PCB by using blind and <b>buried</b> <b>vias.</b> In addition a method for transmitting the switching signal over the isolation barrier is suggested. The well known Manchester coding is applied to use the advantages of phase modulated signals. Reducing the complexity for decoding the switching signal, it is suggested to transmit the carrier frequency by a second capacitive coupling element. Hereby, coder as well as decode r could be realized by a simple exclusive logic or gate. To verify the new isolation method a half bridge driver was built up. With that a bidirectional buck-boost DC/DC converter, operating at a DC link voltage of 300 V, was successfully controlled. Moreover measurements with a standardized burst generator show, that failure free operation of the driver are possible up to high dU/dt levels...|$|E
