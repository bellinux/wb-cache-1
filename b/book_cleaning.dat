30|$|Developed {{for this}} study, this {{instrument}} records children’s hits associating objects with corresponding actions {{by means of}} pictures drawn on paper cards. An example of a record consists of an object (e.g., a ball) and an action (e.g., playing ball), with a space in front to assign a hit or miss in the association of the object with the action. The paper cards are composed of 10 pairs of pictures of objects and actions related to daily activities. The pictures of the objects used are a toothbrush, a plate of food, a bed, soap, a shirt, a tissue, a book, a ball, a glass of water, and pencils. The pictures used as ADL actions consist of a child doing the following: brushing his/her teeth, eating, waking up, bathing, putting on a shirt, blowing his/her nose, reading a <b>book,</b> <b>cleaning</b> his/her ears, playing ball, drinking water, and drawing. The paper pictures were made based on the drawings from the picture communication symbols (PCS), a procedure also adopted in the illustrations of the digital game to maintain card standardization.|$|E

5000|$|A live-action black janitor, {{played by}} Oscar Polk, {{best known for}} his {{portrayal}} as the servant [...] "Pork" [...] in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind, studies hypnotism from a <b>book</b> while <b>cleaning</b> Max Fleischer's desk at the Fleischer studio. He manages to conjure Max's pen into drawing Betty Boop. In a sequence of animation mixed with live-action, he uses his new powers to control the white animated Boop. She in turn is able to control a small dog. After waking from the spell, Betty manages to work a few more spells. Fraught with racial innuendo, one of her tricks includes turning the black man white for a split-second, after which he begins cleaning in overdrive. Before that, he was sleeping on his broom and sweeping dirt under the carpet. At the end, Betty Boop leaps into a bottle of black ink.|$|R
5000|$|Corporal Albright (Charlie Weber), a go-getter Marine who {{aspires to}} be a hero, is a newly {{graduated}} Marine who is first stationed at a United States Embassy in a Middle Eastern territory {{referred to as}} [...] "The Kingdom."

When Albright first arrives he meets several other Marines including Hansen, Ski, Lopez, Stamper, Sunshine in addition to their superior Sergeant Gunny Raines (Scott Adkins), all of which seem fairly laid back. Albright is then directed to meet the Ambassador and his staff, where he meets Kraus, head of Security, and Olivia Winston, digital security director.

"A Host of Furious Fancies" [...] - A doctor {{looks into}} the curious case {{of a young girl}} who became {{orphaned}} after her father inexplicably killed himself several years after her mother died.

Despite the fact that she inherited millions from her parents, she treats herself as a servant, allowing herself to become malnourished. It is suspected by the doctor that before his death, the girl's father had engaged in an incestuous relationship with her, and to cope with the trauma she is playing out the fairytale of Cinderella.|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} the generation gap {{as regards the}} transmission of knowhow concerning the maintenance and cleaning of garments and accessories, especially traditional Japanese kimonos, and reformed kimonos. As in modern day-to-day family life, parent and child {{do not seem to}} lose much time on the subject, we concentrated on the transmission of knowhow through the channel of literary sources, i. e. books and magazines. During the years 1954 - 2005, we picked up 35 books at random and examined the number of pages dedicated to the cleaning and maintenance of kimonos. We found out that the percentage of these pages compared to the total number of pages in <b>books</b> concerning <b>cleaning</b> arrived at a mere 2, 8 %; even including instructions how to fold and store the kimono only 4, 6 %. Around 2002, we perceived a dramatic change in the younger generation's perception of the kimono as a fashionable item, as opposed to the cooler, detached reception of the older generation. The instructions of the 1950 's explaining how to unsew a kimono disappear; and instead appear around 2000 helpful advice how to avoid soiling a kimono in the first place, and then to bring soiled kimonos to a kimono laundry, if unsure...|$|R

Some head shops also sell items used for home cultivation of marijuana plants, such as hydroponic equipment and lights and guidebooks on cultivation. Since the 2000s, some head shops also sell e-cigarettes and the flavoured liquids used with these devices.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{responds to}} the question, “what constitutes an environmentally friendly textile?” Written {{from the point of}} view of a practicing textile designer, it has a particular focus on textile recycling and reuse. The study identifies key contemporary environmental design strategies, and appropriates them for use in textile and fashion design. Interviews were conducted with recycling companies, an industrial spinner, and an Indian sustainable textile company. An electronic questionnaire survey was also conducted via a website. The study presents a wide range of inspirational and successful small textile and fashion design businesses, working with various aspects of recycling. These case studies collectively offer valuable insights into how design and creativity can be used to promote more effective textile recycling and reuse. A selected “eco-textile glossary” is included to aid understanding of the jargon, technical terms and scientific concepts relevant to this contemporary investigation of ecological textiles. A short version of the glossary appears as an appendice explaining words which appear in purple throughout the text. This glossary is available in full online as a “wiki” resource, where it may be updated by expert contributors, to become a dynamic, evolving resource of value for students, researchers and practitioners in the field. Recommendations for further work: New business possibilities are made evident, which will develop new markets, not only for designing and making textiles and garments, but also the systems through which textile products sold, traded, swapped, customised, mended, upgraded, hired, used, shared, disposed of, re-envisioned. Development of new products and processing within the waste stream will add value and make reuse and recycling increasingly economically viable. The imminent development of a labelling system, although complex, is necessary to empower customers so that market forces will make a systematic change possible. My further academic work will identify, develop, support, and encourage the development of creative freedom within environmentally friendly textiles. I will continue my creative practise, and continue to source and supply ecological yarns, <b>books</b> and <b>cleaning</b> materials, through my shop...|$|R
40|$|A School Library is a {{valuable}} space, especially useful {{for the development of}} curricula and for developing learning abilities, as well as learning strategies that cannot be achieved elsewhere in the School Center. Only rarely in schools does the Library fulfil its potential function; generally it does not form a part of the cultural or school life of the institution. When a School Library exists, it often ends up in greater or smaller measure by being a wasted space. This situation is not improved by having a teacher who will open the door only occasionally, to supervise the loan of <b>books</b> or for <b>cleaning</b> the <b>books</b> in the bookcases! A fundamental change is required {{on the part of the}} teachers. They need to understand that a library should play a central role in the life of the school: 1. Transformation in the methods involved in the intellectual work necessary for integrating the library space in a systematic way with the development of the daily classes 2. Awareness in the whole educational community - students, parents and teachers – that the library should form an intrinsic component of the work of the school, interacting with the different curricular activities in a dynamic way. 3. It would be important to arrange a training project for the teachers in the school, which would be committed to educational reform and which would take place communally with the specific objective of integrating the library into the academic life. Such an initiative was introduced, over a period of two years, in the Public College Saavedra Fajardo in Algezares, Murcia, with the support of the directive and participation of the educational body. It resulted in rejuvenation of the forgotten library and it carried the flag for a renewed protagonis...|$|R
