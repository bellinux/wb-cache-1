40|$|Although {{bottom-up}} forcing and overfishing {{are known}} to induce shifts in ecosystem states, system changes and their reversibility under each factor are still poorly understood. In this paper, dynamic food web simulations are conducted to evaluate when and why ecological thresholds may be exceeded, and whether bottom-up forcing or fishing {{is more likely to}} induce irreversible ecosystem states. Simulations are conducted using a calibrated food web model of the upwelling system off central Chile (33 - 39 degrees S) and the Ecopath with Ecosim software version 5. 1. The effects of fishing scenarios are explored by changing fishing mortality according to trophic level. The effects of bottom-up forcing scenarios are explored by changing phytoplankton biomass, as a function of sea temperature, at El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and decadal scales. Simulations are carried out for 150 years and impacts, system recovery and regime shifts from each scenario are evaluated using trophodynamic indicators and <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> for <b>biomass</b> of functional groups as proxies of food web state and ecological thresholds, respectively. Proportionally distributed fishing along trophic levels is the least harmful fishing scenario, resulting in <b>biomass</b> <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> rarely being exceeded and high system recovery. Concentrating fishing at higher and lower trophic levels more likely causes <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> to be exceeded and induces ecosystem changes with low-to-medium recovery potential. No <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are exceeded (or regime shift induced) under ENSO-scale bottom-up forcing. Decadal scale bottom-up forcing has different effects on the system depending on the sequence in which the high and low phytoplankton biomass periods are simulated. A shift from low phytoplankton biomass towards high phytoplankton biomass does not result in <b>biomass</b> <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> being exceeded, whereas the opposite sequence results in a large number of <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> being exceeded with medium recovery. The interplay between fishing and decadal scale bottom-up forcing indicates that bottom-up forcing can dampen the effects of fishing, whereas fishing increases the number of <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> exceeded and decreases the recovery observed under decadal scale bottom-up forcing. Results suggest that fishing (especially unsustainable strategies) is more likely to cause ecological thresholds to be exceeded and to induce regime shifts of low recovery than decadal scale bottom-up forcing. We consider these results of relevance for the management of fisheries in their ecosystem context...|$|R

40|$|The {{decline of}} the Eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) stock from highest to lowest stock levels on record {{throughout}} the 1980 s and early 1990 s {{was caused by a}} combination of recruitment failure and increasing fishing pressure at declining stock sizes. The processes driving the reproductive success are largely understood, but the consequences of these changes for fisheries management are far less evident. This includes doubts about the adequacy of the biological <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> presently used to advise on the stock status, and the need of their revision given that environmental changes have affected stock productivity. Long-term projections suggest that under adverse environmental conditions for reproduction, harvesting at fishing mortality determined as precautionary may not lead to a recovery of the stock to a biomass level considered precautionary. Thus, a revision of either the limit fishing mortality or the <b>limit</b> <b>biomass</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> is indicated.

However, vessel catch rates are predicted fall and economic conditions worsen, which is of particular concern for those smaller-scale fleets within Pacific island countries and territories that rely on this stock for income and employment. We examine candidate target <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> that might achieve wider management objectives integrating across multiple plausible states of nature using a deterministic bio-economic model, and potential implications of those targets for the stock and fisheries through stochastic stock projections. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY), the ‘default’ <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> within the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, implied a relatively low stock size {{and more than a}} 1 -in- 3 chance of the stock falling below the <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point.</b> Minimum target levels, defined by the permissible level of risk (5 – 20 %) of falling below the <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point,</b> implied larger stock sizes than at MSY, but a halving in longline catch rates that would lead to increased social and economic hardship. These results suggest that economic, rather than biological, requirements will provide the standards for an albacore target <b>reference</b> <b>point.</b> However, achieving maximum economic yield (MEY) implied severe reductions in effort, likely incompatible with objectives for employment within the local fishery sector or the level of vessel licensing revenue.

The U.

40|$|Abstract. A {{management}} strategy evaluation (MSE) framework is developed to evaluate strategies that provide {{total allowable catches}} (TACs) when the target biomass corresponds to maximum economic yield (MEY). The framework is applied to Australia’s Northern Prawn Fishery (NPF), which has been actively managed using a tradable input-control system, but is to move to output controls based on individual transferable quotas (ITQs), with a consequence that the current {{management strategy}} needs to be replaced. Because the fleet is small, {{it is possible to}} set a TAC that cannot be taken entirely. Whereas input controls tend to self-adjust if recruitment is not accurately predicted, and consequently catch variability tends to be low, {{this is not the case}} for the reasonably variable species caught in the NPF when they are managed using TACs. The management strategy recovered the simulated stock to the target <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> when it was initially depleted, and avoided dropping the stock below the <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> (LRP) for five scenarios based on the current best understanding of resource status; however, in some cases, the stock was left above the target biomass because of biases in the assessment. A scenario in which the stock was forced to be initially depleted to below the <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> showed that the management strategy allows recovery...|$|R
50|$|The {{ecosystem}} approach to fishing is encapsulated in Article II of the CAMLR Convention. The {{ecosystem approach}} utilizes decision rules based on both population status targets and on <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> and incorporates uncertainty and ecosystem {{status in the}} calculation of these targets. Different <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> {{to account for the}} needs of dependent predators in the ecosystem are used depending on the location of the species in the food web. The ecosystem fisheries management approach by CCAMLR involves use of move-on rules to protect trophic interactions, and limit direct effects of fishing on fish bycatch, seabirds and Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). There are annually reviewed mitigation measures such as line weighting and streamer lines to minimize seabird bycatch which have resulted in a substantial reduction in accidental seabird mortalities in the CAMLR Convention Area. The 50% (target) and 20% (<b>limit)</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> used by the CCAMLR decision rules exceed the requirements for target and <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> set by almost all national and international fisheries management organizations, even for species longer lived than toothfish. A wide study of many fisheries generally indicated that most reach maximum sustainable yield at 30-35% of their pre-exploitation abundances. CCAMLR uses a more conservative reference level to allow exploitation at a level where toothfish recruitment and the ecosystem in general is not appreciably impacted. This is required by Article II of the CAMLR Convention. A common misunderstanding of the CCAMLR decision rules is an assumption that the decline in population size will follow a clear trajectory from the starting year to a point 35 years later when the stock size will reach 50% of pre-exploitation levels and an assumption that there is no feedback during each assessment. The catch limit however is re-calculated based on all updated or revised data at each annual or biennual assessment. This approach is used to ensure that the 50% level will be approached slowly and enables an ongoing readjustment of catch levels as knowledge improves.|$|R
40|$|Size-based {{community}} and ecosystem metrics, such as mean body mass and {{the slopes of}} size spectra, have been proposed as indicators to support the Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). These metrics show relatively consistent responses to size-selective exploitation, and " unexploited" indicator <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> may be predicted with models of size-structured foodwebs. Whereas unexploited <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> provide a baseline for assessing the relative magnitude of fishing impacts, target or <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are needed to guide management. Values for target or <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are difficult to justify on scientific grounds. However, given that fishing impacts in most ecosystems need to be reduced {{to meet the objectives}} of the EAFM, we argue that reference directions provide alternative medium-term management targets. We show that the power of surveys to detect trends consistent with reference directions depends on the range of body size classes included in the analysis. Selection of different size ranges will weight metrics to respond to the release of small fish from predation, the depletion of larger individuals as a consequence of exploitation, or both. Such weightings may not be consistent over time, because the differential vulnerability of larger species, within-population changes, predator-prey relationships, and the effects of competition depend on contemporary rates of fishing mortality and the history of exploitation. The power of the surveys investigated is poor on time scales of less than 5 - 10 years. Therefore, size-based indicators provide better support for medium-term, rather than year-on-year, management decision making...|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{evolution}} of the precautionary approach in a Canadian context over the decade following major collapses of a number of cod stocks. The collapses of these cod stocks in the late- 1980 s and early- 1990 s precipitated evaluations of alternative scientific and fisheries management approaches. Over the 10 years following the collapses, Canada has been engaged in a process of developing a precautionary framework that is consistent with UNFA. This framework adopts a notion of “serious harm ” as the definition of a conservation <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point.</b> Several approaches for defining conservation limits consistent with serious harm have been applied to three Canadian cod stocks of concern and used in the provision of scientific advice in the most recent assessments.

40|$|I {{examined}} how the fitness (r) associated with early- and late-maturing genotypes varies with fishing mortality (F) and age-/size-specific probability of capture. Life-history data on Newfoundland's northern Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) {{allowed for the}} estimation of r for individuals maturing at 4 and 7 year {{in the absence of}} fishing. Catch selectivity data associated with four types of fishing gear (trap, gillnet, handline, otter trawl) were then incorporated to examine how r varied with gear type and with F. The resulting fitness functions were then used to estimate the F above which selection would favour early (4 year) rather than delayed (7 year) maturity. This evolutionarily-sensitive threshold, Fevol, identifies a <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> somewhat similar to those used to define overfishing (e. g., Fmsy, F 0. 1). Over-exploitation of northern cod resulted in fishing mortalities considerably greater than those required to effect evolutionary change. Selection for early maturity is reduced by the dome-shaped selectivities characteristic of fixed gears such as handlines (the greater the leptokurtosis, the lower the probability of a selection response) and enhanced by the knife-edged selectivities of bottom trawls. Strategies to minimize genetic change are consistent with traditional management objectives (e. g., yield maximization, population increase). Compliance with harvest control rules guided by evolutionarily-sensitive <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points,</b> which may be achieved by adherence to traditional <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> such as Fmsy and F 0. 1, should be sufficient to minimize the probability of fisheries-induced evolution for commercially exploited species...|$|R

Dynamics based on TEP are different from those based on SSB for cod and plaice, but the stock–recruit relationships were not ‘improved’ using TEP. Shifts in productivity (spawner per recruit) occur in all three time series and SSB underestimated uncertainty. Yet again, it was shown that assumptions of stationarity about fish population productivity are incorrect. We argue that the use of TEP does improve the realism in our understanding of stock dynamics, and demographically, more complex management strategy evaluation is required to develop management procedures that are robust to uncertainty and integrate F and the demographic health of a stock.

A Fcurr/Fmsy ratio greater than one indicates that overfishing is occurring. When SSBcurr/SSBmsy is greater than one, the MSY will be produced, but if it is less than one it means that the stock is overfished. MFMT and MSST are used as <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points.</b> When MFMT is exceeded or the spawning stock size dips below MSST the fishery is shut down. A benchmark that is currently gaining in popularity is SPR, spawning potential ratio. The SPR is the average fecundity of a recruit over its lifetime when the stock is fished divided by the average fecundity of a recruit over its lifetime when the stock is unfished. The SPR is based on the principle that certain levels of fish have to survive in order to spawn and replenish the stock at a sustainable level.|$|R
40|$|In 2011 Fisheries Commission Working Group of Fishery Managers and Scientists on Conservation Plans and Rebuilding Strategies (WGFMS-CPRS) {{reviewed}} the cod 3 NO Conservation Plan and Rebuilding Strategy (CPRS) and proposed {{a new one}} that {{was approved by the}} Fisheries Commission in 2011. The new <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> values approved for the 3 NO cod CPRS were the following: Blim = 60, 000 t, Bisr = 120, 000 t, Flim = 0. 30 and Bmsy = 248, 000 t. Concerns were raised on the high uncertainty and the lack of confidence intervals of the <b>reference</b> <b>points.</b> The WGFMS-CPRS agreed that the values of Bisr and Bmsy should be further reviewed by the Scientific Council and the Fisheries Commission. In 2012, Scientific Council noted that: the approach used in estimation of the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> may not be advisable in the case of Div. 3 NO cod due to the high uncertainty in the stock-recruit relationship for this stock. Scientific Council recommends the use of proxies based on the yield per recruit (YPR) and spawner per recruit (SPR) to estimate the <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> for cod in Div. 3 NO. The proxies for the <b>limit</b> <b>references</b> <b>points</b> estimated through YPR were very similar to the <b>Limited</b> <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> approved. However, the Bmsy estimated based on the YPR was different to the Bmsy estimated last year. The aim of this document is to revise the values for the Bmsy <b>references</b> <b>points</b> based on the YPR-SPR. This document presents new Bmsy <b>references</b> <b>points</b> based on the YPR-SPR taking in account same ideas expressed during the 2012 SC meeting. It could be proposed a value around F 0. 1 (0. 19) or F 35 % (0. 20) as a possible Ftarget. The reason to choose this value is that a small reduction in the YPR supposes a precautionary level of F that has a very low probability to be higher than Flim = Fmax (less than 5 %) and it is similar to SPR F 35 %. A good candidate for Btarget based on the YPR estimation could be the equilibrium SSB estimated with all the recruitments produced by the SSB bigger than Blim. A good Btarget level could be the equilibrium SSB of the proposed Ftarget (F 0. 1 or F 35 %) estimated with all the recruitments produced by the SSB bigger than Blim. This gives a value around 180, 000 - 185, 000 tons. In the cod 3 NO case, and taking a similar definition for Bisr as the ICES MSYBtrigger, a Bisr candidate could be a value around 120, 000 ton if we take a very low probability (less than 5 %) or 135, 000 ton if we take a low probability (less 10 %). These values came from biomass point which is expected with a low probability in a fully productive stock which is fished at Ftarget proposed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} through simulation {{management strategy}} that stabilise catch levels by setting bounds on the inter-annual variability in Total Allowable Catches (TACs). An integrated modelling approach was used, which modelled both the ‘real’ and observed {{systems and the}} interactions between all system components. The modelling framework therefore allowed evaluation of the robustness of candidate management strategies to both the intrinsic properties of the systems, {{and the ability to}} observe, monitor, assess and control them. Strategies were evaluated in terms of level of risk (measured as the probability of spawning stock biomass falling below the <b>biomass</b> <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> level for the stock) and cumulative yield. The simulation approach used provides a powerful tool for the examination of the performance of candidate management strategies. It has shown that better management is not necessarily going to be achieved by improving the assessement, since even with a perfect assessment (where the simulated working group knew stock status perfectly) stocks may crash at fishing levels that standard stochastic projections would suggest were safe. Also explicitly modelling the assessment process can result in quite different outcomes than those predicted by the simple projection traditionally used by stock assessment working groups. This is because the simple projection assumes that the status of the stock in the current year is known without error and that the target fishing mortality can be achieved without error. However, in practice the assessment is based on last years data and the effect of any management measure on SSB is only manifest, following the implementation of the quota, {{at the end of the}} following year. The choice of target and fishing mortality levels and minimum stock levels results from ICES interpretation of the precautionary approach. This lead to the definition of fishing mortality and biomass <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> that are intended to prevent over-fishing and to trigger recovery plans when a stock is overfished respectively. Although, fishing mortality and biomass <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> were originally intended to be independent, a fishing mortality level implies a corresponding biomass level. In the case of saithe a fishing mortality of 0. 40 (i. e. the FPA level) would drive the stock to Blim, suggesting that the choice of biomass and target <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> are not consistent for this stock...|$|R
40|$|Elements of the precautionary {{approach}} to fishery management are commonly {{implemented in the}} form of harvest control rules, with limit, threshold and target <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> for stock size and fishing mortality. However, a review of two large advisory and management systems indicates that many stock assessments are not sufficiently informative to support such control rules. After a nearly a decade of applying such control rules, a large portion of management units in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) convention and marine fisheries under United States jurisdiction still have uncertain status, because many management units lack a complete suite of fishing mortality and biomass estimates and associated <b>reference</b> <b>points.</b> For those fishery resources with analytical stock assessments and <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> estimates, fishing mortality has generally been reduced to within prescribed limits. The number of stocks in the ICES area with excessive fishing mortality (i. e., greater than the <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point)</b> decreased since 1997, but the number of stocks in need of rebuilding increased as a result of excessive fishing or revised <b>reference</b> <b>points.</b> The number of U. S. stocks with excessive fishing decreased and the number of stocks needing rebuilding decreased as a result of stock recovery, revised <b>reference</b> <b>points,</b> or redefined management units. The number of U. S. stocks with uncertain or undefined status substantially decreased. The large portion of stocks with uncertain status in both systems illustrates that such precautionary control rules are applied only to data-rich stock assessments, and are not being applied to management of fishery resources with the most uncertain stock assessments...|$|R
40|$|Recent policy {{commitments}} aim {{to reduce}} biodiversity loss and integrate environmental concerns into fisheries management. However, {{there are few}} operational indicators for reporting biodiversity trends and judging progress in relation to management objectives. Here we develop a threat indicator based on the population status of a suite of 23 North Sea fishes from 1982 to 2001 estimated using World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List decline criteria. The composite indicator was calculated from the weighted average of the threat scores of individual species in each year and varies from 0 to 3, where a score of 3 is equivalent to each species qualifying as "critically endangered". The proportion of threatened fishes, their degree of threat, and the composite indicator value increased steadily over time. The composite indicator value has been > 1 since the late 1990 s, equivalent to all species meeting the "vulnerable" criterion. A suitable reference trajectory, consistent with the World Summit on Sustainable Development commitment to "achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of {{the current rate of}} biodiversity loss" would be a significant reduction in the rate of increase in this indicator before 2010, a <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> could be 1 (all species vulnerable) and a target <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> could be 0 (no threatened species) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{indicator}} {{is presented}} to assess and monitor the good environmental status of national marine waters based {{on the status of}} commercially exploited marine fishes and invertebrates, including fully-assessed as well as data-limited stocks. The overall-indicator consists of one number per year. It summarizes the following sub-indicators: the stock size relative to the size that can produce the maximum sustainable fishing yield; the mortality caused by fishing relative to the natural rate of mortality; the mean length in the catch relative to the length where 90 % of the females reach sexual maturity; and the abundance in national waters relative to mean abundance in the time series. For the example of German marine waters, the overall-indicator shows that only 3 of 19 stocks (Baltic Sea dab, North Sea plaice and North Sea sprat) were above the <b>limit</b> <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> for the overall indicator in 2011. North Sea herring was close to reaching the threshold, but most other stocks were still far below. Apparently fishing mortality was too high to allow recovery of more stocks to levels capable of producing the maximum sustainable yield. The chosen indicators and <b>reference</b> <b>points</b> may prove useful to other scientists tasked with assessing the environmental status of their national waters...|$|R
