Likewise, carboxylic acids are converted into amides, but this conversion typically does not occur by direct reaction of the carboxylic acid and the amine. Instead esters are typical precursors to amides. The conversion of amino acids into peptides is a major <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> that requires ATP.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} {{function of}} the TCR complex is to identify specific bound antigen and elicit a distinct and critical response. The signal transduction mechanism by which a T cell elicits this response upon contact with its unique antigen is termed T-cell activation (just as phototransduction is the term given to the signal transduction event by which photoreceptors elicits vision upon exposure to photons). There are myriad molecules involved in the complex <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> (called trans-membrane signaling) by which T-cell activation occurs.|$|E
25|$|High-throughput {{screening}} (HTS) is {{a method}} for scientific experimentation especially used in drug discovery and relevant to the fields of biology and chemistry. Using robotics, data processing/control software, liquid handling devices, and sensitive detectors, high-throughput screening allows a researcher to quickly conduct millions of chemical, genetic, or pharmacological tests. Through this process one can rapidly identify active compounds, antibodies, or genes that modulate a particular biomolecular pathway. The results of these experiments provide starting points for drug design and for understanding the interaction or role of a particular <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> in biology.|$|E
25|$|The exact <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> {{by which}} trans fats produce {{specific}} health problems are {{a topic of}} continuing research. One {{theory is that the}} human lipase enzyme works only on the cis configuration and cannot metabolize a trans fat although this theory has been overturned by the recognition that trans fat is metabolized but competitively inhibits the metabolism of other fatty acids. Intake of dietary trans fat perturbs the body's ability to metabolize essential fatty acids (EFAs including Omega 3) leading to changes in the phospholipid fatty acid composition in the aorta, the main artery of the heart, thereby increasing risk of coronary artery disease.|$|E

25|$|Carbon suboxide, C3O2, can be {{produced}} in small amounts in any <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> that normally produces carbon monoxide, CO, for example, during heme oxidation by heme oxygenase-1. It can also be formed from malonic acid. It {{has been shown that}} carbon suboxide in an organism can quickly polymerize into macrocyclic polycarbon structures with the common formula (C3O2)n (mostly (C3O2)6 and (C3O2)8), and that those macrocyclic compounds are potent inhibitors of Na+/K+-ATP-ase and Ca-dependent ATP-ase, and have digoxin-like physiological properties and natriuretic and antihypertensive actions. Those macrocyclic carbon suboxide polymer compounds are thought to be endogenous digoxin-like regulators of Na+/K+-ATP-ases and Ca-dependent ATP-ases, and endogenous natriuretics and antihypertensives. Other than that, some authors think also that those macrocyclic compounds of carbon suboxide can possibly diminish free radical formation and oxidative stress and play a role in endogenous anticancer protective mechanisms, for example in the retina.|$|E

2500|$|During fermentation, {{there are}} several factors that winemakers take into consideration, with the most {{influential}} to ethanol production being sugar content in the must, the yeast strain used, and the fermentation temperature. The <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> of fermentation itself creates a lot of residual heat which can take the [...] must out of the ideal temperature range for the wine. Typically, white wine is fermented between 18-20°C (64-68°F) [...] though a wine maker may choose to use a higher temperature to bring {{out some of the}} complexity of the wine. Red wine is typically fermented at higher temperatures up to 29°C (85°F). Fermentation at higher temperatures may have adverse effect on the wine in stunning the yeast to inactivity and even [...] "boiling off" [...] some of the flavors of the wines. Some winemakers may ferment their red wines at cooler temperatures, more typical of white wines, in order to bring out more fruit flavors.|$|E

2500|$|At its {{broadest}} definition, biochemistry {{can be seen}} as a {{study of}} the components, and composition of living things and how they come together to become life, and the history of biochemistry may therefore go back as far as the ancient Greeks. However, biochemistry as a specific scientific discipline has its beginning sometime in the 19th century, or a little earlier, depending on which aspect of biochemistry is being focused on. Some argued that the beginning of biochemistry may have been the discovery of the first enzyme, diastase (today called amylase), in 1833 by Anselme Payen, while others considered Eduard Buchner's first demonstration of a complex <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> alcoholic fermentation in cell-free extracts in 1897 to be the birth of biochemistry. [...] Some might also point as its beginning to the influential 1842 work by Justus von Liebig, Animal chemistry, or, Organic chemistry in its applications to physiology and pathology, which presented a chemical theory of metabolism, or even earlier to the 18th century studies on fermentation and respiration by Antoine Lavoisier. Many other pioneers in the field who helped to uncover the layers of complexity of biochemistry have been proclaimed founders of modern biochemistry, for example Emil Fischer for his work on the chemistry of proteins, and F. Gowland Hopkins on enzymes and the dynamic nature of biochemistry.|$|E
