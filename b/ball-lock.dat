5000|$|These kegs are {{stainless}} steel cylinders that hold approximately 5 U.S. gallons of liquid. The keg {{is filled with}} liquid via a removable hatch on the top, which is then closed and sealed. Carbon dioxide is added to pressurize the keg via an inlet port {{on the top and}} is facilitated by gently rocking the brew back and forth. Liquid is dispensed via an outlet port attached to a tube that extends {{to the bottom of the}} keg. Pin-lock and <b>ball-lock</b> fittings (or posts) are the two types of couplings used on the inlet and outlet ports. Coke distributors used pin-lock fittings, while Pepsi distributors used <b>ball-lock</b> fittings. <b>Ball-lock</b> are most used. The pin-lock style is often referred to as a [...] "Coke" [...] keg or style and the <b>ball-lock</b> is often referred to as a [...] "Pepsi" [...] keg or style, though the fittings themselves are removable, serviceable, and contain interchangeable parts.|$|E
50|$|A {{variant of}} the Personal Flight Sky-Bike, the Sky-Bike Trike adds a {{three-wheeled}} carriage to the Sky-Bike's seat pack, to turn the paramotor into a powered parachute. The three-wheeled fame carriage attaches in minutes, with a few <b>ball-lock</b> pins.|$|E
50|$|A sixth barrel keg {{contains}} approximately 5.2 gallons, and {{is becoming}} the choice for many establishments and breweries that wish to use kegs smaller than a half barrel. The sixth barrel kegs are nominally larger in size and volume compared to the Cornelius keg. They are normally fitted with a standard US Type D Sanke coupler on a single downspout; whereas, Corny kegs are normally fitted with a flip-hatch, and a dual connector pin-lock or <b>ball-lock</b> top. Although the sixth barrel torpedo keg is approximately the same height as the standard half barrel, the smaller foot print of the sixth barrel allows retailers have {{a greater variety of}} beer in a small space. This size keg is quickly replacing the quarter barrel size which has the same foot print as a half barrel keg, but is only half as tall. Other than smaller circumference, sixth barrel kegs are very similar to their full-sized counterparts in construction. A stainless Micromatic brand sixth barrel keg weighs approximately 14-15 pounds (6.3-6.8 kg) when empty, and approximately 58-60 pounds (26.3-27.2 kg) when full.|$|E
5000|$|The quick-connector {{fittings}} {{which allow}} hoses {{to be easily}} attached and removed from the ports come in two mechanical varieties, namely pin lock and ball lock, which are not interchangeable. Historically, pin lock kegs were used primarily by the Coca-Cola company, while ball lock kegs were used primarily by Pepsi. On a pin lock keg, there are metal posts (pins) extending horizontally from around the port. When the connector is attached, these pins hold it in place. The [...] "gas in" [...] port has two pins, while the [...] "liquid out" [...] has three, {{making it impossible to}} accidentally switch the gas-versus-liquid hoses (which would harmlessly result in carbon dioxide bubbling up through the drink, while gas but no drink would be dispensed). Ball lock kegs have ridges in the ports, which are gripped by small metal balls in the connectors. Both types of kegs are fairly easy to find, though <b>ball-lock</b> seem to be more common.As a result of demand from home brewers, second hand kegs are becoming progressively more scarce and in recent years brand new kegs have come onto the market, manufactured in China to the same specifications.|$|E
40|$|Three-point {{automatically}} released {{suspension and}} jettisoning system operates independently of lander's power system and releases parachute on touchdown. The system {{is based on}} a <b>ball-lock</b> device operated by the shock of the parachute's opening and by the subsequent decay in the load on the main cord...|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanism}} uses {{a magnetic}} field to dock a satellite to a host vehicle. A docking component of the mechanism residing on the host vehicle has a magnet {{that is used to}} induce a coupled magnetic field with a docking component of the mechanism residing on the satellite. An alignment guide axially aligns the docking component of the satellite with the docking component of the host device dependent on the coupled magnetic field. Rotational alignment guides are used to rotationally align the docking component of the satellite with the docking component of the host device. A <b>ball-lock</b> mechanism is used to mechanically secure the docking component of the host vehicle and the docking component of the satellite...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} {{system for}} docking a miniature spacecraft {{with a larger}} spacecraft has been developed by engineers at the Johnson Space Center. Engineers working on Mini AERCam, a free-flying robotic camera, needed {{to find a way}} to successfully dock and undock their miniature spacecraft to refuel the propulsion and recharge the batteries. The subsystems developed (see figure) include (1) a docking port, designed for the larger spacecraft, which contains an electromagnet, a ball lock mechanism, and a service probe; and (2) a docking cluster, designed for the smaller spacecraft, which contains either a permanent magnet or an electromagnet. A typical docking operation begins with the docking spacecraft maneuvering into position near the docking port on the parent vehicle. The electromagnet(s) are then turned on, and, if necessary, the docking spacecraft is then maneuvered within the capture envelope of the docking port. The capture envelope for this system is approximated by a 5 -in. (12. 7 -cm) cube centered on the front of the docking-port electromagnet and within an angular misalignment of < 30. Thereafter, the magnetic forces draw the smaller spacecraft toward the larger one and this brings the spacecraft into approximate alignment prior to contact. Mechanical alignment guides provide the final rotational alignment into one of 12 positions. Once the docking vehicle has been captured magnetically in the docking port, the <b>ball-lock</b> mechanism is activated, which locks the two spacecraft together. At this point the electromagnet(s) are turned off, and the service probe extended if recharge and refueling are to be performed. Additionally, during undocking, the polarity of one electromagnet can be reversed to provide a gentle push to separate the two spacecraft. This system is currently being incorporated into the design of Mini AERCam vehicle...|$|E
