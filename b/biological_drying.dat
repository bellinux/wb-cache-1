40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{an innovative}} system used for aerobic biostabilisation and <b>biological</b> <b>drying</b> of solid municipal waste. A mechanical–biological process (MBT) of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) treatment were carried out and monitored in 5 bioreactors. A two-stage biological treatment process {{has been used in}} the investigation. In the first step an undersize fraction was subjected to the biological stabilisation for a period of 14 days as a result of which there was a decrease of loss on ignition, but not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of MBT technology. In the second stage of a biological treatment has been applied 7 -days intensive bio-drying of MSW using sustained high temperatures in bioreactor. The article presents the results of the chemical composition analysis of the undersize fraction and waste after <b>biological</b> <b>drying,</b> and also the results of temperature changes, pH ratio, loss on ignition, moisture content, combustible and volatile matter content, heat of combustion and calorific value of wastes. The mass balance of the MBT of MSW with using the innovative aeration system showed that only 14. 5 % of waste need to be landfilled, 61. 5 % could be used for thermal treatment, and nearly 19 % being lost in the process as CO 2 and H 2 O...|$|E
40|$|Moisture {{is a key}} {{environmental}} factor that affects {{many aspects of the}} composting process. Biodegradation kinetics are affected by moisture through changes in oxygen diffusion, water potential and water activity, and microbial growth rates. These relationships are made more complex by the dynamic nature of the composting process, with changes in particle size and structure occurring over time. A deductive model of the effects of moisture on composting kinetics has defined these relationships based on fundamental physical properties and biological mechanisms. This study applies this model to experimental data from a manure and papermill sludge composting system. The results demonstrate that the optimum moisture content for biodegradation can vary widely for different compost mixtures and times in the composting process, ranging from near 50 to over 70 % on a wet basis. While there is a significant reduction in biodegradation rate when operating outside the optimum range, the results also suggest opportunities to mitigate this effect through manipulation of substrate density and particle size. This framework for engineering analysis demonstrates the importance and challenges of maintaining optimum moisture content in dynamic composting systems, where <b>biological</b> <b>drying,</b> metabolic water production, and changes in compaction and porosity are all occurring over time...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions originating from municipal solid waste (MSW) handling, EU legislation demands treatment of MSW prior to landfill disposal. Several EU countries do not meet this requirement yet so that related decisions are {{to be made in}} the near future. Besides incineration, mechanical biological treatment (MBT) is a well-proven approach to treat residual (r) MSW. Depending on its major focus, MBT can be applied as an alternative or in addition to incineration. Both technologies, MBT and incineration, as well as their combinations may contribute to reducing GHG emissions by diverting biodegradable substances from landfilling, recovering energy from waste and/or increasing resource efficiency through material recycling. But there is no agreement as to what approach shows the best climate performance. This is amongst others due to specific background systems impacting the climate performance of waste management. To enable decision makers to consider the climate performance of potential future rMSW management approaches, modelling is required. However, there is a lack of adequate models that include MBT systems. Within this thesis, a model is developed that allows to determine the carbon footprint of landfilling and waste incineration approaches as well as MBT systems applying either stabilisation through aerobic biodegradation or <b>biological</b> <b>drying</b> technology. Furthermore, energy and material recovery can be incorporated. In order to account for the impact of specific background systems on the climate performance of rMSW management, relevant background conditions can be adapted as they may occur in the EU. On the basis of exemplary consequential modelling, the effect of varying background conditions on the carbon footprint of rMSW management is demonstrated and specified...|$|E

40|$|Angled {{polyurethane}} fiber arrays are modified by adding soft spherical and spatula shaped tips via dipping. These fibers are characterized for adhesion and friction and compared with unmodified fibers and flat material samples. Sphere and spatula tip fiber samples demonstrate increased adhesion, with 10 and 23 times the maximum adhesion of the unmodified fiber sample, respectively. The sphere and spatula tip fiber samples also show increased friction, with 1. 6 and 4. 7 times the maximum friction of the unmodified fiber sample, respectively. Friction and adhesion are simultaneously {{observed in a}} synthetic dry angled fibrillar adhesive sample (spatula tip fiber sample).

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present studies was to explore the possibility of employing composting as a mean of sewage sludge stabilization. A series of composting experiments were performed using dewatered secondary activated sewage sludge from a domestic wastewater treatment plant in New Plymouth, New Zealand. These trials {{have been carried out}} treating the sludge in both open and closed composting systems on a laboratory scale. Two open system methods, one aerated windrow and one static pile, and three closed experiments using a compostumbler were performed. Throughout the whole study woodchips (in varying ratios) were used as a bulking agent. An initial moisture content of nearly 60 % in the sludge - woodchips mixture produced the highest degree of composting activity over a three week period. <b>Biological</b> <b>drying</b> during the process was indicated by an increase in total solids up to values between 17 % and 27 %. Partial stabilization of the organic fraction was indicated by a decrease in volatile solids of 28 % - 50 %. In two closed system trials a total carbon decrease of 26 % - 42 % was observed, serving as an additional indication {{that there had been a}} reduction in organic matter. Total nitrogen losses were substantial in all experiments. Reductions were in the range of 14 % - 58 % with the highest losses observed in the static pile experiment. Phosphorus was found to be stable with only minor concentration changes observed. Temperature development in the composting material followed the well known pattern, provided that the factors influencing the composting process were close to optimal. Temperatures approaching 70 °C in the initial stage of the process were measured. Bacteriological studies indicated, that the final composted product was not free from microbial hazard. In one closed system trial, however, no entero-streptococci were observed, indicating a complete inactivation of these indicator microorganisms.

40|$|International audienceCotyledonary somatic embryos (SEs) of {{maritime}} pine are routinely matured for 12 weeks before being germinated and converted to plantlets. Although regeneration success is {{highly dependent on}} SEs quality, {{the date of harvesting}} is currently determined mainly on the basis of morphological features. This empirical method does not provide any accurate information about embryo quality with respect to storage compounds (proteins, carbohydrates). We first analyzed SEs matured for 10, 12 and 14 weeks by carrying out <b>biological</b> (<b>dry</b> weight, water content) and biochemical measurements (total protein and carbohydrate contents). No difference could be found between collection dates, suggesting that harvesting SEs after 12 weeks is appropriate. Cotyledonary SEs were then compared to various stages, from fresh to fully desiccated, in the development of cotyledonary zygotic embryos (ZEs). We identified profiles that were similar using hierarchical ascendant cluster analysis (HCA). Fresh and dehydrated ZEs could be distinguished, and SEs clustered with fresh ZEs. Both types of embryo exhibited similar carbohydrate and protein contents and signatures. This high level of similarity (94. 5 %) was further supported by proteome profiling. Highly expressed proteins included storage, stress-related, late embryogenesis abundant and energy metabolism proteins.

Recent additions to tire class of one-hit detectors arc Escherichia coil B, and single- and double-strand breaks in SV- 40 virus in EO buffer, where indirect effects predominate. The response of cells (survival, transformation, and chromosome aberration) to these radiations is typically described by a four-parameter model whose numerical values are determined from the equations of the theory being fit to experimental data at high dose (typically above 1 Gy), with tile cells bombarded by gamma rays and high-charge-and-energy (HZE) particle beams, of tile widest possible dynamic range. Once these parameters are determined, the model predicts cellular response in any radiation environment for which the particle-energy spectrum is known. The important feature of this track structure model is its ability to estimate from a limited set. of laboratory data the response of a complex radiation environment with many components. For example, we have calculated cell survival after neutron irradiation with mixtures of neutrons and gamma rays and cell survival and transformation after irradiation with HZE of different energies.

It also does not include cancer induction because tile available data give neither tile number of cells at risk nor tile number of cancers induced and are thus not suited to our formulation...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} associated with the operation of air biofilters is the loss of performance caused by drying of the bioactive support, as the removal capacity of contaminants by the microorganisms is dependent on their water content. In this work, biofilms from a microbial consortium adapted to toluene were grown on stainless steel slides. The biofilms were dried in stoppered flasks with saturated saline solutions to obtain final water activities of 97. 4 %, 83. 9 %, 74. 8 % and 32 %. The biofilms were characterized by a sorption isotherm Type III with toluene; the water desorption isotherm was fitted to the BET model and the biofilm hydrophobicity was also determined. Specific oxygen consumption rates decreased at lower Aw from 60 mu g O- 2 /mg protein/h to zero activity. Biofilm activity, represented by a toluene consumption rate, and others physical properties presented a critical point between Aw 0. 84 and 0. 97. <b>Biological</b> activity of <b>dried</b> biofilms was restored either partially or completely, depending on the extent of drying and rewetting method...|$|R
40|$|EPR {{spectra of}} 3 -carboxy-proxyl (CP) in <b>dry</b> <b>biological</b> tissues {{exhibited}} a temperature-dependent {{change in the}} principal value A′zz of the hyperfine interaction tensor. The A′zz value changed sharply at a particular temperature that was dependent on water content. At elevated water contents, the break occurred at lower temperatures {{and appeared to be}} associated with the melting of the cytoplasmic glassy state. To investigate the reason for the change in A′zz, we employed echo-detected EPR (ED EPR) spectroscopy. The shape of the ED EPR spectrum revealed the presence of librational motion of the spin probe, a motion typically present in glassy materials. The similarities in temperature dependency of A′zz and librational motion of CP in pea seed axes indicated that the change in A′zz arose from librational motion. ED EPR measurements of CP as a function of water content in Typha latifolia pollen showed that librational motion decreased with decreasing water contents until a plateau or minimum was reached. ED EPR spectroscopy is a valuable technique for characterizing the relation between molecular motion and storage kinetics of dry seed and pollen...|$|R
40|$|The {{preservation}} of our cultural heritage {{is of great}} importance to future generations. Despite this, significant problems have arisen with the conservation of waterlogged wooden artifacts. Three major issues facing conservators are structural instability on <b>drying,</b> <b>biological</b> degradation, and chemical degradation on account of Fe 3 +-catalyzed production of sulfuric and oxalic acid in the waterlogged timbers. Currently, no conservation treatment exists that effectively addresses all three issues simultaneously. A new conservation treatment is reported here based on a supramolecular polymer network constructed from natural polymers with dynamic cross-linking formed {{by a combination of}} both host-guest complexation and a strong siderophore pendant from a polymer backbone. Consequently, the proposed consolidant has the ability to chelate and trap iron while enhancing structural stability. The incorporation of antibacterial moieties through a dynamic covalent linkage into the network provides the material with improved biological resistance. Exploiting an environmentally compatible natural material with completely reversible chemistries is a safer, greener alternative to current strategies and may extend the lifetime of many culturally relevant waterlogged artifacts around the world...|$|R
40|$|The Massaguaçu River estuary is an {{irregular}} estuary with sandbar breaching cycles that are irregular and happen several times each year. The species Ludwigia octovalvis is a perennial weed {{in several places}} around the world, but it is seasonal in the Massaguaçu River. In this survey we determined {{the relationship between the}} rain, estuary water level variation, and the spatial and temporal distribution of this species. In a laboratory we simulated the water level variation in water tanks in order to understand how this species responds to flooding. In the field, we determined the distribution of L. octovalvis in the higher pluviose season and in the lower pluviose season. This species is relatively common in the higher pluviose season and completely absent in the lower one. There is strong evidence that this happens due to the longer and deeper sandbar breaching cycles during the dry season, which induce this species to etiolation, and, therefore, mechanical fragility. The seasonality of species in aquatic environments that do not have a <b>dry</b> <b>biological</b> season is unusual and little studied...|$|R
40|$|The Jordanian {{rangeland}} {{has been}} deteriorated due to successive drought and human misuse. The {{present study was}} conducted at Al-Majjediah village during 2012 and 2013 and aimed to study the effect of intercropping fodder shrubs and barley in the grazing productivity and stocking rate using different cropping systems. The study was analyzed using Randomized Complete Block Design including planting methods. High significant differences had noticed of fresh and dry yield between years. Year 2012 was more productive than 2013. Survival % was higher for Salsola, and Salsola-barley compared with Atriplex, and Atriplex-barley systems. Atriplex and Salsola had more fresh and dry yield compared with Atriplex-barley, and Salsola-barley systems. In the other side, Atriplex-barley and Salsola-barley treatments showed high significant differences for <b>biological</b> yield, total <b>dry</b> yield and stocking rate. In addition, stocking rate was higher for Atriplex-barley and Salsola-barley in comparison with Atriplex, Salsola and barley systems. Intercrop barley with fodder shrubs isn’t recommended under rangeland conditions or low rainfall areas. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of soil plowing for barley planting, supplemental irrigation and nutritive value improvement...|$|R
