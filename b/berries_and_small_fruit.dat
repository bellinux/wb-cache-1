50|$|The yellow-vented bulbuls eats <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>fruits.</b> They also sip nectar, nibble {{on young}} shoots, {{and take some}} insects.|$|R
50|$|Lewin's {{honeyeaters}} feed {{mostly on}} <b>fruits,</b> favouring <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>fruits,</b> but also eat insects and nectar. Birds are normally seen alone, but may form loose groups {{of up to}} 10 birds. They feed in the upper branches and on the trunks of trees. Some insects are caught in flight.|$|R
50|$|The painted tiger parrot {{occurs in}} montane and subalpine forests and shrub at {{elevations}} of 2,400-4,000 m. Often, this species {{is seen in}} cautiously feeding in low bushes, eating a variety of seeds, <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>fruits</b> of dacrydium conifers. It is also known to feed alongside Madarasz's tiger parrot. When startled, it flies into the canopy. This species is usually seen in pairs of groups of up to six birds.|$|R
5000|$|Melanocharitidae {{species are}} usually seen {{alone or in}} pairs. [...] They may {{associate}} with mixed-species feeding flocks, but are loose members and not core species. The diet of the family is dominated by <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>fruits.</b> Arthropods are also gleaned from foliage, and more rarely by hovering and snatching. They are highly active feeders, seldom pausing except when at berries. Most species feed in the lower and middle levels of the forest, although records suggest that the obscure berrypecker will enter the canopy to forage. The male black berrypecker will also enter the canopy, while the female will remain lower down in the forest, suggesting some level of sexual segregation of feeding niches.|$|R

"Jams {{are usually}} made from pulp and juice [...] of one fruit, {{rather than a}} {{combination}} of several <b>fruits.</b> <b>Berries</b> <b>and</b> other <b>small</b> <b>fruits</b> are most frequently used, though larger fruits such as apricots, peaches, or plums {{cut into small pieces}} or crushed are also used for jams. Good jam has a soft even consistency without distinct pieces of fruit, a bright color, a good fruit flavor and a semi-jellied texture that is easy to spread but has no free liquid."

5000|$|While {{the surface}} of the town is undulating in the west, it is quite mountainous in the east, a part of the Rensselaer Plateau [...] {{extending}} through that section of the town. Oak hill, near the centre of the town, and Perigo hill, in the northeast corner, rise to a height of about 900 ft above the level of the sea. The soil is very fertile in many parts of Sand Lake, especially in the comparatively low land in the eastern portion. Agriculture and grazing have always been carried on with success. In recent years numerous garden farms have been established, the markets of Troy being supplied largely by these in the proper season. Sand Lake strawberries <b>and</b> other <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> <b>fruits</b> are among the finest produced in Eastern New York. One of the principal characteristics of the town is its numerous small lakes, in which fish of nearly all kinds inhabiting still fresh water abound, and the number of summer guests {{in all parts of the}} town is constantly increasing. Crystal Lake is near the centre of the town, and is the largest body of water lying entirely within the limits of the town. Burden Lake and Crooked Lake are in the southern part, the former lying partly in the town of Nassau. Glass Lake is between Crystal Lake and Crooked Lake. Big Bowman and Little Bowman ponds are close together in the eastern part, and Richard Pond is in the northwestern part near Averill Park. The Wynants Kill and the Tsatsawassa are the principal streams. The former rises in Crooked Lake and flows through Glass Lake and Burden Lake into the Hudson River at North Greenbush. It also drains Richard Pond. The latter drains the eastern part of the town and flows southerly into Nassau. The Wynants Kill furnishes one of the finest water powers in eastern New York.|$|R
50|$|These birds feed {{mainly on}} arthropods, in {{particular}} insects. They acquire prey by gleaning in shrubs and on tree branches, and by hawking prey {{that tries to}} fly away. Other invertebrates <b>and</b> some <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> similar <b>small</b> juicy <b>fruits</b> are also eaten, the latter especially by American yellow warblers in their winter quarters. The yellow warbler {{is one of several}} insectivorous bird species that reduce the number of coffee berry borer beetles in Costa Rica coffee plantations by 50%. Caterpillars are the staple food for nestlings, with some - e.g. those of geometer moths (Geometridae) - preferred over others.|$|R
5000|$|Tubers (starchy root {{vegetables}}) and millet {{are grown}} in the fields, while vegetables such as onions, tomatoes, and okra are grown in small gardens surrounding the homes. The women are responsible for cultivating these small vegetable gardens. They also gather wild grasses, seeds, <b>berries,</b> <b>and</b> other <b>fruits.</b> <b>Small</b> groups of women set out for journeys that last about a month, taking with them all that is necessary for their gathering expedition. They sleep under shelters built from branches and bundles of grass. After the gathering is complete, the various grains are stored in earthen jars, for cereals are not mixed within the same granary. In addition to the products gathered by the women, the Zaghawa may also gather honey, certain leaves, and locusts for consumption.|$|R
5000|$|The diet also {{includes}} {{a wide range of}} insect prey, <b>berries</b> <b>and</b> other <b>fruits,</b> <b>small</b> mammals <b>and</b> occasionally flesh from carcasses. Eggs and nestlings are sometimes devoured, and peanuts and suet have become a favorite at bird tables. Food is taken both from the ground and from trees, where the nutcrackers are very agile among the branches. The birds are able to extract food by clasping pine cones {{in such a way that}} the cones are held between one or both feet. The birds then hack the cones open with their strong bills. Rotten logs are also hacked into in order to locate large beetle grubs, and animal dung may be flipped over in search of insects. Clark's nutcrackers can also be opportunistic feeders in developed areas, and are known to some as [...] "camp robbers".|$|R
