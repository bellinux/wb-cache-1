50|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>rain</b> or red rain is a {{phenomenon}} in which blood is perceived to fall from the sky {{in the form of}} rain. Cases have been recorded since Homer's Iliad, composed approximately 8th century BC, and are widespread. Before the 17th century it was generally believed that the rain was actually blood. Literature mirrors cult practice, in which the appearance of <b>blood</b> <b>rain</b> was considered a bad omen. It was used as a tool foreshadowing events, but while some of these may be literary devices, some occurrences are historic. There is now a scientific consensus that the <b>blood</b> <b>rain</b> phenomenon is caused by aerial spores of green microalgae Trentepohlia annulata.|$|E

There is little literature on the subject of <b>blood</b> <b>rain,</b> although it has gained the attention of some naturalists. The phenomenon received international coverage in 2001, after red rain fell in Kerala, India,and again in 2012.|$|E

50|$|Occurrences of <b>blood</b> <b>rain</b> {{throughout}} history are distributed from the ancient, {{to the modern}} day. The earliest literary instance is in Homer's Iliad, in which Zeus twice caused a rain of blood, on one occasion to warn of slaughter in a battle. The same portent occurs {{in the work of}} the poet Hesiod, writing around 700 BC; the author John Tatlock suggests that Hesiod's story may have been influenced by that recorded in the Iliad. The first-century Greek biographer Plutarch also recounts a tradition of a rain of blood during the reign of Romulus, founder of Rome. Roman authors Livy and Pliny record some later cases of <b>blood</b> <b>rain,</b> with Livy describing it as a bad portent.|$|E

Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 49 (1998) 557 – 583] to propose that a cytochrome P 450 -dependent enzyme might {{be involved in the}} transformation of β-carotene to astaxanthin. In Haematococcus only esterified astaxanthin molecules accumulate, but it is not determined whether a fatty acid synthesis should occur simultaneously to allow pigment accumulation. The aim of this contribution was to answer these two questions using specific inhibitors of β-carotene (norflurazon) and fatty acid (cerulenin) synthesis, and of cytochrome P 450 enzyme activity (ellipticine) ...|$|R

The original spot of many of the monuments and statues was altered drastically. One of the biggest changes was to the Rostra Vetera. This structure changed considerably even before 44 BC. It began with the first curia for the senate in 600 BC and a shrine that was added 20 years later where, it is said, miraculous events occurred of milk and <b>blood</b> <b>raining</b> down from the heavens.|$|R

5000|$|In the 19th century, {{there was}} a trend towards {{examining}} events such as rains of blood more scientifically; Ehrenberg conducted experiments at the Berlin Academy, attempting to recreate [...] "blood rain" [...] using dust mixed with water. He concluded that <b>blood</b> <b>rain</b> was caused by water mixing with a reddish dust, mostly composed of animal and vegetable matter. He was unclear {{on the origin of}} the dust but stated that it lacked the characteristics of African dust that might have indicated it came from the Sahara Desert. Instead, he suggested that the dust came from dried swamps where it was picked up by violent winds and would later fall as rain. This explanation has persisted, and the Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology (1992) attributes the colour of <b>blood</b> <b>rain</b> to the presence of dust containing iron oxide.|$|E
5000|$|Tatlock, in a {{study of}} some medieval cases of <b>blood</b> <b>rain,</b> notes that the medieval cases of <b>blood</b> <b>rain</b> [...] "agree well" [...] with their {{classical}} counterparts. Although there are variables (for example, the rain sometimes lasted only for a short period, while on other occasions, it could last days), they were widely considered to be bad omens and warnings of bad events to come. He also suggests that the phenomenon may be recorded only in small areas because the colour of the rain would not always be noticed and may be obvious against only pale backgrounds. In the classical period, events such as a shower of blood was seen a demonstration of godly power; in the medieval period, Christians were less inclined to attribute the phenomenon to such reasons although followers of nature-religions were happy to do so.|$|E

5000|$|The best-known {{and most}} vivid description, though of the quite {{different}} taurobolium {{as it was}} revived in aristocratic pagan circles, is the notorious one that has coloured early scholarship, which was provided in an anti-pagan poem by the late 4th-century Christian Prudentius in Peristephanon: the priest of the Great Mother, clad in a silk toga worn in the Gabinian cincture, with golden crown and fillets on his head, takes his place in a trench covered by a platform of planks pierced with fine holes, on which a bull, magnificent with flowers and gold, is slain. The <b>blood</b> <b>rains</b> through the platform onto the priest below, who receives it on his face, and even on his tongue and palate, and after the baptism presents himself before his fellow-worshippers purified and regenerated, and receives their salutations and reverence. Prudentius does not explicitly mention the taurobolium, but the ceremony, in its new form, is unmistakable from other contemporaneous sources: [...] "At Novaesium on the Rhine in Germania Inferior, a blood pit was found in what was probably a Metroon", Jeremy Rutter observes.|$|R
