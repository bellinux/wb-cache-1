5|$|When a drop {{of falling}} water hits the {{interior}} of the cup with the appropriate angle and velocity, the peridioles are ejected into the air <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the drop. The force of ejection tears open the purse, and results in the expansion of the funicular cord, formerly coiled under pressure in {{the lower part of the}} purse. The peridioles, followed by the highly adhesive funicular cord and basal hapteron, may hit a nearby plant stem or stick. The hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the still-moving peridiole. After drying out, the peridiole remains attached to the vegetation, where it may be eaten by a grazing herbivorous animal, and later deposited in that animal's dung to continue the life cycle.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine gas {{was also}} used during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E

5|$|Dennis Oglesby and Martin Griffith, two United States Army {{soldiers}} {{who were in the}} lead train and were uninjured in the collision, helped passengers, most of whom appeared to have minor injuries, evacuate from their train. Oglesby and Griffith then noticed that six to eight people from the other train had been ejected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the collision and were more seriously injured. One person from the overtaking train had been thrown onto the roof of the stationary train and had suffered a severe head wound. The soldiers gave first aid to the more seriously injured victims until help arrived, and informed responding emergency personnel that the rails were still powered and needed to be shut down.|$|E
5|$|Dunbeth hill {{where the}} present local {{authority}} municipal buildings stand is {{a wedge of}} rock which was probably squeezed upwards <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> two (now-extinct) fault lines.

5|$|During the Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, Arizona was bombed. After a bomb detonated in a powder magazine, the {{battleship}} exploded violently and sank, {{with the loss}} of 1,177officers and crewmen. Unlike many of the other ships sunk or damaged that day, Arizona was irreparably damaged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the magazine explosion, though the Navy removed parts of the ship for reuse. The wreck still lies at the bottom of Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona Memorial, dedicated on 30 May 1962 to all those who died during the attack, straddles the ship's hull.|$|E

5|$|The cone shaped fruiting body of Cyathus striatus {{makes use}} of a splash-cup {{mechanism}} to help disperse the spores. When a raindrop hits {{the interior of the}} cup with the optimal angle and velocity, the downward force of the water ejects the peridioles into the air. The force of ejection rips open the funiculus, releasing the tightly wound funicular cord. The hapteron attached {{to the end of the}} funiculus is adhesive, and when it contacts a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it; the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridioles degrade over time to eventually release the spores within, or they may be eaten by herbivorous animals and redeposited after passing through the digestive tract.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a normal force). The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
5|$|When a {{raindrop}} {{hits the}} interior of the cup with the proper angle and velocity it can produce considerable force, and can create a splash that drives the water up along the sides of the cup (also known as splash cups), tearing the funiculus, and ejecting the peridioles. The peridioles are followed by their funicular cord and basal hapteron. When they hit a nearby plant stem or stick, the hapteron sticks to it, and the funicular cord wraps around the stem or stick powered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the still-moving peridiole (similar to a tetherball). The peridiole, attached to the plant, may be eaten by herbivorous mammals, and the subsequent passage through its digestive tract will soften the hard shell enough to facilitate later sporulation.|$|E

5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of the men on board were {{soldiers}} with no training for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> the sea.|$|E
5|$|Leeboard: To avoid leeward drift caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>of</b> wind while sailing, the {{leeboard}} was invented; {{it was a}} board lowered {{onto the}} side of the ship opposite to the direction of the wind, helping the ship to stay upright and on course. Paul Johnstone and Sean McGrail state that an odd-looking second paddle on a bronze drum of the Dong Son culture (centered in the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam) may depict a leeboard in use as early as 300 BC. Leeboards may have been invented in China as early as the 8th century during the Tang Dynasty and are featured shortly after in 9th century engraved artwork found at the Borobudur monument built during the Sailendra dynasty of Central Java (Indonesia). Leeboards were first used in the West by the Dutch, during the 15th to 16th centuries (possibly used on early Dutch cogs, or perhaps influenced by a Chinese origin).|$|E
