5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree {{to go to a}} movie, Plan 9 from Outer Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, and it was not a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E

25|$|Before {{the show}} aired, Holland and Smith {{had already decided}} that Sue and her husband would be parents to a young baby named Hassan. However, as further {{characters}} were invented they realised {{that there would be}} a total of four babies in the show: Annie Smith, Martin Fowler, Vicki Fowler and Hassan. It was decided that it would be impossible for the studios to cope with four babies, and so they invented a storyline to eliminate one of the young babies from the cast. During this time in the 1980s, the issue of cot death was extremely prominent in the British press, partly due to an increase in casualties, but also because a doctor had gone public with the accusation that parents were to blame for the tragic occurrence. Holland and Smith decided that covering this subject in the soap would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> of 'setting the record straight', and so it was decided that Sue and Ali's baby would die from cot death in the early months of the show. This was the first of many controversial storylines in EastEnders history. After the storyline aired in June 1985, the show was praised by audience and press alike for the sensitive and unsensational way this harrowing subject was treated. The sudden tragedy came as a surprise to the audience, especially since the bereaved parents were a couple whose feuding, fighting ways had made them appear rather comic in the early episodes of the show. The British Cot Death Foundation initially feared that a soap opera would trivialise the subject and frighten new parents. They tried to stop the episodes from airing, but in the end they were pleased with the way the subject was handled, and provided back-up support after transmission to many viewers who wanted more information on the subject.|$|E

There were concerns about shoving Q into an episode but the idea of [...] "Q-Less" [...] alleviated them.

500|$|While in negotiations, Douglas' staff {{approached}} the show's producers about a guest spot for Douglas and the sitcom's executives sought {{to work against}} Douglas' image. His management team wanted him to stretch beyond his usual roles, and believed a successful comedy show like Will & Grace would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to do so. The show's producers said that Douglas {{was willing to go}} with any story line the writers could come up with. Executive producer and co-creator of the show, David Kohan said: [...] "There's something great about playing on a person's iconic status. [...] Michael Douglas often plays these virile men, and the idea of making him a gay cop too shy to ask Will out was funny." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2008, while {{studying}} nursing at the Grenfell Campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland through the Western Regional School of Nursing, Loder met Devin Robinson, a record producer. The meeting led to him producing her first album, an independent release called The Way, which was recorded at Sweet Music Studios. Loder wrote all 11 {{songs on the}} album, which was released in August 2009. The initial run of the album sold out, and she subsequently went door-to-door in small Newfoundland communities selling a second run of the album. On her most lucrative day selling albums in this manner, she made $1000. Loder later said that this manner of selling her album proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to develop a fanbase; people invited her into their homes for meals, prayer, and discussions. Also that year, she won a talent-search contest hosted by YC Newfoundland, a Christian youth conference,where she performed [...] "Giants".|$|E

[...] "In Sri Lankan, arular means 'enlightenment from the sunshine' or something", she remarked, [...] "but a friend pointed {{out that it was}} a pun in English – 'a ruler' – which is funny because he is a politician.

500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick {{were in favor}} of doing a live episode; [...] "We love the idea of a live episode because we get to show the audience of Will & Grace what we've known from day one — we work with the best cast in network television," [...] said Mutchnick. He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the [...] "challenging live platform launch" [...] for Will & Grace would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all Will & Grace episodes, commented: [...] "This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything.

500|$|On his hiring, Baker explained, [...] "I did the Dino De Laurentiis {{version of}} King Kong in 1976 {{and was always}} {{disappointed}} because I wasn't {{able to do it}} as realistically as I wanted. I thought Apes would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to make up for that." [...] In addition to King Kong, Baker previously worked with designing ape makeup on , , and the 1998 remake of Mighty Joe Young. The makeup took 4.5 hours to apply and 1.5 hours to remove. Burton explained, [...] "it's like going to the dentist {{at two in the morning}} and having people poke at you for hours. Then you wear an ape costume until nine at night." [...] Burton was adamant that the apes should be substantially [...] "more animal-like; flying through trees, climb walls, swing out of windows, and go ape shit when angry." [...] For a month and a half before shooting started, the actors who portrayed apes attended [...] "ape school". Industrial Light & Magic, Rhythm and Hues Studios and Animal Logic were commissioned for the visual effects sequences. Rick Heinrichs served as the production designer and Colleen Atwood did costume design.|$|E
500|$|Following a 10-year {{break from}} music, Jackson signed {{with her brother}} Michael's record label, MJJ Music, in 1997. From the label, Yours Faithfully was {{released}} on March 31, 1998. The album featured a remixed version of Jackson's successful [...] "Centipede". Initially, the singer had not wanted to feature the track, believing that {{it was part of}} the past. After thinking about it for a while, Jackson felt that the inclusion of the remix which features a rap by son Austin would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to return to the music scene. In addition, her two other children, Stacee and Yashi, contributed backing vocals for the album. Other tracks from the album included [...] "Fly Away", which was written and produced by brother Michael, who also served as co-executive producer for Yours Faithfully. Fellow producers included Keith Thomas and Eliot Kennedy. The album also featured a duet with Men of Vizion's Spanky Williams on The Spinners' [...] "I Don't Want to Lose You", which Jet described as being a [...] "sizzling" [...] rendition. Yours Faithfullys title track was released as a single and peaked at number 76 on the R chart.

500|$|While {{developing}} the game, most of NST's efforts {{were focused on}} its multiplayer aspect because of its first-person shooter gameplay, and {{to take advantage of}} the Wi-Fi and voice chat capabilities of the Nintendo DS. One of the game's designers, Richard Vorodi, noted that [...] "the hardware kinda dictated [...]" [...] Wanting to introduce a new element to the Metroid series, Abe created several new bounty hunters after he realized that the game's multiplayer mode and the new bounty hunters could both be implemented seamlessly into the game: [...] "We had this idea early on and thought that would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to introduce [...] and [...] to the gameplay and take advantage of that in the multiplayer." [...] Metroid Prime Hunters includes several references to previous games in the Metroid Prime series. Samus' ship is from the original Metroid Prime, and her suit is the same one that appears in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. The developers decided to add them because they wanted to show that the technology has evolved, and they also wanted to include something that was instantly recognizable to those who had played previous games in the series. On level design, Abe said that as the game's controls shifted from an analog stick method to touchscreen aiming, the developers wanted to avoid making the gameplay and the control scheme more difficult.|$|E
500|$|Former showrunners Jean and Reiss {{had left}} to produce their own series, The Critic, along with The Simpsons co-creator Brooks. The Critic was a {{short-lived}} animated series that revolved around the life of movie critic Jay Sherman. For the second season of The Critic, Brooks {{cut a deal with}} the Fox network to have the series switch over. The episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] was pitched by Brooks, who had wanted a crossover that would help launch The Critic on Fox, and he thought having a film festival in Springfield would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>way</b> to introduce Sherman. In addition, Jean and Reiss returned to produce two episodes ("A Star is Burns" [...] and [...] "'Round Springfield") with the staff of The Critic, to relieve some of the stress on The Simpsons writing staff. Groening felt that the crossover was a thirty-minute advertisement for another show and blamed Brooks, calling it an attempt to get attention for one of his unsuccessful shows. After unsuccessful attempts to get the episode pulled, he decided to go public with his concerns shortly before the episode aired and had his name removed from the credits. In response, Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al [...] and Mike [...] were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 in the morning to get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. 'The Critic' is their shot and he should be giving them his support." ...|$|E
