5|$|The {{collecting}} trip {{had been}} very successful: they catalogued over 500 species of the fauna of {{the shores of the}} Gulf; recorded a species of <b>brittle</b> <b>star,</b> Ophiophragmus marginatus, last recorded nearly 100 years earlier; and discovered about 50 new species. Three species of sea anemone they discovered were named for them by Dr. Oscar Calgren at the Lund University's Department of Zoology in Sweden: Palythoa rickettsii, Isometridium rickettsi, and Phialoba steinbecki.|$|E
25|$|The body of Ophiocoma wendtii, {{a type of}} <b>brittle</b> <b>star,</b> {{is covered}} with ommatidia, turning its whole skin into a {{compound}} eye. The {{same is true of}} many chitons. The tube feet of sea urchins contain photoreceptor proteins, which together act as a compound eye; they lack screening pigments, but can detect the directionality of light by the shadow cast by its opaque body.|$|E

50|$|The Ophiuroidea contain {{two large}} clades, Ophiurida (<b>brittle</b> <b>stars)</b> and Euryalida (basket stars). Over 2,000 species of <b>brittle</b> <b>stars</b> live today. More than 1200 {{of these species}} are found in deep waters, greater than 200 m deep.|$|R

50|$|Ophiactis savignyi is {{a species}} of <b>brittle</b> <b>star</b> in the family Ophiactidae, {{commonly}} known as Savigny's <b>brittle</b> <b>star</b> or the little <b>brittle</b> <b>star.</b> It occurs in the tropical and subtropical parts of all the world's oceans and {{is thought to be}} the <b>brittle</b> <b>star</b> with the most widespread distribution. It was first described by the German zoologists Johannes Peter Müller and Franz Hermann Troschel in 1842. The specific name honours the French zoologist Marie Jules César Savigny.|$|E
50|$|Ophionereis reticulata, the {{reticulated}} <b>brittle</b> <b>star,</b> is a <b>brittle</b> <b>star</b> in {{the family}} Ophionereididae. It is found in shallow parts of the western Atlantic, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

50|$|Over 60 {{species of}} <b>brittle</b> <b>stars</b> {{are known to}} be bioluminescent.

Both shallow-water and deep-sea species of <b>brittle</b> <b>stars</b> are known to produce light. Presumably, this light is used to deter predators.|$|R

50|$|Brittle stars live {{in areas}} from the low-tide level downwards. Six {{families}} live at least 2 m deep; the genera Ophiura, Amphiophiura, and Ophiacantha range below 4 m. Shallow species live among sponges, stones, or coral, {{or under the}} sand or mud, with only their arms protruding. Two of the best-known shallow species are the green <b>brittle</b> <b>star</b> (Ophioderma brevispina), found from Massachusetts to Brazil, and the common European <b>brittle</b> <b>star</b> (Ophiothrix fragilis). Deep-water species tend to live in or on the sea floor or adhere to coral or urchins. The most widespread species is the long-armed <b>brittle</b> <b>star</b> (Amphipholis squamata), a grayish or bluish, strongly luminescent species.|$|E
