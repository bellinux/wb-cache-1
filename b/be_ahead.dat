In the first 15 minutes, the Lions looked formidable as they took an early 10–0 lead over the Stags, keyed by a Gavin Henson try. However, they became disjointed and by half-time had turned over the ball 14 times and were considered lucky to <b>be</b> <b>ahead</b> 10–3 at the break.|$|E

25|$|In this scene, Mussorgsky is hailed to <b>be</b> <b>ahead</b> of {{his time}} musically. His use of the whole tone scale, which uses only whole steps, made the Coronation scene stand out. This {{technique}} was replicated by impressionistic composers about 20 years later who noted his success. Mussorgsky also combined different two-beat and three-beat meters to create a unique sound for his composition called polymeters. These techniques were uncommon during this era and {{were believed to be}} almost too overwhelming for the public. This led to his rejection on two different occasions by the Imperial Opera before they decided to perform.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} round, the contestants {{attempted}} {{to match the}} celebrities whom they had not matched in the first round. On the CBS version, the challenger always began the second round (unless that contestant had matched all six stars; in this situation, the champion selected from the two questions available). This meant that a champion who had only answered one question could <b>be</b> <b>ahead</b> of a challenger who had played both questions, rendering the final question moot. On the syndicated versions, the leader after a round played first in the next round. In case of a tie score, the contestant who had not selected their own question in the previous round made the selection in the tie-breaker round.|$|E
25|$|Republicans {{discovered}} in August that Bryan was solidly {{ahead in the}} South and West, but far behind in the Northeast. He appeared to <b>be</b> <b>ahead</b> in the Midwest, so the Republicans concentrated their efforts there. They said Bryan was a madman, a religious fanatic surrounded by anarchists, who would wreck the economy. By late September, the Republicans felt they were ahead in the decisive Midwest and began emphasizing that McKinley would bring prosperity to all Americans. McKinley scored solid gains among the middle classes, factory and railroad workers, prosperous farmers, and the German Americans who rejected free silver. Bryan gave 500 speeches in 27 states. McKinley won {{by a margin of}} 271 to 176 in the electoral college, but the popular vote was much closer and in some key states, McKinley's margin of victory was narrow.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{had done}} {{research}} on pandemics six {{months prior to the}} 2009 flu pandemic, the outbreak was [...] "really helpful" [...] to his studies, because it provided a glimpse of the societal apparatus following the onset stages of a pandemic.

500|$|The {{reputation}} of the highway continued into {{the early years of}} the 21st century. In 2000, a $1million project (about $ in [...] dollars) was authorized to widen the shoulders of the road, after there were 413accidents and 15fatalities on SR67 from 1996 to 1999. At this time, County Supervisor Dianne Jacob proposed expanding the highway portion to four lanes along the entire route. Following a safety initiative, including the involvement of law enforcement and trucking companies, accidents and fatalities both decreased by the end of 2001. Accidents continued, however, and by November 2008, electronic signs were installed to inform motorists of their speed, and another publicity campaign had been launched. The reduction from two lanes to one lane heading southbound just after a curve has been blamed for at least some of the accidents, with collisions resulting from cars [...] "jockeying" [...] to <b>be</b> <b>ahead.</b> Head-on collisions are another source of crashes. Despite this, in 2009 Caltrans did not view the road as unsafe according to official metrics.|$|E

500|$|In {{reference}} to the 1978 kung fu film The 36th Chamber of Shaolin that the group enjoyed watching, the Clan considered themselves as lyrical masters of the 36 chambers, and arrived onto the rap scene while appearing to <b>be</b> <b>ahead,</b> and more advanced over others, with [...] "knowledge of 36 chambers of hip hop music when everyone else in hip hop was striving to attain the knowledge of 35 lessons." [...] Also, while the human body has 108 pressure points (1 + 0 + 8 = 9), only the Wu-Tang martial artists learned and understood that 36 of those pressure points are deadly (9 + 36 = 45) (4 + 5 = 9) The lyrics and rhymes of the 9 members are to be considered as 36 deadly lyrical techniques for pressure points. All {{of this is the}} basis for the album title, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), being that 9 members x 4 chambers = 36.

500|$|At the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Jenner {{achieved}} five personal bests on {{the first}} day of the men's decathlona [...] "home run"despite being in second place behind Guido Kratschmer of West Germany. Jenner was confident: [...] "The second day has all my good events. If everything works out all right, we should <b>be</b> <b>ahead</b> after it's all over." [...] Following a rainstorm on the second day, Jenner had a strong but cautious showing in the hurdles and discus, then personal bests in the pole vault, when Jenner took the lead, and javelin. By that point, victory was virtually assured, but it remained to be seen by how much Jenner would improve the record. In the final event—the 1500 meters, which was seen live on national television—Jenner looked content to finish the long competition. Jenner sprinted the last lap, making up a 50-meter deficit and nearly catching the event favorite, Soviet Leonid Litvinenko, who was already well out of contention for the gold medal, but whose personal best had been eight seconds better than Jenner's personal best before the race. Jenner set a new personal best time and won the gold medal with a world-record score of 8,616 points.|$|E

The session was held in dry and hot weather conditions. Montoya clinched his first pole position of his Formula One career, with a time of 1:38.117. Although he was pleased with his starting position, he was surprised at his team's performance in qualifying; Montoya lost two tenths of a second in the second sector and found time in the stadium section. [...] He was joined on the grid's front row by teammate Ralf Schumacher who recorded a lap 0.019 seconds slower than Montoya who displaced Schumacher from pole during the middle of qualifying. It marked {{the first time since the}} 1997 British Grand Prix that both Williams cars began a Formula One race from the first two starting positions. Häkkinen qualified third and praised the handling of his car for his good performance. Michael Schumacher secured fourth and was disappointed not to <b>be</b> <b>ahead</b> of the two McLaren cars. Coulthard started fifth having suffered from tyre bilstering and conserved his tyre use by abandoning his final qualifying run. Barrichello managed sixth having been unable to improve his time because of a spin.
