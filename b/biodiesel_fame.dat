40|$|Abstract — <b>Biodiesel</b> (<b>FAME)</b> is biofuel as {{a result}} from {{conversion}} process of triglycerides (oil) into FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esther). Reutelis trisperma (Kemiri Sunan) {{is one of the}} plant that contains triglycerides, which is inedible oil due to its high poisonous component (alpha oleostearic acid), therefore this plant can be used as the nature source of biodiesel production. The research aimed to study the effect of NaOH concentration and length of trans-esterification time on the yield and FAME characteristic. The experiment was arranged in Completely Randomized Design with two replicated. The result indicated that 0. 75 % NaOH in two hours trans-esterification produce the highest yield of FAME with density 0. 8703 g/cm 3, kinematic viscosity 5. 325 cSt, acid value 0. 552 mg KOH/g and iodine value 46. 6972 g I 2 /g...|$|E

The effect of catalyst loading (sodium methoxide), temperature, rotational frequency and flow rates of the feed streams was investigated. An optimized and reproducible FAME yield of 96 % was achieved at a feed rate of 12. 6 mL min- 1 sunflower oil and a sixfold molar excess of MeOH (3. 15 mL min- 1) containing the catalyst (1 wt% {{with respect to the}} oil). A jacket temperature of 75 °C and a rotational frequency of 30 Hz were applied. The productivity under those conditions () was slightly higher than for a conventional batch process. The main advantage is the combined reaction–separation in the CCS, eliminating the necessity of a subsequent liquid–liquid separation step...|$|E

In Europe, as the diesel demand is continuously growing, the alternative diesel market which mostly consists of fatty acid methyl ester (<b>FAME)</b> <b>biodiesel</b> from plant oils grew rapidly (Knothe et al. 2005; Pahl 2005). Even though <b>FAME</b> <b>biodiesel</b> has shown potential for reducing the net carbon dioxide emissions, its commercialization is limited by the increased production cost of the raw material (i.e., vegetable oils) (Krawczyk 1996) as compared to fossil diesel.|$|R
40|$|Biodiesel {{density is}} a key {{parameter}} in biodiesel simulations and process development. In this work we selected, evaluated and improved two density models, one theoretical (Rackett-Soave) and one empirical (Lapuerta's method) for methanol based <b>biodiesels</b> (<b>FAME)</b> and ethanol based biodiesel (FAEE). For this purpose, biodiesel was produced from vegetable oils (sunflower, rapeseed, soybean, olive, safflower and other two commercial mixtures of vegetable oils) and animal fats (edible and crude pork fat and beef tallow) using both methanol and ethanol for the transesterification reactions, and blended to get 21 FAME and 21 FAEE, reporting their density and detailed composition. Bibliographic data have also been used. The Rackett-Soave method has been improved {{by the use of}} a new acentric factor correlation, whereas the parameters of the empirical one are improved by considering a bigger density data bank. Results show that the evaluated models could be used to estimate the biodiesel density with a good grade of accuracy but the performed modifications improve the accuracy of the models: ARD (%) for FAME; 0. 33, and FAEE; 0. 26, both calculated with the modification of Rackett-Soave method and ARD (%) for FAME; 0. 40 calculated with the modification of the Lapuerta's method) ...|$|R

Its determination is usually arduous and expensive, and the results obtained are not always accurate due to experimental error. This work is aimed at deve-loping a relationship between the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) composition and the cetane number (CN). Data were collected from the literature on the cetane number of various biodiesel fuels and their FAME composition. A regres-sion analysis was performed on pure FAME to establish a rela-tionship between the cetane number and FAME composition.

The unit consist of three major units i) a reactor {{consisting of a}} Continuous Centrifugal Contactor Separator (CCCS), ii) a washing unit consisting of a mixer and settler and iii) a drying unit. The methanolysis reaction of sunflower oil was undertaken in the CCCS, using sodium methoxide as a catalyst. The two immiscible liquids (FAME and glycerol stream) were separated in the CCCS unit due to centrifugal forces. The FAME stream was washed with acidic water to remove the excess of methanol and catalyst. The washed FAME was pumped into a column to allow FAME-water separation. Subsequently, the FAME was dried in a bubble column using air. The effect of water to biodiesel ratio, residence time, air flow rate, and temperature were studied in the respective units.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for next decades is development of competitive renewable energy sources, highly needed to compensate fossil fuels reserves and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among different possibilities, which are currently under investigation, {{there is the}} exploitation of unicellular algae for production of biofuels and biodiesel in particular. Microalgae have the ability of accumulating large amount of lipids within their cells which can be exploited as feedstock {{for the production of}} biodiesel. The lipid content of different species of microalgae can range from 30 %- 70 % of their dry weight. In this project a microalgae with lipid content of 60. 095 % was used. This means that 26 gms of oil was obtained from 42 gms of microalgae sample from which 17. 624 gm of <b>biodiesel</b> (<b>FAME)</b> was found at the end of trans-esterification. Algae biofuels avoid some of the previous drawbacks associated with crop-based biofuels as the algae do not compete with food crops. The favorable growing conditions found in many developing countries has led to a great deal of speculation about their potentials for reducing oil imports, stimulating rural economies, and even tackling hunger and poverty.

40|$|Abstract—The {{knowledge}} of biodiesel density over large ranges of temperature and pressure {{is important for}} predicting the behavior of fuel injection and combustion systems in diesel engines, and for the optimization of such systems. In this study, cottonseed oil was transesterified into biodiesel and its density was measured at temperatures between 288 K and 358 K and pressures between 0. 1 MPa and 30 MPa, with expanded uncertainty estimated as ± 1. 6 kg⋅m- 3. Experimental pressure-volume-temperature (pVT) cottonseed data was used along with literature data relative to other 18 biodiesels, {{in order to build}} a database used to test the correlation of density with temperarure and pressure using the Goharshadi–Morsali–Abbaspour equation of state (GMA EoS). To our knowledge, this is the first that density measurements are presented for cottonseed biodiesel under such high pressures, and the GMA EoS used to model biodiesel density. The new tested EoS allowed correlations within 0. 2 kg·m- 3 corresponding to average relative deviations within 0. 02 %. The built database was used to develop and test a new full predictive model derived from the observed linear relation between density and degree of unsaturation (DU), which depended from <b>biodiesel</b> <b>FAMEs</b> profile. The average density deviation of this method was only about 3 kg. m- 3 within the temperature and pressure limits of application.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} hurdles in the {{production}} of biodiesel is the high production cost compared to petroleum-derived diesel. Even though the mechanical agitation utilised during biodiesel production is effective, it is energy intensive and costly. In this study ultrasonic assisted biodiesel production has been considered as a more economical alternative. The optimum transesterification reaction conditions were investigated using sunflower oil as a feedstock, methanol (MeOH) as the alcohol, along with potassium hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst. The transesterification reactions were carried out in an ELMA® ultrasonic bath. The reactions were completed at different ultrasonic frequencies, reaction times, alcohol to oil molar ratios and catalyst loading weights. Both Gas Chromatography (GC-MS) and FT-IR Spectroscopy analyses were used to determine the fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) content of the resulting biodiesel. The optimum ultrasonic assisted biodiesel production reactions were found to be 60 ºC, 35 kHz, an alcohol to oil ratio of 9 : 1, a catalyst loading of 0. 5 wt%, with a reaction time of 50 minutes. The resulting <b>biodiesel</b> <b>FAME</b> yields at these conditions were higher than 96. 5 wt%.

40|$|In 2012, a new {{specification}} for synthetic fuels containing up to 7 % <b>biodiesel</b> (<b>FAME)</b> {{was approved}} (CEN TS 15940). This specification allows {{the sale of}} neat paraffinic diesel, such as Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) diesel, to captive fleets in Europe. Several aspects are important in the final end-use application, including {{the stability of the}} fuel. The current study evaluated the stability of neat GTL diesel and FAME/paraffinic fuel blends via standard laboratory stability tests commonly used to study petroleum-derived fuels. The stability of GTL diesel, containing biodiesel, was evaluated using the Rancimat, PetroOxy, and ASTMD 2274 tests. Selected samples were also evaluated using ASTM D 5304. The Rancimat results indicated that FAME/GTL diesel blends performed similar to the FAME/petroleum derived fuel blends. In the PetroOxy test, the addition of more than 2 v/v% of a highly stable FAME resulted in an unexpected boost in the stability of the FAME/GTL diesel blend. The ASTM D 2274 results were generally insensitive to the addition of FAME. The correlation between the PetroOxy and Rancimant tests was evaluated and found to be base fuel dependent. From this study it was concluded that GTL diesel (in blends with FAME) performed similar to petroleum-derived reference fuels in standard laboratory stability...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 As global {{concerns}} over {{the environmental impact of}} petroleum fuels increase, alternatives such as biofuels are becoming more prevalent. Most of the world’s commodities are shipped over the oceans by large cargo vessels and the carriage of potentially hazardous cargo has safety and environmental risks. The carriage of biofuels is becoming more commonplace and an environmental discharge of such fuels is a potential given international allowances for cargo tank cleaning. The fate of biodiesel in the marine environment is a newer focus of research as the industry expands. This research characterizes the vibrational modes of the building blocks of biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)) and a commercial biodiesel sample through Raman spectroscopy. The concentration sensitivity of the Raman spectroscope in concentrations of ultra-pure and artificial seawater was found to be low; concentrations of 20 % oil in water were necessary for good spectral resolution. Commercial biodiesel in artificial seawater was exposed under a UV lamp for 23 days to evaluate the degradation mechanisms. Isomerization was evidenced by the decline of the cis configurational vibration modes of the =CH bends. Photo-oxidation was apparent as the samples’ double bonds broke down over time. It was shown from comparison with a lab-made FAME mix that the antioxidants in commercial biodiesel slowed this process considerably. Hydrolysis occurred breaking down the <b>biodiesel’s</b> <b>FAMEs</b> into their relative free fatty acid and methanol. Methanol evaporated significantly from the sample; its presence was not measured directly through Raman spectroscopy but through a literature review and evaluation of vapor pressures, it was shown that methanol formed. The toxicity of methanol is a concern to marine organisms; however if most of the methanol formed through this degradation evaporates and exists the marine environment through natural physical oceanographic and transport processes, it is unlikely that biodiesel residue into the ocean will cause measurable harm to aquatic organisms...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to determine if there are any differences between the behaviours of the two fuels which can be used to distinguish between them, for example in a real-time fuel-type detection algorithm in a flex-fuel engine. Tests were conducted at 20 steady-state operating points in an engine test rig with three different fuels: 100 % FAME biodiesel, B 7 and B 50 (blends of 7 and 50 % biodiesel respectively).

The pressure data shows some minor differences across fuels in their rates of pressure rise and fall as the fuels is compressed to the target injection pressure and then injected. The rates of pressure rise and fall for fuels with higher bio-content were found to be higher than for Petrodiesel. While this property could be made use of in a fuel type detection algorithm, two considerations need to be made: First, the noise in the pressure sensor signal in use should be lower than the expected difference in pressure across fuel blends.

40|$|Background: Biodiesel is {{the main}} liquid biofuel in the EU and is {{currently}} mainly produced from vegetable oils. Alternative feedstocks are lignocellulosic materials, which provide several benefits compared with many existing feedstocks. This study examined a technical process and its mass and energy balances to gain a systems perspective of combined <b>biodiesel</b> (<b>FAME)</b> and biogas production from straw using oleaginous yeasts. Important process parameters with a determining impact on overall mass and energy balances were identified and evaluated. Results: In the base case, 41 % {{of energy in the}} biomass was converted to energy products, primary fossil fuel use was 0. 37 MJprim/MJ produced and 5. 74 MJ fossil fuels could be replaced per kg straw dry matter. The electricity and heat produced from burning the lignin were sufficient for process demands except in scenarios where the yeast was dried for lipid extraction. Using the residual yeast cell mass for biogas production greatly increased the energy yield, with biogas contributing 38 % of total energy products. Conclusions: In extraction methods without drying the yeast, increasing lipid yield and decreasing the residence time for lipid accumulation are important for the energy and mass balance. Changing the lipid extraction method from wet to dry makes the greatest change to the mass and energy balance. Bioreactor agitation and aeration for lipid accumulation and yeast propagation is energy demanding. Changes in sugar concentration in the hydrolysate and residence times for lipid accumulation greatly affect electricity demand, but have relatively small impacts on fossil energy use (NER) and energy yield (EE). The impact would probably be greater if externally produced electricity were used...|$|E

The XRD patterns of the fresh catalysts, including the bare CaO, showed lines ascribable to CaO and Ca(OH) (2).

The fuels included a fed batch deoxygenation of canola derived fatty acids (DCFA), a fed batch deoxygenation of canola derived fatty acids with varying amounts of H 2 used during the deoxygenation process (DCFAH), a continuous deoxygenation of canola derived fatty acids (CDCFA), fed batch deoxygenation of lauric acid (DLA), and a third reaction to isomerize the products of the deoxygenated canola derived fatty acid alkanes (IPCF). Diesel, jet fuel, and <b>biodiesel</b> (<b>FAME)</b> have been used as benchmarks for comparing with the newer renewable fuels. The results of the experiments show slightly lower mechanical efficiency but better brake specific fuel consumption for the new renewable fuels. Results from combustion show shorter ignition delays for most of the renewable (deoxygenated) fuels with the exception of fed batch deoxygenation of lauric acid. Combustion results also show lower peak in-cylinder pressures, reduced rate of increase in cylinder pressure, and lower heat release rates for the renewable fuels. Emission results show an increase in hydrocarbon emissions for renewable deoxygenated fuels, but a general decrease in all other emissions including NOx, greenhouse gases, and soot. Results also demonstrate that isomers of the alkanes resulting from the deoxygenation of the canola derived fatty acids could be a potential replacement to conventional fossil diesel and biodiesel based on the experiments in this work...|$|E

As the reserves of petroleum fuel are expected to be depleted within a few decades, finding alternative fuels that are economically viable and sustainable to replace the petroleum fuel has attracted much research attention. In this work, the spray and atomization characteristics were investigated for commercial No. 2 diesel fuel, <b>biodiesel</b> (<b>FAME)</b> derived from waste cooking oil (B 100), 20 % biodiesel blended diesel fuel (B 20), renewable diesel fuel produced in house, and civil aircraft jet fuel (Jet-A). Droplet diameters and particle size distributions were measured by a laser diffraction particle analyzing system and the spray tip penetrations and cone angles were acquired using a high speed imaging technique. All experiments were conducted by employing a common-rail high-pressure fuel injection system with a single-hole nozzle under room temperature and pressure. The experimental results showed that biodiesel and jet fuel had different features compared with diesel. Longer spray tip penetration and larger droplet diameters were observed for B 100. The smaller droplet size of the Jet-A were believed to be caused by its relatively lower viscosity and surface tension. B 20 showed similar characteristics to diesel but with slightly larger droplet sizes and shorter tip penetration. Renewable diesel fuel showed closer droplet size and spray penetration to Jet-A with both smaller than diesel. As a result, optimizing the trade-off between spray volume and droplet size for different fuels remains a great challenge. However, high-pressure injection helps to optimize the trade-off of spray volume and droplet sizes. Furthermore, it was observed that the smallest droplets were within a region near the injector nozzle tip and grew larger along the axial and radial direction. The variation of droplet diameters became smaller with increasing injection pressure. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{esterification}} of free {{fatty acids}} (FFA) found in crude palm oil (CPO) off grade with methanol is a promising technique to convert FFA into valuable fatty acid methyl ester (<b>FAME,</b> <b>biodiesel)</b> and obtain a FFA-free oil that can be further transesterified using alkali bases. In this work, {{the effects of the}} main variables involved in the esterification process i. e. alcohol to oil molar ratio, reaction temperature, agitation speed and the initial amount of FFA of oil, were studied in the presence of sulphuric acid as catalyst at concentration of 1 %-w. The experimental results show that the esterification process could lead to a practical and cost effective FFA removal unit in front of typical oil transesterification for biodiesel production.

40|$|Analysis of MDS (multi {{dimensional}} scaling) {{is performed}} {{to determine the}} level of sustainability of Biodiesel as Biofuel Utilization in Jakarta and its surrounding area. Sustainability assessment based on scoring by the experts for each attribute in each dimension of sustainability assessment. Dimensions of sustainability are considered consists of the environmental dimension, the economic, social, technological, and policy. The {{results showed that the}} five dimensions of sustainability, only environmental and technological dimensions beyond the sustainability index. While the other three dimensions, namely social, economic, and policy do not meet the sustainability index. So that the overall average value of the sustainability of Biodiesel as Biosolar (mixing between automotive diesel engine and <b>biodiesel</b> or <b>FAME)</b> utilization in such area also has not met the required sustainability index. However the counter measures can be applied to leverage these problems is to increase socialization and education, simultaneously the technical regulations that could encourage greater variety of sensitive attributes in each dimension, and make the application of policy incentives and disincentives to support it. The first priority step can be started from the improvement in the social dimension attributes through efforts to raise public awareness of the use of Biodiesel as biofuel. This will indirectly encourage the improvement that will attribute the economic dimension with the increasing value-added agro-industry products. In order t...|$|R

The effect of transesterification {{variables such as}} methanol to oil ratio, reaction time, volume of solvent, reaction temperature, initial addition of water, agitation speed and quantity of immobilized lipase on molar conversion (%) was monitored. A maximum molar conversion of 62.23 % with respect to methyl oleate (with 91.5 % yield) was obtained after a reaction time of 36  h at 34 °C in the presence o 10 U immobilized lipase using methanol to oil ratio of 1 : 1 and solvent to oil ratio of 1 : 0.6. The FAME’s production was not influenced {{by the addition of}} water up to 20 % (v/v). The immobilized lipase was reusable for six cycles with retaining the relative activity of more than 95 %.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} {{deals with}} the characterisation of Jatropha curcas seeds and the oil obtained hereof. The analyzed seeds have been harvested from hedges and plantations in the regions of Teriya Bugu and Bla in Mali in the years 2009 and 2010. The oil is obtained through solvent extraction. Parameters analyzed are those which are relevant for processing of the oil into fatty acid methyl ester (<b>FAME,</b> <b>biodiesel),</b> and include acid value, fatty acid profile and contents of S, P, K, Na, Ca and Mg. All oil samples are suitable for processing into biodiesel, {{but some of them}} require pre-treatment because of high contents of free fatty acids and phosphorous. The margin of deviation of acid value and element contents throughout the oil samples depends on the way of cultivation, harvest and storage of the Jatropha curcas plants and seeds. Despite high acid values, all oil samples show high oxidation stability. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
