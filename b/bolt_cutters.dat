25|$|Gabrion's {{whereabouts}} were unknown, but {{he quickly}} became a prime suspect in her death. A search warrant was executed for his residence and keys that matched the padlock used to secure Rachel's body were found at Gabrion's home along with concrete blocks stained with the same paint as the ones retrieved from the lake. Marvin's nephew, Mikey Gabrion, also led police to a campsite that had frequently been used by his uncle. Gabrion's tent was found there, along with <b>bolt</b> <b>cutters,</b> chain, duct tape, a woman's hair clip, and nipples for a baby bottle.|$|E
25|$|Team Cobra {{attacked}} at 0400 hours. They {{killed three}} guards, {{and drove the}} others away. Sergeant Te used <b>bolt</b> <b>cutters</b> to cut open chains lashing shut the bamboo bars. Phisit Intharathat, a former Thai commando, was released {{from one of the}} sunken cells. To Te's surprise, he found 82 prisoners instead of the expected 40. This overloaded the capacity of the arranged helilift extraction. An urgent radio call was forwarded through the relay aircraft orbiting overhead, appealing for more copters. Air America responded by waiving the usual two pilots per chopper rule, and pulling helicopters out of maintenance. Even as the call went through, some of the released locals dispersed towards their homes.|$|E
25|$|Green anarchist Tre Arrow was {{sought by}} the FBI in {{connection}} with an ELF arson on April 15, 2001 at Ross Island Sand and Gravel in Portland, torching three trucks amounting of $200,000 in damage. Another arson occurred a month later at Ray Schoppert Logging Company in Estacada, Oregon, on June 1, 2001 against logging trucks and a front loader, resulting in $50,000 damage. Arrow was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} in Oregon and charged with four felonies for this crime on October 18, 2002. On March 13, 2004, after fleeing to British Columbia, he was arrested in Victoria for stealing <b>bolt</b> <b>cutters</b> and was also charged with being in Canada illegally. He was then sentenced on August 12, 2008 to 78 months in federal prison for his part in the arson and conspiracy ELF attacks in 2001.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main event}} was the Barbed Wire Steel Cage {{match for the}} WWE Championship between John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL) and The Big Show. JBL took the early {{advantage}} in the match and tried to climb the cage to escape but was stopped by the barbed wire. He then sent Big Show into the cage, causing him to bleed. Big Show took control, prompting JBL's Cabinet to interfere. Orlando Jordan attempted to climb the cage as the Basham Brothers used a pair of <b>bolt</b> <b>cutters</b> to cut a small hole in the cage. General Manager Theodore Long ejected the Cabinet from ringside but Jordan passed the <b>bolt</b> <b>cutters</b> through the cage to JBL. JBL used them to hit Big Show with for a near-fall. Big Show performed a chokeslam from the top rope, sending JBL through the ring. Big Show broke through the cage door but JBL had escaped, meaning JBL retained the title. Big Show then attacked JBL after the match until the Cabinet intervened. They attacked Big Show until Batista made the save and John Cena attacked JBL.|$|E
2500|$|On the Friday {{night before}} the 1979 festival was officially opened, the festival [...] {{attendance}} had already reached its maximum capacity. At 3 am Saturday morning Peter {{was on the phone}} negotiating paddocks from neighboring farms, while Fred, Mike and Bernie were out {{in the dead of night}} with <b>bolt</b> <b>cutters,</b> removing fences to allow cars and campers into newly acquired festival acreage. By 11 am Saturday morning on opening day, the traffic police closed the festival, and were telling people to go home, announcing on radio that the event could accommodate no more patrons. They ordered the organizers to remove the entry gates to free the roads, as vehicles and pedestrians were banked up in all directions for some 20 kilometers. But still they arrived. Some 5 kilometers towards Waihi a tent city spontaneously arose on a neighboring farm where approximately 15,000 people parked and then walked the final leg into the festival site. Others abandoned their vehicles in Waihi itself and made the pilgrimage to Nambassa on foot.|$|E

Both MESA- 2 D and DYNA 3 D have been used to evaluate the role of several design parameters on the performance of a satellite separation system <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter.</b> Due to a lack of high strain rate response data for the materials involved, the properties for the <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> and the <b>bolt</b> were selected to achieve agreement between computer simulation and observed characteristics of the recovered test hardware. The calculations provided insight into design parameters such as the cutter blade kinetic energy, the preload on the bolt, the relative position of the anvil, and the anvil shape. Modeling of the cutting process clarifies metallographic observation of both cut and uncut bolts obtained from several tests. Understanding the physical processes involved in <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> operation may suggest certain design modifications that could improve performance margin without increasing environmental shock response levels...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{this case}} report we {{describe}} {{the case of a}} 36 -year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a grossly swollen scrotum. Nine galvanized iron rings were placed around his scrotum for the enhancement of his sexual performance. Attempts to remove them with lubricants, ring cutters, pliers, and orthopedic bone cutters were unsuccessful. Finally, they were removed with a hydraulic <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> borrowed from the fire department. Genital incarceration or strangulation represents a true urological emergency.

50|$|Kensington locks are not {{designed}} to be an impervious protection measure. Because most computer equipment cases are generally made of plastic or thin metal, the lock can be torn out, though not without doing significant visible damage to the case. The cable itself can be cut if an individual has a wire <b>cutter</b> or <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> sufficiently strong {{to cut through the}} cable material, which will vary between different brands of cable. The Kensington type locks are useful to discourage quick grab-and-run thefts of equipment from casually supervised locations such as coffee shops, but cannot prevent the removal of equipment secured in an unattended location.|$|R

40|$|Strangulation of {{the penis}} by {{application}} of constricting devices may present {{a challenge for}} the treating physician. Depending {{on the type of}} constricting material, special equipment is essential for successful removal of the foreign bodies. We report a new form of constricting device, the neck of a Coca Cola bottle made of Pentaethylene-terephthalate (PET). Particular difficulties were encountered upon removal. Technical details of this case are described. Prior literature on the treatment of penile strangulation is discussed. KEY WORDS: penis; strangulation; constriction; autoeroticism. CASE REPORT A 69 -year old man presented to the emergency room at 4 a. m. The man was drunk, wrapped in a blanket, and obviously suffering from pain in the genital area. Removal of the blanket disclosed a grossly swollen dark, red penis completely stuck inside a 1. 5 l Coca Cola PET bottle. The man had inserted his penis into the bottle for autoerotic purposes. The bottle neck was located directly at the penile base and penile swelling prevented even a turning of the bottle. Reluctantly, the patient reported insertion of his penis into the bottle more than 10 hr ago. His repeated at-tempts of removal of the bottle had remained unsuccessful. By use of a <b>bolt</b> <b>cutter</b> available in the emergency room, the bottle was incised below its neck. Attempts to position the cutter at the bottle neck were unsuccessful. As shown in Fig. 1, bottle necks of PET bottles are equipped with a wide collar and manufactured from particularly firm material. Since the branches of wire cutters open for a maximum width of only 1. 5 cm, cutting of a PET bottle neck is impossible. The idea of using a manually operate...|$|R
