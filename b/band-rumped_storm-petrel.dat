50|$|In December 2009, KIUC {{participated in}} {{hearings}} regarding {{its plan to}} minimize the effects its operations have on three endangered Hawaiian birds, the ʻuaʻu, the ʻaʻo, and the <b>band-rumped</b> <b>storm-petrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|The band-rumped {{storm petrel}} is 19-21 cm in length with a 43-46 cm wingspan, and weighs 44-49 g. It is mainly {{brownish}} black with an extensive white rump. Similar to Leach's storm petrel with the forked tail, long wings, but Leach's {{has a more}} deeply forked tail, a differently shaped (V-shaped or triangular) white rump, and a 'tern-like' flight, whereas the <b>band-rumped</b> <b>storm-petrel</b> has a more 'shearwater-like' flight.|$|E
40|$|Specimens (a downy fledgling and a hatch-year juvenile) and nocturnal calling of the <b>Band-rumped</b> <b>Storm-Petrel</b> (Oceanodroma castro) are {{evidence}} that this rare seabird breeds {{on the island of}} Hawaii. Noctumal calling over land and sightings near the coast indicate that populations nest on the southwest rift and possibly the upper western slope of Mauna Loa...|$|E
40|$|The {{diet and}} {{breeding}} ecology of Yellowlegged Gulls (Larus michahellis atlantis) were studied on Selvagem Grande, North Atlantic in the nesting season of 2007. We collected and analyzed 715 pellets from adults. The most frequent prey were White-faced Stormpetrels (Pelagodroma marina; present on 40. 8 % of all pellets) and the endemic land snails (Theba macandrewiana; present on 36. 5 % of all pellets). Other birds, namely Cory’s Shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea), Macaronesian Shearwaters (Puffinus assimilis), Bulwer’s Petrels (Bulweria bulwerii), and <b>Band-rumped</b> <b>Storm-petrels</b> (Oceanodroma castro) were relatively less frequent, but overall, seabirds {{were present in}} ca. 50 % of all pellets, representing an estimated 60. 4 % of all mass consumed by gulls. We estimate that the contribution of seabirds to the overall caloric balance accounted for 82. 5 % of all energy consumed. The number of gull pairs breeding on Selvagem Grande was 12 on 2005 and 2007. Breeding success was low (0. 92 and 0. 25 juveniles per breeding pair, respectively). Us ing a simple bioenergetics model, we estimate the breeding gull population to {{have the potential to}} consume approximately 4, 847 adult/sub-adult seabirds in 3. 5 months in order to meet its energetic requirements. The importance of the estimated predation levels is discussed and some management actions are suggested...|$|R
40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. This report combines data for procellariiform seabird colony searches conducted in 2005, sporadic surveys for procellariiformes between 2001 and 2005, as well as seabird radar surveys conducted in 2002 at Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park. The objectives of these surveys were to inventory procellariiform species diversity and identify seabird flight corridors and breeding seabird colony sites within park boundaries. Specifically, goals were to locate nesting colonies of Newell’s Shearwater (Puffinus auricularis newelli) which is listed as threatened by the US Fish and Wildlife Service and <b>Band-rumped</b> <b>Storm-Petrel</b> (Oceanodroma castro), a candidate species for listing. Radar surveys were intended to provide information to assist in targeted foot searches for seabird colonies. Reports and results of radar surveys are summarized, but no new radar surveys were conducted in 2005. We performed nighttime and daytime auditory and visual surveys at a variety of locations and a range of elevations within Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park to document Newell’s Shearwater and <b>Band-rumped</b> <b>Storm-Petrel</b> activity. Data from nighttime auditory surveys and incidental reports collected in previous years are also summarized. Seabirds recorded at high elevations included Hawaiian Petrels (Pterodroma sandwichensis), federally listed as endangered, and Band-rumped Storm. We identified one possible <b>Band-rumped</b> <b>Storm-Petrel</b> nest location, but only continued monitoring will confirm nesting. We did not detect any Newell’s Shearwaters at mid-elevation sites. However, based on incidental reports of Newell’s Shearwaters calling repeatedly near the trailhead of the Kalapana trail, the rain forest remaining in the East Rift Zone {{is likely to be the}} one location at which this species continues to nest at Hawai`i Volcanoes National Park. We also documented Newell’s Shearwaters at a coastal location, but the birds were most likely prospecting for or transitting to nesting sites.

40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. We conducted presence or absence and distribution surveys for seabirds throughout Haleakalā National Park from April through August 2005. Results showed the presence of `Ua`u (Hawaiian Petrel, Pterodroma sandwichensis), Koa`e Kea (White-tailed Tropicbird, Phaethon lepturus dorotheae), `Iwa (Great Frigatebird, Fregata minor palmerstoni), and Noio (Hawaiian Noddy, Anous minutus melanogenys). Although `A`o (Newell's Shearwater, Puffinus auricularis newelli) was not detected during the survey, this species is often heard in Kīpahulu Valley. `Ake`ake (<b>Band-rumped</b> <b>Storm-Petrel,</b> Oceanodroma castro) were not detected during the surveys but are likely to occur in Haleakalā National Park. Haleakalā National Park and the National Park Service Pacific Island Network Inventory and Monitoring program funded this project...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of sympatric speciation (the evolution of reproductive isolation between codistributed populations) in generating biodiversity is highly controversial. Whereas potential examples of sympatric speciation exist for plants, insects, and fishes, most theoretical models {{suggest that it}} requires conditions that are probably not common in nature, and only two possible cases have been described for tetrapods. One mechanism by which it could occur is through allochronic isolation-separation of populations by breeding time. Oceanodroma castro (the Madeiran or <b>band-rumped</b> <b>storm-petrel)</b> is a small seabird that nests on tropical and subtropical islands throughout the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In at least five archipelagos, different individuals breed on the same islands in different seasons. We compared variation in five micro-satellite loci and the mitochondrial control region among 562 O. castro from throughout the species' range. We found that sympatric seasonal populations differ genetically within all five archipelagos and have ceased to exchange genes in two. Population and gene trees all indicate that seasonal populations within four of the archipelagos are {{more closely related to}} each other than to populations from the same season from other archipelagos; divergence of the fifth sympatric pair is too ancient for reliable inference. Thus, seasonal populations appear to have arisen sympatrically at least four times. This is the first evidence for sympatric speciation by allochrony in a tetrapod, and adds to growing indications that population differentiation and speciation can occur without geographic barriers to gene flow...|$|E
40|$|Modified marine {{surveillance}} radar {{was used to}} study the presence/ absence, abundance, and flight activity of four nocturnal species: Hawaiian darkrumped petrel [Pterodroma phaeopygia sandwichensis (Ridgeway) ], Newell's shearwater [Puffinus auricularis newelli (Henshaw) ], <b>Band-rumped</b> <b>storm-petrel</b> [Oceanodroma castro (Harcourt)), and Hawaiian hoary bat (Lasiurus cinereus semotus Sanborn & Crespo). Hawaiian seabirds were recorded flying to or from inland nesting colonies at seven sampling sites on the windward {{side of the island}} of Hawai'i. In total, 527 radar "targets" identified as petrel or shearwater-type on the basis of speed, flight behavior, and radar signal strength were observed during eight nights of sampling. Mean movement rates (targets per minute) for seabird targets were 0. 1, 0. 1, 0. 3, 3. 8, 0. 9, and 2. 2 for surveys at Kahakai, Kapoho, Mauna Loa, Pali Uli, Pu'ulena Crater, and Waipi'o Valley, respectively. Two percent of the petrel and shearwater-type targets detected on radar were confirmed visually or aurally. Flight paths for seabird targets showed strong directionality at six sampling sites. Mean flight speed for seabird targets (n = 524) was 61 km/hr for all survey areas. Peak detection times for seabirds were from 0430 to 0530 hours for birds flying to sea and 2000 to 2150 hours for birds returning to colonies. Most inland, low elevation sampling sites could not be surveyed reliably for seabirds during the evening activity periods because of radar interference from insects and rapidly flying bats. At those inland sites predawn sampling was the best time for using radar to detect Hawaiian seabirds moving seaward. Hawaiian hoary bats were recorded at eight sampling sites. Eighty-six to 89 radar targets that exhibited erratic flight behavior were identified as "batlike" targets; 17 % of these batlike radar targets were confirmed visually. Band-rumped storm-petrels were not identified during our surveys...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a {{detailed study of}} the diet of various procellariiformes using new molecular approaches. Dietary studies remove fundamental blocks {{to our understanding of}} the structure of food webs, and provide insights into the demographic regulation of populations and the structuring of communities. The study species were the <b>Band-rumped</b> <b>Storm-petrel</b> (Hydrobates castro), Bulwer’s petrel (Bulweria bulwerii), Cory’s shearwater (Calonectris borealis) and White-faced Storm-petrel (Pelagodroma marina). The breeding colonies of the Madeiran-archipelago are Important Bird Areas (IBA) in the North-Atlantic, but little is known about the predator-prey relationships of its seabird populations. This probably relates to difficulties associated with obtaining robust prey estimates and the need to develop new methodologies to improving the resolution of species identification. Here, new molecular approaches were developed to recover prey from faeces and stomach contents using DNA-barcoding and high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The results obtained show clear improvements to the identification of the diets of procellariiformes, considerably outperforming morphological analysis, and retrieving prey identities from non-invasive faecal remains. Such approaches further showed that sympatric small seabirds of the sub-tropical NE-Atlantic significantly segregated their resources, while showing similar prey types with the species distributed in the Pacific, indicating that these petrels maintain foraging specialization across their distribution range. Foraging efficiency in seabirds has been widely hypothesized to change according to the moon cycle. Predators either optimise foraging during moonlit nights or reduce foraging effort because less accessible prey migrate downward the water column to avoid visual predators. I tested whether prey composition and diversity differ between moon-phases. However, I found no evidence for a significant influence of the moon on the diet of Bulwer’s petrel, contradicting previous ecological assumptions. The results highlight the potential of DNA methodologies to the understanding of marine food webs and predator-prey relationships and will certainly make important contributions to marine community ecology...|$|E
