40|$|Thesis (PhD (Viticulture and Oenology. Wine Biotechnology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Although bananas {{are widely}} grown {{worldwide}} in many tropical {{and a few}} subtropical countries, banana beverages are still among the fruit beverages processed by use of rudimentary methods {{such as the use}} of feet or/and spear grass to extract juice. Because banana juice and beer remained on a home made basis, there is a research drive to come up with modern technologies to more effectively process bananas and to make acceptable <b>banana</b> juices and <b>wines.</b> One of the main hindrances in the production of highly desirable beverages is the pectinaceous nature of the banana fruit, which makes juice extraction and clarification very difficult. Commercial enzyme applications seem to be the major way forward in solving processing problems in order to improve <b>banana</b> juice and <b>wine</b> quality. The particular pectinolytic enzymes that were selected for this study are Rapidase CB, Rapidase TF, Rapidase X-press and OE-Lallzyme. In addition this study, investigate the applicability of recombinant yeast strains with pectinolytic, xylanolytic, glucanolytic and amylolytic activities in degrading the banana polysaccharides (pectin, xylan, glucan starch) for juice and wine extraction and product clarification. The overall objective of this research was to improve <b>banana</b> juice and <b>wine</b> by enzymatic processing techniques and to improve alcoholic fermentation and to produce limpid and shelf-stable products of clarified juice and wine. The focus was on applying the selected commercial enzyme preparations specifically for the production of better clarified <b>banana</b> juice and <b>wine.</b> This is because the turbid banana juice and beer, which contain suspended solids that are characterised by a very intense banana flavour, require a holistic approach to address challenges and opportunities in order to process pure banana beverages with desirable organoleptic qualities. The specific objectives of applying commercial enzymes in the processing of <b>banana</b> juice and <b>wine,</b> comparing with grape winemaking practices, use of recombinant yeast and analyses of various parameters in the juices and wines made have enabled generation of information that could be of help to prospective <b>banana</b> juice and <b>wine</b> processors.

40|$|Considering {{a rising}} demand for novel food products, enriched with {{functional}} properties, and fruits {{as the main}} source of diversity for food formulations, this work focuses on the application of alcoholic and acetic fermentation processes to obtain novel food products with antioxidant potential. Besides generating differentiated food grade products, fermentation allows an extension of the shelf-life of the raw materials and the use of fruits not suitable for direct sale due to morphological nonconformities or advanced maturation. For this, we used industrially processed concentrates of orange, cherry, mango and banana to produce fruit wines and fruit vinegars. The use of concentrates allowed the production of fruit wines with ethanol yields between 8. 66 ± 0. 51 % (v/v) and 12. 79 ± 0. 23 % (v/v), with characteristics close to a wine grade product. From fruit wines, fruit vinegars were produced with total acidities close to 5 % as expected for this type of vinegar. Total antioxidant activity was assessed in the fruit wines and vinegars by FRAP, allowing an insight of fermentation impact on the antioxidant potential of the fermented fruit products. Orange and cherry wines and vinegars demonstrated higher antioxidant potential when compared with mango and <b>banana</b> <b>wines</b> and vinegars. Antioxidant activities in fruit wines ranged between 7144. 05 ± 770. 41 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for mango wine and 28040. 00 ± 1848. 10 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for cherry wine. In fruit vinegars, antioxidant activities ranged from 3700. 95 ± 349. 41 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for banana vinegar to 18563. 81 ± 2333. 94 μmol Fe 2 SO 4 /L for cherry vinegar. Overall, fruit wines showed 0. 5 to 0. 9 folds higher antioxidant activities than the one reported as naturally occurring in the given fruits. Fermentation impact on antioxidant activity of fruits was low, being observed a reduction of total antioxidant activity from 0. 1 to 0. 2 folds during alcoholic fermentation and in a higher range from 0. 1 to 0. 5 folds in vinegars.

Methods: In total, 35 372 women, aged 35 – 69 years at recruitment, were selected to ensure a wide range of dietary intakes. Diet was assessed by a 217 -item food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Detailed lifestyle information was collected by postal questionnaire. Vegetarians, fish-eaters and meat-eaters were compared. Results: The cohort women are mainly white, well-educated, middle-class and married with children. They are health-conscious with only 11 % current smokers and 58 % taking dietary supplements. Twenty-eight per cent of subjects self-report as being vegetarian and 1 % as vegan. However, only 18 % are defined as 'vegetarian' from the FFQ. Fat provides 32 % of energy; vitamin and mineral intakes are high, with a broad range of intakes. Meat-eaters are older, with a higher body mass index (BMI) and the lowest intakes of carbohydrate, fibre, vitamin C, folate, iron and calcium. Other fish-eaters are similar to vegetarians. Vegetarians have the lowest intakes of protein, fat and saturated fat. Oily fish-eaters have the lowest BMI; are the least likely to smoke or use full-fat milk; and are the most likely to use dietary supplements and consume the most fruit and vegetables. Oily fish-eaters have the highest total energy intake and vegetarians the lowest.

Four national settings and seven product categories are compared – coffee, cocoa, <b>bananas,</b> sugar, rice, <b>wine,</b> and honey in Austria, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the USA are chosen and analyzed between the years 2002 and 2011. The effects of the discourse and structural preconditions (i. e. oligopolies) are analyzed in concert through the application of fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). I investigate the role of firms and social movements in the process of change. Two equifinal paths to change in markets are theorized and analyzed. One of those paths is driven by institutional entrepreneurship, the other by social movements. The findings of the fsQCA back the perspective of social movements and institutional entrepreneurship as substitutive drivers of change in markets and the two paths. Less successful attempts to penetrate markets though certification lack the discourse and the focus of single firms or entrepreneurs within the discourse. In addition, the evidence pinpoints to changing processes over time and the need to move beyond static analyses. This study contributes to the current state of the art by offering a comparative perspective on the effect of social movements and institutional entrepreneurship on mature markets. In this vein, fsQCA is applied deductively and the concepts and paths are disentangled in a compelling manner. INUS conditions are theorized as constitutive parts of paths to change. Finally, this study compares the opportunities and fallacies of penetrating markets through certification in general - and Fair Trade certification in particular...|$|R
30|$|Pawpaw, banana and {{watermelon}} are tropical fruits {{with short}} shelf-lives under the prevailing temperatures and humid conditions in tropical countries like Nigeria. Production of wine from these fruits {{could help reduce}} the level of post-harvest loss and increase variety of <b>wines.</b> Pawpaw, <b>banana</b> and watermelon were used to produce mixed fruit wines using Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated from palm wine. Exactly 609 and 406  g each of the fruits in two-mixed and three-mixed fruit fermentation respectively were crushed using laboratory blender, mixed with distilled water (1 : 1 w/v), and heated for 30  min with subsequent addition of sugar (0.656  kg). The fruit musts were subjected to primary (aerobic) and secondary (anaerobic) fermentation for 4 and 21  days respectively. During fermentation, aliquots {{were removed from the}} fermentation tank for analysis. During primary fermentation, consistent increases in alcohol contents (ranging from 0.0 to 15.0  %) and total acidities (ranging from 0.20 to 0.80  %) were observed with gradual decrease in specific gravities (ranging from 1.060 to 0.9800) and pH (ranging from 4.80 to 2.90). Temperature ranged from 27  °C to 29  °C. The alcoholic content of the final wines were 17.50  ±  0.02  % (pawpaw and watermelon), 16.00  ±  0.02  % (pawpaw and banana), 18.50  ±  0.02  % (<b>banana</b> and watermelon <b>wine)</b> and 18.00  ±  0.02  % (pawpaw, banana and watermelon). The alcoholic content of the wines did not differ significantly (p >  0.05). The pH of all the wines were acidic and ranged from 2.5  ±  0.01 to 3.8  ±  0.01 (p >  0.05). The acid concentration (residual and volatile acidity) were within the acceptable limit and ranged from 0.35  ±  0.02 to 0.88  ±  0.01  % (p >  0.05). Sensory evaluation (P >  0.05) rated the wines acceptability as ‘pawpaw and banana wine’ > ‘pawpaw and watermelon’ > ‘pawpaw, watermelon and banana’ > ‘banana and watermelon wine’.
