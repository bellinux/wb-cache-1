25|$|The Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad is {{situated}} in the northern province of Punjab and is a modern and well-equipped stadium. <b>But</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> how impressive a venue is, not much {{can be done about}} the weather and Faisalabad has suffered {{at the hands of the}} elements. In 1998–99 fog caused the third Test against Zimbabwe was abandoned without a ball being bowled, while bad light is often an issue especially for matches played during the winter. However, when play has been possible, some memorable performances have taken place. An exciting Test was played out in 1997–98 when South Africa skittles Pakistan for 92, successfully defending a target of 142 on the final day. Then, in 2004–05, Sanath Jayasuriya smashed 253 as Sri Lanka powered to a 201-run victory. But the ground is most famous for the confrontation between Mike Gatting and Shakoor Rana during England's 1987–88 tour, which led to a day being lost during the match and some long-lasting bad feeling between the teams.PCB(Pakistan Cricket Board) also conducts its domestic tournaments at this venue.Recencently, Super 8 T20 was held here from 11 to 18 May.The stadium itself is only 2km out of the city centre, which can be reached by a walk through the tree-lined suburbs.|$|E
25|$|Zach {{comes into}} the {{knowledge}} that Kendall agreed to act as the surrogate for Ryan and Greenlee's baby when Greenlee's chances of giving birth became non-existent. He utterly hates the idea, and is determined to ensure Kendall will not go through with it. Once Ryan reveals himself to be alive a little after this, Kendall comes to the shocking realization that her husband helped Ryan fake his death. She is enraged at Zach, and states that she never would have taken {{on the task of}} being Greenlee's surrogate if she had known that Ryan is alive. Zach and Kendall fight on and off, <b>but</b> <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> their argumentative nature, Zach has developed true romantic feelings for Kendall. At this point, Greenlee has discovered that Kendall is pregnant not with Greenlee and Ryan's baby, but rather with Kendall and Ryan's baby. She spills this knowledge to the whole town, stating that Kendall has betrayed her in order to produce a child between Ryan and herself. Kendall is embarrassed and heartbroken at Greenlee's accusation, and tries to explain that Greenlee's eggs had been destroyed at implantation time, and if she had not used her own eggs, Greenlee would have been without Ryan's child for certain. Greenlee does not care to listen and soon leaves town. Zach sticks by Kendall's side and tells her of his love for her. Kendall is afraid of his declaration, and starts to distance herself from him. She asks for a divorce, not admitting that she feels the same way. Zach agrees to grant her a divorce, but Bianca Montgomery, Kendall's sister, counsels Zach to not give up on Kendall. Zach does as suggested, and informs Kendall of his love for her again. This time Kendall does not hold back and the two share a passionate kiss.|$|E

Wirkola stated he [...] "just wanted this crazy, mashed-up world where you can’t pinpoint where it is, or when it is" [...] and the modern elements are there to [...] "add to the fun and tone of the film."
