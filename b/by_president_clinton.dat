5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} <b>by</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> on August 22, 1996.|$|E
5|$|For twoyears {{after the}} bombing the only {{memorials}} to the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people at a security fence surrounding {{the site of the}} building. Many suggestions for suitable memorials were sent to Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set up until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemorate the victims of the bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design was chosen unanimously by a 15-member panel from 624submissions. The memorial was designed at a cost of $29million, which was raised by public and private funds. The memorial is part of the National Park Service and was designed by Oklahoma City architects Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated <b>by</b> <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> on April 19, 2000, exactly five years {{after the bombing}}. Within the first year, it had 700,000visitors.|$|E

In 1997, Holbrooke became a special envoy to Cyprus and the Balkans on a pro-bono basis as a private citizen.
