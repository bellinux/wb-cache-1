These planets may have vast {{differences}} in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds, although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.|$|E
5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes he may <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are {{proving to be}} true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, {{saying that it is}} all he has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to a fork in the road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse of the Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom was estimated to <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With {{the increased use of}} the Case Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E

5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> their grip.|$|E

25|$|The diesel railcars were {{an attempt}} to carry light {{passenger}} traffic at lower cost, but since 1918 competition from road transport had severely reduced the line's income; motor lorries abstracted goods traffic and omnibuses reduced passenger carryings. The process continued relentlessly, affecting passenger and goods business. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948, the line was said to <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> £20,000 on its passenger operation, and the decision was taken to stop running passenger trains. The last such train ran on 4 January 1959.|$|E

The 328 had the advantages of being both quieter and faster than many of its rivals, however this did not ensure its commercial success.

25|$|The first season's {{main focus}} is Serena van der Woodsen's sudden {{return to the}} Upper East Side {{following}} her mysterious disappearance. Everyone is extremely shocked at her sudden return after first sightings of her spread across the web, when she is spotted at Grand Central station including her best friend, Blair Waldorf. It turns out Serena returns from Boarding School to see her suicidal brother, Eric. Blair soon finds out that Serena had slept with her boyfriend, Nate Archibald, the night of her disappearance. Meanwhile, Brooklyn boy Dan Humphrey and Serena begin dating while Nate struggles with his feelings for Blair. The two try to salvage what's left of their relationship, only leaving Blair to lose her virginity to Nate's best friend, Chuck Bass, instead. Jenny Humphrey constantly tries {{to make it in}} this upscale world by following around Blair and her friends. Rufus Humphrey, her father, worries that Jenny may <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> herself as she strives for popularity. Vanessa Abrams, Dan's best friend, returns. We find out that Dan had confessed his love for Vanessa in the past, but the two move beyond this as friends, considering Dan is now with Serena. It is discovered that Lilly van der Woodsen and Rufus Humphrey have a romantic past, yet both struggle with other relationships. The two decide to see other people in light of their children's romance. Blair and Nate eventually break up, after finally having sex, despite her affair with Chuck. Nate finds out about the affair and he and Chuck stop associating with one another. Throughout the season, Chuck tries to seduce Blair and the two somewhat come to terms with their feelings for each other. Georgina Sparks, past friend of Serena, comes back and causes havoc, including outing Eric van der Woodsen. Georgina's return reminds Serena of the real reason she left the Upper East Side. Problems erupt between Dan and Serena, since Serena tries to hide her secret from him and Georgina (pretending to be Sarah) manipulates Dan. It is revealed that the true reason Serena left the Upper East Side was because she was involved in a drug-related death and felt responsible for the situation. However, the incident is finally resolved and Georgina leaves. However, Dan and Serena's relationship is in ruins and the two decide to break it off. Meanwhile, Lilly accepts her proposal from Bart Bass, despite her ever-present feelings for Rufus, and the season ends with a Bass wedding and Blair waiting for Chuck at the airport.|$|E
