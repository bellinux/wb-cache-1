50|$|Cardiac traumas such as {{myocardial}} infarction (commonly called a heart attack), myocarditis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, cardiogenic shock , and takotsubo cardiomyopathy {{result in an}} impaired ability of the heart to pump blood. Without proper blood flow the person will ultimately die. Maintaining sufficient cardiac output is the primary objective of therapeutic approaches treating these cardiac conditions. However, many therapies aimed at increasing cardiac output place further stress on the heart. In this way a well-document vicious cycle begins in which increased cardiac output is required, {{but in order to}} achieve this the heart must work harder. This exacerbated stress leads to poorer outcomes. With the exception of cardiopulmonary <b>bypass,</b> <b>current</b> therapeutic approaches do not allow the heart to rest and recover.

Many stability investigations of the NI ReBCO coil itself have been carried out by experiments and simulations.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{of great}} {{practical}} significance to improve welding production efficiency by modifying conventional {{gas metal arc welding}} (GMAW) and increasing welding speed. In this study, an experimental system was developed to implement double-electrode gas metal arc welding (DE-GMAW) and to conduct high-speed arc welding experiments. The geometric parameters for assembling two welding torches were optimized according to the weld-bead quality in DE-GMAW experiments. Based on the measured values of the wire current I, base metal current Ibm, and <b>bypass</b> <b>current</b> Ibp, their relationship, i. e. I is the sum of Ibm and Ibp, was validated, and the scheme of DE-GMAW was realized. By means of adjusting the relative levels of the three current components, weld-bead defects such as humping and/or undercut occurring in high-speed welding can be suppressed and good weld-bead formation can be achieved. Compared with conventional GMAW, DE-GMAW can be operated at much higher welding speed without weld-bead defects occurring. The critical welding speed in DE-GMAW is increased by 28. 3 – 80. 0 per cent under the conditions employed in the experiments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{framework}} of the investigations of electrical phenomena in plants, the DC resistance of plant tissues was studied. Objects of study were the leaves of monocot plant Zea mays indurata. The DC resistance of leaves is related almost exclusively to the continual system of apoplast. Effective resistance of apoplast measured along the midrib was found to be in inverse proportion to the width of a leaf. Taking into account the macroscopic structural anisotropy of a leaf, measurements of resistance were carried out in different directions with respect to the midrib. The degree of anisotropy of apoplast conductive system was found to be marked feebly. Local incisions of leaf tissue increase the resistance insufficiently due to <b>bypass</b> <b>current</b> routes. The resistance of a leaf was measured in the course of progressive water deficit. As the leaf is dried up, the DC resistance of its living part decreases, whereas the resistance of the “dead zone ” rises sharply. The observed decrease in resistance of leaf tissue in the course of water starvation seems unexpected. It may be caused by the entry of water and salts from vacuoles through membranes into apoplast...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we propose}} a novel {{cyberspace}} defense {{solution to the}} growing sophistication of threats facing networks within the Department of Defense. Current network defense strategies, including traditional intrusion detection and firewall-based perimeter defenses, are ineffective against increasingly sophisticated social engineering attacks such as spear-phishing which exploit individuals with targeted information. These asymmetric attacks are able to <b>bypass</b> <b>current</b> network defense technologies allowing adversaries extended and often unrestricted access to portions of the enterprise. Network defense strategies are hampered by solutions favoring network-centric designs which disregard the security requirements of the specific data and information on the networks. Our solution leverages specific technology characteristics from traditional network defense systems and real-time distributed systems using publish-subscribe broker patterns to form {{the foundation of a}} full-spectrum cyber operations capability. Building on this foundation, we present the addition of covert channel communications within the distributed systems framework to protect sensitive Command and Control and Battle Management messaging from adversary intercept and exploitation. Through this combined approach, DoD and Service network defense professionals will be able to meet sophisticated cyberspace threats head-on while simultaneously protecting the data and information critical to warfighting Commands, Services and Agencies.
