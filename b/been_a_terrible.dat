The castle had long <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> nuisance to the Hanseatic cities' trade in the Sound, and the time had now come to remove it.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{stuck to}} her {{decision}} not to remarry, and made a conscious choice not to have children. She believed that motherhood should be a full-time commitment, {{and said it was}} not one she was willing to make. [...] "I would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mother," [...] she told Berg, [...] "because I'm basically a very selfish human being." [...] She felt she had partially experienced parenthood through her much younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own. Rumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn may have been a lesbian or bisexual, which she often joked about. In 2007, William J. Mann released a biography of the actress in which he argued this was the case. In response to this speculation about her aunt, Katharine Houghton said, [...] "I've never discovered any evidence whatsoever that she was a lesbian." [...] However, in a 2017 documentary, columnist Liz Smith, who was a close friend, attested to the fact that she was.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, at the 30 Rock studios, TGS with Tracy Jordan head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and {{her writing}} staff are {{discussing}} potential topics {{to use in}} the show. J. D. Lutz (John Lutz) suggests one of his sketches, [...] "Dancing with the Hobos", which Liz criticizes, thus embarrassing him in front of everyone. Later, Liz talks to Greta Johansen (Rachel Dratch), the show's cat wrangler. At the same time, she overhears Lutz calling her the C word. Outraged by this, Liz tells Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) and Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander) about what Lutz called her and wants to fire him. Frank reveals that Lutz's poor behavior is due to the passing of his grandmother. After it is pointed out that she has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> boss to the staff, Liz begins acting nice, but this backfires when they take advantage of her. Angered by this, Liz confronts the writers about their actions, and tells Lutz she knows what he called her. Liz warns all of them that if they call her that [...] "horrible word" [...] she will fire them.|$|E

2500|$|A jury at Manchester Crown Court {{took one}} hour to find 49-year-old Smith guilty of Bates' murder. Sentencing him to life imprisonment, the judge, Mr. Justice Sachs, {{recommended}} that Smith should serve a minimum term of 20 years. He stated: [...] "This has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> case; {{a catalogue of}} depravity by one human being upon another. You are a highly dangerous person. You are an abuser of women and I intend, {{so far as it}} is in my power, that you will abuse no more." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even though Sir Alan {{thought that}} Ben should have contributed {{more to the}} task and that Adele had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> leader, he {{considered}} Miranda's disrespect towards Adele to be unforgivable, particularly since {{she had been in}} the first boardroom of the series, where Adenike had been fired for exactly the same offence. Her cause was not helped by {{the fact that she had}} contributed little to the last two tasks, although Miranda claimed that Adele had effectively sidelined her by giving her the role of [...] "personal assistant" [...] in this task.|$|E
2500|$|Doolittle and his crew, after {{parachuting}} into China, received {{assistance from}} Chinese soldiers and civilians, {{as well as}} John Birch, an American missionary in China. As did the others {{who participated in the}} mission, Doolittle had to bail out, but fortunately he landed in a heap of dung (saving a previously injured ankle from breaking) in a paddy in China near Quzhou. Doolittle felt the raid had <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> failure because all the aircraft were lost, and he expected to be court-martialed on his return. He subsequently recommended Birch for intelligence work with Claire Chennault's Flying Tigers. The mission was the longest ever flown in combat by the B-25 Mitchell medium bomber, averaging about [...]|$|E

2500|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} midshipman who had distinguished himself to Captain Pigot {{during the previous}} months, but his disrating was a primary trigger to the mutiny. [...] About {{a week before the}} mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain noticed a reef knot which had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. [...] Casey was brought before the captain, and while he took full responsibly for it, Pigot further demanded that Casey get on his knees and beg for forgiveness. This would have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> insult for a gentleman, and Casey refused. The captain gave him 12 lashes, and he was disrated, which would end his career as a naval officer. [...] The crew felt Casey was punished unfairly, and the topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E
2500|$|Other critics {{expressed}} {{more negative}} {{opinions of the}} game, with many citing frequent crashes and other technical issues, along with shallow gameplay. Kallie Plagge (IGN) said that although the game lacked in polish and depth, the overall experience made up for it. Matt Peckham (Time) criticized the game for its frequent crashes. Mike Cosimano (Destructoid) also took issue with the game, saying the original idea showed promise, but was improperly executed. Kat Brewster (The Guardian) wrote that although she thought Pokémon Go {{was not a good}} game, it was [...] "a great experience". The server problems also received negative press. Miguel Concepcion (GameSpot) said that although he enjoyed the game's strong social appeal and visual design, the game's [...] "initial iteration is a buggy mess on all levels", with one of the reasons being the constant server problems. Another glitch that appeared a few days after launch was the [...] "three-step glitch", reviewers also gave this bug negative press. Patricia Hernandez (Kotaku) said, [...] "the three step glitch adds to what has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> launch for Pokémon Go". Paul Tassi (Forbes) said that due to this bug it's [...] "anyone's best guess where Pokémon are 99% of the time" [...] and that it [...] "renders almost all traditional methods of tracking pointless". Critics also emphasized on the large gap between the rural and urban players. Rural players seem to be at a major disadvantage when playing the game, while city players have access to more PokéStops and Gyms. However, the developers {{have come up with a}} solution on solving the problems rural players face daily.|$|E
