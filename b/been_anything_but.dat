5|$|Flagged {{initially}} as {{a transit}} event by the satellite, Kepler-9d {{was given the}} designation KOI 377.03. It was recognized as a potential planet after a study into the system confirmed Kepler-9b and Kepler-9c, but follow-up studies had to be completed to verify that it was indeed a planet, and that the apparent transit event was not due to a background eclipsing binary star in the aperture of Kepler's photometer. Kepler's team exhaustively disproved that the small transit event could have <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a planet, and their results {{were published in the}} Astrophysical Journal on January 1, 2011. Follow-up observations were conducted by the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer at the W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii, as well as the WIYN Observatory in Arizona and the Palomar Observatory in California.|$|E
25|$|The Police Central E-Crime Unit arrested an 18-year-old {{man from}} Shetland on 27 July 2011 {{suspected}} of being LulzSec member Topiary. They also searched {{the house of a}} 17-year-old from Lincolnshire possibly connected to the investigation, interviewing him. Scotland Yard later identified the man arrested as Yell, Shetland resident Jake Davis. He was charged with unauthorized access of a computer under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, encouraging or assisting criminal activity under the Serious Crime Act 2007, conspiracy to launch a denial-of-service attack against the Serious Organised Crime Unit contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977, and criminal conspiracy also under the Criminal Law Act 1977. Police confiscated a Dell laptop and a 100-gigabyte hard drive that ran 16 different virtual machines. Details relating to an attack on Sony {{and hundreds of thousands of}} email addresses and passwords were found on the computer. A London court released Davis on bail under the conditions that he live under curfew with his parents and have no access to the internet. His lawyer Gideon Cammerman stated that, while his client did help publicize LulzSec and Anonymous attacks, he lacked the technical skills to have <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a sympathizer.|$|E

He was in a seriously {{weakened}} condition; Wilson's diary entry for 14 January reads: [...] "Shackleton has <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> up to the mark, and today he is decidedly worse, very short winded and coughing constantly, with more serious symptoms that need not be detailed here but which are of no small consequence one hundred and sixty miles from the ship".|$|E

500|$|In early August 1886, Dunlap {{was sold}} to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most {{expensive}} purchase price at the time. [...] In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 {{on the first day}} of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. [...] The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: [...] "The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. [...] He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons." [...] The Detroit management was praised for their [...] "pluck and enterprise" [...] in making the bold [...] "business stroke." [...] The Sporting News wrote at the time:"Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just as sure as time flies and the world grows. [...] From the day the old St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> a favorite in St. Louis. [...] Still there was no one in the world but was willing to concede that he was the greatest second baseman America has ever known." ...|$|E
500|$|The reveal of Tracer being canonically lesbian was {{generally}} well-received by media outlets and players alike. USgamer called it [...] "an impressive move for Blizzard, given that Tracer is their flagship character". Polygons Allegra Frank described the reveal as one [...] "that fans have waited a long, long time for". Peter Amato of Paste commented, [...] "While a vocal minority has made their disapproval of said announcement clear, the larger fan base's reaction has ranged from indifferent to cheering." [...] Kotaku had {{several of its}} writers react to the reveal, with the consensus being a positive reception. The publication's Cecilia D'Anastasio pointed to a previous statement from Blizzard, where the developers clarified their intention to have an LGBT character reveal play out organically, [...] commenting: [...] "I feel that the comic did that. Tracer buys her partner a scarf. Her partner likes it. They kiss. The comic moves on. I think it was handled quite well, {{although the idea of}} Blizzard announcing a queer character feels sort of.... gimmicky." [...] Gita Jackson concurred with D'Anastasio stating she [...] "was definitely concerned that revealing a queer character would come off as a gimmick, and [...] very pleased at how they pulled this off. This doesn't feel tokenized." [...] Fellow Kotaku writer Heather Alexandra commented, [...] "I think having something explicit was necessary [...] Having something definite gives queer players a proper point of contact." [...] Andy Chalk of PC Gamer noted that: ...the comic itself is a fairly straightforward heartwarming tale of what really matters during the most hectic season of all. But the reaction to Tracer's identity has <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but.</b> Messages decrying Blizzard's [...] "mistake" [...] have cropped up all over the Overwatch forums and other social media, countered by others praising the studio for explicitly stating—in a low-key fashion—that the face of one of the biggest games of the year is gay.|$|E
2500|$|There {{was wide}} {{agreement}} that the FCO was still withholding files. Keith Flett said: [...] "It {{is likely to be}} correct that despite William Hague's professed policy of transparency towards the release of government files from the colonial era that far from everything will be released and it will depend on the skills of historians to spot gaps in the record." [...] Elkins, who, like Anderson, is an expert witness for the Mau Mau legal action, highlighted the need for caution, and wrote of her involvement with trying to get files out of the foreign office for analysis back at Harvard: [...] "This process has <b>been</b> <b>anything</b> <b>but</b> straightforward. Despite the legal context, the FCO has culled files, requiring multiple requests for full disclosure, and still files have not been forthcoming." [...] Of the April 2012 release, she noted that it [...] "excludes territories such as Palestine and Rhodesia. The Cyprus files exclude the period of the emergency. The Malaya files cover very little of the contested emergency years. The Kenya documents are a meagre subset of the files released (though culled) {{in the context of the}} Mau Mau case. For all 12 colonies covered in today's release, there appears to be a great deal pertaining to finance, tourism, administration and the like. ... The first release of the 'migrated archives' is, at first glance, lacking in substantive files, particularly for former colonies like Cyprus and Malaya where future lawsuits potentially loom." ...|$|E
