5000|$|In late July 1899, 100,000 <b>blackspotted</b> <b>trout</b> eggs {{arrived to}} begin populating the hatchery. Dewitt Clinton Booth, the first {{superintendent}} and a New York native, {{traveled to the}} new hatchery from the Leadville National Fish Hatchery in Colorado. A {{few days after the}} eggs arrived, the area was hit by a flash flood, and all of the eggs were washed away and destroyed. Booth later added two storm channels to prevent further flooding. Booth and his employees cleaned up the grounds and finished the hatchery building. At completion, the building was able to hold a maximum of 2.5 million eggs among 48 troughs. Booth described the winter conditions at the hatchery as being [...] "very favorable for incubation." [...] The first trout were released in Little Spearfish Creek and Whitewood Creek in April 1900. Together, the creeks took 25,000 <b>blackspotted</b> <b>trout</b> and brook trout. One year later, Loch Leven brown trout were stocked in Nemo, and that fall, rainbow trout were stocked in Spearfish Creek and Iron Creek. In 1904, another flood occurred, causing further damage to the grounds. As a result, Booth built ten-foot-high bulkheads. Booth built a home for himself and his family in 1905 and stayed at the hatchery for 34 years.|$|E

When broadcaster Norma Ashby discovered there was no state fish, she initiated a drive via her television show, Today in Montana, and an informal citizen's election to select a state fish resulted in a win for the <b>blackspotted</b> cutthroat <b>trout</b> after hot competition from the Arctic grayling. The legislature in turn adopted this recommendation by a wide margin.|$|R
