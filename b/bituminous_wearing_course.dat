40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} ultra-thin white-topping on a bituminous factory pavement. Different road cement concrete mixes were studied: high-strength concrete, concrete with PP fibres added, concrete modified with latex, concrete made by tyre-rubber grains instead of natural aggregate and steel fibre reinforced concrete. The binder was CEM II/A-L 42. 5 R; super-plasticiser and silica fume {{were added to the}} mix. Mixes were tested by mechanical trials after 1 to 60 days: adhesion of concrete to bituminous surfacings, compressive and flexural strength, hygrometric shrinkage, CTOD/CMOD tests, indirect tensile strength, dynamic elastic modulus. Mechanical characterisation of the mixes suggested the use of cement concrete with PP fibres added (because they reduce incoming cracking), latex (in order to reduce slab fragility) and water-reduction additives (for higher and faster mechanical resistance) and steel fibre reinforced concrete. The application was done on a 20 cm macadam pavement with <b>bituminous</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>course,</b> laid in a factory area pavement. The slabs were constructed according to ACPA standards. Strain gauges and LVDT were inserted in the pavement. The experimental data revealed acceptable behaviour of whitetopping: the slabs appear monolithic and have a good response to static and dynamic stresses due to commercial vehicles...|$|E
40|$|Pavement {{design is}} a process {{intended}} to ﬁnd the most economical combination of layer thickness and material type for the pavement, {{taking into account the}} properties of the subgrade and the traffic to be carried during the service life of the road. Low traffic road pavements with a thin bituminous surfacing and granular base and subbase layers represent, in France, about 60 % of the road network. Recent studies dealing with the improvement of design methods of ﬂexible pavements have pointed out that in most cases, when the bearing capacity of the soil is sufficient, this rutting takes place mainly in the granular base and subbase layers. Moreover, fatigue or cracking of the thin <b>bituminous</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> generally appears much later, when significant rutting has already developed. Pavement design methods for low traffic pavements, used in pavement mechanics, are based on linear elastic calculations. In the French design method, two design criteria are used to determine pavement life : a fatigue criterion for the asphalt layer, and a rutting criterion for the subgrade. The rutting criterion is very simplified, and consists in limiting the vertical elastic strains {{at the top of the}} subgrade. This criterion is based on the observation of the performance of existing pavements, and not on any laboratory characterisation of the materials. No criterion is presently applied for the rutting of the unbound granular layers and no model is used to predict the permanent deformations due to cyclic loading...|$|E

Road traffic is one of the main sources of particulate matter and traffic volume is still increasing and has unpleasant impact on longevity of the pavements and the environment.

40|$|Adequate {{friction}} {{resistance is}} needed to prevent pavement slipperiness allowing vehicles to stop in a reasonable distance. For stone mastic asphalt surfaces, friction resistance is mainly {{a function of the}} interaction between the aggregates exposed at the road surface and vehicle tires. Aggregate performance is reduced with time by wear and polishing as a consequence of vehicular traffic. In this research a method to investigate performance based on physical, chemical and petrographic factors has been evaluated. The objective was to develop a laboratory method to test Indiana dolomite, limestone, sandstone, and gravel aggregates to predict friction resistance in the field and determine causes for the range of values among these aggregates. Assessment of gravel sources was based on individual rock types and their proportions comprising the gravel. Initial friction Values (IFV) and Polished Values (PV) were determined in the laboratory with the British Wheel and Pendulum test and field values obtained from the towed friction trailer. For two laboratories involved a significant difference in IFV and PV was obtained so that further verification is required. Correlations between parameters were established which provide predictions of friction resistance based on laboratory specimens.

The term 'surface course' is sometimes used, however this term is slightly different {{as it can}} be used to describe very thin surface layers such as chip seal. In rigid pavements the upper layer is a portland cement concrete slab. In flexible pavements, the upper layer consists of asphalt concrete, that is a construction aggregate with a <b>bituminous</b> binder.

Generally speaking, there are some previous studies in literature on the aggregates substitution, from the standpoint of weight, with different percentages of expanded clay. In order to save the particle size of the blend coming from the mix design procedure, the writers suggest the change of aggregates with expanded clay {{from the point of view}} of volume, so as to consider the large difference of the values of the apparent absolute gravity between expanded clay itself and natural aggregates. As a matter of fact, this study proposes the results of an experimental investigation on the performances of both a traditional bituminous concrete with silica aggregates and a SMA (Splittmastix Asphalt) made of calcareous and basaltic aggregates, 10 and 30 % of the volume percentages of aggregates having been changed with structural expanded clay. The results are significant from the viewpoint of the failure domains tested by means of the UNIBAS M. P. T (UNIBAS Triaxial Test Apparatus) procedure and of the increase of superficial grip or micro and macro-texture. Furthermore, the study highlights the positive environmental aspects deriving from both the use of artificial aggregates and the reduced need of bitumen when expanded clay is used...|$|R
40|$|Most European nations use {{washed sand}} to design their <b>bituminous</b> {{mixtures}} for <b>wearing</b> <b>course,</b> primarily to prevent excessive water sensitivity of asphalt {{due to the}} presence of clays in sand natural fines. The lack of fines is then offset by an addition of limestone filler. These practices lead to high water and energy consumption. France, Belgium and Denmark are exceptions: they use quarry sands with their natural fines, without washing, but after checking the harmfulness of fines (clay content) according to French specifications described in the XP P 18 - 545 standard section 8, a maximum methylene blue value of 2 g/kg is permitted. In order to save natural resources and improve the valorization of unwashed quarry sands, investigations have been carried out since 2007 on two quarry sands with methylene blue values in the range of 2 to 4 g/kg to study the behavior of <b>bituminous</b> mixtures for <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> incorporating these unwashed sands. These two sands coming from eruptive quarries of Burgundy (rhyodacite and rhyolite) were hence characterized by numerous tests, including cationic exchange capacity (CEC) measurements and mineralogical analysis by X-ray diffraction, showing the presence of illite-muscovite and montmorillonite. These sands were subsequently tested in the laboratory to design asphalt <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> (0 / 10 Asphalt Concrete). Finally, these mixes were laid respectively in 2007 and 2009 on two experimental sites located on the French secondary road network. After 1 and 3 years of monitoring, no abnormal behavior induced by the presence of clay could be observed.

40|$|Once {{flexible}} pavements reach minimal bearing capacity, their structural rehabilitation {{is normally}} undertaken us ing bituminous mixture overlay. The number of layers and the thickness depend {{of the existing}} quality of the pavement and of the required quality determined by the rehabilitation program for a next life period. The rehabilitation of a pavement with a porous <b>bituminous</b> mixture <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> is usually undertaken without any treatment to increase its bearing capacity.

The properties of this material are dependent on void connectivity, in order to allow the grout to flow through them.

40|$|Martin, Ronald E. Wet {{pavement}} friction, or skid resistance, {{is one of}} {{the most}} important engineering considerations in highway design from a safety standpoint. For bituminous pavements, skid-resistance performance is primarily a function of the durability, texture, and composition of coarse aggregate used to construct the <b>wearing</b> <b>course,</b> or the uppermost layer of the road surface. Cambrian age carbonate construction aggregates mined in Pennsylvania, although relatively simple mineralogically, exhibit a wide variety of textures that developed in response to complex paleoenvironmental and diagenetic processes. To reveal what factors influence the petrographic properties of such aggregates and relate these attributes to skid resistance, carbonate construction aggregates currently being mined from the Lower Cambrian Kinzers Formation in the West York 7. 5 -minute quadrangle, Pennsylvania have been sampled and subjected to laboratory testing. Thin section analysis has revealed six individual microfacies types at the mining operation in West York: Microfacies Types I and III include massive debris flow deposits consisting either of coarser crystalline dolomite or limestone; Microfacies Type II is believed to represent a proximal turbidite facies consisting of finer crystalline dolomite; Microfacies Types IV and V are laminated to shaly dolomites and limestones corresponding to middle and distal fan turbidite environments; and Microfacies Type VI consists of hemipelagic, meta-pelitic deposits. Four complete depositional sequences and portions of two others have been identified at the West York quarry using clast composition and the presence of sharp lithofacies contacts believed to represent sequence boundaries. High energy debris flows (LST) are interlayered with more distal turbidites (LST and TST) and altered, hemipelagic shales (HST). Aggregate skid resistance has been assessed through cyclic material polishing in the micro-Deval testing apparatus and incremental microtexture evolution monitoring via two methodologies: the application of wavelet analysis to grayscale images of aggregate particles and the use of laser confocal microscopy to measure aggregate sample surface roughness. Laser confocal microscopy, which results in a direct measurement of surface texture, provides a more precise method for monitoring changes in aggregate roughness as a function of polishing time than wavelet analysis. The latter technique is adequate for assessing bulk samples, but apparently is susceptible to misinterpreting aggregate variegation as surface roughness. Stockpile samples consisting of Microfacies Type I resist polishing much more effectively than those comprised mostly of Microfacies Types IV and V, reflecting the importance of coarser crystal sizes in carbonate aggregate skid-resistance performance. Microfacies Types I and III, both initially characterized by pronounced surface roughness associated with coarser, interlocking carbonate crystals, exhibit marked differences in polish resistance. Microfacies Type I ??? a mostly pure dolomite ??? maintains its initial rough microtexture more efficiently than Microfacies Type III ??? a high-calcium limestone. This observation confirms that it is essential to consider mineralogy when estimating the potential for relatively pure carbonate construction aggregates to resist polishing. Finally, Microfacies Types II and IV, which are both comprised of higher percentages of dolomite than calcite and mostly consist of fine to medium crystals, appear to sustain microtexture more effectively than the coarser textured, high-calcium limestones of Microfacies Type III, indicating that the dolomite component enhances skid resistance even more noticeably than the presence of coarser crystalline material, particularly for aggregates that are not exclusively fine textured in character. Findings are used to develop a process map that may serve as a valuable tool for mining companies targeting relatively pure or argillaceous carbonate deposits for use in <b>bituminous</b> <b>wearing</b> <b>courses</b> and state agencies charged with evaluating construction materials prior to approval for use and to confirm ongoing, consistent performance.

Several bituminous surface courses containing slag, slag-dolomite, or dolomite aggregates showed deterioration soon after deicing salts were first applied. Initially, a detailed literature review (Appendix A of report) was conducted. Data on eighteen dolomite sources from a previous study (Bruner, Choi and West, 1995) plus ten additional dolomite sources formed the basis for the brine freeze thaw testing program. Mercury intrusion porosimetry testing conducted on multiple specimens showed that rock texture significantly affects pore size distribution. Petrographic analysis, acid etching of thin sections and electron microprobe studies revealed the distribution of clays on dolomite grains. Additional brine freeze thaw testing on selected dolomite sources, plus one slag sample, were conducted using deicing salts from six Indiana highway districts. Petrographic evaluation of pavement cores from the distressed pavements was accomplished. Brine freeze thaw test results ranged from 0. 6 to 27. 3 % loss for the 28 samples; this test is a good measure of aggregate durability. INDOT has recommended a maximum 30 % loss for the brine freeze thaw test. Regression analysis showed that acid insoluble residue content and sodium sulfate loss have the highest correlation with brine freeze thaw loss; elemental magnesium content has a negative correlation with it. It is concluded that dolomite aggregates with a low insoluble residue content have lower sulfate soundness losses, lower brine freeze-thaw losses and greater durability. Evaluation of pavement cores indicated no evidence of deterioration caused by aggregate weathering or degradation. Brine freeze thaw testing is a good measure of freeze thaw resistance of aggregates in bituminous surface courses and no evidence was found indicating that early deterioration of the pavements studied was caused by salt attack...|$|R

Specimens from both types of mix were also prepared at the optimum asphalt contents. The specimens were also subjected to moisture induced damage test and Indirect Tensile Strength test. Volumetric analyses of the mixes showed that the optimum asphalt content and voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) of the Superpave mixtures is lower than Marshall mixtures.

Two-step cluster analysis is a powerful knowledge discovery tool that can handle categorical and interval data simultaneously and is capable of reducing dimensions for large data sets.

The prediction model discussed in this report describes the magnitude of wear of pavement and of rut formation created by vehicles with studded tyres.

The road served 4 years until the summer of 2009 when the <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> of the right lane was maintained with a remixing. In the left lane no maintenance was done. The first measurement at the test sections with the new <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> was conducted {{in the spring of}} 2006 after it had been in service approximately 1 year. In spring 2009 a profile measurement was done before the maintenance operation. The latest profile measurement was carried out in autumn 2010. The rut depth has been calculated according the thread principle...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{construction}} of a major motorway pavement in Northern Africa, relevant rutting phenomena were observed after opening to traffic. Preliminary investigations showed that permanent deformations were limited to the upper <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> layer which was designed according to set requirements. In order to define the most appropriate rehabilitation strategy, investigations were carried out by focusing on the volumetric and mechanical properties of the employed <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> mixture. Compaction properties were assessed by making use of a gyratory shear compactor and of a rubber-wheeled roller. Moreover, simulative wheel-tracking tests were carried out in severe temperature and loading conditions. Additional tests were performed on an alternative bituminous mixture containing polymer granules. Based on the obtained results the possible causes of the above described distress phenomena were identified {{and the use of the}} alternative bituminous mixture as a technical solution to adopt for rehabilitation was considere...|$|R

40|$|Prediction {{models that}} {{describe}} {{changes in the}} condition of various portions of a road structure constitute a valuable tool for evaluating the service life and economics of a road structure or of a surfacing measure. Prediction models also constitute the core of planning systems - Pavement Management Systems - {{which are based on}} changes in the condition of various road structures and asphalt layers depending on traffic and time. The prediction model discussed in this report describes the magnitude of wear of pavement and of rut formation created by vehicles with studded tyres. The objective was to develop a computer based prediction model for the rut formation that is caused by wear from studded tires. The model shall both provide a prediction of the wear resistance of the <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> based on data regarding the type of <b>wearing</b> <b>course,</b> the properties of component materials, and a model of the rut profile based on data for type of road, traffic load, etc...|$|R
50|$|The runway <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> {{is made of}} in-situ gravel material. Most of {{the runway}} surface is covered in silt and {{overgrown}} with grass. The underlying rock layer has been exposed on approximately 20% of the entire runway surface. The landing strip was the hub for UN and operations during 1993-1996 but had fallen into despair since then, however local NGOs are planning to renovate and rebuild it.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two major}} types of {{pavement}} surfaces - Portland cement concrete (PCC) and hot-mix asphalt (HMA). Underneath this <b>wearing</b> <b>course</b> are material layers that give structural support for the pavement system. These underlying surfaces may include either the aggregate base and subbase layers, or treated base and subbase layers, and additionally the underlying natural or treated subgrade. These treated layers may be cement-treated, asphalt-treated, or lime-treated for additional support.|$|R
