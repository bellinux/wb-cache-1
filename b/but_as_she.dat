5|$|At 09:15, {{two more}} ships {{appeared}} on the scene– Mount Temple and Californian, which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty– but by then {{there were no more}} survivors to be rescued. Carpathia had been bound for Fiume, Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after. Carpathia departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we'll have to {{stay right}} here and {{do the best we}} can," [...] said Bridge. [...] "I was {{thinking}} we might make a run for it if Miss Barbara was here; <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she's</b> not we must wait for those who went out after her." ...|$|R
60|$|Verena {{said this}} with the same eagerness, with as {{determined}} an air of not incurring any reproach this time. <b>But</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had spoken she buried her head in Olive's lap.|$|R
50|$|Madhuri Dixit {{was offered}} the role of Manisha <b>but</b> {{rejected}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had date issues.|$|R
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{is off to}} Philadelphia to {{interview}} at Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) new company, Athlead, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) decides to come along, since office manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) is still not back from his sailboat excursion. She asks Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{to take care of}} a shipment of pens while she has gone. Pam's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive. She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam's job of office administrator in her absence. Mortified, Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box.|$|E
5|$|During {{a grocery}} {{shopping}} trip, Lois realizes she is short on {{money to pay}} for food. She pretends to return a ham to the meat department but decides to hide it in her purse instead. Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is not going to solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> loads up the car to return her stolen goods, she is caught by Joe and arrested.|$|E
5|$|The two try to {{convince}} Sheila to stop the projection, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is inexperienced with the device, she instead ends up projecting Steiner to somewhere else. He ends up at a construction site, the hideout of a band of thieves who are attempting to break into a bank. It is learned that an error in the projection has given Steiner the ability to kill people by touching them, and has mutilated one half of his body. Steiner kills the criminals, and then enters a store, where he steals a pair of rubber gloves and a coat. He then breaks into the institute, where he finds Latham and kills him. He also destroys the building's power supply, alerting Hill and Mitchell that something is wrong. By this time, Inspector Davis (Derek Farr) has discovered {{the bodies of the}} criminals and is determined to stop Steiner.|$|E
60|$|Then he laughed, and <b>she</b> laughed also, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> yet <b>she</b> did {{not take}} the ring.|$|R
60|$|His mother {{met him at}} {{the door}} anxiously, <b>but</b> smiled <b>as</b> <b>she</b> saw his {{pleasant}} face and cheerful eyes.|$|R
60|$|My sister wept the longest, as {{a matter}} of course; <b>but,</b> <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had dried her eyes, she {{replaced}} the wig, and completely restored my disguise, trembling the whole time lest some one might enter and detect me.|$|R
5|$|Ben and Abi {{continue}} their relationship, but Ben is still secretly seeing Paul. Babe Smith (Annette Badland) offers Abi {{work in the}} pub kitchen, and Abi tells Babe that {{she is able to}} {{turn a blind eye to}} Ben's homosexuality as long as he loves her. However, when Abi finds a present that Ben has got for Paul, she realises he has feelings for Paul and confides in Babe, who helps her to publicly announce that she is pregnant. Ben asks Abi to have a termination but then changes his mind, saying he wants the baby. Abi then goes to Babe, panicking because she has lied and is not really pregnant. When Ben accompanies her to a doctor's appointment, she gets him out of the room and confesses her lie to the doctor, who encourages her to be honest, but she then tells Ben the baby is due in October. Abi plans to get pregnant by Ben, but when he admits he may have caught an STI from a stranger, she is unable to have sex with him, so Babe tells her to get pregnant by another man. Babe forces her into getting drunk, and after a drunk Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) compliments her, they have unprotected sex. However, Abi does not get pregnant. She decides to tell Ben the truth, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is about to do so, he tells her he has caught chlamydia. Abi later tests positive for chlamydia and realises that Lee may have caught it too. Abi panics to Babe that Ben will discover she is not pregnant, so during an argument between Ben and Phil, Babe pushes Abi into Ben as he is pushed by Phil, knocking her to the ground. Babe takes Abi away from the square, and on their return, Abi tells Ben she has had a miscarriage. When she later sees Ben being comforted by Paul, she feels uneasy.|$|E

25|$|A cartel {{arrived at}} Dover on 30 January 1811 with the 22 survivors. The British sent the Elizabeth cartel from Chatham with 18 French prisoners <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{approached}} Calais the batteries there fired {{on her and}} she returned to Dover on 4 March.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> even <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke {{her speech}} was cloven by another hoarse {{proclamation}} {{from the dark}} street, again horribly articulate.|$|R
60|$|Now {{all this}} time she had never stirred, <b>but</b> lay <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had lain, her face downwards, her arms above her neck.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The thread {{must have}} been rotten,' she said to herself. 'I will see if I can break it.' <b>But</b> search <b>as</b> <b>she</b> would she could find none.|$|R

25|$|Voyage 7: Lively sailed on 19 November 1806 {{in company}} with Duke of Portland and Ranger. It {{is not clear}} who her master was. Lloyd's Register still carried Whiteus/Whitehouse as master, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was lost on this voyage {{and he went on}} to sail other vessels, she almost {{certainly}} had a different master.|$|E
25|$|Her captors sold Kent for 30,900 piastres to a Danish {{shipping}} company, which renamed her Cronberg. She left on 21 March, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> approached Denmark passing vessels {{informed her}} that a British fleet had attacked Copenhagen; she therefore waited some weeks in Fleckeroë {{before it was}} safe to proceed to arrive in Kristiansand in June 1801, and at Copenhagen on 16 July.|$|E

60|$|Sylvia smiled <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{looked at}} him. She liked the man; {{she thought that}} he had a good deal she valued to offer her; <b>but</b> <b>as</b> yet <b>she</b> desired only his captivation. She must not allow him to go too far.|$|R
25|$|On 6 July the unescorted 7,129 ton Canadian {{merchant}} ship Jasper Park {{was hit by}} two torpedoes from U-177 south southwest of Cap Sainte Marie, the extreme southern point of Madagascar.

25|$|On Day 89, Chanelle {{returned}} to the house {{for a short period of}} time to participate in a task, which involved Ziggy feeling objects to find out what they are.

25|$|Alicia Silverstone auditioned before Danes and {{impressed}} producer Edward Zwick, {{who wanted}} to cast her as Angela; she was also emancipated, so she could work longer hours. His partner Marshall Herskovitz thought, however, that Silverstone was too beautiful to play a conflicted teenager uncertain of herself. Danes' audition impressed both, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was 13 and had to attend school, after her casting, the show increased the screen time for the parental characters.|$|E
25|$|The first table below lists ships {{known to}} have been built by William Foulks, {{probably}} before his partnership with Herbert Lawrence. The second table lists ships built by Lawrence & Foulks. The two lists combined currently represent 112 of the 144 ships {{known to have}} been built by Foulks alone or by Lawrence & Foulks. In addition to the ships listed below, Lawrence & Foulks also designed the model for the Hudson River steamer Albany, <b>but</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> had an iron hull the construction contract went to Harlan and Hollingsworth.|$|E

60|$|For {{a moment}} Sadie {{turned her head}} and then got up and stood by her father's chair. Her look was {{strained}} <b>but</b> resolute <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{put her hand on}} his arm.|$|R
60|$|<b>But</b> not <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did. She {{had better}} {{have been dead}} than laugh <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did, in reply, with her intent look fixed upon him. He had better have been dead, than sitting there, in his magnificence, to hear her.|$|R
