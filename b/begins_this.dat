5|$|To {{identify}} the optimal {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources to be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to refine the distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation <b>begins.</b> <b>This</b> approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E
5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein <b>begins.</b> <b>This</b> entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting of}} the game {{takes place in the}} 24th century when {{humanity}} has discovered interstellar travel through the use of interstellar subspace jump nodes that function {{in the same manner as}} wormholes, allowing it to spread out across the stars and colonise new worlds. Prior to the game beginning, humanity (referred to as Terrans) formed the Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) as the central power of all of their systems' governments and military, and became engaged in a war over systems and resources against the Vasudans of the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire (PVE). By the time the story <b>begins,</b> <b>this</b> war has entered its fourteenth year, as a third species, dubbed Shivans, makes an unprovoked attack on the Terran system of Ross 128. The player, acting as a new Terran pilot in the GTA, is initially involved in the conflict with the PVE before the fights focus on the new species' arrival and subsequent assaults.|$|E

5|$|In {{southern}} Kent County, M-37 follows Cherry Valley Road through Caledonia. As {{the highway}} transitions to Broadmoor Avenue, the landscape also transitions from rural to suburban. North of 76th Street, Broadmoor widens to a four-lane boulevard which passes a campus of Davenport University near the M-6 freeway {{on the outskirts}} of the Grand Rapids area. This section is dominated by light industrial complexes west of the Gerald R. Ford International Airport in the suburb of Kentwood. These complexes change over to retail establishments north of 32nd Street. At 28th Street, Broadmoor Avenue ends, and East Beltline Avenue <b>begins.</b> <b>This</b> same intersection also marks the western terminus of M-44, which starts concurrent with M-37 in Kentwood. These two highway designations follow East Beltline Avenue between the Woodland Mall and the Centerpointe Mall. North of the malls, M-37/M-44 passes through the campus of Calvin College and along residential areas at the east end of Reeds Lake. The intersection of East Beltine Avenue and Fulton Street is the western terminus for M-21, a highway that runs east across the state to Flint. North of this junction, M-37/M-44 meets I-96.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundation}} of Swedenborg's theology was {{laid down in}} Arcana Cœlestia (Heavenly Mysteries), published in eight Latin volumes from 1749 to 1756. In {{a significant portion of}} that work, he interprets the Biblical passages of Genesis and Exodus. He reviews what he says is the inner spiritual sense of these two works of the Word of God. (He later made a similar review of the inner sense of the book of Revelation in Apocalypse Revealed.) Most of all, he was convinced that the Bible describes a human's transformation from a materialistic to a spiritual being, which he calls rebirth or regeneration. He <b>begins</b> <b>this</b> work by outlining how the creation myth was not an account of the creation of Earth, but an account of man's rebirth or regeneration in six steps represented by the six days of creation. Everything related to mankind in the Bible could also be related to Jesus Christ, and how Christ freed himself from materialistic boundaries through the glorification of his human presence by making it Divine. Swedenborg examines this idea in his exposition of Genesis and Exodus.|$|E
25|$|Towards dusk, the Martians {{renew their}} offensive, {{breaking}} through the defence-line of siege guns and field artillery centred on Richmond Hill and Kingston Hill by a widespread bombardment of the black smoke; an exodus {{of the population of}} London <b>begins.</b> <b>This</b> includes the narrator's younger brother, a medical student, also unnamed, who flees to the Essex coast after the sudden, panicked, predawn order to evacuate London is given by the authorities, a terrifying and harrowing journey of three days, amongst thousands of similar refugees streaming from London. The brother encounters Mrs. Elphinstone and her younger sister-in-law, just in time to help them fend off three men who are trying to rob them. Since Mrs. Elphinstone's husband is missing, the three continue on together. After a terrifying struggle to cross a streaming mass of refugees on the road at Barnet, they head eastward. Two days later, at Chelmsford, their pony is confiscated for food by the local Committee of Public Supply. They press on to Tillingham and the sea. There they manage to buy passage to the Continent on a small paddle steamer, part of a vast throng of shipping gathered off the Essex coast to evacuate refugees. The torpedo ram HMS Thunder Child destroys two attacking tripods before being destroyed by the Martians, though this allows the evacuation fleet to escape, including the ship carrying the narrator's brother and his two travelling companions. Shortly thereafter, all organised resistance has ceased, and the Martians roam the shattered landscape unhindered.|$|E

25|$|The colony cycle for {{southern}} yellowjackets is fairly variable. Many annual colonies begin in late May or early June when the queen infringes {{on a small}} V. maculifrons colony (about 85% of colonies begin in this parasitic takeover, while only 15% of colonies are independent). Whereas workers do not survive the winter in annual colonies, the queen does survive, and in the spring, when she is ready to lay more eggs, she scouts for small V. maculifrons and V. vidua colonies {{to serve as the}} host colony. These “takeovers” can often be violent as evidenced by many dead queens found in the nests. This violence tends to be conspecific, meaning that multiple V. squamosa queens are fighting for control of the host nest or for control of the polygynous nest. A successful usurpation constitutes the beginning of the parasitic relationship between a V. squamosa colony and a V. maculifrons colony. These colonies are built around the host nest, thus increase the size of the initial host nest. The queen begins the building process by constructing queen cells and laying eggs that will hatch larvae. The larvae enter the pupal phase after about a month. Once more of these female workers have been produced (late July or early August), the colony size begins to grow significantly as worker cell construction <b>begins.</b> <b>This</b> period from July to August is the major growth period during which up to 4000 workers could be producing cells. Workers build smaller 4.0- to 5.0-mm-wide cells, while the queens build “queen cells” which are about 7.0mm wide. Most nests have their maximum number of queen and worker combs between October and December, the end of the seasonal colony cycle. As the season ends, the queen hibernates so she can, in many cases, begin a new colony the next year.|$|E

What follows has been characterized as an absurd, improvised blues which Dylan, in the sleeve notes, describes as [...] "a really off-the-cuff-song. I start with an idea and then I feel what follows. Best way I can describe this one is that it's sort of like walking by a side street. You gaze in and walk on." [...] Harvey points out that Dylan subsequently elaborated this style of self-deprecatory, absurdist humor into more complex songs, such as [...] "I Shall Be Free No.10" [...] (1964).|$|E
500|$|Turn Based - Much like in Dungeons and Dragons {{this method}} of {{conflict}} resolution is taken in turns. This combat format is the primary system used in Theater-style LARPs. How turns work {{and what can be}} done during each turn is determined by the creator's of the game. Generally, who goes first is determined by some form of indicator and in the case of LARPs it is usually who acts first, this begins the engagement, essentially giving them an opportunity attack. Movement during a turn is determined by that character's movement speed, while actions are can be either consistent and unchanged rules or character specific. Each individual in the conflict has certain actions they can take on their turn. Chess is an example of a turn based game where who goes first is determined by the color of the pieces. That player now gets to make their movement, which in this case movement is synonymous to action. After their action resolves the other player's turn <b>begins.</b> <b>This</b> differs from the 'No-Touch' System, because a Turn Based LARP does not also mean no touching, although it can. An action from one character could end with their hand on the other character's shoulder. An example of a LARP that utilizes this system is the Otakon convention which also has its [...]|$|E

[...] "Obsessed" [...] never mentions the rapper's name, although reviewers felt it to be very obvious. The song begins with [...] "I was like, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?'", before the music <b>begins.</b> <b>This</b> line references the 2004 film Mean Girls. As the first verse begins, Carey describes the tracks' subjects constant lies: [...] "All up in the blogs sayin' we met at a bar / When I don't even, know who you are / Sayin' you up in my house sayin' you up in my car / When you in L.A. and I'm at Jermaine's". Additionally, the song suggests the stalker is under the influence of drugs: It must be the weed, it must be the E / 'Cause you be poppin', heard you get it poppin'." [...] During the chorus, Carey confronts her stalker, asking: Why are you so obsessed with me / Boy I wanna know / Lying that you're sexing me / When everybody knows/ It's clear that you're upset with me / Oh, Oh, Oh, finally found a girl that you couldn't impress / last man on the earth still couldn't get this." [...] During the song's second verse, critics complimented Carey's lyrics, highlighting phrases such as: You're a mom & pop, I'm a corporation / I'm the press conference, you're a conversation", [...] "suggesting the rapper isn't a worthy suitor".|$|E
500|$|Feminist scholar Maria Lauret {{states that}} the {{formation}} of female cultural identity is woven into Angelou's narrative, setting her up as [...] "a role model for Black women". Lauret agrees with other scholars that Angelou reconstructs the Black woman's image throughout her autobiographies, and that Angelou uses her many roles, incarnations, and identities in her books to [...] "signify multiple layers of oppression and personal history". Angelou <b>begins</b> <b>this</b> technique in her first book, and continues it in Gather Together, especially her demonstration of the [...] "racist habit" [...] of renaming African Americans. Lauret sees Angelou's themes of the individual's strength and ability to overcome throughout Angelou's autobiographies as well. [...] Cudjoe states that Angelou is still concerned with {{what it means to}} be Black and female in America, but she now describes [...] "a particular type of Black woman at a specific moment in history and subjected to certain social forces which assault the Black woman with unusual intensity". When Angelou was concerned about what her readers would think when she disclosed that she had been a prostitute, her husband Paul Du Feu encouraged her to be honest and [...] "tell the truth as a writer". [...] Cudjoe recognizes Angelou's reluctance to disclose these events in the text, stating that although they are important in her social development, Angelou does not seem [...] "particularly proud of her activity during those 'few tense years'". Angelou has stated that she wrote the book, in spite of potentially harming the reputation she gained after writing Caged Bird, because she wanted to show how she was able to survive in a world where [...] "every door is not only locked, but there are no doorknobs...
