40|$|AbstractB-cell {{activating}} factor (BAFF), {{also known}} as tumour necrosis factor (TNF) ligand superfamily member 13 B, is an important immune regulator with critical roles in B-cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion. A BAFF gene has been cloned from spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) and its expression studied. The dogfish BAFF encodes for an anchored type-II transmembrane protein of 288 aa with a putative furin protease cleavage site and TNF family signature as seen in <b>BAFFs</b> from other species. The identity of dogfish BAFF has also been confirmed by conserved cysteine residues, and phylogenetic tree analysis. The dogfish BAFF gene has an extra exon not seen in teleost fish, birds and mammals that encodes for 29 aa and may impact on receptor binding. The dogfish BAFF is highly expressed in immune tissues, such as spleen, and is up-regulated by PWM in peripheral blood leucocytes, suggesting a potentially {{important role in the}} immune system...|$|E
40|$|B cell {{activating}} factor (BAFF) is {{a member}} of the tumor necrosis factor family that is known to play an important role in B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation in mammals. However, studies of BAFF in teleosts are very limited and its function, in particular that under in vivo conditions, is essentially unknown. In this study, we conducted in vivo as well as in vitro functional analyses of a BAFF homologue (CsBAFF) from the teleost fish tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). CsBAFF is composed of 261 residues and shares moderate sequence identities with known <b>BAFFs</b> of other teleosts. CsBAFF expression was most abundant in immune organs and was upregulated during bacterial infection. Purified recombinant CsBAFF (rCsBAFF) bound to tongue sole lymphocytes and promoted cellular proliferation and survival. The results of an in vivo study showed that CsBAFF overexpression in tongue sole significantly enhanced macrophage activation and reduced bacterial infection in fish tissues, whereas knockdown of CsBAFF expression resulted in increased bacterial dissemination and colonization in fish tissues. Furthermore, vaccination studies showed that CsBAFF enhanced the immunoprotection of a DNA vaccine and augmented the production of specific serum antibodies. Taken together, these results provide the first in vivo evidence to indicate that teleost BAFF is an immunostimulator that significantly contributes to the innate antibacterial immune response and vaccine-induced adaptive immune response...|$|E

Dysregulated <b>BAFF</b> expression may contribute to autoimmune diseases or B-cell malignancies via effects on abnormal B-lymphocyte activation, proliferation, survival, and immunoglobulin secretion. Monoclonal antibodies were generated against human <b>BAFF,</b> characterized for species specificity and affinity, and screened for the ability to neutralize both membrane-bound and soluble <b>BAFF.</b> In addition, studies were undertaken to determine the relative potency of membrane-bound and soluble <b>BAFF.</b> Tabalumab has a high affinity for human, cynomolgus monkey, and rabbit <b>BAFF.</b> No binding to mouse <b>BAFF</b> was detected. Tabalumab was able to neutralize soluble human, cynomolgus monkey, or rabbit <b>BAFF</b> with equal potency. Our data demonstrate that membrane-bound <b>BAFF</b> can be a more potent stimulus for B-cells than soluble <b>BAFF,</b> and tabalumab also neutralized membrane-bound <b>BAFF.</b> Tabalumab prevented <b>BAFF</b> from binding to <b>BAFF</b> receptors and demonstrated pharmacodynamic effects in human <b>BAFF</b> transgenic mice.

40|$|<b>BAFF</b> (B cell {{activating}} factor {{belonging to}} the TNF family) is a cytokine implicated in the survival and maturation of peripheral B lymphocytes and T and B cell activation. <b>BAFF</b> binds to three different receptors: TACI, BCMA and BAFF-R, whose expression is restricted to B and T lymphocytes. <b>BAFF</b> and BAFF-R-deficient mice show a dramatic loss of peripheral B lymphocytes and a severely reduced immune response. In contrast, an enhanced <b>BAFF</b> expression leads to B cell hyperplasia and autoimmunity in mice. In vivo, administration of soluble decoy receptors for <b>BAFF</b> effectively decreases disease progression in various autoimmune mouse models. These evidences render <b>BAFF</b> as a potentially new therapeutic target.

40|$|Two newly {{identified}} tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family cytokines, B cell activation factor {{from the}} TNF family (<b>BAFF)</b> and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), {{have recently been}} shown to enhance the maturation and survival of peripheral B cells. However, whether <b>BAFF</b> and APRIL are expressed in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment and if these two cytokines modulate early B cell development remain unclear. In the present study, we have detected the abundant expression of <b>BAFF</b> and APRIL transcripts in BM non-lymphoid cells. Low levels of <b>BAFF</b> and APRIL mRNA are also found in developing B cells. Furthermore, we have determined the expression patterns of <b>BAFF</b> receptors during B lymphopoiesis. In cultures, both recombinant <b>BAFF</b> and APRIL significantly promote the survival of precursor B cells whereas only <b>BAFF</b> can suppress apoptosis of immature B cells. These findings suggest that <b>BAFF</b> and APRIL, {{in addition to their}} well established role in regulating peripheral B cell growth, can modulate the survival of developing B cells in th...|$|R
40|$|Background: B {{cells and}} {{antibodies}} are involved {{not only in}} controlling the spread of blood circulating Trypanosoma cruzi, {{but also in the}} autoreactive manifestations observed in Chagas disease. Acute infection results in polyclonal B cell activation associated with hypergammaglobulinemia, delayed specific humoral immunity and high levels of non-parasite specific antibodies. Since TNF superfamily B lymphocyte Stimulator (<b>BAFF)</b> mediates polyclonal B cell response in vitro triggered by T. cruzi antigens, and BAFF-Tg mice show similar signs to T. cruzi infected mice, we hypothesized that <b>BAFF</b> can mediate polyclonal B cell response in experimental Chagas disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: <b>BAFF</b> is produced early and persists throughout the infection. To analyze <b>BAFF</b> role in experimental Chagas disease, Balb/c infected mice were injected with BR 3 :Fc, a soluble receptor of <b>BAFF,</b> to block <b>BAFF</b> activity. By <b>BAFF</b> blockade we observed that this cytokine mediates the mature B cell response and the production of nonparasite specific IgM and IgG. <b>BAFF</b> also influences the development of antinuclear IgG and parasite-specific IgM response, not affecting T. cruzi-specific IgG and parasitemia. Interestingly, <b>BAFF</b> inhibition favors the parasitism in heart. Conclusions/Significance: Our results demonstrate, for the first time, an active role for <b>BAFF</b> in shaping the mature B cel...|$|R

B-cell activating factor (<b>BAFF)</b> is a cytokine and adipokine of the TNF ligand superfamily. The main biological function of <b>BAFF</b> in maintaining the maturation of B-cells to plasma cells has recently made it a target of the first FDA-approved selective <b>BAFF</b> antibody, belimumab, for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus. Concomitantly, the role of <b>BAFF</b> in cancer has been a subject of research since its discovery. Here we review <b>BAFF</b> as a biomarker of malignant disease activity and prognostic factor in B-cell derived malignancies such as multiple myeloma. Moreover, anti-BAFF therapy {{seems to be a}} promising approach in treatment of B-cell derived leukemias/lymphomas. In nonhematologic solid tumors, <b>BAFF</b> may contribute to cancer progression by mechanisms both dependent on and independent of <b>BAFF’s</b> proinflammatory role. We also describe ongoing research into the pathophysiological link between <b>BAFF</b> and cancer-related cachexia. <b>BAFF</b> has been shown to contribute to inflammation and insulin resistance which are known to worsen cancer cachexia syndrome. Taking all the above together, <b>BAFF</b> is emerging as...|$|R
40|$|DeltaBAFF {{is a novel}} {{splicing}} isoform of {{the regulator}} B cell-activating factor (<b>BAFF,</b> BLyS), a TNF family protein with powerful immunoregulatory effects. Overexpression of <b>BAFF</b> leads to excessive B cell accumulation, activation, autoantibodies, and lupus-like disease, whereas an absence of <b>BAFF</b> causes peripheral B cell immunodeficiency. Based {{on the ability of}} DeltaBAFF to multimerize with full-length <b>BAFF</b> and to limit <b>BAFF</b> proteolytic shedding from the cell surface, we previously proposed a role for DeltaBAFF in restraining the effects of <b>BAFF</b> and in regulating B lymphocyte homeostasis. To test these ideas we generated mice transgenic for DeltaBAFF under the control of human CD 68 regulatory elements, which target expression to myeloid and dendritic cells. We also generated in parallel <b>BAFF</b> transgenic mice using the same expression elements. Analysis of the transgenic mice revealed that DeltaBAFF and <b>BAFF</b> had opposing effects on B cell survival and marginal zone B cell numbers. DeltaBAFF transgenic mice had reduced B cell numbers and T cell-dependent Ab responses, but normal preimmune serum Ig levels. In contrast, <b>BAFF</b> transgenic mice had extraordinarily elevated Ig levels and increases in subsets of B cells. Unexpectedly, both <b>BAFF</b> and DeltaBAFF appeared to modulate the numbers of B- 1 phenotype B cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between the expression of B cell activating factor (<b>BAFF)</b> and <b>BAFF</b> receptor in patients with disease activity of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Real-time RT-PCR was used to examine <b>BAFF</b> mRNA expression in peripheral blood monocytes of active and stable SLE patients and healthy controls. The percentage of <b>BAFF</b> receptor 3 (BR 3) on B lymphocytes was measured by flow cytometry. Soluble <b>BAFF</b> levels in serum were assayed by ELISA. Microalbumin levels were assayed by an automatic immune analysis machine. <b>BAFF</b> mRNA and soluble <b>BAFF</b> levels were highest in the active SLE group, followed by the stable SLE group, and controls (P< 0. 01). The percentage of BR 3 on B lymphocytes was downregulated in the active SLE group compared with the stable SLE group and controls (P< 0. 01). <b>BAFF</b> mRNA levels and soluble <b>BAFF</b> levels were higher in patients who were positive for proteinuria than in those who were negative (P< 0. 01). The percentage of BR 3 on B lymphocytes was lower in patients who were positive for proteinuria than in those who were negative (P< 0. 01). The BAFF/BR 3 axis may be over-activated in SLE patients. <b>BAFF</b> and BR 3 levels may be useful parameters for evaluating treatment...|$|R

40|$|<b>BAFF</b> (B-cell-activating {{factor of}} the tumor {{necrosis}} factor family), a pivotal cytokine for B-cell activation, is overexpressed by salivary gland (SG) epithelial cells in primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS).

40|$|The TNF ligand {{family member}} <b>BAFF</b> (B cell {{activating}} factor {{belonging to the}} TNF family, also called Blys, TALL- 1, zTNF- 4, or THANK) is an important survival factor for B cells [corrected]. In this study, we show that <b>BAFF</b> is able to regulate T cell activation. rBAFF induced responses (thymidine incorporation and cytokine secretion) of T cells, suboptimally stimulated through their TCR. <b>BAFF</b> activity was observed on naive, {{as well as on}} effector/memory T cells (both CD 4 + and CD 8 + subsets), indicating that <b>BAFF</b> has a wide function on T cell responses. Analysis of the signal transduced by <b>BAFF</b> into T cells shows that <b>BAFF</b> has no obvious effect on T cell survival upon activation, but is able to deliver a complete costimulation signal into T cells. Indeed, <b>BAFF</b> is sufficient to induce IL- 2 secretion and T cell division, when added to an anti-TCR stimulation. This highlights some differences in the <b>BAFF</b> signaling pathway in T and B cells.
