25|$|Following {{the church}} shooting, many {{commentators}} questioned the continued {{display of the}} flag at the memorial on the State House grounds. The flag had first been erected in 1962 by the state's Democratic governor in a protest against desegregation. Opposition and attempts to remove the flag began almost immediately. In 1996, then-governor David Beasley pushed to have it removed from the Capitol dome, only to <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> then be driven from office two years later in the political blowback.|$|E
25|$|As the SEC was gridlocked, the Financial Stability Oversight Council promulgated its own {{suggested}} {{money market}} reforms and threatens {{to move forward}} if the SEC doesn’t button it up with an acceptable solution of their own on a timely basis. The SEC has argued vociferously that this is “their area” and FSOC should <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> let them handle it, a viewpoint shared by four former SEC Chairmen Roderick Hills, David Ruder, Richard Breeden, and Harvey Pitt, and two former commissioners Roel Campos and Paul S. Atkins.|$|E
25|$|In July, Strauss {{told the}} FBI that he {{believed}} eight of the Institute’s thirteen trustees were ready to dismiss Oppenheimer – but he decided to postpone {{a vote on the}} matter until Autumn so that it would not appear that Strauss as chairman was acting out of personal vindictiveness. This proved to be a miscalculation, because the delay gave members of the faculty time to organize an open letter in support of Oppenheimer… Strauss was forced to <b>back</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> later that Autumn the trustees voted to keep Oppie as director.|$|E

5000|$|Darrell Waltrip of Fox Sports {{said that}} he [...] "didn't see {{anything}} wrong with what happened. Matt needed to win that race to have any chance to advance to the next Chase round. True, Joey had already punched his ticket to the next round two weeks ago winning at Charlotte. Sure he could have played it safe, <b>backed</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> finished second to Matt but why <b>back</b> <b>off?</b> He had a fast race car. The kid is paid to win races for his sponsors, owner and team, plus don't lose sight of this: If he <b>backs</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> lets Matt win, then he's {{going to have to face}} Matt and his extremely fast Toyota in the next round of the Chase. If you have a chance to eliminate a major competitor for the championship, then that's the smart play. Simply <b>backing</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> letting Matt win really isn't a good idea in the big picture.|$|R

25|$|He {{then takes}} {{his case to}} Jupiter, who gives his consent in return for Cupid's future help {{whenever}} a choice maiden catches his eye. Jupiter has Mercury convene an assembly of the gods in the theater of heaven, where he makes a public statement of approval, warns Venus to <b>back</b> <b>off,</b> <b>and</b> gives Psyche ambrosia, the drink of immortality, so the couple can be united in marriage as equals. Their union, he says, will redeem Cupid from his history of provoking adultery and sordid liaisons. Jupiter's word is solemnized with a wedding banquet.|$|E
25|$|In qualifying, McLaren took 1–2 {{ahead of}} the Williamses and the Benettons with Senna ahead of Berger, Mansell, Patrese, Piquet and Schumacher. At the start, in {{extremely}} torrential wet conditions, Patrese lost time and was quickly behind Piquet and Alesi had also got by him and Schumacher. Senna led from Berger, Mansell, Piquet, Alesi and Patrese. On lap 3, Berger went wide allowing Mansell to be second and thus go after Senna. He was close enough on lap 5 and was {{side by side with}} Senna on the next lap but saw yellow flags because of Nicola Larini's crash. Thus he was forced to <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> Senna retained the lead. Alesi spun off immediately and was followed there by Schumacher. Both were out.|$|E
25|$|Marissa warns Bianca that Reese may {{fight to}} gain {{custody of her}} kids and things may get ugly, but Bianca dismisses her concerns, {{convinced}} that she and Reese can end things civilly and that Marissa is merely letting her experience with JR get in the way. However, when Reese sends her lawyer and nanny to Pine Valley in her place with tickets for Miranda and Gabrielle {{to come back for}} spring break, Bianca realizes that Marissa's fears may not be completely unfounded. However, Marissa manages to get Jack and Erica to come to Bianca's aid, where Jack forces them to <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> leave. Bianca thanks Marissa and apologizes for doubting her. Bianca is subjected to even further turmoil when she discovers that Reese is indeed trying to obtain full custody of both Miranda and Gabby.|$|E

He and Justine get out, and he tells her to run straight to the bus. As {{they are about to}} reach it, Michelle appears. Stephen convinces his daughter that she should get on the bus and sacrifices himself to Michelle, saying that if {{she did not want to}} be lonely, she should take him and not their daughter. As she is about to touch his face, she <b>backs</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> disappears with a smile. Stephen is relieved and thanks her, but Marta's ghost clings to him and takes his soul.

25|$|Silas {{returns to}} Hollyoaks in January 2016 as he visits Trevor Royle (Greg Wood) in prison {{under the name}} Mr. E Mann (Mystery Man). It is {{revealed}} that Silas had been writing to Trevor as he heard about the Gloved Hand Killer who had murdered seven residents throughout 2015. As Silas asks Trevor disturbing questions, Trevor tells Silas to <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> never contact him again. Silas leaves but has a feeling that Trevor is innocent and is determined {{to find out who}} the real killer is. Silas returns to Hollyoaks again in February, this time for an appointment with Tegan Lomax (Jessica Ellis), a nurse at Dee Valley Hospital. During the appointment, Silas tells Tegan he believes that the killer is one of the nurses or doctors who work at the hospital as medical equipment mysteriously disappeared {{during the time of the}} murders. Silas's interrogation about the murders makes Tegan uncomfortable and she leaves briefly, and once she returns Silas has already left. Silas visits Dee Valley Hospital again a few weeks later, this time imitating a human resources officer while visiting Lindsey Roscoe (Sophie Austin) in her office. After she confides in him about her feelings on her sister Kim Butterfield's (Daisy Wood-Davis) arrest for the murders, he leaves with the chilling parting words that he is a keen admirer of her good work and to keep it up, implying that he knows she is the real killer.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} season {{saw the two}} drivers collide again. With Senna leading Prost, now in a Ferrari, in {{the world}} Drivers' Championship, Prost qualified second for the penultimate race {{of the season in}} Suzuka with Senna on pole. Between the end of qualifying and race day, pole position was switched {{to the other side of}} the track without explanation. Senna complained that no longer being on the racing line, his side of the grid was dirty, meaning he would get less grip and therefore a slower start compared to Prost who had been moved to the clean side of the grid. The Brazilian's appeal was rejected. At the start of the race, Prost got the better start of the two; but whilst braking for the first corner, Senna refused to <b>back</b> <b>off</b> <b>and</b> collided with Prost at , clinching the title for the Brazilian. Prost almost retired from the sport, saying [...] "What he did was disgusting. He is a man without value."
