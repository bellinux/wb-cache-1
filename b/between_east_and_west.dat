5|$|The {{city was}} also under latent danger of {{attack by the}} Venetians. For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to {{preserve}} their city-republic by skillful maneuvering <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West.</b> A strategic treaty with Turkey protracted Ragusa’s liberty and maintained {{the opportunity for a}} major trading role between the Ottoman Empire and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline of}} {{the period of the}} Pax Mongolica was a result of a number of factors, these being incompetent and rivalling leaders, corruption, revolts, decadence, {{factional}} struggles, assassinations, external attacks, and disease. The {{decline of the}} Pax Mongolica resulted in a decline of eased trade <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alexander's legacy {{extended}} beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West,</b> and vast areas {{to the east}} were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves {{got a sense of}} belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|To {{maintain}} control and improve administration, various schemes {{to divide the}} work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of labour <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West.</b> Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although the co-emperors often saw each other as rivals or enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points out}} that From Russia, with Love was written and published {{at a time when}} tensions <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A joint British and American operation to tap into landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour, an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a popular uprising in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.|$|E
5|$|An ancient {{division}} <b>between</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>west</b> Wessex {{continued to}} be important in the 9th century; the boundary was Selwood Forest on the borders of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire. The two bishoprics of Wessex were Selborne in the west and Winchester in the east. Æthelwulf's family connections seem to have been west of Selwood, but his patronage was concentrated further east, particularly on Winchester, where his father was buried, and where he appointed Swithun to succeed Helmstan as bishop in 852–853. However, he made a grant of land in Somerset to his leading ealdorman, Eanwulf, and on 26 December 846 he granted a large estate to himself in South Hams in west Devon. He thus changed it from royal demesne, which he was obliged to pass on to his successor as king, to bookland, which could be transferred as the owner pleased, so he could make land grants to followers to improve security in a frontier zone.|$|E

5|$|Baltimore {{was home}} to a major doo wop scene {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, which began with The Orioles, who are {{considered}} one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially. By the 1950s, Baltimore {{was home to}} numerous African American vocal groups, and talent scouts scoured the city for the next big stars. Many bands emerged from the city, including The Cardinals and The Plants. Some doo wop groups were connected with street gangs, and some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of The Marylanders. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street gang culture, and with the success of some local groups, pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a rough boundary <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as The Sonnets, The Jollyjacks, The Honey Boys, The Magictones and The Blentones, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as The Twilighters and The Four Buddies.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall beginning in 1961, which increased tensions <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West,</b> Brundage was successful in securing a joint German team for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Nevertheless, the East Germans, supported by IOC members from Warsaw Pact nations, aspired to have their own team. They made a major breakthrough when the IAAF (led by the Marquess of Exeter, the former Lord Burghley) recognized a separate East German team beginning with the 1966 European Athletics Championships. The East Germans did their best to get Brundage's support, and, at the IOC session at Mexico City in 1968, they were granted full membership, with their own team under their own flag, which they displayed on West German soil four years later at the Opening Ceremony at Munich. Brundage, while finally supporting full membership for East Germany, considered the matter a defeat for Olympic ideals.|$|E
5|$|It was {{possibly}} after the defences were finished that Urbicus {{turned his attention}} upon the fourth lowland Scottish tribe, the Novantae who inhabited the Dumfries and Galloway peninsula. The main lowland tribes, sandwiched as they were between Hadrian's Wall of stone {{to the south and}} the new turf wall to the north, later formed a confederation against Roman rule, collectively known as the Maeatae. The Antonine Wall had a variety of purposes. It provided a defensive line against the Caledonians. It cut off the Maeatae from their Caledonian allies and created a buffer zone north of Hadrian's Wall. It also facilitated troop movements <b>between</b> <b>east</b> <b>and</b> <b>west,</b> but its main purpose may not have been primarily military. It enabled Rome to control and tax trade and may have prevented potentially disloyal new subjects of Roman rule from communicating with their independent brethren to the north and coordinating revolts. Urbicus achieved an impressive series of military successes, but like Agricola's they were short-lived. Having taken twelve years to build, the wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160.|$|E

5|$|Season 4 {{kicks off}} with Eric Taylor {{struggling}} as the East Dillon High coach. The team, field and conditions are a complete {{change from the}} privileged and sparkling conditions at West Dillon. East Dillon High resembles Odessa High from the source novel , Permian High's sister school {{and the home of}} the Odessa Bronchos, with whom they have an annual rivalry match which divides the town. The East Dillon Lions and Odessa Bronchos both wear red uniforms and are considered underdogs to the Panthers. Additionally, Odessa High and East Dillon are both underfunded and considered inferior compared to their rival school, and serve a predominately poor minority community. Additionally, the school district boundaries <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> Dillon were intentionally drawn to ensure the majority of talented players would be zoned for West Dillon; the districts between Permian and Odessa High were drawn in a similar manner.|$|E
5|$|This new-found unity <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> did not, however, {{solve the}} ongoing {{disputes}} in the east. Justinian's policies switched between attempts to force Monophysites {{to accept the}} Chalcedonian creed by persecuting their bishops and monks – thereby embittering their sympathizers in Egypt and other provinces – and attempts at a compromise that would win over the Monophysites without surrendering the Chalcedonian faith. Such an approach {{was supported by the}} Empress Theodora, who favoured the Monophysites unreservedly. In the condemnation of the Three Chapters, three theologians that had opposed Monophysitism before and after the Council of Chalcedon, Justinian tried to win over the opposition. At the Fifth Ecumenical Council, most of the Eastern church yielded to the Emperor's demands, and Pope Vigilius, who was forcibly brought to Constantinople and besieged at a champel, finally also gave his assent. However, the condemnation was received unfavourably in the west, where it led to new (albeit temporal) schism, and failed to reach its goal in the east, as the Monophysites, remained unsatisfied; all the more bitter for him because during his last years he took an even greater interest in theological matters.|$|E
25|$|Photius's {{importance}} endured {{in regard}} to relations <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West.</b> He is recognized as a Saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church and his line of criticism has often been echoed later, making reconciliation <b>between</b> <b>East</b> <b>and</b> <b>West</b> difficult.|$|E
