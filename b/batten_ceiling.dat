50|$|Internally, {{the front}} and western sides of the {{building}} are divided into partitioned offices and other rooms. Internal walls and ceilings are mostly tongue and groove vertically-joined boards {{with a number of}} walls being covered over with plywood and fibro sheeting. A fibreboard and <b>batten</b> <b>ceiling</b> in the drill hall section has also been added to what was originally an open roof cavity.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} altered but the chamber space remains along with much original fabric including the vertical tongue-and-groove lining, post and rail framing, sheeted and <b>battened</b> <b>ceiling,</b> picture rails to the chamber, doors, casement windows and cupboard between the former {{office and the}} chamber.|$|R
50|$|The main stair to {{the first}} floor has simple {{detailing}} reflecting its interwar period of construction and remains in its original position. The first floor has retained its original configuration being divided into a series of single rooms off narrow corridors which run parallel to the west and north elevations. The detailing is plain with <b>battened</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{ceilings}} {{are lined}} with fibrous cement sheeting and cover strips, decoratively placed. All ceilings retain lattice ventilation panels with some partially concealed by later fluorescent light fittings. Interior walls are a combination of rendered concrete and fibrous cement sheeting [...]with cover <b>battens</b> <b>Ceilings</b> are fibro with decorative placement of the cover strips, {{as defined by the}} original architect's plans.|$|R
5000|$|The Curator's House is a timber {{building}} with a corrugated iron roof and is situated on a slight rise. The house has been altered internally, although it retains <b>battened</b> <b>ceilings,</b> much original joinery and some leadlight. A clipped box hedge has been cultivated {{in front of the}} house to form the words [...] "Queens Park". There are also bougainvillea plantings around the house. Close to this are brick bush houses, the smaller of which is a 1941 bush house built by Turley.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} frontage to the north-east {{is decorated}} with toothed windows surrounds and quoins, and has large carved brackets supporting the verandah. The ground floor entry is marked with battened panels over a porch. The verandah has a timber balustrade and square timber posts with square capitals supporting a skillion roof. The skillion is timber-lined and the verandah soffit has a timber <b>battened</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The south-western frontage of the main building is clad in weatherboard with internally exposed framing and small openings. The building has large casement windows and timber French doors with fanlights with timber mullions opening onto the verandahs.|$|R
50|$|Beyond the {{entrance}} lobby, the original fit out has been substantially altered, {{and evidence of}} the original configurations of walls and partitions are preserved in the intact fibre cement sheet and <b>battened</b> <b>ceiling</b> linings and remnants of original timber framed fibre cement panelled walls. A central corridor is flanked by plasterboard walls with Silky Oak doors and fixed glazing, all dating from the early 1990s and located in the original wall alignment (underneath and between boxed in steel beams and columns). Office spaces {{either side of the}} corridor are separated by similar early 1990s partitions, but do not follow the set out of original meeting rooms evident in the ceiling.|$|R
50|$|Windows to the south, {{east and}} west light the upper storey, which also has a <b>battened</b> <b>ceiling,</b> though the central section is missing. This {{workshop}} level has two large entrances to {{each side of the}} building. The floor is concrete to the part of the workshop accessed by the west entrance; the balance of the floor is timber. The east opening accommodates a pair of substantial timber sliding doors. This level has offices and toilets and an enquiry counter near the rear entrance that opens on to a yard accessed from Antrim Street and Dodge Lane. The red face brick double gable parapet of the rear elevation screens the two gable roofs behind. An open lean-to-roof shelter projects out from north end of the building.|$|R
5000|$|... (1868 residence, remodelled in the 1870s as {{a kitchen}} and staff {{quarters}} {{and in the}} 1920s as men's quarters)To {{the rear of the}} main house and separated from it by a garden area, is a single-storeyed, low-set bluestone building with sandstone quoins, rectangular in plan, which was formed from the lower storey of the 1868 main homestead residence. It has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. The wall at the eastern end of the building is of weatherboards with bricks infilling between the quoins, following the removal of an adjoining wing. The rooms are arranged in a linear fashion, each opening onto a verandah along the southern side. The interior has fibrous cement linings and <b>battened</b> <b>ceilings.</b> One room has a brick fireplace.|$|R
50|$|The {{west wing}} has {{undergone}} a number of alterations. The former entrances to the courthouse and office were off the west verandah to Passage Street. The verandah is now enclosed and partitioned into an office and storage area {{and is no longer}} accessed from Passage Street. Concrete paths from 1935 indicate the location of the two sets of timber stairs that arrived at the west verandah and concrete stairs to the verandah remain from later alterations. The courtroom is partitioned into two offices and a corridor runs between the former verandah and courtroom to the brick extension built to the south. The sheeted and <b>battened</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the courtroom is intact and part of the glass partition between the courtroom and the office is visible above the doorway in the corridor.|$|R
50|$|The two {{classrooms}} in Block A are very intact, retaining {{most of their}} early linings, joinery and hardware. As a consequence they are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early school design under RG Suter (1868-1873), and changes to school design under Robert and John Ferguson (1879-1893) to incorporate requests by educationalists for more windows, greater ventilation, and wide verandahs. The differing approaches to school design demonstrated in the early Waterford school building include: the different window layouts in the two rooms; the exposed roof timbers in the 1871 room compared with the ceiling lining in the 1888-1889 room with <b>battened</b> <b>ceiling</b> vent leading to a gable vent (now blocked up); the exposed framing inside the gable {{end of the second}} classroom (now enclosed with fibrous sheeting); and the differences in window pivoting arrangements. The external framing also is laid out differently in the two building parts.|$|R
50|$|A dog-leg timber stair at {{the rear}} of the Station connects to {{entrance}} to the residential accommodation for the station superintendent above which contains three bedrooms, living room, kitchen, bathroom and hall. A laundry, on a suspended concrete slab supported by concrete piers, is off the landing of the dog-leg stair. The laundry was not able to be unlocked. The entrance to the residence opens off a small sheltered porch at the top of the stair through an arched doorway into a central hall. The smaller bedrooms and bathroom are through an arched opening to the west of the hall and the kitchen and living room open to the east and south of the hall. The cupboard to the east of the hall that housed the fireman's pole is now used for storage. The kitchen no longer functions as a kitchen but cupboards to the west and an arched recess and broom cupboard to the south remain. The bedroom to the northwest and the bathroom have been converted to toilets. The living room has an arched recess and opens to an enclosed verandah to the southeast. The wall separating bedrooms one and two has been removed. All rooms are lined with tongue and groove boarding and have fibro sheeted and <b>battened</b> <b>ceilings.</b> The <b>battening</b> to the <b>ceiling</b> in bedroom one forms a lozenge-like pattern.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to use a {{mathematical}} model to predict the vibration of lightweight timber-framed floor/ceiling systems (LTFSs) caused by mechanical excitation. The LTFS considered here is made up of an upper floor layer, a cavity space with timber joists and a ceiling. These components are joined by timber <b>battens,</b> <b>ceiling</b> furring channels and ceiling clips. The vibration in the structure is caused by a localized excitation on the top surface and the resulting vibration level of the ceiling surface will be analysed. The cavity space is filled with fibre infill for damping the sound transmitting through the cavity. A unique feature of the design and the model is the sand-sawdust mixture in the upper layer. The theoretical model and the experimental measurements show that the sand-sawdust dampens the vibration in the frequency range between 10 and 200 Hz. The damping by the sand-sawdust and the fibre infill are found by comparing the numerical simulations against the experimental measurements. We show that the simple linear frequency dependent loss factors can be used to predict the low-frequency vibrations of LTFSs...|$|R
50|$|The main {{entrance}} from Russell Street leads directly into an entrance lobby. The original elevated timber floor has been altered to accommodate ramped access from street level. Flanking original walls are rendered masonry. At the far end, original opposing door openings fitted with original joinery (including three panelled door leaves with original hardware) {{lead to the}} adjacent tenancies fronting Russell Street. The right hand (east) wall is also fitted with an original multi-paned high light fixed window. The ceiling is lined with decoratively arranged fibre cement sheets and cover battens. The original staircase joinery survives intact. The lower flight rises from the far right to a half landing over the front door, and a second flight rises beyond (parallel to Russell Street) to the floor above. A small ticket office to the right {{is built into the}} stair under-croft. The adjacent tenancies contain original plain quad skirtings, rendered masonry walls, and fibre cement and <b>batten</b> <b>ceilings.</b> The ceiling panel pattern in the right hand tenancy provides evidence of an original partition wall, since removed. Later doorways have been cut through to spaces behind.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has a central corridor with two rooms on the eastern side, used for storage and containing built in cupboards, and one large room {{on the western side}} containing a room divide with timber <b>battened</b> valance. <b>Ceilings</b> are hardboard with timber coverstrips, and walls are vertically boarded. A leaded glass door opens into the kitchen. A lean-to laundry is located on the rear of the kitchen, and a toilet on the southern side of the rear verandah.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is a single storeyed brick structure, longitudinally planned to create three distinct sections from front to rear. A single hipped roof, which is clad in galvanised steel decking, covers the entire building. The front section, which is mainly one large partitioned office space, is cement rendered externally. Internally the brick walls have been plaster rendered. The office partitions are timber framed with infill panels. Louvred glass panels fitted to an aluminium frame {{have been used for}} partition walls separating the two minor offices towards {{the southern end of the}} space. A suspended ceiling in the office area provides space for electrical and air conditioning conduits. The original <b>battened</b> <b>ceiling</b> still survives. The building's facade is symmetrical and consists of a central door with large aluminium framed shop windows at either side. Below the cantilevered awning that replaces the original awning, the facade has been tiled. The roof is hidden from the street by a parapet that supports a segmental pediment at the front. The building has only three other windows that are located on the east side of the building facing the Customs House. These are all single paned, double hung, timber framed windows, each fitted with steel protection bars.|$|R
50|$|The apse entry, with {{a narrow}} tongue and groove board lined ceiling, opens into the high ceilinged large school room from which two small {{teaching}} rooms open to the south. The large school room has been subdivided into two spaces by a vertical tongue and groove lined post and rail framed partition. Both partitioned spaces have a tongue and groove lined ceiling with a plain cornice. There are timber floors throughout. Cambered arched window openings are a feature throughout the building and double arched doors open from the large school room to both verandahs. Windows to the south portion of the large school room are sheeted over {{and could not be}} inspected. Windows to the west wall of the north portion have been clumsily replaced but a window to the north east survives. The two small teaching rooms are lit from the south by a bank of casement windows and each opens to its adjacent verandah. The flat sheeted and <b>battened</b> <b>ceiling</b> across these rooms falls with the gable roof slope near the edges of the rooms. Throughout the building door mouldings, window frames, verandah posts and verandah rails are stop-chamfered. Many verandah posts survive within the enclosing boarding, some with capitals intact. There is evidence that there were handrails and balustrading to the verandahs.|$|R
50|$|Rectangular in plan, {{the ground}} floor {{contains}} an engine room, watchroom, dormitory, kitchen, bathroom and recreation room. Tall, vertical, timber, bifold, counterweighted doors to School Road open into the engine room around which the other rooms are arranged in an L-shape. The concrete floor to the engine room has been painted green but the red fire engine guide tracks are evident {{in areas where the}} paint has worn. The watchroom is {{at the front of the}} Station off the engine room and opens into the adjacent dormitory. The fireman's pole terminated in a small hall in the centre of the building to the rear of the engine room. The pole has been removed. The kitchen, bathroom and dormitory open off this hall. The recreation room is to the rear of the Station off the engine room and opening to the rear yard. All ground floor rooms are lined with tongue and groove boarding and have fibro sheeted <b>battened</b> <b>ceilings.</b> The dormitory contains built-in timber cupboards and tilting fanlights to the engine room wall. The bathroom could not be unlocked but a terrazzo floor was evident under the closed door. A serving hatch has been cut into the wall between the kitchen and the recreation room.|$|R
40|$|Contrary {{to common}} belief, a {{relatively}} simple and practical lightweight timber based floor/ceiling can have impact sound insulation superior to that of concrete slab based systems. This paper presents examples of such systems that include vibration isolation/damping features, such as rubber <b>ceiling</b> <b>batten</b> clips, glass fibre wool, and a sand-sawdust mixture layer. We give enough details to reproduce our experiments and build the proposed lightweight systems...|$|R
50|$|The {{entry and}} {{circulation}} apse opens {{into a large}} school room from which two smaller teaching rooms open to the west. The ground and first floor plans are identical. These rooms are now partitioned into office workspaces and meeting rooms. The interiors are plain with stop-chamfering to doors and window frames. The apse stair has stop- chamfered newell posts with ball and half-ball tops and plain rectangular timber post balustrading. Much of the joinery survives. The ceiling to roof of the large school room at the upper level is presently covered by a suspended ceiling of acoustic tiles, but a preliminary investigation reveals that the roof is supported by four collar-braced king-post trusses within a lofty timber lined roof space. The arched pendant posts with decorative corbels survive and are visible beneath the suspended ceiling. A dog-leg stair with half landing has been inserted from the south-west teaching room to the teaching room directly above. In the large school rooms, high set windows {{to the south and}} larger lower windows to the north accommodated galleried classes. High set windows to the south and west of the small teaching rooms also accommodated galleried classes. The south verandah is enclosed with weatherboards and louvres and partitioned into toilets. A timber louvre to the former southwest lavatory on the south verandah survives. There are hat/coat hooks along the masonry wall to the verandah. The pavilion extension to the south of the apse is entered from the south verandah. A light and airy room, with a mansard profile sheeted and <b>battened</b> <b>ceiling,</b> it is lit by a bank of south facing windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{hotel is}} a good {{regional}} example of a large timber interwar hotel that demonstrates the principal characteristics of its type. Built to provide comfortable accommodation for tourists, its original form and layout is legible and it retains many features including its lounge and coffee room (ballroom) space and evidence of its bars, parlours and retail facilities on the ground floor. On the first floor it retains: largely intact bedrooms, each with wash basin, opening off a central hall and onto wide verandahs; separate male and female bathroom facilities off the rear verandah; and a central guest lounge. Decorative features include ornamental plaster ceilings in the public ground floor spaces, <b>battened</b> sheet <b>ceilings</b> {{to the first floor}} rooms and generously sized timber joinery including built-in cabinets.|$|R
50|$|The theatre is {{organised}} {{around the}} central auditorium, with flanking sides accommodating {{a restaurant and}} toilets to the north; and a cafe, commercial kitchen, organ room and storage to the south. The small foyer has a plain <b>battened</b> fibreboard <b>ceiling</b> sloping towards the auditorium and accommodates a recently fitted bar and ticket booth. It opens to the sides to the restaurant and cafe. A timber framed partition lined with fibreboard separates the foyer and auditorium. A dress circle sits above the foyer and is reached {{by a set of}} timber stairs {{to the left of the}} doorway from the foyer into the auditorium. The dress circle has a sloping timber floor and accommodates several rows of moveable seats. The bio-box standing to the rear of the dress circle is newly lined with plasterboard and accommodates the electronic console controlling the film projection.|$|R
50|$|Barnes, a 16-year-old {{apprentice}} carpenter, was electrocuted installing fibreglass insulation. He {{most likely}} {{came into contact}} with a metal <b>ceiling</b> <b>batten</b> which was floating at main's voltage due to contact with live electrical wiring. The wiring had been unusually placed during construction of the building, and subsequently a screw used to attach fibreboard to the batten had penetrated its sheath, creating a dangerous hazard for anyone entering the roof space with the mains power switched on. Barnes had no specific safety training, with his employer believing that his previous experience as an apprentice carpenter was adequate.|$|R
50|$|The former {{pavilion}} is a large, open {{room with}} high ceilings. It is accessed via stairs {{from the one}} of the tenancies on the ground level. Walls have a smooth rendered finish to the north and part of the walls to the west. Other walls are lined in v-jointed boards. The lower sections of the internal walls are lined with plywood and timber <b>battened</b> sheeting. The <b>ceiling</b> is lined with decorative pressed metal sheeting with large pressed metal cornices finished with leaf-shaped cornice mitres in the internal corners. Two decorative circular pressed metal ceiling vents are located on the ceiling. Metal ceiling roses (former pendant fittings have been removed) are also located on the ceiling. Wall and window trims are clear finished timber. Floors are timber tongue and groove boards. A door formerly accessing a dumbwaiter is located in a small alcove on the southern side of the room. A concrete wash tub is located in the north-west corner of the room.|$|R
5000|$|Internally, the joinery and {{fittings}} in the [...] house are of good quality, {{consistent with the}} Federation era styling of the exterior, without being excessively lavish. Skirtings and architraves in particular are simple but generously proportioned. It {{is possible that some}} of the joinery and moldings currently painted were originally clear finished red cedar, or similar, which if re-instated would increase the visual richness of the interiors considerably. The walls and ceilings generally are lined with painted, tongue-and-groove, vertically-jointed timber, with either elaborate ceiling roses or coffers, bay windows, or decorative fireplaces used to elevate the character of the formal rooms. More simply treated rooms such as bedrooms and service rooms have been largely removed or remodelled. The later additions are altogether more pragmatic and possibly more altered to suit changing needs than the original sections of the building. The internal linings in the two storeyed [...] addition and the [...] dormitory building are generally a combination of tongue-and-groove walling and <b>battened,</b> smooth sheeted <b>ceilings</b> with simple, largely traditional joinery and detailing.|$|R
5000|$|From the {{vestibule}} {{there is an}} office {{to the left and}} a rest room area to the right. The rest room area accommodates a toilet, cleaner's room, and a crying room (a room to retreat to with children during the service) which has double-glazed fixed window into the nave and acoustic sheeting to one wall. The office and the rest room contain built-in benches, cupboards, tables, chairs and fittings such as wall-hung speakers which are original elements.The vestibule opens to the nave through large, timber-framed glass sliding doors. The body of the church is a large space, brightly lit and uncluttered. The walls and flat ceiling are painted white complimenting the stained and varnished timber elements. The floor is plain concrete squares with a red and gold carpet running the length and width of the aisle. The pews are silky oak, carved with a version of Durer's [...] "Praying Hands" [...] at the aisle end; some have memorial plaques, e.g. Donated by Mr and Mrs A.T. Thompson in memory of Mr and Mrs Hermann Rehbein. The perimeter of the ceiling features a wide band of timber battens emphasising the length of the nave and drawing the eye to the sanctuary. Twelve large windows light the nave. They contain panels depicting scenes from the Gospel of St John in stained and painted glass including portions of older glass from the earlier church, some feature dedications, e.g., In Memory of Mr and Mrs H. Pressler from their children within the glass and on plaques. The nave is electrically lit by wall sconces with glass shades and by fluorescent lights recessed between the <b>ceiling</b> <b>battens.</b> A cast plaster baptismal font (from the earlier church) with painted leaves and inscription stands to {{the west side of the}} sanctuary.|$|R
