5000|$|LK-4-I - The first {{variation}} with slats on {{the upper}} wing, twin parallel <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> and a cantilever lower wing.|$|R
5000|$|This was {{essentially}} a Raleigh Twenty increased in size by 10%. It also had no <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> at the bottom bracket.|$|R
50|$|Germany {{received}} 36 aircraft from February 1917. They were temporarily {{grounded in}} July {{of that year}} because of severe vibration, being modified with additional interplane <b>bracing</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|LK-4-IV - The final {{variation}} was a low-wing monoplane {{with the}} lower wing replaced by the upper wing and twin <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> {{to the top of}} the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The {{pneumatically}} actuated inwards retracting undercarriage {{was housed}} inside the inner lower-wing which folded at approx Â½ span {{to lie in}} recesses in {{the sides of the}} fuselage. The outer halves of the lower wings remained horizontal as the wings retracted and were housed in recesses in the under-surfaces of the upper wings. Retraction of the wings was carried out by a single vertically mounted pneumatic actuator in the fuselage which unlocked the <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> either side and pulled the wing upwards as the <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> was pulled upwards.|$|R
50|$|The two outer Salmson engines were mounted, uncowled, on {{the forward}} wing <b>bracing</b> <b>struts,</b> with {{extended}} streamlined bodies behind them which {{connected to the}} rear bracing strut; the forward struts were reinforced by jury struts to the wing roots and the rear <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> by vertical jury struts to the rear spar. The Potez 40 had a tailwheel undercarriage with its main legs with rubber shock absorbers mounted vertically below the outer engine extensions; the mainwheels were hinged on widely spaced V-Struts from the lower fuselage and were sometimes enclosed under spats.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the ends}} of <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> are joined to the main {{internal}} structural components such as a wing spar or a fuselage bulkhead, and bracing wires are attached close by.|$|R
50|$|The Junkers J 1 was a mid-wing {{monoplane}} with a cantilever wing, without exterior <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> or wires. External bracing {{was used}} only for support of the horizontal stabilisers and the undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bracing</b> <b>struts</b> {{and wires}} of many kinds were {{extensively}} used in early aircraft to stiffen and strengthen, {{and sometimes even}} to form, the main functional airframe. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s they fell out of use in favour of the low-drag cantilever construction. Most aircraft <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> are principally loaded in compression, with wires taking the tension loads. Lift struts came into increasing use during the changeover period and remain in use on smaller aircraft today where ultimate performance is not an issue. Typically they are applied to a high-wing monoplane and act in tension during flight.|$|R
50|$|The Magni PM.2 Vittoria was an Italian experimental, single seat, {{parasol wing}} {{aircraft}} {{built in the}} mid-1920s. It had a large area aerofoil on each of its single wing <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> which could be rotated together or independently to give lift or drag.|$|R
50|$|This was {{essentially}} a Raleigh Twenty reduced in size by 10%. It differed from the larger model in that it dispensed with the <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> at the bottom bracket. The Eighteen was introduced in 1972 and aimed at children and shorter adults.|$|R
50|$|Peak wind {{speeds of}} over 90 mph were {{recorded}} at Jodrell Bank Observatory, which severely tested {{the structure of}} the Lovell Telescope. Following the storm two diagonal <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> were added to give the telescope greater rigidity when parked in the zenith to ride out storms.|$|R
5000|$|Vimana:Introduced 2006. Current production, 2011. Optimised for STOL performance, {{with the}} Savannah ADV wing with double-slotted Fowler flaps, leading edge slats, single <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> and a slimmer fuselage. Powered by the [...] ) Rotax 912 ULS {{four-stroke}} engine. It is marketed in North America as the Rampage.|$|R
50|$|A <b>strut</b> bar, <b>strut</b> <b>brace,</b> or <b>strut</b> tower <b>brace</b> (STB) is an {{automotive}} suspension accessory usually used {{in conjunction}} with MacPherson struts on monocoque or unibody chassis to provide extra stiffness between the strut towers.|$|R
5000|$|Magni {{continued}} {{to experiment with}} rotating <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> {{to the start of}} World War II. The Magni Vale of 1935 had a faired V-strut bracing the wing on each side. The leading members of these were fixed but the rear ones could be rotated as airbrakes as they could on the Vittoria.|$|R
50|$|The AL 3's elderly 1.3 m track {{undercarriage}} {{seen from}} ahead formed a splayed M-form set of rigid, longitudinally wire <b>braced</b> <b>struts.</b> The large diameter wheels were mounted on half axles, hinged at {{the centre of}} the M and joined to its outer members by rubber shock absorbers. A tall tailskid protected the rudder.|$|R
50|$|The T.31 was a tandem two-seat {{development}} of the T.8 Tutor (RAF Cadet TX.2). The fuselage was based on that of the T.29 Motor Tutor, increased in length and widened slightly; the wings and tail were unchanged. A single T.31A prototype was flown in 1949, followed by the production T.31B, with spoilers and a small additional wing <b>bracing</b> <b>strut.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sprint SKh: Agricultural {{spraying}} version. Carries 130 L (28.6 Imp gal; 34.3 US gal) of sprayant in two streamlined tanks {{attached to}} the lower fuselage {{just ahead of the}} wing <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> and main undercarriage leg. Liquid chemical is applied via underwing spraybars from the lower fuselage and supported below the wing on each side by a V-strut.|$|R
25|$|In 1920, Marchetti {{redesigned}} the MVT, {{giving it}} wings of longer span and splayed interplane <b>bracing</b> <b>struts,</b> a new cabane structure, {{and a more}} powerful engine, the SPA 62a rated at 234 kilowatts (285 horsepower). In this redesigned form, the MVT underwent testing at Guidonia Montecelio, where it achieved a speed of 275 kilometers per hour (171 miles per hour).|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, Sky Classic Aircraft of Des Moines, Iowa marketed {{plans for}} another {{updated version of}} the Miniplane, the Miniplane 2000. [...] The Miniplane 2000 {{incorporates}} several modifications to the original design, including a slightly longer and wider fuselage to accommodate larger pilots, adding <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> to reinforce the horizontal stabilizer, and changing the airfoil section and angles of incidence of the wings.|$|R

50|$|The BS.8 Biancone was {{a higher}} {{performance}} {{version of the}} BS.7 primary trainer. The two designs, both high-wing monoplanes, shared a fuselage boom, empennage and wing <b>bracing</b> <b>struts,</b> but the later type had a nacelle with a conventional open cockpit and a pedestal {{in place of the}} B.7's simple boom and open girder, together with a new wing of much higher aspect ratio.|$|R

50|$|Utilising the wings, struts {{and tail}} {{unit of the}} T.8 Kirby Tutor, the T.29 Motor Tutor had a new {{fuselage}} incorporating a wheeled undercarriage and the cockpit under the wing centre section. Early trials revealed resonance of the front wing struts, which was rectified by adding a vertical <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> vertically up to the mainspar. This modification was introduced for all Kirby Tutors to allow aero-tow launching.|$|R
2500|$|Originally {{designed}} as a single-seat biplane flying-boat fighter, the CAMS 36 was modified {{to compete in the}} 1922 Schneider Trophy. Originally built with a pusher-propeller this was changed to a tractor arrangement for the [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fd piston engine. Twin vertical wing <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> were changed to a single I-type strut. Although the racer proved to be fast in the air, lack of funds prevented the two aircraft from competing.|$|R
5000|$|The Hansa-Brandenburg C.I, {{also known}} as Type LDD, was a 2-seater armed {{single-engine}} reconnaissance biplane designed by Ernst Heinkel, who worked at that time for the parent company in Germany. The C.I had similarities with the earlier B.I (Type FD, also designed by Heinkel), including inward-sloping interplane <b>bracing</b> <b>struts.</b> Like other early-war Austro-Hungarian reconnaissance aircraft, such as C-types of Lloyd or Lohner, the Type LDD had a communal cockpit for its crew.|$|R
5000|$|The R.16 was {{powered by}} three [...] Lorraine 9N Algol nine {{cylinder}} radial engines enclosed by long chord NACA-type cowlings. One {{was in the}} nose of the fuselage and the other were mounted under the wing centre section from the forward wing <b>struts,</b> aided by <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> rising inwards to the wing root and short vertical struts to the forward spar. Long nacelles behind the outer engines tapered to the rear wing strut.|$|R
5000|$|The PL-12 had an {{unconventional}} but practical layout for its intended agricultural top-dressing role. The basic layout was {{inherited from the}} PL-11. This was a mid-wing monoplane, but with a small lower [...] "wing" [...] that carried the wing <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> and the two main wheels of the tricycle undercarriage. Slender booms carried the two separate tailplanes {{on top of the}} fin/rudder units. The two booms were not joined together at the aircraft's rear.|$|R
5000|$|Spindle-shaped {{jettisonable}} external tanks with {{a capacity}} of 650 gal, fitted to the sponsons and <b>braced</b> by <b>struts</b> attached to the fuselage ...|$|R
25|$|In February 1917 {{the second}} version {{was ready for}} testing. The single thick struts were {{replaced}} with more conventional parallel wire <b>braced</b> <b>struts</b> and the landing gear was lengthened. The new wings were of varying chord and the overall diameter of the fuselage was increased. Most importantly, a larger dorsal fin and rudder were installed. After several disappointing flights at Martlesham Heath the machine was returned to the aircraft production facilities in Cowes for another rework.|$|R
25|$|The wheeled {{undercarriage}} was {{a simple}} single-axle arrangement, with oleo legs forward to the engine bulkhead and rearward <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> {{to the root of}} the rear wing spar. There was a rather long tailskid to protect the downward-extended fin. The seaplane version used a pair of floats, their low drag profile refined via Schneider Trophy experience, cross braced with a pair of horizontal transverse struts. They were mounted with N-shaped struts which sloped strongly outwards from the fuselage.|$|R
25|$|It was a {{parasol wing}} {{monoplane}} of fabric-covered all-metal construction. Its slightly swept back wing {{was attached to}} the fuselage by <b>bracing</b> <b>struts,</b> and its two floats were braced to both the wing and fuselage. It was powered by a Hispano-Suiza 12Ybrs engine driving a three-bladed propeller, and could carry a single torpedo or bombs under the fuselage. Defensive armament was one fixed forward-firing machine gun, also two in the rear cockpit and one in a ventral tunnel.|$|R
50|$|Consolidated's XP3Y-1 design (company Model 28) had a {{parasol wing}} with {{external}} <b>bracing</b> <b>struts,</b> {{mounted on a}} pylon over the fuselage. Wingtip stabilizing floats were retractable in flight to form streamlined wingtips and had been licensed from the Saunders-Roe company. The two-step hull design {{was similar to that}} of the P2Y, but the Model 28 had a cantilever cruciform tail unit instead of a strut-braced twin tail. Cleaner aerodynamics gave the Model 28 better performance than earlier designs.|$|R
50|$|The Lilienthal Bekas is a pod and boom, multi-purpose, pusher {{configuration}} ultralight with a {{high wing}} and low-set boom carrying a T-tail. The well glazed pod seats two in tandem and carries the constant chord wing at its top. The wing is braced to the lower fuselage by two pairs of cross <b>braced</b> <b>struts</b> and is fitted with flaps, which have a maximum deflection of 40Â°. A fixed, tricycle undercarriage with a castoring nosewheel is mounted on the pod.|$|R
