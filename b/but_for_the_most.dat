He preferred {{to spend most of}} his free time with his children. Nasser and Tahia had two daughters and three sons: Hoda, Mona, Khaled, Abdel Hamid, and Abdel Hakim.|$|E
5|$|Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 {{was badly}} damaged. Other {{structural}} damage {{resulted from the}} shock. For example, both Monrovia and Pasadena each {{had more than a}} dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, dislodged marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E
25|$|Sporadic {{violence}} broke out, {{and a few}} governors mobilized {{their state}} police and National Guard. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, the coal fields remained calm.|$|E
2500|$|The east shore {{along the}} Kenai Peninsula, {{from the mouth}} of Turnagain Arm nearly to Kachemak Bay, is low and {{comparatively}} flat, <b>but</b> is <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part heavily wooded.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> soundtrack <b>for</b> Riviera was {{composed}} mostly by Minako Adachi, {{with a few}} tracks by Shigeki Hayashi, and spanned less than forty tracks. This music has been rearranged and rerecorded for each release of <b>the</b> game, <b>but</b> has <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part remained static.|$|R
25|$|The various autocephalous and {{autonomous}} synods of the Orthodox Church {{are distinct}} {{in terms of}} administration and local culture, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part exist in full communion with one another.|$|E
25|$|In 1888, Ybor {{completed}} an imposing 3-story brick building {{which was the}} largest cigar factory {{in the world at}} the time. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, the Ybor City that greeted the first arrivals was primitive.|$|E
25|$|Watts {{completed}} another 30 months training reservists {{out of the}} Seattle-Tacoma area. In mid-1963, one of {{her training}} cruises took her to Hawaii; <b>but,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, she operated just off the west coast. In December 1964, Watts was decommissioned and placed in reserve at Bremerton.|$|E
50|$|Football tournaments at {{international}} multi-sports events, {{such as the}} Olympics, Pan-American Games and Francophone games are without FIFA's jurisdiction, <b>but</b> are, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, operated with the acknowledgement of that body. These events typically involve age restricted teams, to avoid direct competition with the World Cup and continental championships.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{administration}} of Act on library activities, the institution has no formal executive power in relation to <b>the</b> libraries, <b>but</b> runs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part its development tasks {{on the basis of}} grants given to projects which pursue the development of new services or as temporary strategic grants.|$|R
50|$|The Rhythm, Energy and Elasticity mark {{comprises}} {{the first two}} collective marks from a set test, that being Paces and Impulsion, while the Harmony between Horse & Rider mark {{is made up of}} the second two: Submission and Rider. The remaining scores are somewhat connected to the technical execution, <b>but</b> are <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part dependent on the artistic qualities of the test.|$|R
25|$|They differ {{greatly in}} length and wording, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part appear {{to be derived from}} a single source that has not survived, and contain (except for some obvious insertions) no undeniably Christian teaching. Each version {{contains}} some unique material, as well as variations and omissions.|$|E
25|$|Goals {{depend on}} the individual, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, goals on the first date, are fairly similar between parties. In her study on first dates, Mary Claire Morr {{explains}} that expectations for a date can be formed based on information about the communicator, relationship and context.|$|E
25|$|The {{worldwide}} {{success of}} Metallica and {{the explosion of}} the hair metal scene in the US in the late 1980s had raised the level of interest in heavy metal music in Australia by the early 1990s <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part it was still primarily an underground scene.|$|E
40|$|In a l,OOO-mile {{section in}} the {{tropical}} Atlantic, flagellate species, with one exception, tended to be uniformly distributed, <b>but</b> diatoms, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, were more numerous toward {{the southern end of}} the section. This change was associated with an intensification of stratification of the upper 100 m. The relative ability of flagellates and diatoms to react to varying growth conditions, in turn dependent on hydrography, is discussed...|$|R
50|$|HIV/AIDS {{prevention}} efforts {{such as school}} education, education in the workplace, and mass media campaigns have largely failed to significantly impact South African townships. For example, HIV voluntary counseling and testing programmes have improved HIV/AIDS awareness in Khayelitsha, <b>but</b> have <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part failed to influence behavior. On the other hand, specific HIV/AIDS prevention methods such as <b>the</b> Priorities <b>for</b> Local AIDS Control Efforts (PLACE) method have demonstrated a potential for success.|$|R
50|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> cavalry regiments {{allocated}} {{as individual}} squadrons to the divisions, the regimental unit {{ceased to exist}} for all practical purposes. The Regimental Staffs were not dissolved, <b>but</b> were <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part left with the divisions they happened to find themselves with, {{to be used for}} special purposes. 16 Regimental Commanders found new employment as horse inspectors; two Regimental Staffs were changed into Infantry Regiment Staffs; and three Regimental Staffs were changed into JÃ¤ger Regiment Staffs.|$|R
25|$|The {{northern}} {{portion of}} the Arctic Cordillera was uplifted during the Innuitian orogeny when the North American Plate moved northward during the mid-Mesozoic. It contains igneous and metamorphic rocks, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part is composed of sedimentary rocks. Mountains on Axel Heiberg Island consist mainly of long ridges of folded mid-Mesozoic and Palaeozoic strata with minor igneous intrusions.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a Jewish {{presence}} in Gibraltar for more than 650 years. There have been periods of persecution, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part the Jews of Gibraltar have prospered and {{been one of the}} largest religious minorities in the city, where they have made contributions to the culture, defence, and Government of Gibraltar.|$|E
25|$|Because Lingo {{tried to}} fill orders for everyone, the Oorang strain size was never standardized. Airedales {{weighing}} from 40 to 100 pounds were produced, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part they were approximately 50 pounds and 22 to 24inches at the shoulder. In the United States, the males Airedales measure 40 to 70 pounds, with Oorang strain typically in 80 pounds to 120 pounds range.|$|E
50|$|A magnet is a {{material}} or object {{that produces a}} magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible <b>but</b> is responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets.|$|R
50|$|A {{significant}} number of Bosnians converted to Islam after the conquest by the Ottoman Empire {{in the second half}} of the 15th century, giving it a unique character within the Balkan region. It took more than a hundred years <b>for</b> <b>the</b> number of Muslims to become the majority religion. The general view among scholars is that the Islamization of the Bosnian population was not the result of violent methods of conversions <b>but</b> was, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, peaceful and voluntary.|$|R
50|$|NSA {{dropped the}} {{component}} that monitored for abuse of records. It not only tracked {{the use of}} <b>the</b> database, <b>but</b> hunted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> effective analysis techniques, and some analysts {{thought it would be}} used to judge their performance. Within the NSA, <b>the</b> primary advocate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ThinThread program was Richard Taylor. Taylor has retired from the NSA. The strength of ThinThread's approach is that by encrypting information on Americans, it is legal regardless of whether the country is at war.|$|R
25|$|Smith was {{a relaxed}} man who {{thoroughly}} enjoyed his football, and this {{showed in the}} teams that he produced at Bloomfield Road over the years. One of his first signings was Fred Chandler, from his old club, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part he kept together the team he inherited from his predecessor Sandy MacFarlane, who, after leaving Blackpool, retired from the game {{at the age of}} 57.|$|E
25|$|Like {{others of}} his time, he puzzled over the {{problems}} of fitting native peopling of the New World and their development into a Biblical framework, and seldom doubted authenticity of miracles, or the Providential intervention which accounted for Cortes' Conquest {{as an expression of}} Divine Will. <b>But</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part he went at his tasks with professional coolness, and a rather high degree of historiographical craftsmanship.|$|E
25|$|The only {{existing}} Scandinavian texts {{dating to}} the period before 1050 (besides a few finds of inscriptions on coins) are found amongst the runic inscriptions, {{some of which were}} scratched onto pieces of wood or metal spearheads, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part they have been found on actual stones. In addition, the runestones usually remain in their original form and at their original locations, and so their importance as historical sources cannot be overstated.|$|E
50|$|Angell {{is the son}} of Katharine Sergeant Angell White, The New Yorkerâs first fiction editor, and the stepson of renowned essayist E. B. White, <b>but</b> {{was raised}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part by his father, Ernest Angell, an {{attorney}} who became head of the American Civil Liberties Union.|$|R
50|$|The {{climate of}} Nazareth town is usually dry. A short rainy season exists <b>but</b> <b>the</b> weather <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part its hot and humid. Paddy is mainly {{cultivated}} {{in and around}} the places of Nazareth, followed by cereals green and black grams. Banana is also cultivated here on a large scale.|$|R
25|$|The {{heavy snow}} began falling across east central Minnesota and {{northwest}} Wisconsin {{during the late}} afternoon hours of October 31. By midnight, the Twin Cities had already recorded 8.2in (20.8cm) of snow. This not only set a record <b>for</b> <b>the</b> largest amount of snow on that date, <b>but</b> also <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> snow ever recorded in the Twin Cities {{during the month of}} October. As the storm system pushed its way northward, more communities in eastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin began to experience similar conditions; and thundersnow occurred as far north as Duluth.|$|R
25|$|The HudsonâBergen Light Rail {{system uses}} a {{combination}} of old rail and new exclusive rights-of-way {{for most of its}} length, with some grade separation in certain areas. It shares a lane with automobiles on a portion of Essex Street in downtown Jersey City, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, does not operate with other traffic. At-grade crossings are equipped with special signals to automatically change traffic lights in favor of the light rail.|$|E
25|$|The colony {{suffered}} from economic fluctuations, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part was prosperous, experiencing steady growth. With few external threats and strong trade {{links with the}} Empire, Tasmania enjoyed many fruitful periods in the late 19th century, becoming a world-centre of shipbuilding. It raised a local defence force that eventually {{played a significant role}} in the Second Boer War in South Africa, and Tasmanian soldiers in that conflict won the first two Victoria Crosses awarded to Australians.|$|E
25|$|Not surprisingly, strikes {{increased}} steadily {{from the}} middle of 1915, and so did crime; <b>but,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, people suffered and endured, scouring the city for food. Working class women in St. Petersburg reportedly spent about forty hours a week in food lines, begging, turning to prostitution or crime, tearing down wooden fences to keep stoves heated for warmth, grumbling about the rich, and wondering when and how this would all come to an end.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} cost-reducing R&D investments by {{firms that}} behave non-cooperatively or cooperatively. Firms face a trade-off between allocating their R&D investments to innovate or to imitate (absorb). We {{find that the}} non-cooperative behavior not only induces more imitation (absorption) <b>but</b> also, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, more innovation investments. Only the cooperative behavior, however, ensures that R&D investments are allocated efficiently to innovation and to imitation (absorption) {{in the sense that}} any given amount of industry-wide cost reduction is obtained <b>for</b> <b>the</b> minimum overall R&D costs. Absorptive capacity, Cooperation, Spillovers, Innovation, Imitation, R&D,...|$|R
50|$|Cleo Moore {{starred in}} seven films for Haas, {{becoming}} a well-known film star in that era. Other actresses who starred in Haas' films were Beverly Michaels and Carol Morris. The Haas pictures generally received poor reviews <b>but</b> were <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part commercially successful, and on occasion featured such well-known names as Eleanor Parker, John Agar, Vince Edwards, Joan Blondell, Agnes Moorehead, Julie London, Corinne Griffith, and Marie Windsor. Haas' final film, Paradise Alley {{was rejected by}} the major studios and sat unreleased for over three years, finally surfacing in a limited run in 1962.|$|R
40|$|Peer reviewedThe article investigates demonic evil as a {{historic}} theme in KÃ¶nigâs theology, {{a theme that}} has been important to him <b>but</b> which, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> part, {{has come to the}} fore indirectly. His high regard for Scripture and of what is said in the Bible about God and Jesus has also led him to take references to demonic powers seriously. Implications of his approach to these issues and his theology on the subject, as it has grown over three decades, are discussed. Some biographical data are linked to his theological viewpoints on these issues...|$|R
