25|$|Christianity holds several {{different}} views on Christ's role in defeating Satan. Some emphasize Christ's {{death and resurrection}} as sealing Satan's fate, so that the devil is already defeated though not banished. Others emphasize the devil's final judgment when Christ returns, at which time the terror and deceit of Satan will have no more effect on the world. This is <b>because</b> <b>mankind</b> will face final judgment and the earth will be purged or cleansed with fire. Satan will be bound to the lake of fire (Rev 20) with the Beast, the false prophet and all those whose names {{are not in the}} Book of Life.|$|E
2500|$|After {{weeks of}} trying to get his hands on McMahon's new faction, the Corporation, Mankind {{received}} a title shot against The Rock at [...] Mankind won the match by shoving a stench-ridden sock down The Rock's gullet, but McMahon ruled that the title would not change hands <b>because</b> <b>Mankind</b> did not win by pinfall or submission. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind had his big night on December 29, where Mankind defeated The Rock and won his first WWF Championship. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the , TV ratings became more important. The rival WCW, attempting {{to take advantage of the}} fact that their show Monday Nitro aired live while Mankind's title victory was taped the week before, had announcer Tony Schiavone reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, [...] "That'll put a lot of butts in the seats." [...] The move backfired for WCW, as Nielsen ratings showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the Hogan vs. Nash main event which led to the reformation of the New World Order. Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from Nitro to Raw to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this, and [...] "Mick Foley put my butt in this seat" [...] signs began showing up at WWF events.|$|E
60|$|The general {{principles}} of science, {{such as the}} belief in the reign of law, and the belief that every event must have a cause, are as completely dependent upon the inductive principle as are the beliefs of daily life All such {{general principles}} are believed <b>because</b> <b>mankind</b> have found innumerable instances of their truth and no instances of their falsehood.

The image of God in man requires communication between God and human beings. God’s incomprehensibility is {{another reason for the}} necessity of Scripture. Natural revelation’s insufficiency to teach the nature of God makes Scripture indispensable. The complexity of divine truth would have eventually required a written revelation even for Adam had he remained in his unfallen state. The fall of man made comprehension of divine truth in an oral form impossible, <b>because</b> corrupt <b>mankind</b> is always prone to distort what is oral. God’s special revelation had to be in written form. The work of God also makes written Scripture a necessity, since Scripture is the means that God has chosen to do His work in human lives. Without Scripture much would be left undone. There can be no question that Scripture {{is necessary}}...|$|R

60|$|We then, {{every one}} of us who is here to-day, have a right to believe that we have a share in Christ's eternal life: that our {{original}} sin, that is, the sinfulness which we inherited from our forefathers, is all forgiven and forgotten, and that mankind is now redeemed, and belongs to the second Adam, the true and original head and pattern of man, Jesus Christ, in whom was no sin; and that <b>because</b> <b>mankind</b> belongs to him, God is well pleased with them, and reconciled to them, and looks on them not as a guilty, but as a pardoned and beloved race of beings.|$|E

For this we have reason to be thankful; and the appearance of affairs in that quarter is hopeful, but our hope is mingled with anxiety, <b>because</b> <b>mankind</b> is terribly prone to go to sleep on hopeful appearances. Our nature is such, that our only chance of success lies, under God, in resolving ceaselessly to energise until our ends be accomplished. We must see to it that the Khedive of Egypt acts in accordance with his professions, and for this end efficient consular agency is as needful in the north-east as in the south-east.|$|E

60|$|And if {{we apply}} the third test {{to this problem}} of {{political}} secrecy, the case is even clearer and even more funny. Surely no one {{will say that the}} purchase of peerages and such things are kept secret because they are so light and impulsive and unimportant that they must be matters of individual fancy. A child sees a flower {{and for the first time}} feels inclined to pick it. But surely no one will say that a brewer sees a coronet and for the first time suddenly thinks that he would like to be a peer. The child's impulse need not be explained to the police, for the simple reason that it could not be explained to anybody. But does any one believe that the laborious political ambitions of modern commercial men ever have this airy and incommunicable character? A man lying on the beach may throw stones into the sea without any particular reason. But does any one believe that the brewer throws bags of gold into the party funds without any particular reason? This theory of the secrecy of political money must also be regretfully abandoned; and with it the two other possible excuses as well. This secrecy is one which cannot be justified as a sensational joke nor as a common human freemasonry, nor as an indescribable personal whim. Strangely enough, indeed, it violates all three conditions and classes at once. It is not hidden in order to be revealed: it is hidden in order to be hidden. It is not kept secret because it is a common secret of mankind, but <b>because</b> <b>mankind</b> must not get hold of it. And it is not kept secret because it is too unimportant to be told, but because it is much too important to bear telling. In short, the thing we have is the real and perhaps rare political phenomenon of an occult government. We have an exoteric and an esoteric doctrine. England is really ruled by priestcraft, but not by priests. We have in this country all that has ever been alleged against the evil side of religion; the peculiar class with privileges, the sacred words that are unpronounceable; the important things known only to the few. In fact we lack nothing except the religion.|$|E
5000|$|The {{revelation of}} God is {{continuous}} <b>because</b> <b>mankind</b> is slowly evolving {{to a higher}} level, making it necessary to perfect the doctrine.

50|$|Farabee held fairly modern views {{regarding}} {{the people that}} inhabited the Amazon. He felt that all cultures are a product of their environment {{and that there is}} no way to separate culture and the influence that the surrounding world has had on it (Farabee, 1917). He stated that “…there are no primitive men, neither is there primitive culture,” (Ibid), which was a novel concept at a time when man was still often viewed in terms of the size of his crania. Although this did not preclude him from obtaining anthropometric data during his travels. Farabee went on to state that “Man has been able to profit by his knowledge of nature’s laws, but he has not overcome them” (Farabee 1917). This statement was also innovative <b>because</b> <b>mankind</b> was typically viewed as the apex of creation and able to overcome his natural environment.

[...] Instead, Mill attributed many important qualities to this future state, he even believed the state would bring about [...] "... a very considerable improvement on our present condition." [...] According to Mill, the stationary state was at {{one and the same}} time inevitable, necessary and desirable: It was inevitable, because the accumulation of capital would bring about a falling rate of profit that would diminish investment opportunities and hamper further accumulation; it was also necessary, <b>because</b> <b>mankind</b> {{had to learn how to}} reduce its size and its level of consumption within the boundaries set by nature and by employment opportunities; finally, the stationary state was desirable, as it would ease the introduction of public income redistibution schemes, create more equality and put an end to man's ruthless struggle to get by — instead, the human spirit would be liberated to the benefit of more elevated social and cultural activities, 'the graces of life'.|$|E
5000|$|He {{believed}} that orthodox Christianity {{no longer had}} any meaning to people {{because it did not}} discuss Christianity within the context of contemporary theology. Christian atheists want to be completely separated from most orthodox Christian beliefs and biblical traditions.

This faith [...] "can never identify itself with an ecclesiastical tradition or with a given doctrinal or ritual form." [...] He {{goes on to say that}} faith cannot [...] "have any final assurance as to what it means to be a Christian". Altizer said, [...] "We must not, he says, seek for the sacred by saying 'no' to the radical profanity of our age, but by saying 'yes' to it". They see religions which withdraw from the world as moving away from truth. This is part of the reason why they see the existence of God as counter-progressive. Altizer wrote of God as the enemy to man <b>because</b> <b>mankind</b> could never reach its fullest potential while God existed.

5000|$|In {{the fall}} of 1998, McMahon said he was [...] "damn sick and tired" [...] of seeing Stone Cold Steve Austin as the WWF Champion and {{developed}} a [...] "master plan" [...] to remove the championship from Austin. By employing the services of The Undertaker and Kane, McMahon set up a triple threat match for the WWF championship at Breakdown: In Your House, in which Undertaker and Kane could only win by pinning Austin. At Breakdown, Austin lost the title after being pinned simultaneously by both Undertaker and Kane. However, no new champion was crowned. The following night on Raw Is War, McMahon attempted to announce a new WWF Champion. He held a presentation ceremony, and introduced The Undertaker and Kane. After saying that both deserved to be the WWF Champion, Austin drove a Zamboni into the arena, and attacked McMahon before police officers stopped him, and arrested him. Because The Undertaker and Kane both failed to defend McMahon from Austin, McMahon did not name a new champion, but instead made a match at Judgment Day between The Undertaker and Kane with Austin as the special referee. This prompted The Undertaker and Kane to attack Mr. McMahon, injuring his ankle because he gave them the finger behind their backs. At Judgement Day, {{there was still no}} champion crowned as Austin declared himself the winner after counting a double pinfall three count for both men. McMahon ordered the WWF Championship to be defended in a 14-man tournament named Deadly Games at Survivor Series in 1998. McMahon made sure that Mankind reached the finals <b>because</b> <b>Mankind</b> had visited McMahon in hospital after McMahon was sent to the hospital by the Undertaker and Kane. He also awarded Mankind the WWF Hardcore Championship due to his status as a hardcore wrestling legend. Originally, McMahon was acting as he if he was helping out Mankind during the match. At one point, The Rock turned his attention to McMahon. McMahon turned on Mankind after a screwjob, however, as The Rock had caught Mankind in the Sharpshooter. Mankind had not submitted but McMahon ordered the referee to ring the bell, thus giving The Rock the WWF Championship. This was an homage to the [...] "Montreal Screwjob" [...] that occurred one year earlier. McMahon referred to The Rock as the [...] "Corporate Champion" [...] thus forming the Corporation with his son Shane and The Rock. At Rock Bottom: In Your House, Mankind defeated The Rock to win the WWF Championship after The Rock passed out to the Mandible Claw. McMahon, however, screwed Mankind once again by reversing the decision and returning the belt to his chosen champion, The Rock. McMahon participated in a [...] "Corporate Rumble" [...] on the January 11, 1999 Raw as an unscheduled participant, but was eliminated by Chyna.|$|E
