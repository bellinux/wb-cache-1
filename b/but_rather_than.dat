It has an Aristotelian structure, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, comparing natural and artificial processes. Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical. Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed {{place on the}} scala naturae, Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant can transform into another, as when a field sown to wheat turns to the weed darnel.|$|E

5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure was created by a {{different}} third-party developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have given more nuanced reviews {{of the first two}} games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.|$|E
5|$|Thus Meher Baba {{offers many}} {{suggestions}} that keep one moving towards God-realization. These suggestions include putting theory into practice, the internal renunciation of desires, offering selfless service to humanity or the master, spontaneity, while avoiding actions that bind one to illusion. <b>But</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> lay out moral rules, Baba offers an understanding {{as to why}} some actions bind the individual whereas some others help towards his emancipation. Many chapters offer {{a better understanding of}} the mechanisms by which consciousness gets caught up between the opposites of experience, such as pleasure and pain, good and evil, and point to a way of transcending them.|$|E
5|$|Among the bishops, {{only two}} stood out as {{significant}} political figures, the more prominent {{of whom was}} Robert Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury. Long a formidable presence in English public life, Winchelsey had led the struggle against Edward I to uphold {{the autonomy of the}} church, and for this he had paid with suspension and exile. One of Edward II’s first acts as king had been to reinstate Winchelsey, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> responding with grateful loyalty, the archbishop soon reassumed a leadership role in the fight against the king. Although he was trying to appease Winchelsey, the king carried an old grudge against another prelate, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield. Edward had Langton dismissed from his position as treasurer of the Exchequer and had his temporal possessions confiscated. Langton had been an opponent of Winchelsey during the previous reign, but Edward II’s move against Langton drew the two Ordainers together.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, Monroe {{spent most of her}} {{childhood}} in foster homes and an orphanage and married at the age of sixteen. While working in a radioplane factory in 1944 as part of the war effort, she was introduced to a photographer from the First Motion Picture Unit and began a successful pin-up modeling career. The work led to short-lived film contracts with Twentieth Century-Fox (1946–1947) and Columbia Pictures (1948). After a series of minor film roles, she signed a new contract with Fox in 1951. Over the next two years, she became a popular actress with roles in several comedies, including As Young as You Feel and Monkey Business, and in the dramas Clash by Night and Don't Bother to Knock. Monroe faced a scandal when it was revealed that she had posed for nude photos before becoming a star, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> damaging her career, the story resulted in increased interest in her films.|$|E
5|$|Brushstrokes {{series is}} the name {{for a series of}} {{paintings}} produced in 196566 by Roy Lichtenstein. It also refers to derivative sculptural representations of these paintings that were first made in the 1980s. In the series, the theme is art as a subject, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> reproduce masterpieces as he had starting in 1962, Lichtenstein depicted the gestural expressions of the painting brushstroke itself. The works in this series are linked to those produced by artists who use the gestural painting style of abstract expressionism made famous by Jackson Pollock, but differ from them due to their mechanically produced appearance. The series is considered a satire or parody of gestural painting by both Lichtenstein and his critics. After 1966, Lichtenstein incorporated this series into later motifs and themes of his work.|$|E
5|$|By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. The fishery {{rules were}} {{reinforced}} by fresh legislation in 1758, which created {{a court of}} conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, this court was supposed {{to sit at the}} fort, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking. The fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of the}} 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|HeliumII also {{exhibits}} a creeping effect. When a surface extends past {{the level of}} heliumII, the heliumII moves along the surface, against the force of gravity. HeliumII will escape from a vessel that is not sealed by creeping along the sides until it reaches a warmer region where it evaporates. It moves in a 30nm-thick film regardless of surface material. This film is called a Rollin film and is named after the man who first characterized this trait, Bernard V. Rollin. As {{a result of this}} creeping behavior and heliumII's ability to leak rapidly through tiny openings, {{it is very difficult to}} confine liquid helium. Unless the container is carefully constructed, the heliumII will creep along the surfaces and through valves until it reaches somewhere warmer, where it will evaporate. Waves propagating across a Rollin film are governed by the same equation as gravity waves in shallow water, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> gravity, the restoring force is the van der Waals force. These waves are known as third sound.|$|E
5|$|In 173, the Quadi rebelled and overthrew Furtius, who {{was their}} client-king {{appointed}} {{to them by}} Rome, and replaced him with Ariogaesus, who wanted {{to enter into negotiations}} with Marcus. As the success of the Marcomannic wars was in no danger, Marcus refused to negotiate. At that point only the Iazyges had not yet been defeated by Rome. Judging from the lack of action on Marcus Aurelius' part, it appears he was unconcerned, but when the Iazyges attacked across the frozen Danube in late 173 and early 174, Marcus redirected his attention to them. Trade restrictions on the Marcomanni were also partially lifted at that timethey were allowed to visit the Roman markets at certain times of certain days. In an attempt to force Marcus to negotiate, Ariogaesus began to support the Iazyges. Marcus Aurelius put out a bounty on him, offering 1,000 aurei for his capture and delivery to Rome, or 500 aurei for his severed head. After this, Ariogaesus was captured by the Romans, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> executing him, Marcus Aurelius sent him into exile.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} of England private castles were being built by newly emerging, wealthy families; like the work at Windsor, these castles drew on the {{architectural}} themes of earlier martial designs, but were not intended to form a serious defence against attack. These new castles were heavily influenced by French designs, involving a rectangular or semi-rectangular castle with corner towers, gatehouses and moat; the walls effectively enclosing a comfortable courtyard plan not dissimilar to that of an unfortified manor. Bodiam Castle built in the 1380s possessed a moat, towers and gunports <b>but,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> being a genuine military fortification, the castle was primarily intended to be admired by visitors and used as a luxurious dwelling – the chivalric architecture implicitly invoking comparisons with Edward I's great castle at Beaumaris.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} 24September that Edward left Acre. Arriving in Sicily, he was met {{with the news that}} his father had died on 16November, 1272. Edward was deeply saddened by this news, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> hurrying home at once, he made a leisurely journey northwards. This was due partly to his still-poor health, but also to a lack of urgency. The {{political}} situation in England was stable after the mid-century upheavals, and Edward was proclaimed king at his father's death, rather than at his own coronation, as had until then been customary. In Edward's absence, the country was governed by a royal council, led by Robert Burnell. The new king embarked on an overland journey through Italy and France, where among other things he visited Pope Gregory X. Only on 2 August 1274 did he return to England, and he was crowned on 19 August.|$|E
5|$|James Beckwourth {{opened the}} Beckwourth Trail over Beckwourth Pass in 1851, {{crossing}} the Sierra Nevada {{at a lower}} elevation than the existing Donner Pass route of the California Trail. This split from the Truckee Route of the California Trail near Reno and roughly followed the present SR 70 to Quincy, <b>but,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> passing through the Feather River Canyon, it followed Oroville-Quincy Highway along ridges to Bidwell's Bar. A company was incorporated on July 23, 1855 to build the Quincy and Spanish Ranch Wagon Road, which bypassed the older trail from Quincy west to Spanish Ranch and began collecting tolls in November. The Pioneer Wagon Road, another toll road, was built in 1856 and 1857, continuing the improvements southwest to Buckeye (just before the Butte County line). An 1866 law authorized Plumas County to improve the portion from Quincy east to Beckwourth. The county also improved the road east from Beckwourth over the pass {{as part of the}} Red Clover Wagon Road, which began at Genesee and was completed in the 1870s.|$|E

Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, <b>but</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.|$|E
