Hunting, trapping and fishing essentially serve their subsistence and by far do not contribute enough added value, as would be needed. In addition, the trade with more significant products gained from these activities, like seal furs, or ivory from narwhal or walrus, is subject to international restrictions.

40|$|The goal of {{the article}} lies {{in the study of}} the essence of labour {{motivation}} and establishment of differences between stimulation and motivation. While analysing the “motivation” notion the article shows that internal wishes and goals of a human being stimulate this human being to act in a specific direction in order to achieve the set goal. Moreover, the article states that there are two theories of motivation in the modern economic literature – meaningful and procedural. As analysis of indicators of payment for labour in Ukraine shows, there is a rather significant differentiation of sizes <b>of</b> wages by <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> and there are arrears of wages.

40|$|Though {{the basic}} {{economic}} problems are still {{of the same}} kind all over East Germany, partially considerable regional differences exist in respect to the conditions for further economic development. Therefore, detailed empirical analyses for the individual Länder and their sub-regions are necessary making economic policy recommendations. The following contribution deals with this task taking Saxony-Anhalt as an example. A multitude of indicators is used to bring out the specific strengths and weaknesses of the economy of this state (Land) and its sub-regions. The outstanding strength of Saxony-Anhalt are the high private investment outlays which served to build a modern capital stock during the past ten years. Another fundamental strength of the Land are the universities and public research institutions. Besides these unambiguous strengths some ‘ambivalent’ growth factors exist which are characterized by strengths as well as by weaknesses. Such ‘ambivalent’ growth factors are the infrastructure and the situation of important sectors and <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> The weaknesses <b>of</b> Saxony-Anhalt’s <b>economic</b> structure find expression especially in its low supply with human capital and entrepreneurial initiative {{as well as in the}} few research and development efforts of its firms. The aforementioned strengths of the Land are reflected insufficiently in its economic output. Consequently some economic policy measures are proposed to bring about an improvement: Amongst other things Saxony-Anhalt should develop a clear idea <b>of</b> its <b>economic</b> development (Leitbild). Such a Leitbild could be related to the Land’s strengths or to the elimination of its major weaknesses. This also would facilitate a concentrated use <b>of</b> the different <b>economic</b> policy instruments. The latter shouldn’t only be concentrated on singular economic growth factors but also spatially, on the economically stronger sub-regions, as this can lead to larger growth effects for the entire Land. The good provision with public research institutions in Saxony-Anhalt should be used to bring about an improvement <b>of</b> the <b>economic</b> structure to a larger extent than until now. This could be done for example by means of a further strengthening of applied research vs. basic research, possibly via orienting the public research more towards the existing <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Finally, the Land should intensify its efforts to increase the entrepreneurial initiative in Saxony-Anhalt, e. g. by means of introducing courses in economics in its schools. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{characteristics}} of the production process in the Quebec economy. We devote particular attention to two features of the technology: the returns to scale and the substitution possibilities. Two forms of production functions, the Cobb-Douglas and an homothetic translog production function, are estimated for six <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> These are: Agriculture; Fishing and Forestry; Mining; Quarying and Oil Wells; Manufacturing; Utilities; Services. Two main conclusions are derived from this work. First, there is strong evidence of constant returns to scale in all <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> the Quebec economy but services. Second, when comparing the Cobb-Douglas model with an homothetic translog model, the hypothesis that the true model is the Cobb-Douglas one cannot be rejected for five of our six sectors. Therefore, there is evidence that the elasticity of substitution is around one. Finally a byproduct of our work has been the construction of capital stock series for the Quebec economy (1960 - 73) disaggregated into 14 sectors, and two types of capital: construction and machinery and equipment...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] This is {{the fourth}} issue of the ILO 2 ̆ 7 s report series: Global Estimates on Child Labour. The present Report {{provides}} new global and regional estimates on child labour for the year 2012 and compares them with the previous estimates for 2000, 2004 and 2008. The Report draws on an increasing amount of data from national-level child labour surveys (SIMPOC surveys) and other sources. Understanding Children 2 ̆ 7 s Work (UCW), an interagency programme on child labour statistics and research, provided access to non-ILO data and assisted in the analysis. The new child labour estimates are based on refined estimation techniques fully comparable with the ones for 2000, 2004 and 2008 rounds. They also benefited from: (a) the international standards on child labour statistics adopted by the 18 th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS) in 2008; and (b) an integrated approach to estimation using standardized tabulation schemes for national data and composite estimation procedures for arriving at regional and global trends. The remainder of the Report is structured as follows. Chapter 1 highlights the main estimation findings for 2012. Chapter 2 presents the current child labour situation. Chapter 3 presents the dynamic child labour situation, comparing estimation results from 2012 with those of 2000, 2004 and 2008. For Chapters 2 and 3, data are disaggregated {{to the extent possible}} by age group, sex, region, <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> national income category and status in employment.

40|$|The {{success of}} small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) in industrialised countries has led to the increasing recognition of their role in exports, and in transition economies, this is driven by private-sector-led economic growth. The objective of this thesis is to determine major factors influencing export propensity of Polish SMEs in an expanded European Union (EU). All investigated enterprises are located in the Gdansk province. This study employs the Logit model to explain why some SMEs are exporters (their export propensity) in Poland. The second contribution of this thesis is to find out why some Polish SMEs are non-exporters and will not even engage in future export activities (export aversion). The results of the study indicate that the essential sources of an enterprise's finance, the perception about major problems with respect to export operations and the actions taken to prepare for the accession of Poland to the EU are very important drivers of export propensity and export aversion. More importantly, the results show that the information about special foreign credit available for Polish SMEs and the number of competing firms in domestic market have a positive influence on their export propensity. A strong relationship has been observed between the extent of use of IT tools in distribution-marketing and export propensity. Our results also illustrate that the propensity to export is dependent on the capital of the firm and on profitability of the firm in the domestic market. However, our findings reveal that legal status of firms, the <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> of the enterprise, the firms with less attractiveness and modernity of products, the firms with little knowledge of EU members' markets and the firms with low technological levels are the factors influencing export aversion of Polish SMEs. Our results demonstrate that the domestic share of the market of the firm is significant in explaining export propensity and aversion. Our empirical results should contribute to policy makers' designing effective assistance programmes to encourage Polish SMEs in their exporting.

Te su regule kruna ranijih raznolikih oblika slavljena kulta vina kroz narodnu pjesmu, vinska bratstva, kroz govore, zdravice, stihove i pjesme. Do Križanicevih navoda i Patacicevih Doktora od Pinte nemamo važnijega spomenika hrvatske vinopijske kulture. Posebice u 19. stoljecu u cijeloj su zemlji nicala vinsko-pajdaška bratstva, klubovi i družine s razlicitim propisima i pravilima. I Križevacki su štatuti postojali samo u usmenosti do 19. stoljeca, kada su zapisani. Regule traju i danas zahvaljujuci i izvedbama i zapisu. With {{their arrival}} in the {{territory}} that is Croatia today, the Croats adopted grapevines as an agricultural product. Numerous charters, laws and statutes dating from {{as early as the}} 9 th century stress the importance of vine-growing as a <b>branch</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> The relatively strong development of viticulture contributed to the founding of the oldest agricultural college in south-eastern Europe, the Agricultural and Forestry College in Križevci in 1860. The initial notations of the Križevci Statutes, the best-known Croatian rules on companionable wine-drinking, date from that time. Previously they had been handed down by word of mouth. These rules are a continuation and fruit of earlier oral-literary forms that lived on among the people, from epic folk poems dedicated to wine, to speeches, toasts, verses and wine-drinking songs. Croatian good cheer flourished along with the oral, popular song, but right up until Križanic’s quotations and Patacic’s Doktor od Pinte we have no important memorials to Croatian wine-drinking culture. Following Pinta, and particularly during the 19 th century, companionable wine-drinking brotherhoods, clubs and societies with various rules and regulations sprouted up all over Croatia. After the Statues were written down, discussions started about whether the Croatian rules had been influenced by the drinking regulations from Central Europe, especially those from Germany. Croatian students abroad maintained a particular connection with the Statutes. Wine and the Statutes were the thread which bound them together in socialising in their spare time, as was written about by the Croatian authors, August Šenoa, Josip Eugen Tomic and Vjenceslav Novak. Slovenian students abroad also socialised in keeping with the rules of the Križevci Statutes. They took those Croatian companionable wine-drinking rules and translated them into Slovenian, adapting them to their own use. Wine-drinking clubs in 19 th century Croatia were not reduced merely to wine toasting, but also served for preservation of the national awareness of the Croats in the struggle against Germanisation and Hungarianisation. However, that dose of seriousness in no way suppressed the cheery atmosphere and humour that accompany good wine. The customs connected with vineyards and wine are often a coupling of pre-Christian and Christian features and are a set of elements of various origins. Croatian wine-growing tradition is familiar with five obligatory saints, with whom the majority of activities connected with the vine are linked, as well as the best-known customs. These saints are celebrated on St Vinko’s Day on January 22, St George’s Day (Juraj) on April 23, St John the Baptist’s Day (Ivan Krstitelj) on June 24, St Michael’s Day (Mihovil) on September 29 and St Martin’s Day on November 11. The cheerful popular spirit connected with wine has been a constant, despite all the changes brought by civilisation in the cultivation of the grapevine throughout the centuries. It remains visible in the customs, rituals, songs, stories, legends and rhetorical and minor oral-literary forms, and is reflected through the statutes, rules, regulations and ceremonies. It has endured in the Croatian regions, either in performance or in notations, or, as in the example of the Križevci Statutes, in both ways among all social strata and throughout all eras...|$|E

Descobrir os anseios do consumidor e adequar o produto final à expectativa do mesmo constitui-se num verdadeiro desafio em qualquer ramo da atividade econômica. Em se tratando de habitação, não raro o construtor depara-se com um mercado em franca competição e sujeito aos diversos imprevistos da economia, os quais geralmente afetam a demanda por habitação e, por conseguinte interferem na rentabilidade, liquidez e segurança dos investimentos imobiliários. Esta pesquisa elabora um modelo de inferência econômica que se baseia nas informações fornecidas pelos demandantes por apartamentos na cidade de Florianópolis. Para tanto, um protocolo de pesquisa, já utilizado pelo grupo de pesquisa imobiliária para o SINDUSCON de Florianópolis # Sindicato da Indústria da Construção Civil de Florianópolis SC # foi necessário para entender como os atributos relevantes de demanda e/ou rejeição influenciam a demanda para diferentes categorias de clientes das construtoras, neste trabalho enfocando apenas segmentos familiares. O arcabouço teórico foi retirado da teoria econômica, estatística, econometria e álgebra. A teoria econômica forneceu subsídios sobre o comportamento do consumidor, teoria da utilidade e elasticidade da demanda. A modelagem probabilística foi fornecida pela estatística, útil para se entender o comportamento considerado como aleatório das variáveis (atributos) em estudo. A álgebra foi utilizada para planejar a distribuição dos atributos que maximiza a demanda para determinados segmentos de clientes que serão objeto de estudo desta tese. Pretende-se que um modelo decisório surja da combinação metódica dos instrumentos teóricos listados anteriormente. Desta forma, o produto final desta tese foi um modelo de apoio às decisões mercadológicas, o qual servirá para tirar o máximo de proveito do conhecimento das utilidades percebidas pelo consumidor do tipo de habitação estudado neste trabalho. Será feito a análise de flexibilidade da demanda pelos diferentes estágios do ciclo de vida familiar, bem como por renda e por localização. A vantagem deste método está na perspectiva que será a do usuário e não a do técnico economista; assim, os fatores como conjuntura política, oscilação e/ou alta de juros e outros fatores que enfraquecem modelos econômicos convencionais, já estão embutidos no protocolo.

They identify {{the emergence of a}} new technological paradigm in the 1970 s, strongly based on the application of information and communication technologies (ICTs), arguing that in such periods of transition and emergence of new techno-economic paradigms, the intermediate development countries and the countries which are not at the technological frontier have higher opportunities to catch-up. Although this debate is theoretically well documented, the empirics seem to lag behind the theory. In this article, we contribute to this literature by adding enlightening evidence on the issue. More precisely, we relate the growth experiences of countries which had relatively similar economic structures in the late 1970 s, with changes occurring in these countries' structures between 1979 and 2003. The results reveal a robust relationship between structure and (labor) productivity growth, and lend support to the view that producing (though not user) ICT-related industries are strategic <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Copyright 2011 The Author 2011.

Currently, social well-being is considered to be the reflection <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> the instrument <b>of</b> state influence on the society, as well as an indicator of the social security system. Due to the fact that Russia is integrated into the world economy, the foreign-economic policy currently is playing {{an important role in the}} development of national security and the state's interest to the spheres of economy considering external and internal threats. Decline in external economic conditions may result in serious consequences for the functioning and development of the country as well as for the trade and investment activities, which will further lead to the decline in export, withdrawal of capital, recession of industrial production, trade and investment sphere, fall of GDP and living standards. Thus, considering the current state of instability in the world economy and the growing political tension in relation to Russian Federation, the measures to increase economic security in the country should be taken. The policy of import substitution is considered to be one of the major solutions nowadays...|$|R

This could be threat as well as opportunities for banking sector of Nepal. The existing level of Non-Performing Assets (NPA) is not that much healthy sign for the smooth growth of banking sector. One should seriously need to re-think proper strategy for managing NPA. The predominance of rural economy urge bank and financial institutions of Nepal to peneterate in this sector with innovative products of microfinance as insurence, remittance, etc. so as to support poverty alleviation programme. Expansion of Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in rural sector could lured to banking sector to invest on it too. Managing inflow of remittances would yield fruitful outcome for Nepal. Public private partnership concept will be equally desirable for poverty alleviation, growth and expansion of banking service especially in the rural economy.

The paper proposes EUROMIND, which is a new monthly indicator of the euro area economic conditions, based on tracking real gross domestic product monthly, relying on information provided in the Eurostat Euro-IND database. EUROMIND has several original economic and statistical features. First, it considers both the output and the expenditure sides of the economy, as it provides a monthly estimate of the value added <b>of</b> the six <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>of</b> the main gross domestic product components by type of expenditure (final consumption, gross capital formation and net exports), and combines the estimates with optimal weights reflecting their relative precision. Second, the indicator is based on information at both the monthly and the quarterly level, modelled with a dynamic factor specification cast in state space form. Third, since estimation of the multivariate dynamic factor model with mixed frequency data can be numerically complex, computational efficiency is achieved by implementing univariate filtering and smoothing procedures. Finally, special attention is paid to chain linking and its implications, via a multistep procedure that exploits the additivity of the volume measures expressed at the prices of the previous year...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between job mobility during working life and health state after retirement was studied {{in a random}} sample of 627 retired men and women living in the Paris area who were beneficiaries of an interprofessional supplementary pension fund. State of health was evaluated by the number of health impairments that these subjects reported at the time of interview. Job mobility was defined by a dichotomic variable {{based on the number of}} different companies and <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> in which the subjects had worked. This information was obtained from the individual records supplied by the pension fund. For both sexes, a significant relation was found between the number of health impairments and job mobility: for men, the mean number of impairments was 1. 7 in the high mobility group and 1. 3 in the low mobility group, and for women these numbers were respectively 2. 1 and 1. 7. This finding seemed independent of the effects of selection and of the effects of factors such as age at the time of interview, age at retirement, previous diseases, past work accidents, and previous occupational exposures. These results suggest that a high job mobility during working life might be a risk factor for health after retirement...|$|R

The debate about the positive impact <b>of</b> FDI on <b>economic</b> growth remains open, and therefore the formulation <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> policy in developing regions such as Latin America and the Caribbean is still a dilemma between to adopting policies that support economic openness or implementing policies aimed at promoting the protection of domestic markets. However, in recent years Latin America has been leaning towards policies that promote FDI inflows so as to stimulate market growth and to increase the competitiveness in different <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> From this argument, the following thesis investigates the impact of FDI on the growth of Latin American developing economies by presenting an econometric analysis through the application of an OLS pooled panel data analysis for 19 Latin American countries between 1980 and 2010. The result of the research aims to test the hypothesis that establishes {{a positive}} relation between FDI inflows and economic growth. To do so, the relation FDI-growth is examined by the use of different control variables related with macroeconomic stability, trade openness, political stability, per capita GDP, and secondary schooling. The results of this research reveal a positive effect of FDI on the <b>economic</b> growth rate <b>of</b> the countries taken in the sample of the study.

40|$|Economics has {{traditionally}} been defined as the science of the allocation of scarce resources to different channels of production {{in order to provide}} goods and services. The resource allocation problem can be solved by the market mechanism. The markets and the prevailing prices provide signals for the most justified <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> and hence for the optimum and efficient allocation <b>of</b> resources and <b>economic</b> inputs. Problems <b>of</b> allocation arise when the level of certain activities compete for scale resources necessary to perform those activities. ^ The location of production activities is one aspect of optimal resource allocation. Production can take place at various points and consumers typically are located in different areas. ^ This dissertation is concerned with the development of a method for evaluating comparative location advantages and production costs in selected states for one product: air compressors. The specific goals of the dissertation are: (1) to establish a method for evaluating comparative location advantages for air compressors; (2) to determine whether the comparative location advantages will be altered by population shifts, and (3) to derive a method capable of analyzing the relative importance of production costs and transportation costs in the determination of comparative location advantages. ^ The final goal of this dissertation is to estimate minimum total costs as defined (production costs and transportation costs) and to seek an optimal solution for the air compressor industry, as represented in the model. ...|$|R

As exposi????es ambientais, principalmente as ocupacionais, t??m sido foco crescente destes trabalhos. Este estudo caso-controle de base hospitalar realizado na regi??o metropolitana do Rio de Janeiro, entre 1999 - 2002, teve como objetivo identificar as associa????es entre ramos de atividade econ??mica e ocupa????es referidas com as neoplasias intracranianas em adultos, segundo subtipos histol??gicos gliomas emeningiomas. Foi analisada a hist??ria ocupacional de 239 casos e 267 controles, pareados por freq????ncia de sexo e idade, utilizando as classifica????es por ramos de atividades econ??micas e por grupos ocupacionais. Os riscos foram estimados por regress??o log??stica. Na an??lise por ramo de atividade, a Agricultura apresentou OR: 2, 52 (IC 95 por cento: 1, 15 5, 53) para o conjunto das neoplasias cerebrais. Al??m disso, Sa??de e Social, Administra????o P??blica e Educa????o apresentaram associa????o positiva sem signific??ncia estat??stica. Quanto aos meningiomas, observou-se risco em trabalhadores das ??reas de Transporte (OR: 3, 14, IC 95 por cento: 1, 08 9, 19) e Bens Im??veis (OR: 2, 45, IC 95 por cento: 1, 17 5, 15). Em rela????o aos grupos ocupacionais, os agricultores apresentaram risco significativo: OR: 2, 44 (IC 95 por cento: 1, 14 5, 18). Associa????o direta foi evidenciada nos grupos de Transporte / Produ????o de Equipamentos e For??as Armadas enquanto que Profissionais T??cnicos e Trabalhadores com Vendas apresentaram associa????o inversa. A an??lise para gliomas mostrou risco para Empregados de Escrit??rio: OR: 2, 33 (IC 95 por cento: 1, 02 5, 29). Os achados sugerem que trabalhadores da agricultura, militares e profissionais de sa??de apresentam risco para neoplasias intracranianas, demandando novas pesquisas para identifica????o de exposi????es espec??ficas. The {{increase}} of incidence and mortality taxes of brain tumors in Brazil {{and the world}} has stimulated the inquiry of its etiological factors. Environmental exposure, mainly the occupational ones, have been extensively focused in the studies. This case-control study of hospital base carried through in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, between 1999 - 2002, had as objective to identify associations between <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> and occupations related with brain tumors in adults, according to histological subtypes gliomas and meningiomas. It was analyzed the occupational history of 239 cases and 267 controls, matched by frequency of sex and age, using the classifications for <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> and occupational groups. The risks had been esteem by logistic regression. In the analysis for activity branch, Agriculture presented OR: 2, 52 (CI 95 %: 1, 15 - 5, 53) for brain tumors with no histological stratification. Moreover, Social and Health, Public Administration and Education had presented positive association without significance statistics. To meningiomas, it??s observed elevated risk in workers of the areas of Transport (OR: 3, 14 CI 95 %: 1, 08 - 9, 19) and Real Estate Activities (OR: 2, 45, CI 95 %: 1, 17 - 5, 15).

It is our belief that the extension of Portugal?s continental shelf will have a multidimensional impact over a set <b>of</b> different <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> and it will represent a major challenge in terms of our geopolitical orientation. This way, we chose a set of specialists with different scientific backgrounds and professional experience, in order to put our main hypothesis into test. In practical terms, and with the goal to evaluate our main objective, we have launched a DELPHI survey, collecting the opinion of said pre-selected panel of specialists. This panel included specialists in politics, economics, military and academia. This paper is divided into four sections: In the first part, we will discuss some theoretical trends related to maritime related activities and maritime transport that might have a strong impact in Portugal?s political and economic options towards the Atlantic. It is important to stress that the enlargement of the continental shelf will bring different impacts over a diverse range of sectors, including transports, logistics, defense and different <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities.</b> In the second part, we will present the methodological concerns related to the DELPHI method, in order to explain our main choices where this method multidimensional impact derived from the enlargement of Portugal?s continental shelf. The third part of our paper will be dedicated to our case-study, that is, the impact derived from the enlargement of Portugal?s continental shelf. It will be the author?s main concern to discuss the differential impacts over four main areas: a) advantages that might come as a result of the said enlargement; b) Management related issues; c) Portugal weaknesses that might play a negative role in terms of the continental shelf future management; d) Multidimensional solutions towards the future. In terms of methodological options it is important to point out that for one part, the DELPHI Inquiry was divided according to those four main issues and, that for another part, we launched two rounds of questions. In the second round, we chose only the questions that were considered as more controversial taking into account the answers obtained during the first round of inquiry; In the final section of our paper, we {{will discuss the}} main results from our survey and we will propose some guidelines for further research...|$|R
