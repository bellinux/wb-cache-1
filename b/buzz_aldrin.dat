5|$|In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Grissom {{was ranked}} as the #9 (tied with astronauts <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> and Alan Shepard) most popular space hero.|$|E
5|$|Several books {{indicate}} early mission timelines had <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> {{rather than}} Neil Armstrong {{as the first}} man on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|More {{than one}} third of the United States' manned spaceflights have {{included}} MIT-educated astronauts (among them Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin),</b> more than any university excluding the United States service academies. Alumnus and former faculty member Qian Xuesen was instrumental in the PRC rocket program.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the crash}} {{did not affect}} space flight {{operations}} and the spacecraft itself was undamaged—it was shipped to NASA {{two days after the}} crash—the accident caused neither delays nor engineering changes in the U.S. space program. However, the loss of the Gemini 9 crew did cause NASA to reshuffle the crew assignments for subsequent Gemini and Apollo missions; Stafford and Cernan were moved up to the primary position for Gemini 9, re-designated Gemini 9A. Jim Lovell and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin,</b> who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the back-up crew for Gemini 9A, and through the normal rotation were then assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without experience during the Gemini mission, <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> would have been an unlikely choice for the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of Yugoslav History has {{collection}} from Yugoslav era. Beside paintings, {{the most}} valuable are Moon rocks donated by Apollo 11 crew Neil Armstrong, <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> and Michael Collins while visiting Belgrade in 1969 and from mission Apollo 17 donated by Richard Nixon in 1971. Museum also houses Joseph Stalin's sabre with 260 brilliants and diamonds, donated by Stalin himself.|$|E
5|$|An Apollo 1 mission patch {{was left}} on the Moon's surface after the first manned lunar landing by Apollo 11 crew members Neil Armstrong and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin.</b> The Apollo 15 mission {{left on the}} surface of the Moon a tiny {{memorial}} statue, Fallen Astronaut, along with a plaque containing the names of the Apollo 1 astronauts, among others including Soviet cosmonauts, who perished in the pursuit of human space flight.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy's {{goal was}} {{accomplished}} on the Apollo 11 mission when astronauts Neil Armstrong and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> landed their Lunar Module (LM) on July 20, 1969, and {{walked on the}} lunar surface, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module (CSM), and all three landed safely on Earth on July 24. Five subsequent Apollo missions also landed astronauts on the Moon, the last in December 1972. In these six spaceflights, twelve men walked on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong's {{second and}} last spaceflight was as {{commander}} of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> descended to {{the lunar surface}} and spent {{two and a half}} hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the crash, the backup crew of Thomas Stafford and Eugene Cernan were moved up to the primary position for the Gemini 9 mission, scheduled for early June. Jim Lovell and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin,</b> who had formerly been the backup for Gemini 10, became the mission's backup crew, and through the normal rotation were assigned as prime crew for Gemini 12. Without the Gemini experience, it is unlikely that Aldrin would have been assigned to the Apollo 11 mission, during which he became the second man to walk on the Moon.|$|E
5|$|The G {{mission was}} {{achieved}} on Apollo 11 in July 1969 by an all-Gemini veteran crew consisting of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin.</b> Armstrong and Aldrin performed the first landing at the Sea of Tranquility at 20:17:40 UTC on July 20, 1969. They spent {{a total of}} 21 hours, 36 minutes on the surface, and spent 2 hours, 31 minutes outside the spacecraft, walking on the surface, taking photographs, collecting material samples, and deploying automated scientific instruments, while continuously sending black-and-white television back to Earth. The astronauts returned safely on July 24.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, he was {{appointed}} an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society (HonFRS), the only amateur astronomer ever to achieve the distinction. In June 2002, he {{was appointed}} as the Honorary Vice-President of the Society for the History of Astronomy. Also in 2002, <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> presented him with a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for services to television. He was patron of Torquay Boys' Grammar School in south Devon. Moore had a long association with the University of Leicester and its Department of Physics and Astronomy, and was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Science (HonDSc) degree in 1996 and a Distinguished Honorary Fellowship in 2008, the highest award that the university can bestow.|$|E
5|$|In a 2010 Space Foundation survey, Shepard {{was ranked}} as the ninth most popular space hero (tied with astronauts <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> and Gus Grissom). In 2011, NASA honored Shepard with an Ambassador of Exploration Award, {{consisting}} of a Moon rock encased in Lucite, for his contributions to the U.S. space program. His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, where it is on permanent display. On May 4, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class stamp in Shepard's honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut. The first day of issue ceremony was held at NASA's Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.|$|E
5|$|After Armstrong {{served as}} backup {{commander}} for Apollo 8, Slayton offered him {{the post of}} commander of Apollo11 on December 23, 1968, as Apollo 8 orbited the Moon. In a meeting that was not made public until the publication of Armstrong's biography in 2005, Slayton told him that although the planned crew was Armstrong as commander, lunar module pilot <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> and command module pilot Michael Collins, he was offering the chance to replace Aldrin with Jim Lovell. After thinking it over for a day, Armstrong told Slayton he would stick with Aldrin, as he had no difficulty working with him and thought Lovell deserved his own command. Replacing Aldrin with Lovell would have made Lovell the Lunar Module Pilot, unofficially the lowest ranked member, and Armstrong could not justify placing Lovell, the commander of Gemini 12, in the number3 position of the crew.|$|E
5|$|NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training. As {{only one}} of them can go into space, they soon find {{themselves}} in competition. Under NASA's alcohol ban, the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> and Race Banyon. However, when Barney toasts his victory with non-alcoholic champagne, he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes, stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory. Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight, but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration, he becomes very nervous about going. Just as they prepare to take off in the Corvair space shuttle, Homer runs away. He talks with Marge on the phone, and she says that he ought {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity. He agrees, and the launch, which is also a Nielsen ratings smash, proceeds.|$|E
5|$|While {{trying on}} her bridesmaid's dress in the TGS fitting room, Colleen, Sylvia Rossitano (Patti LuPone), and Verna Maroney (Jan Hooks) criticize Liz {{for not being}} married by now as she is in her late thirties, but Liz does not care what they think. Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders why her mother did not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses {{that it was a good}} decision that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic. After her encounter with Buzz, Liz tells her mother that she respects the decision she made by not ending up with Buzz.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what this code meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E

25|$|In December 2016, <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> {{was visiting}} the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, Antarctica, {{as part of}} a tourist group, when he fell ill and was evacuated, first to McMurdo Station and from there to Christchurch, New Zealand, where he was {{reported}} to be in stable condition. Aldrin's visit at age 86 makes him the oldest person to ever reach the South Pole.|$|E
25|$|On her land, Pancho Barnes {{built the}} Happy Bottom Riding Club, {{also known as}} the Rancho Oro Verde Fly-Inn Dude Ranch, a dude ranch and {{restaurant}} which catered to airmen at the nearby airfield and her friends from Hollywood. Pancho became very close friends with many of the early test pilots, including Chuck Yeager, General Jimmy Doolittle, and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin.</b> Pancho's ranch became famous for the parties and high-flying lifestyle of all the guests.|$|E
25|$|Hornet {{recovered}} the astronauts {{from the first}} moon landing mission, Apollo 11, on 24 July 1969. President Nixon was on board to welcome the returning astronauts back to Earth, where they lived in quarantine aboard Hornet prior to transfer to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at Houston. The first steps on Earth of returning moonwalkers Neil Armstrong and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin,</b> with Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, are marked on her hangar deck, {{as part of her}} Apollo program exhibit.|$|E

Google Moon includes several tours, including one for the Apollo missions, incorporating maps, videos, and Street View-style panoramas, all provided by NASA.|$|E
25|$|The {{first human}} spaceflight was {{achieved}} with the Soviet space program's Vostok 1 mission in 1961. The lead architects behind the mission were Sergei Korolev and Kerim Kerimov, with Yuri Gagarin {{being the first}} astronaut. Kerimov later went on to launch the first space docks (Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188) in 1967 and the first space stations (Salyut and Mir series) from 1971 to 1991. The first spaceflight to the Moon was achieved with NASA's Apollo 11 mission in 1969, with Neil Armstrong and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> being the first astronauts on the Moon.|$|E
25|$|The Lunar Module was {{the lander}} portion of {{spacecraft}} {{built for the}} Apollo program by Grumman {{in order to achieve}} the transit from cislunar orbit to the surface and back. The module was also known as the LM from the manufacturer designation. NASA achieved the first test flight on January 22, 1968 using a Saturn V rocket. Six successful missions carried twelve astronauts, the first being Neil Armstrong and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> on July 20, 1969, to the moon surface and safely back home to earth. Tom Kelly as a project engineer at Grumman, invented and successfully designed the Lunar Module.|$|E
25|$|He {{has been}} awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, Air Force Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Force Command Pilot Astronaut Wings, Presidential Medal of Freedom, and Congressional Gold Medal. Together with Neil Armstrong and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin,</b> he {{received}} the Collier Trophy in 1969 and the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society in 1970. The International Astronomical Union honored him by naming an asteroid after him, 6471 Collins. Collins and his Apollo 11 crewmates were the 1999 recipients of the Langley Gold Medal from the Smithsonian Institution. Also, like the other two Apollo 11 crew members, he has a lunar crater named after him. He also received the Harmon Trophy in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Gagarin {{has been}} honored on the Moon by both astronauts and astronomers. He was {{honored by the}} American space program during Apollo 11 in 1969 when astronauts Neil Armstrong and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> left a {{memorial}} satchel containing medals commemorating Gagarin and fellow cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov on the surface. In 1971, Apollo 15 astronauts David Scott and James Irwin left the Fallen Astronaut at their landing site as a memorial to all the American astronauts and Soviet cosmonauts {{who died in the}} Space Race, with Yuri Gagarin listed among 14 others. He is memorialized by the official naming of a 265km crater on the Far Side after him.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} World War II, von Braun {{and most}} of his rocket team {{surrendered}} to the United States, and were expatriated to work on American missiles at what became the Army Ballistic Missile Agency. This work on missiles such as Juno I and Atlas enabled launch of the first US satellite Explorer 1 on February 1, 1958, and the first American in orbit, John Glenn in Friendship 7 on February 20, 1962. As director of the Marshall Space Flight Center, Von Braun oversaw development of a larger class of rocket called Saturn, which allowed the US to send the first two humans, Neil Armstrong and <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin,</b> to the Moon and back on Apollo 11 in July 1969. Over the same period, the Soviet Union secretly tried but failed to develop the N1 rocket to give them the capability to land one person on the Moon.|$|E
25|$|Using the {{information}} from Charlie's analysis, Don visits the McCrary family. He learns that McCrary's son Matt (Johnny Simmons) thought that his family was {{not doing enough to}} stop molesters after his sister Katie's rape and murder, so Matt contacted someone in a support group to discuss non-violent ways of vengeance. Megan interviews Mrs. Tillman again and realizes that her husband, Scott, molested their daughter. The team learns of a new victim and finds the house where he is being held. Inside, they find the victim being held hostage by Mrs. Tillman. Megan convinces Mrs. Tillman to not kill the molester by promising that he will be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and the agents arrest both people. After the arrest, the team and Charlie says goodbye to Larry at the office. Megan and Larry say goodbye near the walkway, where <b>Buzz</b> <b>Aldrin</b> appears to escort Larry to the launch. On launch day, everyone gathers at the house to watch the launch, with both Eppes brothers toasting Larry seconds before liftoff.|$|E
