It was inspired by [...] "visual psychedelia" [...] of the hippie culture of the 1960s, but additionally uses some elements of futurism and symbolism. Another characteristic feature of the book is Saudek's processing of the sequences of pictures, similar to film editing. The formatting of individual pages is unusual, given the time of the creation of the book. It makes use of <b>bevelled</b> <b>frames,</b> enabling innovative work with the space and perspective.|$|E

Pairs of vases were produced either in a single colour of opaque glass or in two-colour cased glass. These were decorated in thickly enamelled flower subjects that were painted with great speed. Others were decorated with coloured lithographic prints copying famous paintings. These glass objects were made in huge quantities in large factories and were available by mail order throughout Europe and America. Many of them were not fine art but provided inexpensive decorative objects to brighten up ordinary homes. Reverse glass painting was also a Czech specialty. The image is carefully painted by hand on the back of a pane of glass, using a variety of techniques and materials, after which the painting is mounted in a <b>bevelled</b> wooden <b>frame.</b>|$|R
