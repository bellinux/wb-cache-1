500|$|In 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt {{created the}} first {{wildlife}} refuge in the United States, Pelican Island. [...] Its first warden, Paul Kroegel, joined forces with Bradley to enforce the illegality of bird-hunting in Florida. [...] By 1904, the various Audubon organizations had 34 wardens employed in ten states. [...] Conservationist publications were optimistic that Bradley and other wardens would be successful in their enforcement; in AOU's January 1904 issue of The Auk, an editor wrote: [...] "The natives are <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the birds are to be protected and that the wardens are fearless men who {{are not to be}} trifled with. [...] The Bradleys have the reputation of being the best rifle shots in that vicinity and they would not hesitate to shoot when necessary." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No.404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan [...] "never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966." [...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands up now as it did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way." ...|$|E
2500|$|The words [...] "down" [...] and [...] "up", {{according}} to Fuller, are awkward {{in that they}} refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words [...] "in" [...] and [...] "out" [...] should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. [...] "I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going [...] "outstairs" [...] and [...] "instairs."' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and {{out for a few}} days in fun, they find themselves <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Although DRM is {{prevalent}} for Internet music, some online music {{stores such as}} eMusic, Dogmazic, Amazon, and Beatport, do not use DRM despite encouraging {{users to}} avoid sharing music. Major labels have begun releasing more music without DRM. Eric Bangeman suggests in Ars Technica that {{this is because the}} record labels are [...] "slowly <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> they can't have DRMed music and complete control over the online music market at the same time... One way to break the cycle is to sell music that is playable on any digital audio player. eMusic does exactly that, and their surprisingly extensive catalog of non-DRMed music has vaulted it into the number two online music store position behind the iTunes Store." [...] Apple's Steve Jobs called on the music industry to eliminate DRM in an open letter titled Thoughts on Music. Apple's iTunes Store will start to sell DRM-free 256 kbit/s (up from 128 kbit/s) AAC encoded music from EMI for a premium price (this has since reverted to the standard price).|$|E

60|$|A {{gray sky}} without {{a break in}} it hung low above the ragged spires of the pines; the river the track skirted, and {{presently}} crossed upon a wooden bridge, shone in the gathering shadow with a wan, chill gleam; and the bare rocky ridges that flitted by now and then looked grim and forbidding. Indeed, it was a singularly desolate landscape, with no touch of human life in it, and Alison shivered as she gazed at it with a somewhat heavy heart and weary eyes.

The United States has been like one of those men you read about in the papers who go away from home and turn up in some distant place with their memories gone. They've forgotten what their names were or where they lived or what they did for a living; they've forgotten everything that matters. Often they have to begin again and settle down for a long time before their memories come back. That's how it has been with us. Our memory is just coming back to us." ...|$|E
