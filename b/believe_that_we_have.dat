500|$|He {{continued}} to socialize and {{keep up with}} his correspondence well into his seventies, and his fame and popularity {{continued to}} soar. [...] "I don't believe that any man, in any country, has ever had a more affectionate admiration for him than that given to you in America", wrote Senator William C. Preston {{in a letter to}} Irving. [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had but one man who is so much in the popular heart". By 1859, author Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. noted that Sunnyside had become [...] "next to Mount Vernon, the best known and most cherished of all the dwellings in our land".|$|E
500|$|Besides the {{official}} honours, Shackleton's Antarctic feats were greeted in Britain with great enthusiasm. Proposing {{a toast to}} the explorer at a lunch given in Shackleton's honour by the Royal Societies Club, Lord Halsbury, a former Lord Chancellor, said: [...] "When one remembers what he had gone through, one {{does not believe in}} the supposed degeneration of the British race. One does not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> lost all sense of admiration for courage [...] endurance". The heroism was also claimed by Ireland: the Dublin Evening Telegraph's headline read [...] "South Pole Almost Reached By An Irishman", while the Dublin Express spoke of the [...] "qualities that were his heritage as an Irishman". Shackleton's fellow-explorers expressed their admiration; Roald Amundsen wrote, in a letter to RGS Secretary John Scott Keltie, that [...] "the English nation has by this deed of Shackleton's won a victory that can never be surpassed". Fridtjof Nansen sent an effusive private letter to Emily Shackleton, praising the [...] "unique expedition which has been such a complete success in every respect". The reality was that the expedition had left Shackleton deeply in debt, unable to meet the financial guarantees he had given to backers. Despite his efforts, it required government action, {{in the form of a}} grant of £20,000 (2008: £1.5 million) to clear the most pressing obligations. It is likely that many debts were not pressed and were written off.|$|E

The world has shown us in the car industry, the space industry and the hi-tech industry that this is not true. And we need to be open to others' ideas and others' innovations," ...|$|E

2500|$|Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid {{expressed}} {{disappointment with}} Lieberman, saying, [...] "I've talked to Senator Lieberman, and unfortunately {{he is at}} a different place on Iraq than {{the majority of the}} American people." [...] House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi added, [...] "I completely disagree with Lieberman. I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a responsibility to speak out if we think that the course of action that our country is not making the American people safer, making our military stronger and making the region more stable."

2500|$|The American Psychological Association (APA) in 1983 asked Singer, {{who was one}} of {{the leading}} proponents of coercive persuasion theories, to chair a taskforce to {{investigate}} whether brainwashing or [...] "coercive persuasion" [...] did indeed play a role in recruitment by such groups. The task force was titled APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control (DIMPAC). The task force completed its final report in November 1986. In May 1987 the APA Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC final report, stating that the report [...] "lack the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur," [...] and also stating that the BSERP did [...] "not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|You Couldn't Make It Up (1995, Heinemann, [...] ) – {{named after}} one of Littlejohn's catchphrases, and {{described}} [...] on the jacket as [...] "a brilliant collection of liberal-skewering wit and wisdom", {{this is a book}} of recollections and opinion pieces on subjects such as political correctness, politicians, corporate [...] "fat cats", the European Union, and the British Royal Family. Anthony Daniels, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said: [...] "...not only does he never mention foreigners in any but a derogatory way – when he is far too intelligent a man really to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> nothing to learn from any of them – but when he writes of the Germans and the Japanese as having taken our cars and electronics industries he is pandering to the kind of stupid, ignorant, sentimental, self-pitying xenophobia which is the root of all fascism, and which is an obstacle to genuine self improvement." [...] The New Statesman wrote: [...] "Not exactly New Statesman territory, but the pick of the best tabloid columnist in Britain is a joy from beginning to end.

2500|$|In December 2007, still {{campaigning for}} the Republican presidential nomination, Romney summed up his general {{position}} {{on gun control}} at that time as: [...] "we should check on the backgrounds {{of people who are}} trying to purchase guns. We also should keep weapons of unusual lethality from being on the street. And finally, we should go after people who use guns in the commission of crimes or illegally, but we should not interfere with the right of law-abiding citizens to own guns either for their own personal protection or hunting or any other lawful purpose." [...] He also said that, had it come before him as president, he would have signed a renewal of the federal assault weapons ban that had expired. The following month, during a presidential primary debate, he noted that the federal assault weapons ban that he would have signed as president had failed in Congress, and he insisted that he would not support any new gun control legislation: [...] "I do not believe we need new legislation. I do not support any new legislation of an assault weapon ban nature, including that against semiautomatic weapons. I instead <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> laws in place that if they're implemented and enforced, will provide the protection and the safety of the American people." ...|$|E
