It introduces an intermediate <b>band</b> (<b>IB)</b> energy level in between the valence and conduction bands.

40|$|As an {{appealing}} concept for developing next-generation solar cells, intermediate-band solar cells (IBSCs) promise to drastically increase the quantum efficiency of photovoltaic conversion. Yet to date, a standing {{challenge lies in}} the lack of materials suitable for developing IBSCs. Recently, a new doping approach, termed non-compensated n-p codoping, has been proposed to construct intermediate <b>bands</b> (<b>IBs)</b> in the intrinsic energy band gaps of oxide semiconductors such as TiO$_ 2 $. We explore theoretically the optimal quantum efficiency of IBSCs based on non-compensated n-p codoped TiO$_ 2 $ under two different design schemes. The first preserves the ideal condition that no electrical current be extracted from the IB. The corresponding maximum quantum efficiency for the codoped TiO$_ 2 $ can reach 52. 7 %. In the second scheme, current is also extracted from the IB, resulting in a further enhancement in the maximum efficiency to 56. 7 %. Our findings also relax the stringent requirement that the IB location {{be close to the}} optimum value, making it more feasible to realize IBSCs with high quantum efficiencies...|$|R

40|$|The {{intermediate}} <b>bands</b> (<b>IBs)</b> {{between the}} valence and conduction bands {{play an important}} role in solar cells. Because the smaller energy photons than the bandgap energy can be used to promote charge carriers transfer to the conduction band and thereby the total output current increases while maintaining a large open circuit voltage. In this paper, the influence of the new band on the power conversion efficiency for the structure of the quantum dots intermediate band solar cell (QDIBSC) is theoretically investigated and studied. The time-independent Schrödinger equation is used to determine the optimum width and location of the intermediate band. Accordingly, achievement of maximum efficiency by changing the width of quantum dots and barrier distances is studied. Theoretical determination of the power conversion efficiency under the two different ranges of QD width is presented. From the obtained results, the maximum power conversion efficiency is about 70. 42 % for simple cubic quantum dot crystal under full concentration light. It is strongly dependent on the width of quantum dots and barrier distances...|$|R
40|$|When {{applying}} dynamic {{route guidance}} to improve the road network performance, {{the interests of the}} road authorities and the road users are likely to conflict. Road users are normally aiming at minimising their travel times by choosing the time-shortest route, whereas the authorities might want to send road users to a time-longer alternative to prevent phenomena like capacity drop and spill-back. In this study, the authors demonstrate how, in such a situation, bounded rationality and indifference <b>bands</b> (<b>IB)</b> of road users can be used to improve the network performance, such that the road users will not experience being disadvantaged by the advice. An interpretation and utilisation of the IBs in a route guidance control approach is proposed, which degrades the routes such that the network performance deterioration is prevented while the IBs of road users are respected. By means of a simulation test case, the potential gain in network performance of different IBs is evaluated. Results show a reduction in total travel time of 5 % compared with user equilibrium, in case of an IB of 4 min for a trip of ~ 22 min, and up to 14 % in case of an IB of 10 min...|$|R

40|$|Binding of Ricinus communis I {{agglutinin}} to {{the outer}} surface of resealed human erythrocyte ghosts results in an organizational perturbation that is translated to the inner membrane surface. The organizational change was detected by an enhancement in the chemical cross-linking of several erythrocyte membrane components by the bifunctional reagent, dimethyl malonimidate, resulting in their loss or reduction after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the solubilized erythrocyte components. Of the components that failed to appear, or are reduced in amount, on the gels (protein <b>bands</b> Ia, <b>Ib,</b> IVa, and VII), two {{are known to be}} the subunits of spectrin (<b>bands</b> Ia and <b>Ib),</b> an inner-surface peripheral protein. A new band, which was identified as R. communis lectin, appeared on the polyacrylamide gels of lectin-treated ghosts with or without crosslinking. The loss of spectrin and other bands after lectin treatment and chemical crosslinking was due to a specific transmembrane event because: (a) β-lactose, an inhibitor of R. communis agglutinin, prevented labeling of ghosts by the lectin and loss of spectrin and other erythrocyte components on gels after crosslinking; (b) use of inactive bifunctional or active monofunctional crosslinking reagents did not result in loss of spectrin or other components from lectin-treated ghosts; (c) the loss of spectrin and other components after lectin treatment and crosslinking was sensitive to temperature and lectin concentration; (d) no new bands appeared on the gels except for the band identified as R. communis agglutinin; (e) R. communis agglutinin does not interact with purified spectrin; and (f) previously published data indicate the R. communis lectin binds exclusively {{to the outer}} membrane surface while spectrin is located on the inner membrane surface.

50|$|Another {{method of}} {{fabricating}} an IB device {{is to use}} highly mismatched alloys. The use of these mismatched alloys introduces an IB due to the band anti-crossing (BAC) mechanism.

40|$|Abstract. Intermediate <b>band</b> (<b>IB)</b> {{solar cells}} aim to exploit in solar cells {{the energy of}} below bandgap energy photons. They are based in a {{material}} that, {{in addition to the}} conventional conduction and valence bands, has an electronic band (named intermediate band) located inside the bandgap and separated from the conduction and valence band by a null density of states. The theoretical limiting efficiency of these cells (63. 2 % at maximum concentration) is equivalent to a triple junction solar cell but requiring a single material instead. Several approaches are being followed worldwide to take to practice this concept that can be divided into two categories: quantum dots and bulk materials. This paper reviews the main experimental results obtained under both approaches...|$|E

40|$|Intermediate band {{solar cells}} (IBSC) have been {{proposed}} as a potential design {{for the next generation}} of highly efficient photo-voltaic devices. Quantum nanostructures, such as quantum dots (QD), arranged in super-lattice (SL) arrays produce a mini-band (IB) that is separated by a region of zero density of states from other states in the conduction band. Additional absorption from the valence <b>band</b> to the <b>IB</b> and IB to the conduction band allows two photons with energies below the energy gap to be harvested in generating one electron-hole pair. We present a theoretical study of the electronic and optical properties of the IB formed by an InAs/GaAs QD array. The calculations are based on an 8 -band k. p Hamiltonian, incorporating mixing between valence and conduction states, strain and piezoelectric field. Theoretical results of the the mini-band width variation with the period of the QD array in the z direction are presented. For one particular spacer distance, d(z) = 4 nm, we report detailed variation of the optical dipole matrix elements through the mini-band and identify the character of the states involved. This approach,captures the essential physics of the absorption processes in a realistic model of the IBSC structure and will be used to provide input parameters for predictive modelling of transport properties. ...|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{the last}} {{approach}} is to introduce deep level impurities (DLI) into a semiconductor bulk material. This method is similar to highly mismatched alloys, however the doping percentages are much less. The biggest issue with these devices is that the non-radiative recombination, predominantly Shockley-Read-Hall, significantly increases.Significant {{research in this field}} was aimed at achieving “lifetime recovery”, or the ability to increase carrier lifetime by introducing more DLIs. In particular, it was believed that lifetime recovery could be achieved by increasing the DLI concentrations to the insulator to metal transition. Krich, however, disproved this and in the process proposed a “figure of merit” to determine if materials would be suitable for high efficiency IB’s. The idea was that if the non-radiative recombination lifetime was significantly higher than the transit time for an electron to move from the conduction <b>band</b> to the <b>IB,</b> then the material could increase efficiency. Essentially, the electron could reach the IB before recombining, leading to a higher induced photocurrent. This figure of merit has been used to explain why no usable device has been fabricated using highly doped silicon. Chalcogen doped silicon, in particular, have low figures of merit due to their small non-radiative recombination lifetimes. To achieve IB devices, more research {{needs to be done to}} find a bulk semiconductor material that exhibits higher non-radiative recombination lifetimes.|$|R

In {{order to}} study the circumnuclear star-forming activity along the Hubble sequence, we cross-correlate the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR 2) with the Third Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies (RC 3) to derive a large sample of 1015 galaxies with both morphological and spectral information. Among these, 385 sources are classified as star-forming galaxies and the SDSS fibre covered the circumnuclear regions (0. 2 − 2. 0 kpc). By using the spectral synthesis method to remove the contribution from the underlying old stellar population, we measure the emission lines fluxes accurately which are then used to estimate the star formation rates(SFRs). Our main findings are that: (1) Early-type spirals show much larger Hα luminosities and hence higher SFRs, they also suffer more extinctions than late-type ones. The equivalent widths (EWs) of Hα emission lines show the similar trend, however, the very late types (Sdm ∼ Irr) do have large fractions of high EWs.
