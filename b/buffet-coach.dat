50|$|Two {{of these}} power cars, {{numbered}} 352 and 353, were purchased {{as part of}} the 1935 order, along with three <b>buffet-coach</b> cars, and two sleeper-observation cars. Normal operating procedure was for a northbound train to leave New Orleans with two coaches and an observation car. Due to lower ridership on the northern portion of the route, one of the 2 coaches would be removed from the northbound train at Jackson, Mississippi, and the train would continue on to Jackson, Tennessee as a 3 car consist. The southbound train would add the extra coach during its own stop at Jackson, Mississippi.|$|E

50|$|As {{originally}} {{built by}} the Budd Company and the Electro-Motive Company for the Twin Cities Zephyr in 1936 #9902 consisted of a power car with baggage section, a <b>buffet-coach</b> with seating for 40, and coach-observation car with seating for 24 in the coach section and 24 in the observation section. The Mark Twain Zephyr consisted of four cars: a power car with railway post office (RPO), a baggage car, a coach-dinette with seating for 20, and a coach-observation car with seating for 40 in the coach section and 16 in the observation section. Both sets were articulated, making it a difficult process to add and remove cars. The relative lack of seating in both consists, {{and the presence of}} the RPO in the Mark Twain Zephyr, reflected the CB&Q's belief that mail and express revenue was a better source of income on short-haul Midwestern services than passenger traffic.|$|E
