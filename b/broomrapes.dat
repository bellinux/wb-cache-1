40|$|<b>Broomrapes</b> (Orobanche spp., Orobanchaceae) are chlorophyll-lacking, obligately {{parasitic}} {{flowering plants}} that infect roots of many dicotyledoneous species and cause severe damage to vegetable and field crops worldwide, but particularly in North Africa, {{southern and eastern}} Europe, and the Middle East. (1). Orobanche crenata {{is one of the}} most important <b>broomrapes</b> and mainly infects legume crops (2). In January 2006, we observed severe broomrape attacks in four commercial fields of fall-sown lettuce (Lactuca sativa cv. Iceberg) crops at Almodóvar del Río (Córdoba Province) in southern Spain. Infected lettuce plants showed severe stunting, foliar yellowing, and had loose-formed heads. Infection of lettuce plants by Orobanche sp. was confirmed by removing plants to verify the attachment of <b>broomrapes</b> to lettuce roots. There were one to four <b>broomrapes</b> per lettuce plant. Incidence of infected lettuce ranged from 10 to 20 % in different areas of the fields. Morphological observations of broomrape plants identified the parasite as O. crenata. The main botanical features were as follows: plants 20 to 40 cm tall; corolla 20 to 28 mm, white, lips with lilac, divergent veins, lower lip large with suborbicular lobes, not ciliate; filaments hairy, obliquely inserted 2 to 4 mm above the base of corolla, with short glandular hairs in the upper third; anthers glabrous, 2 to 2. 5 mm in length, and stigma yellow or pinkish at anthesis (2). O. crenata also was observed infecting faba bean (Vicia faba) plants in a field in close proximity to the affected lettuce fields. The complete 5. 8 S ribosomal DNA gene and internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2 of O. crenata were sequenced using adventitious roots and stem tissues sampled from infected faba bean and lettuce plants (Genbank Accession Nos. DQ 458908 and DQ 458909) by standard protocols (3). A nucleotide BLAST search revealed that both sequences were identical and share 100 % similarity with three reported ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 sequences from two Orobanche spp. (O. crenata and O. minor; Genbank Accession Nos. AY 209267, AY 209266, and AY 209272). On the basis of the morphological characters described above, the parasite was O. crenata and not O. minor. O. crenata has been reported infecting many legume crops in southern Spain, including faba bean, pea, lentil, and vetch. To our knowledge, this is the first report of O. crenata infecting lettuce in Spain and elsewhere.

Based on trnL and rbcL plastidial genes amplification, the designed assay successfully identifies O. cumana, O. cernua, O. crenata, O. minor, O. hederae, and O. foetida; P. ramosa and P. aegyptiaca can be differentiated from other species but not from each other.

40|$|The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press {{on behalf}} of the Annals of Botany Company. Background and Aims The <b>broomrapes,</b> Orobanche sensu lato (Orobanchaceae), are common root parasites found across Eurasia, Africa and the Americas. All species native to the western hemisphere, {{recognized}} as Orobanche sections Gymnocaulis and Nothaphyllon, form a clade that has a centre of diversity in western North America, but also includes four disjunct species in central and southern South America. The wide ecological distribution coupled with moderate taxonomic diversity make this clade a valuable model system for studying the role, if any, of host-switching in driving the diversification of plant parasites. Methods Two spacer regions of ribosomal nuclear DNA (ITS + ETS), three plastid regions and one low-copy nuclear gene were sampled from 163 exemplars of Orobanche from across the native geographic range in order to infer a detailed phylogeny. Together with comprehensive data on the parasites' native host ranges, associations between phylogenetic lineages and host specificity are tested. Key Results Within the two currently recognized species of O. sect. Gymnocaulis, seven strongly supported clades were found. While commonly sympatric, members of these clades each had unique host associations. Strong support for cryptic host-specific diversity was also found in sect. Nothaphyllon, while other taxonomic species were well supported. We also find strong evidence for multiple amphitropical dispersals from central North America into South America. Conclusions Host-switching is an important driver of diversification in western hemisphere <b>broomrapes,</b> where host specificity has been grossly underestimated.

Of the tested materials, 12 in 2006, 56 in 2007 and 140 in 2008 were found to be resistant. During winter, <b>broomrape</b> tests continued in growth chambers and in pots, under conditions of artificial infes-tation. <b>Broomrape</b> seeds were collected from a naturally infested area in Trakya region and used to determine the reaction of developed hybrids and lines to the collected races. In this part of the study, 1752, 816 and 1389 genetic material were tested in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The tests showed that 332, 94, and 404 materials in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, were resistant to the new races of <b>broomrape</b> used in the study.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} {{in order to determine}} the efficiency of the fungi Aspergillus alliaceus in fighting <b>broomrape</b> by the pesta-tablet trials under below- and above-ground conditions and to determine the appropriate tablet formulations for both conditions. For this purpose, different tablets were used in different experimental steps and their efficiencies were evaluated. The results showed that the tablets T- 1, T- 2, T- 3, T- 5, T- 12 and T- 13 greatly reduced the amount of <b>broomrape</b> in below-ground conditions, particularly with previous and high amount or crushed-tablet applications before crop-sowing. In above-ground conditions, any tablet formulation or directly sclerotial contacting were very effective in <b>broomrape</b> control and it was determined that close presence to or direct contact with <b>broomrape</b> is essential for successful biocontrol. In conclusion, considering the durability of the fungal agent against harsh environmental conditions and its sclerotial structure, it was deduced that if the fungi could be implemented in a stand-alone or especially integrated with each other, it will provide long-term, high-level <b>broomrape</b> biocontrol, indicating the advantages of A. alliaceus against other alternative fungal agents...|$|R
