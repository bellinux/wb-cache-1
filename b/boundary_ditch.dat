5|$|The helmet {{was found}} {{along with some}} 5,296 Iron Age and Roman coins mostly dating to AD 20/30–50, the largest {{assemblage}} of Iron Age coins ever found in Britain. They had been buried at what {{appears to have been}} a pre-Roman shrine where large-scale animal slaughtering had taken place; nearly 7,000 bone fragments were also found at the site, 97 per cent of which were from pigs. Many appear to have been buried without the meat being eaten, suggesting that they had been used as offerings. The site is located on a hilltop which appears to have been encircled by a <b>boundary</b> <b>ditch</b> and palisade, with a possible processional way leading up to it. In Roman times it would have been located in the territory of the Corieltauvi, who inhabited an area of the East Midlands stretching from Northamptonshire to Lincolnshire.|$|E
25|$|In {{medieval times}} the {{westerly}} {{end of the}} mound was dug away and a <b>boundary</b> <b>ditch</b> was laid out. Therefore, when looters dug into the apparent centre during the sixteenth century, they missed the real centre: nor could they have foreseen that the deposit lay very deep {{in the belly of}} a buried ship, well below the level of the land surface.|$|E
2500|$|A Roman <b>boundary</b> <b>ditch</b> and posthole {{has been}} found just off Nethergate Street; a strap fitting, coins, sepulchral urns and a bronze figurine of Mercury or a dancing boy have been {{unearthed}} in various locations.

40|$|An archaeological {{evaluation}} {{was undertaken}} by Cotswold Archaeology in November 2014 at Kenniford Farm, Clyst St George, Devon. Seven trenches were excavated. Field <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches</b> and a pond, all identifiable on the 1839 Tithe Map of Clyst St George and which survived until the compilation of late 20 th-century cartographic sources, were recorded during the evaluation...|$|R
50|$|The priory {{buildings}} {{stood in}} a rectangular enclosure, with <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches</b> on at least three sides. Initially there were two wooden domestic buildings, adjoining a stone church, which later became the chancel as the nave was extended westwards from it. The wooden buildings were rebuilt in stone within a few decades and then partially rebuilt again a century later.|$|R
50|$|Once established, the Romans {{worked to}} develop {{infrastructure}} in Lincolnshire. They built the Car Dyke, {{a series of}} semi-natural and artificial <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches</b> which run from the River Welland at Market Deeping for 64 km to the River Witham at Washingborough, constructed hard standings and walkways across the Fens, and also built inland ports, such as the Brayford Pool at Lincoln.|$|R
2500|$|During July 2012 James Wright, Andy Gaunt, Ben Crossley and David Budge opened two {{evaluation}} trenches to {{test whether}} or not the large 180m long geophysical anomaly identified by Gaunt in 2011 was in fact the palace <b>boundary</b> <b>ditch</b> to the south-west of the site. The excavation discovered a ditch c. [...] in width associated with the buried soil horizon of an internal bank coupled with archaeologically sealed finds of 13th-14th century pottery has led to the early conclusion that this was indeed the palace boundary. The total area enclosed would have been approximately [...] which compares favourably with the sizes of Knole House (...) , Clarendon (...) and Eltham Palace (...) making the King's Houses one of the largest palace sites in England. The evaluation also revealed evidence for a 19th-century sandpit associated with construction work on either the flood meadows or rebuilding of the village by the Duke of Portland.|$|E
60|$|Thus he {{did nothing}} more decided than taking the Riverston coach. He came back again by it {{while it was still}} daylight, having made up his mind that he must go to Lydgate's that evening. The Rubicon, we know, was a very {{insignificant}} stream to look at; its significance lay entirely in certain invisible conditions. Will {{felt as if he were}} forced to cross his small <b>boundary</b> <b>ditch,</b> and what he saw beyond it was not empire, but discontented subjection.|$|E

40|$|An archaeological {{evaluation}} {{was undertaken}} by Cotswold Archaeology in February and March 2013 at Old Park Farm, Pinhoe, Devon. Twenty trenches were excavated. Evidence {{was found for}} prehistoric activity or occupation, {{in the form of}} three intercutting ring ditches, within the westernmost part of the site. Two prehistoric worked flints were recovered from one ring ditch fill, and a single piece of burnt stone was recovered from a second ring ditch. Palaeoenvironmental samples taken from all three ditches revealed charcoal present but no burnt or unburnt bone to indicate a funerary association, and the character of these ditches remains uncertain. A series of NW/SE and NE/SW-aligned <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches</b> were also recorded, pre-dating the arrangement of fields depicted on the 1889 OS first edition map. Artefacts recovered from one double-ditched boundary, on a shared alignment with other <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches,</b> suggest that these boundaries may be of 19 th-century date. Numerous shallow plough furrows were encountered. Although undated artefactually these probably represent medieval or post-medieval ridge and furrow cultivation remains. Post-medieval/modern field drains and a modern service were also encountered...|$|R
5|$|The {{water levels}} in the moors and levels are {{controlled}} {{by a series of}} small narrow canals called rhynes (known as 'rhines' in Avonmouth and Gloucestershire - both are pronounced 'reens'). along with larger drains, gates and pumping stations. The rhynes are often used as field <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches</b> instead of hedges. Some parts are allowed to flood in winter. The area is mainly used for grazing but some peat extraction is carried out.|$|R
25|$|In {{the centre}} a {{carriageway}} {{was built on}} a raised agger after stripping off soft topsoil, using the best local materials, often sand or sandy gravel. The two strips of ground between the agger and the <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches</b> were used by pedestrians and animals, and were sometimes lightly metalled. The agger was sometimes, but not always, bordered by deep ditches to take rainwater and keep the road structure as dry as possible.|$|R

50|$|This {{is also an}} old mature wood, {{though it}} has seen more active use {{in the past and}} may not be primary ancient woodland. There is again {{evidence}} of charcoal and white coal manufacture in the form of charcoal hearths and Q-pits, and also evidence of former quarrying and <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches,</b> which may indicate that the area was at one time cleared for agriculture. This is also now mostly mature sessile oak, and has public footpaths granting access, including the Sheffield Round Walk.|$|R
2500|$|Since the Enclosure Acts of {{the eighteenth}} century, the UK's uplands (including Wales and the Scottish Highlands) have largely been {{associated}} with animal husbandry and forestry.

50|$|The Sussex manor of Glottenham has had <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches</b> {{since the}} {{eleventh}} century, and the moat at Glottenham Castle {{is believed to}} date from around 1200. Glottenham Castle {{was built in the}} late thirteenth century. The castle had stone walls, two square towers and a gatehouse. The castle was owned by the de Etchingham family, before being abandoned in the late 16th or 17th century. In 1990, the site was listed under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979. The site is now a popular camping and glamping site.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} one of the largest Anglo-Saxon {{settlements}} in the area and can demonstrate nearby occupation to Neolithic times, through research carried out by Liverpool University over many years. The Black Ditches <b>boundary</b> <b>ditch</b> runs to the south of the village and is believed to be the most easterly of a series of early Anglo-Saxon defensive earthworks built across the Icknield Way.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} Anglo-Saxon period, West Stow {{was the site}} of a small village made up of timber buildings. Archaeological {{excavation}} of the site unearthed evidence for a variety of different constructions and areas at West Stow: 69 sunken-featured buildings (SFBs), alongside 7 post-hole buildings interpreted as halls, traces of several lesser structures, a reserve area for clay, 2 large hollows or animal pens, pits, various unassociated post holes and several 7th century <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches.</b> The Anglo-Saxon village showed no signs of the development of property boundaries until the last phase of occupation. There was no evidence that the settlement was defended by fortifications.|$|R
40|$|An archaeological trench evaluation, on {{the site}} of a {{proposed}} new residential development at the former Holsworthy Showground site, Holsworthy, Devon was undertaken by AC archaeology. The site occupies an area {{to the north of the}} historic core of the town. There are no previously recorded archaeological sites or monuments {{on the site}} itself, but it is located in area considered to have potential for prehistoric settlement and funerary remains. The evaluation comprised the machine-excavation of 33 trenches totalling 990 m in length. The work identified parts of two former hedgebank boundaries shown on 19 th century maps, as well as a number of modern drainage gullies/ditches. No in situ remains pre-dating the late post-medieval period were present. Two small and abraded sherds of 16 th/ 17 th century pottery were recovered from one of the former field <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches,</b> but 19 th century artefacts were also recovered from this...|$|R
50|$|Archaeological finds, {{including}} flint tools at Swallow Vale Farm, {{indicate the}} presence of early settlements in Swallow. Other traces include cropmark traces of four possible barrows, a pit and a <b>boundary</b> <b>ditch</b> on Cuxwold Road, and similar barrows behind Grange Farm and on {{the eastern edge of}} the village south of Grimsby Road. Straddling the Limber parish border are the remains of an undated ring ditch in Swallow Wold Wood.|$|E
5000|$|The parish {{church of}} St Peter's is a {{relatively}} modern construction, possibly from about 1737, but with earlier artefacts within the fabric, such as the Twelfth century Tympanum inserted within an internal wall. [...] It is unclear whether an earlier church stood {{on the site of}} the current one, but it is certain that a church did exist here from the earliest days of the bishop's manor. A medieval <b>boundary</b> <b>ditch</b> that may, or may not, have belonged to an earlier church dated to between 1066 and 1500 was discovered in substrate deposits on the site. During building work in 1895 various artefacts were unearthed from various historic periods including the Middle Saxon period and also an even older <b>boundary</b> <b>ditch.</b> Middle Saxon finds from the ninth and tenth century have been found here and in other places immediately adjacent to the church grounds. This included a ninth century shard from a Maxey ware strainer from the ninth century which was discovered in the garden of 3 Archer Street in 2004.|$|E
50|$|The Great Wall as {{constructed}} by the Jurchens differed from the previous dynasties. Known as the Border Fortress or the <b>Boundary</b> <b>Ditch</b> of the Jin, it was formed by digging ditches within which lengths of wall were built. In some places subsidiary walls and ditches were added for extra strength. The construction was started in about 1123 and completed by about 1198. The two sections attributable to the Jin dynasty are known as the Old Mingchang Walls and New Great Walls, together stretching more than 2,000 kilometres in length.|$|E
50|$|The {{preliminary}} {{assessment of the}} archaeological potential {{along the line of}} the Ribble Link Navigation identified Mill Field as an area in which significant features, essentially a water mill, may have been located. The evaluation established that the field contained the abraded remains of a ridge and furrow field system. This feature partially survived as indistinct, but identifiable, earthworks covering the centre of the field. The remains of furrows found within the excavation trenches indicated that the field system originally covered a greater area. The evaluation indicated that the construction of the navigation should not conflict with the area in which the ridge and furrow survived as earthworks. However, the area where the field system was known to survive only as subsurface features would be affected by the excavations for the navigations. It may be possible to locate the eastern and western <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches</b> to the field system, if they exist, during the construction work.|$|R
50|$|Up on {{the open}} heath of the downs {{the line of the}} road can be {{followed}} very well on foot and is free of modern roads and paths. Walking south from Bignor Hill one soon comes to open sheep-grazed pasture at Gumber farm where the scale of the agger of the road can be clearly seen. The spire of Chichester cathedral can be seen above the distant trees, slightly {{to the right of the}} road line as the road heads for Chichester's east gate. Further on at Eartham Woods where the Monarch's Way long-distance path follows the route, the flint surface of the well-preserved road is exposed, the trees are mostly cut back to the <b>boundary</b> <b>ditches,</b> and the road seems little different from the time when the Legions left Britain. Although the Saxons made Chichester the capital of the South Saxon kingdom only the southern 7 km of the southern section of the road into the western Weald have remained in use, as the A285.|$|R
