Nevertheless, since as sword, as trowel, or as pocket-comb, the <b>beak</b> <b>of</b> {{the bird}} {{has to be}} pointed, the {{collection}} <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> may be conveniently intrusted to this otherwise penetrative instrument, and such food as can only be obtained by probing crevices, splitting open fissures, or neatly and minutely picking things up, is allotted, pre-eminently, to the bird species.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} a rhizomatous {{perennial}} grass with stems growing up to 1.3 meters tall. The leaves have erect blades {{up to half}} a meter tall. The inflorescence is a panicle up to 40 centimeters long bearing pale green or yellowish spikelets. The grass produces an abundance <b>of</b> <b>seed.</b> The seed is curved like the <b>beak</b> <b>of</b> a bird, giving the plant its common name.|$|R
5000|$|According to Les Hiddins, Aboriginal {{people would}} eat the fruit without chewing so they wouldn't {{stick to the}} tongue. The {{ripeness}} of the berry is indicated not only by its softness, but often also by a slight translucence. When quite ripe the sticky, gelatinous, sweet pulp surrounding the single seed is pleasant to eat, but its great stickiness often make the seed almost impossible to spit out. Birds have the same difficulty and may sometimes be seen wiping their <b>beaks</b> free <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> against the branch of a tree. Jennifer Isaacs lists berries of L. exocarpi and L.spathulata as being eaten in the Central desert Peter Latz notes that the calories obtained would be rather low. Aborigines often pluck whole branches from the tree and pick off the berries at their leisure. These berries are particularly favored by children. Although all Aboriginal groups have two or more names for mistletoes, it appears {{that they do not}} give separate names to each species. The Walpiri word for both L. murrayi and L. spathulata is pawurlirri. The Antakirinja people around Coober Pedy call the berries of L. exocarpi Ngantja.Reference to the fruit was first contained in a letter written by Governor Gawler during an ill-fated expedition in 1839 led by Charles Sturt. Gawler to his brother-in-law, Henry Cox, 20 December 1839: [...] "The poor boy (Henry Bryan) accompanied me most cheerfully, he had been resting all day and did not appear to suffer from the subsequent exertion. He brought me the pulpy but bitter fruit of the mesembryantheumum and the little berries of the exocarpi - and ate plenty of them himself - he made many observations about our course, appearing to recollect its striking features well, and calculated our distances with much precision".|$|R

40|$|Three {{hundred and}} {{seventeen}} accessions of lentil collected {{from all over}} the country were characterized for stem colour, pedicle colour, growth habit, tendrils, hairiness, leaf pubescence, leaflet size, pod pigmentation, pod indehiscence, presence/absence <b>of</b> <b>beak,</b> <b>seed</b> coat colour, seed coat pattern, seed coat pattern colour and cotyledon colour. Out of these accessions, 76 were heterogeneous that needs to evaluate carefully to isolate pure lines. Inter and intra-accession variation indicated the presence of local wealth for lentil that is yet needed to collect, therefore further exploration missions are suggested to collect germplasm from remote areas of NWFP, NA and Baluchistan with maximum emphasis to interiors rather than closer to motorable roads. High variability was observed for growth habit, leaf pubescence, leaflet size, seed coat colour, seed coat pattern and seed coat pattern colour that could be expanded and exploited for developing breeding material and to use for Marker Assisted Selection. Though clusters analysis grouped together accessions with greater genetic similarity, the cluster did not necessarily include all the accessions from same origin. Low level of association between genetic diversity and geographic distribution is expected to be due to less representation of accessions from particular area that is needed to be studied uniformly...|$|R
