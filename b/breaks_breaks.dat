60|$|There is a {{long way}} we can travel, after the death-break: after that point when the soul in intense {{suffering}} <b>breaks,</b> <b>breaks</b> away from its organic hold like a leaf that falls.

60|$|Yet {{the case}} {{is not the same}} quite, for we see that the short story where it is ranged with others of its species within the covers of a {{magazine}} is so welcome that the editor thinks his number the more brilliant the more short story writers he can call about his board, or under the roof of his pension. Here the boardinghouse analogy <b>breaks,</b> <b>breaks</b> so signally that I was lately moved to ask a distinguished editor why a book of short stories usually failed and a magazine usually succeeded because of them. He answered, gayly, that the short stories in most books of them were bad; that where they were good, they went; and he alleged several well-known instances in which books of prime short stories had a great vogue. He was so handsomely interested in my inquiry that I could not well say I thought some of the short stories which he had boasted in his last number were indifferent good, and yet, as he allowed, had mainly helped sell it. I had in mind many books of short stories of the first excellence which had failed as decidedly as those others had succeeded, for no reason that I could see; possibly there is really no reason in any literary success or failure that can be predicted, or applied in another Base.|$|E

50|$|The Phillips-Williams Fork Reservoir site {{provides}} archaeologists {{with the}} opportunity to assess the extent to which James Allen (and perhaps earlier) groups were utilizing mountain settings during the early Holocene period. When compared to other, similar sites in Colorado, the frequency of points in the Phillips-Williams Fork Reservoir site assemblage is most similar to assemblages from large, communal bison kills in the eastern portions of the state. The absence of evidence for a bison (or other species) kill site and the low occurrence of impact fractures (a common result of point use in hunting) on points raises questions {{about the nature of the}} collection. The presence of bend <b>breaks</b> (<b>breaks</b> causing during manufacture) indicates the site may have acted as some sort of temporary camp. The additional presence of Goshen/Plainview points at the Phillips-Williams Fork Reservoir is important as it indicates that the site was either multi-component, that individuals were finding and reusing older projectile points, or that the Goshen/Plainview form may have continued or been adopted by flintknappers of later periods.|$|E

40|$|Topoisomerases {{carry out}} the high-wire act of {{changing}} DNA structure through transient DNA <b>breaks.</b> <b>Breaks</b> are needed because the topology of DNA can only be changed through cutting the DNA. Topoisomerases are well suited for this tricky enterprise; they hold on to DNA covalently, shielding DNA ends from participation in unwarranted repair signaling or reactions. A downside of this mechanism is that topoisomerases can get trapped on DNA, leading to the new hazard of topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage. Topoisomerase-mediated damage oc...|$|E

Treatment with AcO-AAF in 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide did not directly yield strand <b>breaks.</b> <b>Breaks</b> in relatively low yield appeared after alkali treatment (pH 13, 60 min) of the RF I previously reacted with AcO-AAF. The DNA treated with AcO-AAF was sensitive to single-strand breakage by 303 nm near-ultraviolet light under neutral conditions. The greater the prior AcO-AAF treatment, the greater the sensitivity to 303 nm light. Post-irradiation alkali treatment greatly enhanced the light-induced strand breakage...|$|E

40|$|Tn 10 {{transposition}} {{is accomplished}} without extensive replication of the transposon sequences. Replicative cointegrate formation is precluded by efficient separation of transposon sequences from flanking donor DNA {{at an early}} stage in the transposition reaction. We report here that excision of Tn 10 from its donor site occurs by a pair of flush double-strand <b>breaks.</b> <b>Breaks</b> occur {{at each end of the}} element precisely between the terminal base pair of the element and the first base pair of flanking DNA. This observation provides definitive evidence that cleavage of both strands of the element occurs under the direct control of Tn 10 transposase protein. It is highly likely that transposase itself is directly responsible for these cleavages. The implications of this possibility are discussed...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new fault {{simulation}} algorithm for realistic break faults in the p-networks and n-networks of static CMOS cells. We show that Miller effects can invalidate a test just as charge sharing can, and {{we present a}} new charge-based approach that efficiently and accurately predicts the worst case effects of Miller capacitances and charge sharing together. Results on running our fault simulator on ISCAS 85 benchmark circuits are provided. 1 INTRODUCTION Defects that occur during the IC manufacturing process can be categorized into three classes according to Hawkins et al. [7]. These classes are bridge, open circuit, and parametric defects. Open circuit defects cause breaks in the conducting materials in the layout, and contacts are particularly susceptible to such <b>breaks.</b> <b>Breaks</b> {{can be divided into}} two categories: those that physically disconnect one or more transistor gates from their drivers, and those that disconnect transistors from each other in the p-network or n-network of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} evidence of instability in models of ex post predictable components in stock returns related to structural {{breaks in the}} coe cients of state variables such as the lagged dividend yield, short interest rate, term spread and default premium. We estimate linear models of excess returns {{for a set of}} international equity indices and test for stability of the estimated regression parameters. There is evidence of instability {{for the vast majority of}} countries. We then attempt to characterize the timing and nature of the <b>breaks.</b> <b>Breaks</b> do not generally appear to be uniform in time: di erent countries experience breaks at di erent times. We do identify a contemporaneous break for the US and UK indices in 1974. There is also some evidence of a break for a cluster of European nations during the 1978 - 1982 period. These breaks may relate to the oil price shock of 1974 and the formation of the European Monetary System in 1979. For the majority of intenational indices, the predictable component in stock returns appears to have diminished following the most recent break. We assess the adequecy of the break tests and model selection procedures in a set o...|$|E

40|$|Fbh 1 (F-box DNA helicase 1) orthologues are conserved from Schizosaccharomyces pombe to {{chickens}} and humans. Here, we report {{the disruption of}} the FBH 1 gene in DT 40 cells. Although the yeast fbh 1 mutant shows an increase in sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, FBH 1 −/− DT 40 clones show no prominent sensitivity, suggesting {{that the loss of}} FBH 1 might be compensated by other genes. However, FBH 1 −/− cells exhibit increases in both sister chromatid exchange and the formation of radial structures between homologous chromosomes without showing a defect in homologous recombination. This phenotype is reminiscent of BLM−/− cells and suggests that Fbh 1 may be involved in preventing extensive strand exchange during homologous recombination. In addition, disruption of RAD 54, a major homologous recombination factor in FBH 1 −/− cells, results in a marked increase in chromosome-type <b>breaks</b> (<b>breaks</b> on both sister chromatids at the same place) following replication fork arrest. Further, FBH 1 BLM cells showed additive increases in both sister chromatid exchange and the formation of radial chromosomes. These data suggest that Fbh 1 acts in parallel with Bloom helicase to control recombination-mediated double-strand-break repair at replication blocks and to reduce the frequency of crossover...|$|E
