Journal of Agricultural Science, 141, (2), 191 - 202. Sponsorship: HGCAPlant characters that determine stem and root lodging were measured on 15 winter wheat cultivars at three UK sites between 2000 and 2002. A model of lodging {{was used to}} estimate stem failure wind speeds (resistance to stem lodging) and anchorage failure wind speeds (resistance to root lodging). The degree and type of natural lodging was also recorded in the plots and this correlated well with the stem and anchorage failure wind speeds. Only a weak correlation (R 2 = 0 ? 33) was observed between the stem and anchorage failure wind speeds for the 15 cultivars. This {{can be explained by}} the absence of genetic correlation between the plant characters that determine the stem and anchorage strength. There was a significant interaction between type of lodging (stem or root) and cultivar for failure wind speed (PPeer reviewe...|$|E

Is the {{productivity}} of organic farms restricted by the supply of available nitrogen? Soil Use and Management, 18, (Suppl. 1), 248 - 255. Special issue - Soil fertility in organically managed soils Sponsorship: DEFRAThis paper reviews information from the literature and case studies to investigate whether productivity in organic systems is restricted by the supply of available N during the major phases of crop growth. Organic systems {{have the potential to}} supply adequate amounts of available N to meet crop demand through the incorporation of leys, N rich cash crop residues and uncomposted manures. However, this is seldom achieved because leys are only incorporated once every few years and organically produced crop residues and manures tend to have low N contents and slow mineralization rates. N availability could be improved by delaying ley incorporation until spring, applying uncomposted manures at the start of spring growth, transferring some manure applications from the ley phase to arable crops, preventing cover crops from reaching a wide C:N ratio and better matching crop type with the dynamics of N availability.

40|$|Objective: Two recent {{retrospective}} studies independently reported typically pathogenic {{bacteria in}} normally sterile sites of infants succumbing to sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI). These findings suggested {{a proportion of}} unexplained SUDI might be triggered by bacteraemia. The objective was to assess these observations {{in the context of}} the pathology and epidemiology of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in relation to the role of infection and inflammation as triggers of these deaths. Design: A review of the literature to identify potential risk factors for unexplained infant deaths and proposal of a theoretical model for SUDI. Results: Pathologic and epidemiological evidence suggests a hypothesis based on three factors: bacterial translocation, pathogen pattern recognition insufficiency and prenatal exposure to infection. Conclusion: We propose that sterile site infections in which common toxigenic bacteria are identified indicate a brief bacteraemic episode prior to death. This might reflect an ineffective innate response to invasive pathogens that results in reduced clearance of the bacteria. Thymomegaly observed consistently among infants diagnosed under the category of SIDS might have its origins in prenatal life, perhaps generated via in utero infection or exposure to microbial antigens which results in thymocyte priming. There is consistent evidence for an infectious aetiology in many unexplained SUDI. Future directions for research are suggested. A. R. Highet, A. M. <b>Berry,</b> <b>P.</b> N. Goldwate...|$|E

This work forms part of the dissertation research of MR. 0 SPIE-SOC PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS BELLINGHAM J APPL REMOTE SENSSatellite radar altimeter measurements of lake and reservoir water levels complement in situ observations by providing stage information for ungauged basins and by filling data gaps in existing gauge records. Such additional measurements assist both research and operational programs. However, for a particular lake or reservoir, altimetric products offered to end-users may differ due to choice of employed instrument, processing technique, and applied geophysical corrections. To explore these differences, particularly with their potential impact on climate-based research, an intercomparison of three web-based water-level products (produced by Laboratoire d'Etudes en Geophysique et Oceanographie Spatiale, National Aeronautics and Space Administration/United States Department of Agriculture, and European Space Agency/De Montfort University) has been undertaken based on 18 lakes and reservoirs. The products are well correlated with each other (r = 0. 87 to 0. 99) and where in situ data are available are quite well correlated with the gauge measurements (r = 0. 73 to 0. 99). Despite variations in data processing, the poorest root-mean-square differences between any altimeter product and gauge data (similar to 0. 20 to 1. 41 m) occur for the narrow reservoirs and smaller lakes. The largest discrepancies between the altimeter products occur for the lakes that freeze (Lake Athabasca and Woods). The current altimeter products provide acceptable accuracy, long-term trends and seasonality for climate applications. We discuss the merits of each product system, but recommend further validations and the provision of ice-detection flags. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

A previous estimate was generated for 1993 - 2008 using TOPEX-Poseidon, ERS- 2 and ENVISAT, and is now extended using Jason- 2. To take full advantages of the new availability of in situ rating curves, the processing scheme is adapted and the adjustments of the methodology are discussed here. First, using a large sample of in situ river height measurements, we estimate the standard error of Jason- 2 -derived water levels over the Ganga and the Brahmaputra to be respectively of 0. 28 m and 0. 19 m, or less than similar to 4 % of the annual peak-to-peak variations of these two rivers. Using the in situ rating curves between water levels and river discharges, we show that Jason- 2 accurately infers Ganga and Brahmaputra instantaneous discharges for 2008 - 2011 with mean errors ranging from similar to 2180 m(3) /s (6. 5 %) over the Brahmaputra to similar to 1458 m(3) /s (13 %) over the Ganga. The combined Ganga-Brahmaputra monthly discharges meet the requirements of acceptable accuracy (15 - 20 %) with a mean error of similar to 16 % for 2009 - 2011 and similar to 17 % for 1993 - 2011. The Ganga-Brahmaputra monthly discharge at the river mouths is then presented, showing a marked interannual variability {{with a standard deviation of}} similar to 12500 m(3) /s, much larger than the data set uncertainty. Finally, using in situ sea surface salinity observations, we illustrate the possible impact of extreme continental freshwater discharge event on the northern Bay of Bengal as observed in 2008...|$|E

In addition to this definition, certain situations were also described to the respondents in order to elaborate on the concept of psychological violence. Psychological violence was reported by most of the participants (21 of 32). Nonetheless, the women tried to blame the situation instead of their husbands. Only four women complained that they were “humiliated” by their husbands in various social situations and they directly accused their husbands of the deliberate use of psychological abuse.

40|$|Trust {{has been}} {{described}} as “perhaps the single most powerful relationship marketing tool available to a company” (<b>Berry,</b> 1995, <b>p.</b> 242). Trust enjoys wide acceptance among scholars as a key facilitator of inter-organisational relationship development; however, the construct begs deeper exploration within a framework of both existing and emerging dimensions of trust. Successful relationship development demands an understanding of what drives the propensity to trust between organisations. Organisations that are oblivious to these evaluative criteria risk relationship decay with partner organisations. The six most salient antecedents of trust within contemporary trust literature, explored both conceptually and empirically, have been identified as satisfaction, communication, competence, shared values, benevolence and integrity. Additionally, co-creation is investigated as an emergent antecedent of trust in business-to-business relationships. The relationship between these independent variables and trust are investigated by adopting multiple regression analysis. The moderating influence of business experience on the relationship between significant independent variables and trust is also explored. Findings from this study indicate that co-creation and integrity positively affect trust within a business-to-business environment. The results also reveal that business experience has a moderating effect on the relationship between co-creation and trust. The longer-term, more involved nature of business-to-business relationships precludes flawless execution of all service encounters. Service failure is a common occurrence within inter-organisational relationships and the trust enjoyed between partners can suffer as a consequence. An exploration of the antecedents of trust within business-to-business relationships serves as the first step toward developing sound trust recovery mechanisms {{in the event of a}} violation of trust...|$|R
