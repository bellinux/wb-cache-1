The wish to achieve higher accuracy of photogrammetric products, which result from complex bundle <b>block</b> <b>adjustments</b> and multi-image matching, {{raises the question of}} stability of parameters of the digital camera’s internal orientation in the aerial vehicle and their impact on the final product. The Bramor rTK aerial vehicle by the company C-ASTRAL and the Agisoft PhotoScan photo processing software were used {{for the purpose of this}} thesis. A geodetic network consisting of 20 stabilised points was established at the Petrol petrol station in Vipava to provide a calibration field. The network was condensed with a polar method to obtain more control points. To determine the stability of parameters of the camera’s internal orientation, we conducted flights above the calibration field on three occasions. On every occasion, we carried out two flights, each at a different altitude, following the same flight plan. The acquired pictures were loaded to the Agisoft PhotoScan software, where internal and external camera orientation parameters were calculated through bundle <b>block</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The changing internal orientation parameters were analysed based on tests performed on different test blocks. The impact of the said parameters on the accuracy of photogrammetric products, i. e. orthophotos and point clouds, were assessed in line with control point discrepancies that were measured on the products using the Autocad Civil 3 D software. Moreover, the discrepancies of the products on control points using different numbers of Ground Control Points were also observed...|$|R

A DRM, in our concept, is a function that for each ground point returns a reflectance value and a Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). In a similar way to the terrain geometric reconstruction procedure, given an image block of some terrain area, we split the DRM generation in two phases: radiometric <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> and DRM generation. In the paper we concentrate on the radiometric <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> step, but we also describe a preliminary DRM generator. In the <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> step, after a radiometric pre-calibraton step, local atmosphere radiative transfer parameters, and ground reflectances and BRDFs at the radiometric tie points are estimated. This radiometric <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> is based on atmospheric radiative transfer (ART) models, pre-selected BRDF models and radiometric ground control points.

Lunar orbiter imagery and laser altimeter data are two major data sources for lunar topographic modeling. Most previous studies have processed the imagery and laser altimeter data separately for lunar topographic modeling, and there are usually inconsistencies between the derived lunar topographic models. This paper presents a novel combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> approach to integrate multiple strips of the Chinese Chang'E- 2 imagery and NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Laser Altimeter (LOLA) data for precision lunar topographic modeling. The participants of the combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> include the orientation parameters of the Chang'E- 2 images, the intra-strip tie points derived from the Chang'E- 2 stereo images of the same orbit, the inter-strip tie points derived from the overlapping area of two neighbor Chang'E- 2 image strips, and the LOLA points. Two constraints are incorporated into the combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> including a local surface constraint and an orbit height constraint, which are specifically designed to remedy the large inconsistencies between the Chang'E- 2 and LOLA data sets. The output of the combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> is the improved orientation parameters of the Chang'E- 2 images and ground coordinates of the LOLA points, from which precision lunar topographic models can be generated. The performance of the developed approach was evaluated using the Chang'E- 2 imagery and LOLA data in the Sinus Iridum area and the Apollo 15 landing area. The experimental results revealed that the mean absolute image residuals between the Chang'E- 2 image strips were drastically reduced from tens of pixels before the adjustment to sub-pixel level after adjustment. Digital elevation models (DEMs) with 20 m resolution were generated using the Chang'E- 2 imagery after the combined <b>block</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Comparison of the Chang'E- 2 DEM with the LOLA DEM showed a good level of consistency.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} a {{total of}} 53 Galileo and Voyager images of Io and 54 Cassini images of Enceladus to derive new geodetic control point networks for the two satellites. In order to derive the network for Io we used a subset of 66 images from those used in previous control point network studies [1, 2]. Additionally we have carried out new point measurements. We used recently reconstructed Galileo spacecraft trajectory data, supplied by the spacecraft navigation team of JPL. A total of 1956 tie point measurements for Io and 4392 ones for Enceladus have been carried out, which were processed by performing photogrammetric bundle <b>block</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Measurements and <b>block</b> <b>adjustments</b> were performed {{by means of the}} «PHOTOMOD» software [3] which was especially adapted for this study to accommodate global networks of small bodies, such as Io and Enceladus. As a result, two catalogs with the Cartesian three-dimensional coordinates of 197 and 351 control points were obtained for Io and Enceladus, respectively. The control points for Io have a mean overall accuracy of 4985. 7 m (RMS). The individual accuracy of the control points for Enceladus differ substantially over the surface (the range is from 0. 1 to 36. 0 km) because images lack coverage and resolutions. We also determine best-fit spheres, spheroids, and tri-axial ellipsoids. The centers of the models were found to be shifted from the coordinate system origin attesting to possible errors in the ephemeris of Io. Conclusion and Future work: A comparison of our results for Io with the most recent control point network analysis [2] has revealed that we managed to derive the same accuracy of the control points using a smaller number of images and measurements (This study: 1956 measurements, DLR study: 4392). This probably attests {{to the fact that the}} now available new navigation data are internally more consistent. At present an analysis of the data is in progress. We report that control point measurements and global network analysis for small planetary bodies by means of the software «PHOTOMOD» is fast and efficient. Using the new control points and shape models of the satellites we are currently preparing new maps of Io and Enceladus using GIS tools. For parts of the surface for which we have quality stereo-images we will produce DEMs and orthoimages, which will be shown at the conference.

In this paper, some results referred to an experience of multitemporal aerial triangulation are presented, {{with the purpose of}} demonstrating accuracy improvements in stereo model orientation. The case study is the Belvedere Glacier that belongs to the Monte Rosa east face (Italian Western Alps) and since 1868 has been being interested by superglacial lakes outbursts, ice avalanches and surge-type movements, awakening the interest of the scientific community in studying these phenomena and generally to consider a glacier monitoring. Approaching the multitemporal analysis of the geometric features of moving surfaces, the most critical factor is always the planimetric coherence between the oriented stereo models of the different periods. This work tries to give a preliminary answer to this problem. Two digitized aerial stereo-pairs (years 2001 and 2003) acquired at different scales were used for the tests. Three Aerial Triangulation approaches were considered and compared: a) a traditional Single <b>Block</b> Bundle <b>Adjustment</b> (SBBA); b) a Single <b>Block</b> Sequential Bundle <b>Adjustment</b> (SBSBA); c) a Multi-temporal <b>Block</b> Bundle <b>Adjustment</b> (MTBBA). Statistical parameters referring to some Check Points sited in no-moving areas demonstrate that MTBBA produces a better co-registration among blocks, guaranteeing a better coherence between measurements and consequently a higher precision in determining displacements measured at the ground level.

40|$|The {{satellite}} image with high resolution has been commercially available since early 21 st century, and {{the generation of}} digital elevation model and Ortho-image with lower costs and shorter period from these high-resolution images has become practical. But at first one must calculate the parameters of these high-resolution images. Recently, A new strict geometric model, based on affine transformation, for RSIHR was proposed. In the new model, there are eight affine coefficients and one slantwise angle for each image. However, in order to calculate the nine parameters, more than five control points are needed. Therefore, many control points {{should be used in}} a block for the new model.

On this basis, an innovative solution of the <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> problem by Procrustes algorithms and the related computer program implementation are presented and discussed. The main advantage of the new proposed method is that it avoids the conventional least squares solution. For this reason, linearisation algorithms and the knowledge of a priori approximate values for the unknown parameters are not required. Once the model coordinates of the tie points are available and at least three control points are known, the Procrustes algorithms can directly provide, without further information, the tie point ground coordinates and the exterior orientation parameters. Furthermore, some numerical <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> solutions obtained by the new method in different areas of North Italy are compared to the conventional solution. The very simple data input process, the less memory requirements, the low computing time and the same level of accuracy that characterise the new algorithm with respect to a conventional one are verified with these tests. A <b>block</b> <b>adjustment</b> of 11 models, with 44 tie points and 14 control points, takes just a few seconds on an Intel PIII 400 MHz computer, and the total data memory required is less than twice the allocated space for the input data.

For this purpose, the cameras have been flown over large calibration test areas at different flying heights, forward and reverse flight patterns over the same flight line, and different overlaps (end and lateral). Both calibration test sites include a large quantity of control and independent check points used during adjustment and quality control. Several patterns of control point amounts and distributions were tested. All bundle <b>block</b> <b>adjustments</b> were carried out with self-calibration using specifically derived additional parameters for each camera with the purpose of removing possible systematic effects. In relation to the radiometric characteristics, several linear features evenly distributed over the entire area were cross sectioned along edges and their pixel grey shade studied through point spread functions that allow for the derivation of the effective dimension of the ground sample distance.

In this research, we propose {{a combination of a}} digital camera and a small (cheap) laser scanner with inexpensive IMU and GPS for an unmanned helicopter. Direct geo-referencing is achieved automatically using all the sensors without any ground control points. After the accurate trajectory of the platform with attitude changes are determined through the direct geo-referencing, 3 D shape of objects is determined by laser scanner as 3 D point cloud data, while texture is acquired by CCD sensor from the same platform simultaneously. A method of direct geo-referencing of range data and CCD images by integrating multi sensors for constructing digital surface model are focused. While measuring, an unmanned helicopter is continuously changing its position and attitude with respect to time. For direct geo-referencing, IMU measures the movement of the platform. IMU has a rising quality, but it is still affected by systematic errors. Through Kalman filter operation, an optimal estimate of the sensor position and attitude are determined from GPS and IMU.

40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the control issues of the quasi-Z-source derived {{push-pull}} converter with integrated magnetic elements. The proposed converter is intended for applications that require a high gain of the input voltage and galvanic isolation, i. e. power conditioning systems for renewable energy sources, such as variable speed wind turbines with direct driven permanent magnet synchronous generators. Magnitude and frequency of the output voltage of such turbines are variable due to intermittent nature of the wind power. Despite number of advantages converter has complicated dynamic behavior. Simulations showed change of stability margin depending on current operation point of the wind turbine and output load. Closed loop control system should provide fast response and stable operation in the wide range of wind speeds. Simulations showed that the conventional PI-controller with saturation cannot satisfy those requirements. Nonlinear PI-controller was derived by adding <b>adjustment</b> <b>block</b> to the conventional PI-controller. <b>Adjustment</b> <b>block</b> is drastically changing proportional and integral gains of the controller according to sign of the output voltage error. Proposed controller is compared with conventional one by means of simulation in PSIM. Simulation results prove that proposed nonlinear control system has improved regulator performance...|$|R
40|$|A block {{adaptive}} rate controlled (BARC) {{image data}} compression algorithm is described. It is {{noted that in}} the algorithm's principal rate controlled mode, image lines can be coded at selected rates by combining practical universal noiseless coding techniques with <b>block</b> adaptive <b>adjustments</b> in linear quantization. Compression of any source data at chosen rates of 3. 0 bits/sample and above {{can be expected to}} yield visual image quality with imperceptible degradation. Exact reconstruction will be obtained if the one-dimensional difference entropy is below the selected compression rate. It is noted that the compressor can also be operated as a floating rate noiseless coder by simply not altering the input data quantization. Here, the universal noiseless coder ensures that the code rate is always close to the entropy. Application of BARC image data compression to the Galileo orbiter mission of Jupiter is considered...|$|R
50|$|Before the Hipparcos Catalogue was published, he was {{the first}} (with Michael Perryman), to set forth a new {{proposal}} for a more ambitious mission in terms of accuracy and sensitivity, resting on the same fundamental principles as Hipparcos. This was initially Roemer, and finally Gaia, eventually selected by ESA in 2000 (for a projected launch in 2012), and actually launched in December 2013. Again, Lennart Lindegren was instrumental in the initial design of what was in the early phase an interferometer and in the assessment of the astrometric accuracy achievable. He also led the detailed design of the overall scheme of the astrometric solution, being a <b>block</b> iterative <b>adjustment</b> determining the attitude, the calibration and the system directly from the CCD images. This Astrometric Global Iterative Solution (AGIS) is now fully operational within the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC).|$|R
