They try to live their lives free from 'A' after Aria manages to save them from Shana, the rooftop shooter, in New York. The girls think Shana was 'A', and with her gone, they no longer worry about 'A'. However, 'A' returns, blowing up the Cavanaugh house and leaving the liars more afraid than ever. With Alison back, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer notice how their friendship has changed since Ali's disappearance. The other residents in Rosewood also deal with Alison coming home, and it leads to Mona making an army against her, consisting of residents whom Ali bullied <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> The liars try to figure out who killed Mrs. DiLaurentis, and if there is a connection between her and the girl who was buried in Alison's grave, Bethany Young.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, Mars {{said that}} he was no longer {{interested}} in churning out songs for other artists, he explained [...] "There's a piece of me that's no longer there, which was basically let me write a song and then sell it. That was <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when I was struggling and hustling to pay rent. I was selling songs for 250 bucks." [...] Despite this, they have produced a song for Adele's third studio album 25, entitled [...] "All I Ask". This marked their last production as a team.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Radiohead's Oxford studio, Godrich's studio in Covent Garden, and Yorke's home. Yorke wanted to [...] "approach and engage with computers and not a lot else, and yet still have lots of life and energy in the music." [...] To generate ideas, he cut and pasted clips at random from Radiohead's library of original samples, {{many of which were}} created on laptops in hotel rooms as the band toured. He would send sound fragments to Godrich, who identified passages that could become songs, edited them, and returned them to Yorke. Describing the collaborative process, Yorke said: [...] "'Black Swan', <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> was a ... nine-minute load of bollocks. Except for this one juicy bit, and [...] goes past and goes, 'That bit. Fuck the rest.' Usually it's something like that." ...|$|E

GamesRadar's Brett Elston described Charizard as [...] "hands-down one of the coolest Pokémon out there", heavily praising its character design and calling it [...] "one of the coolest" [...] designs of the entire series. GamesRadar editor Raymond Padilla stated [...] "Charizard was an awesome Pokemon <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and still an excellent choice more than a decade after it was introduced." [...] UGO.com described Charizard as a [...] "winged, dragon-like creature" [...] which is [...] "able to breathe fire and smash opponents into red-tinged goo", but states that in Brawl, it is [...] "as slow as Bowser" [...] and [...] "lacks the coolness factor of Mario's arch-nemesis." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine was {{impressed}} with the album and said that [...] "Madonna, with the help of Price, [...] has succeeded at creating a dance-pop odyssey with an emotional, if not necessarily narrative, arc — and one big continuously-mixed F you to the art-dismantling iPod Shuffle in the process." [...] He compared the album to Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue's studio album X (2007), saying [...] "Comparisons to X, Kylie Minogue's own discofied comeback album from 2007, are inevitable". Alan Light from Rolling Stone declared that the album illustrated that [...] "Madonna has never lost her faith {{in the power of the}} beat." [...] However, he opined that [...] "Confessions on a Dance Floor won't stand the test of time like her glorious early club hits, but it proves its point. Like Rakim <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> Madonna can still move the crowd." ...|$|E
500|$|Dieter Bohn of The Verge {{praised the}} Xbox One S's revised design as being [...] "svelte and good-looking", noting its smaller form factor {{and the lack}} of power brick. The Xbox One S was also praised for being the {{cheapest}} 4K-compatible Blu-ray Disc player on the market, but it was argued that consumers were [...] " [...] as eager to upgrade to 4K Blu-rays as they were to DVDs <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Especially when 4K streaming boxes can be purchased for much less." [...] The lack of HDR-compatible games available on-launch was panned, as well as Microsoft's choice of the standard over Dolby Vision (which was the only HDR standard supported by the reviewer's 4K television). Bohn concluded that the Xbox One S would appeal best to new owners or those who wish to leverage its HDR and 4K support, but recommended that existing owners hold off until the release of Xbox One X in 2017.|$|E

500|$|Becky Bain of 'Idolator' {{was more}} {{positive}} {{of the song}} saying she [...] "actually forgot Lopez is still considered a singer, what with her two-year hiatus to focus on all her fragrances and clothing lines and babies and such. It's nice to have her back—yes, not every J-Lo song was a hit, but we all danced to 'If You Had My Love' and 'Waiting for Tonight' <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> 'Louboutins' ... definitely has the catchiest chorus she's had in years. This could actually bring Jennifer out of the pit her last album Brave dug her into." [...] Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as [...] "a Tricky and The-Dream-produced club banger with a chorus that succeeds through sheer attrition, with a proper Janet Jackson-style dance break. [...] Truth be told, it's not a J.Lo classic to rival 'Play' or 'Love Don't Cost a Thing', and it's about as original as starting your day {{with a bowl of}} Kellogg's Cornflakes, but it does burrow into your brain after a few spins." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson has {{cited the}} color red as the album's only theme. A color {{traditionally}} associated with Christmas, she affiliated the color to various emotions in the holidays. Wanting to stray {{away from her}} usual pop sound, she described Wrapped in Reds music as a representation to explore different genres such as jazz, country and Memphis soul. She recalled: [...] "What's cool about Christmas albums is you can do jazz, rock and roll, you can do pop, you can do blues, like {{you can do all}} that stuff and it works—cause it's all classic and it's Christmasy sounding." [...] She also noted that the album's multitude of styles positively contributed to her artistic goal, saying: [...] "My best friend from childhood heard it and said, 'This is what you sound like, before everything else.' And I agree, It's my core sound. <b>Back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> when artists came out with things like [...] "Fall to Pieces" [...] and [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water", those songs transcended genres. It wasn't, 'Where is it going to fit?' You catered to whatever the song calls for. And that's exactly what I did—without having to have an umbrella for everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{is known}} for their {{elaborate}} concert performances. In Marley Brant's Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway, Bruce described a typical performance: [...] "We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of Faygo at every show...We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage...Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage...ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'" [...] Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a game show set and a cemetery. Bruce stated, [...] "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour we go out on. We've been around so long that we get to dig up the many cool sets that we used <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and then get to use them again on a national level. Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, {{we can go back}} again and now do it nationwide-style".|$|E

500|$|Rob Leane, for Den of Geek, {{stated that}} [...] "this week we {{continue}} to see the fallout of ’s revelations playing out in gleefully entertaining fashion ... we were treated to a twisty espionage-heavy thriller of an episode". Leane added that [...] "by pitting May against her other self in a well-shot, thumpingly-scored fight sequence, new-to-S.H.I.E.L.D. director Kevin Tancharoen used his experience from Mortal Kombat: Legacy to highlight how far the action elements of the show have come since the early days." [...] and also noted the development of multiple characters as positive. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush said [...] "I had my trepidations about [...] "Face My Enemy"'s cutesy-looking callbacks to more camp episodes and spy tropes, the kind you might expect from Chuck, <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> The hour certainly danced over that line here and there, what with May and Coulson’s only means to recover an important artifact lying in a lavish party, the stock laser grid security alarm, May's mirror image fight, and other such throwback fare, but I’d say [...] "Face My Enemy" [...] ended up more of a celebratory self-aware subversion, rather than {{a sign of the}} season running out on empty just yet." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{subjects}} {{focused on}} in the album's lyrics include Vanilla Ice's abusive childhood and drug addiction. He stated that [...] "I wrote 'Fuck Me' 'cause I know how I've been perceived. [...] "I can {{look back at the}} whole Vanilla Ice thing, and it was played way out. It was just an image thing. I was always real to the music. But it built a huge hurdle for me to get over musically. A lot of people didn't even want to admit they bought a Vanilla Ice record." [...] "Too Cold" [...] is a rap rock remake of Vanilla Ice's biggest hit, [...] "Ice Ice Baby". Vanilla Ice stated that he remade the song because [...] "I wanted to let people know that I'm not running from anything. This is me. This is what I'm about. I think the music speaks for itself. If the music was whack, nobody'd even care to hear anything about no Vanilla Ice. I just think the music is so strong people are kinda comin' out of the closet. It's like, 'You know, hey, I bought it <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> and the new stuff is slammin'.' I think there's some hip-hop influenced, stage-diving, body piercing, tattooed white boys out there who are embracing this new sound." [...] "Too Cold" [...] was originally intended to be released as a hidden track or B-side.|$|E
500|$|Paul Byrnes of The Sydney Morning Herald {{felt that}} American Gangster was [...] "one {{of the most}} {{intelligent}} gangster films in years" [...] and expressed that the film offers [...] "the spectacle of grand themes and two bigger-than-life characters played {{by two of the}} best actors in cinema." [...] Concluding his review, Byrnes gave the film four out of four stars. IGN's Jim [...] "Stax" [...] Vejvoda rated the film four out of five stars, praising the acting—particularly of the two protagonists, [...] "both dynamic presences on-screen, with neither actor outweighing the other's importance to the story"—and declaring that despite being preceded by other gangster stories such as Scarface and The Sopranos, American Gangster managed to justify its existence with [...] "emphasis on the human and class elements of the story". Manohla Dargis of The New York Times strongly commended the film, opining that [...] "greatness hovers just outside American Gangster." [...] She continued: [...] "It's a seductive package, crammed with all the on-screen and off-screen talent that big-studio money can buy, and filled with old soul and remixed funk that evoke the city <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> when heroin turned poor streets white and sometimes red." [...] These sentiments were echoed by Sukhdev Sandhu of The Telegraph, who asserted that the storyline was [...] "amazing".|$|E

500|$|Unlike the {{original}} release, Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror has received very positive reviews from critics. AppSafari gave the game a 5 out of 5, saying: [...] "Production {{values for the}} game are sky-high, with gorgeous graphics, challenging, well-designed puzzles, and pitch-perfect voice acting. The sequel also implements the same fantastic touch interface of its predecessor." [...] AppGamer gave the game a 10 out of 10, saying: [...] "Broken Sword 2 will last you hours, having all the playability of a full-priced PC game. It {{is the kind of}} game that could convert people who wouldn't look twice at adventure games, and is easily one of my most highly recommended titles on the platform." [...] GameZone gave the game an 8 out of 10 and praised the game's controls and cut scenes, but stated that the iPad version of the game can be blurry at times. Carl Stevens of TouchGen gave the game 4 out of 5 start and stated that it should be on everybody's [...] "must play list" [...] and that the ease of, and restriction between some puzzles were the only let down in the game. Jeniffer Allen of 148Apps gave the game a 4 out of 5 start and praised it, saying: [...] "Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror is a fantastic game. The story feels as fresh and as entertaining as it did <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> and the slightly improved graphics are much appreciated. Many hours of entertaining storytelling lie ahead." ...|$|E
500|$|The Way I See It was an {{exemplary}} {{release of the}} classic soul revival during its peak in 2008. The music scene was marked by similarly retro-minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele, independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Mayer Hawthorne, and older artists attempting comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette. Oliver Wang cited Saadiq's album, along with Solange Knowles' 2008 record Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, {{as one of the}} [...] "retro-soul" [...] efforts that were released by contemporary R artists as the music scene peaked in popularity. Wang wrote that The Way I See It [...] "showcased a mastery of any number of past R styles, including those out of Memphis, Muscle Shoals, Philadelphia, New Orleans, and of course, Detroit." [...] Estelle said in 2008, [...] "Every song is like a different era of Motown ... Everything sounds exactly like it did <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Not to take away from Amy, but this is the real shit." [...] It was described by David Nathan as the [...] "contemporary album that was the closest to authentically recreating the great soul music sound of the late '60s and early '70s." [...] Ken Tucker found it distinct from other soul revival music: [...] "You can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm, but without an emotional commitment, it's all tedious pandering to baby boomers. For Raphael Saadiq, there's a glowing vibrancy in soul music that allows him to work out themes and ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick W. Galbraith of Otaku2.com {{compared}} {{the design of}} OZ to Takashi Murakami's artwork, specifically [...] "the flatness, or slick, polished surfaces" [...] and then contrasted them with the sequences in Nagano noting, [...] "it has a warm and lived in feel to it, aided by a scrupulous attention to detail." [...] Of the story and characters Galbraith wrote that [...] "scenes such as the large family coming together and talking over dinner are heartwarming and hilarious." [...] and {{compared the}} movie to [...] "a moving picture book, a family photo album turned back a few decades." [...] He also noted the audience response, reporting sold-out screenings two nights in a row, and highlighting handwritten notes left at the theater by [...] "hoardes of fans who on the spot {{decided to move to}} Nagano" [...] In conclusion, Galbraith wrote [...] "there is an innocence and purity to this work that really reminds [...] of Miyazaki Hayao and Studio Ghibli <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> and the stellar backgrounds invoke Shinkai Makoto." [...] Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network gave the film an 'A' rating and wrote that [...] "decades from now, Summer Wars will be seen as the official arrival of [...] Mamoru Hosoda into the realm of historically important anime directors." [...] He called the film [...] "a near-perfect blend of social satire and science fiction, at once timely and timeless, sardonic and optimistic." [...] and noted that the film is [...] "practically overflowing with sharp social insight in a way we have not seen from anime in years." [...] Sevakis praised Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character designs and highlighted the visuals as [...] "sharp and consistently great". In summing the film up he called Summer Wars [...] "Incredibly entertaining, and intriguingly intelligent. Accessible and fast-paced. Pretty much perfect." [...] Similarities have been commented on between the film and a previous work of Hosoda, [...] Neo magazine has stated that Our War Game is [...] "plainly a prototype" [...] of Summer Wars.|$|E
