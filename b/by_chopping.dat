25|$|The phytochemicals {{responsible}} for the sharp flavor of garlic are produced when the plant's cells are damaged. When a cell is broken <b>by</b> <b>chopping,</b> chewing, or crushing, enzymes stored in cell vacuoles trigger the breakdown of several sulfur-containing compounds stored in the cell fluids (cytosol). The resultant compounds are {{responsible for}} the sharp or hot taste and strong smell of garlic. Some of the compounds are unstable and continue to react over time. Among the members of the onion family, garlic has by far the highest concentrations of initial reaction products, making garlic much more potent than onion, shallot, or leeks. Although many humans enjoy the taste of garlic, these compounds are believed to have evolved as a defensive mechanism, deterring animals such as birds, insects, and worms from eating the plant. Because of this, people throughout history have used garlic to keep away insects such as mosquitoes and slugs.|$|E
25|$|The Baker, his Wife, and Little Red Ridinghood {{get lost}} in the woods and find Cinderella's family and the Steward, who reveal that the castle was set upon by the Giant. The Witch arrives as well, {{bringing}} news that the Giant has destroyed the village and the Baker's house. Suddenly, thunderous footsteps are heard and the Giant appears. To the shock of all, this Giant is a woman who has come from the second beanstalk and is the widow of the Giant that Jack killed <b>by</b> <b>chopping</b> down the beanstalk. Her booming voice proclaims that she wants Jack's blood in revenge. To satisfy the Giantess, the group realizes they must give her someone, but are unable to decide on whom until they realize that the Narrator is still commenting on the actions from the sidelines. Everyone offers her the narrator as a sacrifice, but he convinces them how lost they would be without him. Nevertheless, the Witch throws him into the Giantess's arms and he is killed upon being dropped. Jack's mother finds the group and aggressively defends her son, angering the Giantess, and the Steward clubs Jack's mother to quiet her, inadvertently killing her. As the Giantess leaves to search for Jack, Rapunzel runs into her path and is trampled, to the horror of the Witch and her Prince ("Witch's Lament").|$|E
25|$|The Nationals placed Fedde on the 10-day {{disabled}} list on September 4 and recalled starting pitcher A. J. Cole from Syracuse, along with catcher Pedro Severino. Fedde was listed with a flexor strain {{in his right}} throwing arm, an injury expected to rule him out {{for the remainder of}} the season. Cole got the start on September 4 against the division rival Miami Marlins and earned the win in the 7−2 contest, in which Read notched his first career hit <b>by</b> <b>chopping</b> an infield single deflected off the glove of pitcher Jarlin García. Inserted in the ninth inning as a defensive substitute in left field, Alejandro De Aza leaped to take a home run away from Marlins pinch-hitter Tyler Moore to end the game. Posting six shutout innings while leading the Nationals to a 2−1 victory over Miami on September 5, starter Stephen Strasburg set a new team record for consecutive innings without allowing a run, at 26. Washington finished off the series with an 8−1 rout of the Marlins, their eighth victory against their second-place division rival in a row, in front of a crowd Reuters estimated at fewer than 800 at first pitch on September 6, with Hurricane Irma bearing down on South Florida and an evacuation order in place. Rookie Dillon Peters, starting on the mound for the Marlins, received his first career decision with the loss. Zimmerman homered off Peters on a count of three balls and no strikes, the first time in his 12-year major league career he had notched a hit in that count.|$|E

500|$|Civilian units, called [...] "villagers", {{are used}} to gather resources; they are either male or female—gender does not affect their abilities. Resources {{can be used to}} train units, {{construct}} buildings, and research technologies, among other things; for example, players can research better armour for infantry units. The game offers four types of resources: food, wood, gold, and stone. Food is obtained by hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, and shore fishing and fishing from boats. Wood is gathered <b>by</b> <b>chopping</b> down trees. Gold is obtained from either gold mines, trade or collecting relics in a monastery, and stone is collected from stone mines. Villagers require checkpoints, typically depository buildings (town center, mining camp, mill, and lumber yard), where they can store gathered resources.|$|E
500|$|The {{problems}} with the Barbary states had never gone away, and on 10 May 1801 the Tripolitans declared war on the United States <b>by</b> <b>chopping</b> down the flag {{in front of the}} American Embassy, which began the First Barbary War. [...] was captured by the Moors, but then set on fire in an American raid led by Stephen Decatur. The Marines invaded the [...] "shores of Tripoli" [...] in 1805, capturing the city of Derna, the first time the U.S. flag ever flew over a foreign conquest. This act was enough to induce the Barbary rulers to sign peace treaties. Subsequently, the Navy was greatly reduced for reasons of economy, and instead of regular ships, many gunboats were built, intended for coastal use only. This policy proved completely ineffective within a decade.|$|E
500|$|John Baldwin {{was born}} in Branford, Connecticut on 13 October 1799 to Joseph Baldwin and Rosanna Malley. His mother was a well-educated woman, as well as {{intensely}} religious. She attempted to become a student at Yale University, but was not allowed {{because she was a}} woman. Due to this, John resolved to make no distinction between races or sexes should he ever found a school. His father enlisted in the Continental Army during the American Revolution as a private and left as a captain. When John turned eighteen, he joined the Methodist Church. As a student at a private school, he paid his way <b>by</b> <b>chopping</b> firewood, ringing the bell, and building fires. Afterwards, he became a teacher in Fishkill, New York, Maryland, and Litchfield, Connecticut. As a teacher in Maryland, his stance on slavery, as well as black people as a whole, was revealed. A mulatto boy was sent to his school daily as a servant for his master's son. Baldwin began to teach them in common. When the student's father found out about this, he demanded Baldwin not teach him any more, to which he replied, [...] "I do not charge anything for teaching him" [...] and continued to teach him.|$|E

2500|$|The larynx {{is a major}} (but not the only) {{source of}} sound in speech, {{generating}} sound through the rhythmic opening and closing of the vocal folds. [...] To oscillate, the vocal folds are brought near enough together such that air pressure builds up beneath the larynx. [...] The folds are pushed apart by this increased subglottal pressure, with the inferior part of each fold leading the superior part. Such a wave-like motion causes a transfer of energy from the airflow to the fold tissues. Under the correct conditions, the energy transferred to the tissues {{is large enough to}} overcome losses by dissipation and the oscillation pattern will sustain itself. [...] In essence, sound is generated in the larynx <b>by</b> <b>chopping</b> up a steady flow of air into little puffs of sound waves.|$|E
2500|$|Despite PAW's ad {{campaign}} promising grand views and stunning scenery, riders were often disappointed to discover [...] that {{the views of}} Saanich Inlet were largely obscured by thick old growth forest along most of the route's right of way.

Questions were also raised about the Malahat being chosen as the northern terminus, due to its isolation [...] Apart from a crude shelter/platform that Rowland built in the wilderness with untreated lumber, the terminus lacked even basic service such as refreshments or washrooms. The nearest location that offered these services was a tiny gas station over 10 kilometers away.|$|E

2500|$|The Elstree sets {{designed}} by John Barry, according to Gilbert Taylor, [...] "were like a coal mine".

His idea was supported by the Fox studio, which agreed that [...] "we couldn't have this 'black hole of Calcutta. The lighting approach Taylor devised [...] "allowed George to shoot in almost any direction without extensive relighting, which gave him more freedom."

2500|$|There {{are four}} major {{resources}} in Age of Mythology: food, wood, gold, and unlike previous games by Ensemble Studios, this game {{does not include}} the stone resource. Resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies, among other things. Civilian units—namely, the Greek villagers, Norse gatherers and dwarfs, the Egyptian laborers, and fishing boats—are used to gather resources. Hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, and fishing are all methods by which food can be gathered. Wood is gathered only <b>by</b> <b>chopping</b> down trees, and gold is gathered from either gold mines or from trade. Players can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Favor is acquired in different ways by different cultures: Greek players gain it by having villagers pray at temples; Egyptian players earn it by building monuments; and Norse players receive it by fighting/hunting animals or by possessing heroes. Resources can be exchanged at a player's market, with the exception of favor.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{starting}} his speech, Aristophanes warns {{the group that}} his eulogy to love may be more absurd than funny. His speech is an explanation of why people in love say they feel [...] "whole" [...] when they have found their love partner. He begins by explaining that people must understand human nature before they can interpret the origins of love and how it affects their own times. This is, he says, because in primal times people had double bodies, with faces and limbs turned away from one another. As [...] spherical creatures who wheeled around like clowns doing cartwheels (190a), these original people were very powerful. There were three sexes: the all male, the all female, and the [...] "androgynous," [...] who was half male, half female. The males {{were said to have}} descended from the sun, the females from the earth and the androgynous couples from the moon. These creatures tried to scale the heights of Olympus and planned to set upon the gods (190b-c). [...] Zeus thought about blasting them [...] with thunderbolts, but did not want to deprive himself of their devotions and offerings, so he decided to cripple them <b>by</b> <b>chopping</b> them in half, in effect separating the two bodies.|$|E
