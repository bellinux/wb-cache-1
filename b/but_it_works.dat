[...] So you'd put it on, and {{not only did it}} work, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> on so many different levels— and it allows you to figure out who the guy is. Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve. There's flamboyance, there's real risk-taking, but when I walk into the room, it's not flashy. It's actually very subtle.

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from Selective Hearing {{was positive}} in his review. They praised {{the production and}} BoA's English pronunciation, stating [...] "The production {{as a whole has}} a bit of en edge to it which is a slight departure from the typical BoA song <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>works...</b> Her pronunciation is miles above the English in her older songs. Her vocals are as strong as ever and even when the vocal effects are laid on thick her voice doesn’t get drowned in them. You can still hear her clearly." [...] Overall, the reviewer felt it was a great debut track for the North American audience. Asian Junkie member Random J reviewed the song on his personal blog site, and his response was mixed. He felt the song was [...] "boring" [...] and [...] "bog standard" [...] upon its release. However, he stated, [...] "But in comparison {{to the rest of the}} album, the song is actually rather decent and a highlight. A definite grower." ...|$|E
500|$|Kallie Plagge at IGN remarked how the remaster wasn't as revolutionary a {{game when}} {{compared}} with the original, and that certain aspects, such as the pacing and level design, felt notably dated. She praised the range of visual and technical improvements compared with other remasters, but criticized some minor shortcomings with regards to both graphical and design elements, saying [...] "there are cracks in the facade; a checkpoint-triggered cloud of smoke {{near the end of the}} campaign was jarringly rough around the edges, for instance, and there were times when I'd get momentarily stuck on the geometry of a door and unceremoniously shoved to the side by a scripted ally charging through." [...] Despite this, she complimented the gameplay as having held up remarkably well and which felt more gratifying as a result of being unaltered, stating how it left her [...] "feeling relatively weighed down, encumbered, and more desperate in the fray. [...] It feels urgent, and it's still really satisfying even next to a contemporary, faster CoD." [...] She thought the game felt more classic rather than outdated, saying that [...] "It might not have the same effect it did the first time around, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> as both a great embodiment of what shooters used to be and one that still plays well." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was divided, as reviews ranged from largely positive to negative. In the book The End and the Beginning: The Official Guide to The X-Files, Vol. 5, author Andy Meisler {{noted that some}} fans and critics responded positively to [...] "The Beginning," [...] most notably because the episode functioned as [...] "a particularly artful and effective way to launch the series's new season—and era." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying [...] "'The Beginning' {{was a pretty good}} premiere episode. I was quite pleased to see how Chris Carter took last season's finale and the movie and tied things together to get Season 6 off to a fresh start." [...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club gave it a B. He praised the performance of Chris Owens, noting that he was [...] "acting the shit out of Spender". Despite this, however he called the episode [...] "lackluster" [...] and noted that it [...] "isn’t a great episode of the show, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> well enough". VanDerWerff's main issue with the entry was that it chose to close off the events of the fifth season finale, but did little to expand upon the revelations of the series' feature film. VanDerWerff also criticized the fact that Scully was, once again, a skeptic in the paranormal after all she saw.|$|E
500|$|... "The Call of the Simpsons" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, both criticized and praised the episode saying: [...] "This episode is a bit less {{than the sum of its}} parts. The early stuff at the RV Round-Up is much better than the main camping story, although there's some nice Marge-Lisa bonding, and who could resist Maggie and the bears?" [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5, adding [...] "the surrealism of Homer as bigfoot is a major misstep. This type of gag would be very different today, if done at all." [...] Jon Bonné at MSNBC called the episode [...] "a perfect example of the first season’s bizarre and fruitful balance between edgy humor and softly-drawn neuroses" [...] and stated that [...] "it was this combination that made Groening’s shorts for the Ullman show so compelling, and ultimately what made it possible for The Simpsons to break the molds of network television." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "while [...] doesn’t offer the continuous highs of the best Simpsons, it’s a generally solid show" [...] and added that [...] "the episode uses a wackier tone than usual for this era, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>works,</b> and the program is consistently fun".|$|E

2500|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A-, saying, [...] "I'll save you the worry: it's good.

2500|$|Within {{reach of}} children, {{there is an}} Iron Age beehive quern-stone with {{removable}} wooden handle and plenty of grain for grinding. [...] Visitors are invited {{to look at a}} drawing of the inner structure of the object, and to try to work out how to grind the corn. [...] When turning the headstone, you can feel how the grain lessens the friction enough for the headstone to turn easily, while the roughness of the stone continues to provide enough friction to grind the corn: a paradox perhaps, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>works.</b> [...] However, to allow entry of grain, the central wooden spindle of a quern-stone is by necessity very loosely fitted {{through the hole in the}} headstone, which means that the headstone can move sideways, and young children's fingers must be supervised.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 Bourke and Gerrard {{were asked}} by Italian {{director}} Ivana Massetti to contribute music to Nadro, a French documentary on West African visual artist, poet and author, Frederic Bruly Bouabre. Two tracks from the score were included on [...] "The Human Game" [...] CD single: [...] "Awakening" [...] and [...] "Jungabya". In 1999 Bourke and Gerrard composed the soundtrack for the film, The Insider by American director, Michael Mann. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated their score was [...] "eerie and haunting, somewhere between ambient and new age, but always evocative and cinematic. This {{may be a}} strange choice for a seemingly dry journalism tale, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> terrifically and gives {{a good sense of}} how unusual and unpredictable The Insider is". In January 2000 the film received three Golden Globe Award nominations, including 'Best Original Score' for Bourke and Gerrard. In 2001 Bourke and Gerrard scored Mann’s next film, a bio-pic about World Boxing Champion, Muhammad Ali. In January 2002 the film, Ali, also received a Golden Globe Award nomination for 'Best Original Score'.|$|E

After admitting that No Man's Land is a [...] "haunting weird play" [...] that he himself [...] "can never fully understand – Who can? – <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> on you", he reviews the genesis of the play's first line ("As it is?"), which came to Pinter in a taxicab while riding home from dinner out alone, and the thematic significance of the titular metaphorical phrase no man's land, and finds [...] "something of Pinter" [...] in both of the main characters, each one a writer whom Pinter may have to some degree feared becoming: one [...] "with all the trappings of success but [...] is inured by fame, wealth, comfort" [...] (Hirst); the other, [...] "the struggling, marginal, the pin-striped writer" [...] who [...] "does not make it" [...] (Spooner); though when Billington put his theory to Pinter, Pinter said (jokingly), [...] "Well, yes, maybe; but I've never had two-man servants named Foster and Briggs." ...|$|E

Sebastian also received nominations for Most Popular Australian Artist, Most Popular Australian Album, and Most popular Australian Single for [...] "Like It Like That" [...] and [...] "Art of Love. The album received many positive reviews. Paul Cashmere from Undercover Music wrote, [...] "By covering the classics on The Memphis Album Guy Sebastian discovered Guy Sebastian. He has drawn from that epitome and created what should be considered the debut album from the next phase of his career. [...] If The Memphis Album was Guy's initiation into becoming a Soul Man then Like It Like That is the graduation. Ara Jansen said in The West Australian, [...] "While there are plenty of pop elements to the album, Sebastian has finally and unabashedly unleashed his soul side. He's also done it with a big grin on his face as songs such as the wonderful [...] "Magic" [...] and the title track fizz like a soft drink on a hot day." [...] A reviewer for TV Central wrote, [...] "There's no doubt in anyone's mind that Sebastian's previous 'Memphis' record has inspired him like no other. From the first beat of his new album, it screams soul. It's bold, brash, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>works</b> — it really works. It's {{probably one of the most}} cohesive albums from Sebastian to date. Listening from start to finish, you truly feel like you’ve experienced a musical journey. [...] The album, while not without its flaws, is definitely one of the most artistically complex records we've heard from an 'Australian Idol' artist to date.
