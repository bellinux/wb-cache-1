40|$|This paper explores United States {{high school}} <b>booster</b> club {{activity}} {{and its potential}} effect on gender equity by examining high schools’ <b>booster</b> club models – one all-school, all-sport <b>booster</b> club or a <b>booster</b> club for each sport – and club reporting requirements. The U. S. Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972 prohibits schools from discriminating {{on the basis of}} sex in any educational program. However, schools can escape compliance by allowing each sport to have its own <b>booster</b> club, a model which heavily favors boys’ sports, coupled with an absence of club reporting requirements to school district officials. All 414 Wisconsin public high schools’ athletic directors were surveyed in September 2015 on <b>booster</b> club activities. A quarter of high schools do not require their <b>booster</b> clubs to report their activities to a school district official, and only 46 % have one all-sport <b>booster</b> club. Factors that predict <b>booster</b> club model were identified. Federal laws on gender equity may be undermined by <b>booster</b> clubs. Solutions include requiring the public release of <b>booster</b> club expenditures and an adoption of one all-sport <b>booster</b> club...|$|R

5|$|Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) was a German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) project {{concept to}} develop a {{reusable}} liquid rocket booster for Ariane 5 in order to significantly reduce a high cost of space transportation and increase environmental friendliness. LFBB would replace existing solid rocket <b>boosters,</b> providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged <b>boosters</b> would perform an atmospheric entry, fly back autonomously to the French Guiana, and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.|$|E
5|$|The RLM had {{acquired}} {{an interest in}} rocket <b>boosters</b> fitted {{for the sake of}} simplicity below the wings of a heavily loaded bomber to cut down the length of runway needed for takeoff. Once in the air the booster canisters would be jettisoned by parachute for reuse. The firm of Hellmuth Walter, at Kiel, handled this development. The first standing trials and tests flights of the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe liquid-fueled <b>boosters</b> were held in 1937 at Neuhardenberg with test pilot Erich Warsitz at the controls of Heinkel He 111E bearing civil registration D-AMUE.|$|E
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket <b>boosters,</b> which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass steel casings for the <b>boosters.</b> These had been replaced by a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E

5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5.

5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's solid rocket <b>boosters</b> (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform.

After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank stack. The stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to Launch Complex 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was loaded into the orbiter when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready for launch was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E

5|$|After {{two years}} of poor {{attendance}} at ACC championship games in Tampa, Florida, organizers hoped moving the game to Charlotte, closer to the geographic center of the conference, would result in improved ticket sales.
