5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel springs to prevent damage from falling, she can <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E

5|$|In Albanian folklore, the dhampir is {{the hybrid}} {{child of the}} karkanxholl (a werewolf-like {{creature}} with an iron mail shirt) or the lugat (a water-dwelling ghost or monster).

The lugat cannot be seen, he can only <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> the dhampir, who himself is usually {{the son of a}} lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} Proteaceae, B.epica has proteoid roots, roots with dense {{clusters}} of short lateral rootlets that form a mat {{in the soil}} just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, so is thought to <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> fire. Like most Banksia species, however, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank following a bushfire, so populations regenerate rapidly. It is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} breeds in coniferous woodland and gardens, {{building its}} compact, three-layered nest {{on a tree}} branch. Ten to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone, and the chicks are fed by both parents; second broods are common.

5|$|Adult birds may <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> cats, little owls and sparrowhawks, {{and eggs}} and nestlings are taken by magpies, jays, and, where present, grey squirrels. As with other {{passerine}} birds, parasites are common, and include endoparasites, {{such as the}} nematode Splendidofilaria (Avifilaria) mavis whose specific name mavis derives from this thrush. A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma. Ixodes ticks are also common, and can carry pathogens, including tick-borne encephalitis in forested areas {{of central and eastern}} Europe and Russia, and, more widely, Borrelia bacteria. Some species of Borrelia cause Lyme disease, and ground-feeding birds like the song thrush may act as a reservoir for the disease.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Marge {{take the}} lizards to the Springfield Birdwatching Society.

Skinner says the lizards must <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> law, because they have killed many bird species. Bart escapes and runs away with the lizards, but before he can get away, Skinner catches up to him and they both struggle on top of the building. Suddenly, the lizards glide to the ground, where they start to eradicate pigeons in Springfield.|$|E

5|$|Both {{species have}} {{distinctive}} loud grating calls used for advertising and territorial purposes in the breeding season, although the corn crake is silent on its African wintering grounds. They are mainly active during the day; they walk with a high-stepping action, and when disturbed {{they can run}} swiftly through grass or fly a short distance to cover. Migration takes place at night, {{and the ability to}} undertake these journeys is innate, not learned from adults. The nest is a shallow cup of grass lined with finer vegetation and built in a well hidden depression. The precocial chicks leave the nest soon after hatching, and fledge after four to six weeks. These are ground-feeding omnivores, but mainly eat invertebrates. They may <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> <b>by</b> a variety of mammals and large birds, and infected by parasites.|$|E

The Natchez kept two Frenchmen alive, a carter named Mayeux who was made to carry all the goods of the French to the Great Village, and a tailor named Le Beau who was {{employed}} by the Natchez to refit the colonists' clothing to new owners. They set fire to the fort, the store, and all the homesteads, burning them to the ground.
