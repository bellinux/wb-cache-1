5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a <b>binary</b> <b>operation,</b> that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be invertible, the most general matrix groups are the groups of all invertible matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E
25|$|A ring is an {{abelian group}} with a second <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> that is associative, is {{distributive}} over the abelian group operation, and has an identity element. By extension from the integers, the abelian group operation is called addition and the second <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> is called multiplication.|$|E
25|$|Semigroups, quasigroups, and monoids are {{structures}} {{similar to}} groups, but more general. They comprise a set and a closed <b>binary</b> <b>operation,</b> {{but do not}} necessarily satisfy the other conditions. A semigroup has an associative <b>binary</b> <b>operation,</b> but might not have an identity element. A monoid is a semigroup which does have an identity but might not have an inverse for every element. A quasigroup satisfies a requirement that any element {{can be turned into}} any other by either a unique left-multiplication or right-multiplication; however the <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> might not be associative.|$|E

These flags can be tested using <b>binary</b> <b>operations</b> or with the Enum type's builtin 'HasFlag' method.|$|R
25|$|There are {{at least}} two {{structurally}} equivalent formal definitions of quasigroup. One defines a quasigroup as a set with one <b>binary</b> <b>operation,</b> and the other, from universal algebra, defines a quasigroup as having three primitive operations. The homomorphic image of a quasigroup defined with a single <b>binary</b> <b>operation,</b> however, need not be a quasigroup. We begin with the first definition.|$|E
25|$|Every {{singleton}} set {x} closed under a <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> • {{forms the}} trivial (one-element) monoid, {{which is also}} the trivial group.|$|E
25|$|Binary operations: The {{notion of}} {{addition}} (+) is abstracted {{to give a}} <b>binary</b> <b>operation,</b> ∗ say. The notion of <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> is meaningless without the set on which the operation is defined. For two elements a and b in a set S, a ∗ b is another element in the set; this condition is called closure. Addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (×), and division (÷) can be binary operations when defined on different sets, as are addition and multiplication of matrices, vectors, and polynomials.|$|E

25|$|Venn {{diagrams}} {{are helpful}} in visualizing laws. The commutativity laws for ∧ and ∨ {{can be seen}} from the symmetry of the diagrams: a <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> that was not commutative would not have a symmetric diagram because interchanging x and y would have the effect of reflecting the diagram horizontally and any failure of commutativity would then appear as a failure of symmetry.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a t-norm (also T-norm or, unabbreviated, {{triangular}} norm) {{is a kind}} of <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> used in {{the framework}} of probabilistic metric spaces and in multi-valued logic, specifically in fuzzy logic. A t-norm generalizes intersection in a lattice and conjunction in logic.

25|$|The common {{elements}} of the lattice and ring bases are the constants 0 and 1, and an associative commutative <b>binary</b> <b>operation,</b> called meet x∧y in the lattice basis, and multiplication xy in the ring basis. The distinction is only terminological. The lattice basis has the further operations of join, x∨y, and complement, ¬x. The ring basis has instead the arithmetic operation x⊕y of addition (the symbol ⊕ is used in preference to + because the latter is sometimes given the Boolean reading of join).|$|E

25|$|In {{mathematics}} and vector algebra, the cross product or vector product (occasionally directed area product {{to emphasize the}} geometric significance) is a <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> on two vectors in three-dimensional space (R3) and is denoted by the symbol ×. Given two linearly independent vectors a and b, the cross product, a × b, is a vector that is perpendicular to both a and b and thus normal to the plane containing them. It has many applications in mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer programming. It {{should not be confused}} with dot product (projection product).|$|E
25|$|One change we did {{not need}} to make as part of this {{interchange}} was to complement. We say that complement is a self-dual operation. The identity or do-nothing operation x (copy the input to the output) is also self-dual. A more complicated example of a self-dual operation is (x∧y) ∨ (y∧z) ∨ (z∧x). There is no self-dual <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> that depends on both its arguments. A composition of self-dual operations is a self-dual operation. For example, if f(x, y, z) = (x∧y) ∨ (y∧z) ∨ (z∧x), then f(f(x, y, z), x, t) is a self-dual operation of four arguments x,y,z,t.|$|E
25|$|Now {{what is an}} atom? Conventionally an atom {{is either}} a {{constant}} (0 or 1) or a variable x'i where 0 ≤ i < n. For the proof technique here it is convenient to define atoms instead to be n-ary operations n'f'i, which although treated here as atoms nevertheless mean the same as ordinary terms of the exact form n'f'i(x0,...,x'n-1) (exact in that the variables must listed in the order shown without repetition or omission). This is not a restriction because atoms of this form include all the ordinary atoms, namely the constants 0 and 1, which arise here as the n-ary operations n'f0 and n'f−1 for each n (abbreviating 22n−1 to −1), and the variables x0,...,x'n-1 {{as can be seen}} from the truth tables where x0 appears as both the unary operation 1f2 and the <b>binary</b> <b>operation</b> 2f10 while x1 appears as 2f12.|$|E
