50|$|A {{credential}} is a physical/tangible object, a {{piece of}} knowledge, or a facet of a person's physical being that enables an individual access to a given physical facility or computer-based information system. Typically, credentials can be something a person knows (such as a number or PIN), something they have (such as an access badge), something they are (such as a <b>biometric</b> <b>feature),</b> {{or some combination of}} these items. This is known as multi-factor authentication. The typical credential is an access card or key-fob, and newer software can also turn users' smartphones into access devices.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the purpose}} of recognition, the {{biometric}} data subject (the person to be recognized) presents his or her biometric characteristics to the biometric capture device, which generates a recognition biometric sample. [...] From this recognition biometric sample the <b>biometric</b> <b>feature</b> extraction software creates biometric features which are compared with one or multiple biometric templates from the biometric enrolment database. Due to the statistical nature of biometric samples there is generally no exact match possible. For that reason, the decision process will only assign the biometric data subject to a biometric template and confirm recognition if the comparison score exceeds an adjustable threshold.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBiometric {{templates}} {{are often}} used in intelligent human computer interaction systems that include automated access control and personalization of user interaction. The effectiveness of biometric systems is directly linked with aging that causes modifications on <b>biometric</b> <b>features.</b> For example the long term performance of person identification systems decreases as biometric templates derived from aged subjects may display substantial differences when compared to reference templates whereas in age estimation, aging variation allows the age of a subject to be estimated. In this paper we attempt to quantify the effects of aging for different biometric modalities facilitating in that way the design of systems that use <b>biometric</b> <b>features.</b> In this context the homogeneity of statistical distributions of <b>biometric</b> <b>features</b> belonging to certain age classes is quantified enabling in that way the definition of age sensitive and age invariant <b>biometric</b> <b>features.</b> Experimental results demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} method in quantifying aging effects...|$|R

50|$|The {{currently}} standardized biometrics {{used for}} this type of identification system are facial recognition, fingerprint recognition, and iris recognition. These were adopted after assessment of several different kinds of biometrics including retinal scan. Document and chip characteristics are documented in the International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Doc 9303. The ICAO defines the biometric file formats and communication protocols to be used in passports. Only the digital image (usually in JPEG or JPEG2000 format) of each <b>biometric</b> <b>feature</b> is actually stored in the chip. The comparison of biometric features is performed outside the passport chip by electronic border control systems (e-borders). To store biometric data on the contactless chip, it includes a minimum of 32 kilobytes of EEPROM storage memory, and runs on an interface in accordance with the ISO/IEC 14443 international standard, amongst others. These standards intend interoperability between different countries and different manufacturers of passport books.|$|E

An example of this method is shown for iris templates processed using Principal-Component Analysis- (PCA-) and Independent-Component Analysis- (ICA-) based feature decomposition schemes. From this, the <b>biometric</b> <b>feature</b> information is calculated to be approximately 278 [*]bits for PCA and 288 [*]bits for ICA iris features using Masek's iris recognition scheme. This value approximately matches previous estimates of iris information content...|$|E
30|$|In {{the first}} study that investigates the invertibility of a {{biometric}} hashing algorithm, {{it was assumed that}} the biohash of a user and the corresponding random projection matrix are available to an adversary. Each dimension of the biohash vector was mapped to the set {− 1, 1 } (by mapping [0]→[− 1] and [1]→[1]) and the resulting vector was multiplied with the pseudo-inverse of the random projection matrix. A new biohash created from the estimated <b>biometric</b> <b>feature</b> vector was used to perform imposter attacks. A similar approach that uses the pseudo inverse of a random projection matrix was also presented in [17]. In [18], a new method was proposed to generate a <b>biometric</b> <b>feature</b> from biohashes using genetic algorithms. For each biohash in a database, the proposed genetic algorithm was applied to approximate the value of the <b>biometric</b> <b>feature</b> given the corresponding secret key.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an approach}} to measure the information content of a <b>biometric</b> <b>feature</b> repre-sentation. We define biometric information as the decrease in uncertainty about {{the identity of a}} person due to a set of biometric measurements. We then show that the <b>biometric</b> <b>feature</b> information for a person may be calculated by the relative entropy D(p�q) between the population feature distribution q and the person’s feature distribution p. The biometric information for a system is the mean D(p�q) for all persons in the population. In order to practically measure D(p�q) with limited data samples, we introduce an algorithm which regularizes a Gaussian model of the feature covariances. An example of this method is shown for PCA and Fisher linear discriminant (FLD) based face recognition, with <b>biometric</b> <b>feature</b> information calculated to be 45. 0 bits (PCA), 37. 0 bits (FLD) and 55. 6 bits (fusion of PCA and FLD features).

40|$|In {{the real-life}} scenario, obtaining {{transformation}} invariant feature extraction is a challenging task in Computer Vision.
