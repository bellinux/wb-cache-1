5|$|Adams {{returned}} to management in April 1999 with Division Three team Brighton & Hove Albion. The club {{were in the}} middle of a financial crisis, which had seen the board sell the Goldstone Ground just to stay afloat; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status. His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker Bobby Zamora. The £100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in <b>building</b> <b>his</b> squad.|$|E

5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an {{expensive}} and painstaking process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} his modest garage, and <b>building</b> <b>his</b> own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E
5|$|He {{served in}} the Clay Center Kansas National Guard and in that {{capacity}} was called to assist in crowd safety {{at one of the}} popular flying demonstrations in Topeka in June 1910. Longren's interest in aircraft was ignited after he witnessed the featured airplane spin out shortly after takeoff and crash to the ground.

5|$|John Gaughan, an American {{manufacturer}} of equipment for magicians based in Los Angeles, spent $120,000 <b>building</b> <b>his</b> {{own version of}} Kempelen's machine {{over a five-year period}} from 1984. The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a computer running a chess program.|$|E

5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office <b>building</b> <b>his</b> law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious nationwide and in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Johnson's {{future was}} {{uncertain}} {{because his father}} was deeply in debt. To earn money, Johnson began to stitch books for his father, {{and it is likely}} that Johnson spent much time in his father's bookshop reading and <b>building</b> <b>his</b> literary knowledge. The family remained in poverty until Sarah Johnson's cousin, Elizabeth Harriotts, died in February 1728 and left enough money to send Johnson to university. On 31 October 1728, a few weeks after he turned 19, Johnson entered Pembroke College, Oxford. The inheritance did not cover all of his expenses at Pembroke, but Andrew Corbet, a friend and fellow student at Pembroke, offered to make up the deficit.|$|E
5|$|In the 1923 season, {{under the}} eye of the county's coach, James Iremonger, Larwood {{concentrated}} on <b>building</b> <b>his</b> physique and on learning bowling skills. He grew a few inches in height, although he remained short for a fast bowler, and under Iremonger's regime of diet and exercise he gained weight. Besides his physical development, he learned by incessant practice various bowling arts, among them accuracy in line and length, variation of pace and grip, and deviating the ball in the air to produce swing. That year he played intermittently for the county's Second XI, and in a match against Lancashire Seconds took 8 wickets for 44 runs.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{eventually}} {{concentrated on}} the field of law, starting with work on wills and deeds. By 1933, he was senior partner in a 20-man Midtown Manhattan law firm. He developed the business habits of smoking cigars and of answering questions only after taking two puffs. During the Great Depression, O'Malley represented bankrupt companies and enriched himself, while <b>building</b> <b>his</b> thriving law practice. He invested wisely in firms such as the Long Island Rail Road, Brooklyn Borough Gas Company, the New York Subways Advertising Company, a building materials firm, a beer firm and some hotels. His success begot both influence and attention. The Brooklyn Democratic Machine powers such as judge Henry Ughetta and Brooklyn Trust Company president George Vincent McLaughlin were among those who noticed the rising O'Malley.|$|E

5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives {{parked in front of the}} <b>building.</b> <b>His</b> co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{was rarely}} in London, EdwardI {{undertook}} an expensive remodelling of the Tower, costing £21,000 between 1275 and 1285, over double that {{spent on the}} castle during the whole of HenryIII's reign. EdwardI was a seasoned castle builder, and used his experience of siege warfare during the crusades to bring innovations to castle <b>building.</b> <b>His</b> programme of castle building in Wales heralded {{the introduction of the}} widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. At the Tower of London, Edward filled in the moat dug by HenryIII and built a new curtain wall along its line, creating a new enclosure. A new moat was created in front of the new curtain wall. The western part of HenryIII's curtain wall was rebuilt, with Beauchamp Tower replacing the castle's old gatehouse. A new entrance was created, with elaborate defences including two gatehouses and a barbican. In an effort to make the castle self-sufficient, EdwardI also added two watermills. Six hundred Jews were imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1278, charged with coin clipping. Persecution of the country's Jewish population under Edward began in 1276 and culminated in 1290 when he issued the Edict of Expulsion, forcing the Jews out of the country.|$|E
5|$|As {{teacher and}} player, Byard was renowned for his {{knowledge}} of the history of jazz piano. This meant that some aspiring young musicians sought him out as a teacher. One of these was pianist Jason Moran, who described their first meeting, at a performance by the Apollo Stompers: Jaki had all these toys and whistles and bells and things that he was playing from the piano, and also screaming and yelling from the piano in joy. I remember thinking, 'This guy's out of his mind.' After the set, I went up to him, introduced myself, and said that I would be studying with him. He said something to the effect of, 'get ready'. Moran studied with Byard for four years, and credits the older man with developing his skills, <b>building</b> <b>his</b> awareness of jazz history, and creating his willingness to experiment with different styles. Another student, Fred Hersch, reported that Byard was both organized and chaotic as a teacher: giving his students worksheets and having them study early stride piano, but also behaving eccentrically and missing lessons. Classical composer Bruce Wolosoff was taught by Byard at the New England Conservatory and counts him as an important influence.|$|E

5|$|Bolstered {{by some of}} his successes, in 1940 Narayan {{tried his}} hand at a journal, Indian Thought. With {{the help of his}} uncle, a car salesman, Narayan managed to get more than a {{thousand}} subscribers in Madras city alone. However, the venture did not last long due to Narayan's inability to manage it, and it ceased publication within a year. His first collection of short stories, Malgudi Days, was published in November 1942, followed by The English Teacher in 1945. In between, being cut off from England due to the war, Narayan started his own publishing company, naming it (again) Indian Thought Publications; the publishing company was a success and is still active, now managed by his granddaughter. Soon, with a devoted readership stretching from New York to Moscow, Narayan's books started selling well and in 1948 he started <b>building</b> <b>his</b> own house on the outskirts of Mysore; the house was completed in 1953. Around this period, Narayan wrote the screenplay for the Gemini Studios film Miss Malini (1947), which remained the only screenplay by him that was successfully adapted into a feature film.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had long}} been an {{acquaintance}} of John Fitch, the first to build a steamboat in the United States, and the two had worked together on steam projects. The Oruktor Amphibolos was Evans's lone attempt at <b>building</b> <b>his</b> own steamboat powered by a high-pressure engine and Evans himself was often vague in appraising its capabilities. Yet Robert Fulton had found success with the North River Steamboat on the Hudson River in 1807, and thereafter steamboats became a reality. Although he used low-pressure engines, Fulton had in 1812 contacted Evans {{about the possibility of}} using Evans's engines, though that correspondence did not lead to the implementation of any of Evans's designs for Fulton's steamships. The Mississippi and tributaries experienced far stronger currents than eastern counterparts, and low-pressure steamboats lacked the power to counteract these. The Enterprise was the first viable steamboat to run on these rivers, and its designer Daniel French employed an adapted Evans' engine for the purpose. High-pressure engines became the standard on the Mississippi, though relatively few of those were actually built by the Pittsburgh works as Evans' patent on high-pressure engines was not widely enforced, and many other engine shops opened on the Mississippi that freely adapted Evans' designs for their own purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Bastille {{remained}} {{a powerful and}} evocative symbol for French republicans throughout the 19th century. Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the French First Republic {{that emerged from the}} Revolution in 1799, and subsequently attempted to marginalise the Bastille as a symbol. Napoleon was unhappy with the revolutionary connotations of the Place de la Bastille, and initially considered <b>building</b> <b>his</b> Arc de Triomphe on the site instead. This proved an unpopular option and so instead he planned the construction of a huge, bronze statue of an imperial elephant. The project was delayed, eventually indefinitely, and all that was constructed was a large plaster version of the bronze statue, which stood on the former site of the Bastille between 1814 and 1846, when the decaying structure was finally removed. After the restoration of the French Bourbon monarchy in 1815, the Bastille became an underground symbol for Republicans. The July Revolution in 1830, used images such as the Bastille to legitimise their new regime and in 1833, the former site of the Bastille was used to build the July Column to commemorate the revolution. The short-lived Second Republic was symbolically declared in 1848 on the former revolutionary site.|$|E
