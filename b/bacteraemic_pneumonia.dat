40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The role of cytokines in the {{pathogenesis}} of pneumonia is still poorly understood. In a previous study the diagnostic value of measuring blood concentrations of interleukin 6 and interferon gamma was established. In the present study the value of blood concentrations of interleukin 8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and lactoferrin as markers of <b>bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> is evaluated. METHODS [...] The circulating concentrations of interleukin 8 (IL- 8), granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and lactoferrin were measured in 14 patients with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia and 49 patients with atypical pneumonia or influenza A infection using enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS [...] Serum G-CSF concentrations {{were higher in the}} group with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, and G-CSF values correlated with the white blood cell count and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). The levels of IL- 8 were higher in the group with bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia than the groups with Chlamydia pneumonia, Legionella pneumonia, or influenza A infection, but there was no difference when compared with the group with Mycoplasma pneumonia. A white blood cell count of > 15 x 10 (9) /l was highly suggestive of <b>bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia.</b> The concentrations of lactoferrin were raised in all groups except those with influenza A infection, but no difference was found between the different aetiological groups.

40|$|Community {{acquired}} pneumonia (CAP) is {{the most}} commonly occurring infectious disease that requires hospital admission. CAP affects mainly, the youngest, the oldest, the poorest and the sickest. Annual incidence is 5 - 12 per 1000 adults. Between 20 % and 40 % of patients with CAP need in-hospital treatment. Mortality is below 1 % {{among those who are}} treated in the community, however in-hospital mortality can be as high as 50 % in patients who are critically ill due to CAP. In Europe the annual costs from pneumonia is estimated to be more than € 10 billion. Streptococcus pneumonia is the main aetiology of CAP, as well as it carries the highest fatality rate. In the preantibiotic era the observed death toll from <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia</b> could reach, and even exceed, 80 %. Today, with access to effective antibiotics the observed fatality rate from <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia</b> usually varies between 5 % and 25 %. In paper 1, 460 patients were included, from five centres in five countries, in a prospective multicentre study. All patients had pneumococcal bacteraemic disease and 12 % of the patients died during period of hospitalisation. Independent prognostic factors of death present on admission were age > 65 years, chronic pulmonary disease, nursing home residency, high Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, and > 2 lung lobes affected. Need for mechanical ventilation after admission was also an independent prognostic risk factor for death. In paper 2, 340 patients with pneumonia, included in paper 1, were analysed. Aim {{of the study was to}} examine if the combination of β-lactam and macrolide antibiotics could reduce the case fatality rate (CFR) in patients with <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia.</b> Despite use of univariate, as well as multivariate analysis, we were unable to find any reduction in fatality rate among patients, with bacteraemic pneumococcal CAP, who received antibiotic combination therapy. Paper 3 included 375 patients who all suffered from <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia</b> and were enrolled during two periods of time, 1993 - 1995 and 1999 - 2000. Patients enrolled during the first time period were identical with the Swedish patients who took part in the studies described in paper 1 and 2. In paper 4, 1172 patients were included from one hospital during 16 months. All patients in paper 4 had pneumonia of different microbial aetiology.

40|$|This {{epidemiological}} study examined morbidity and case fatality of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults in Belgium {{as well as}} distribution and antibiotic susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes. Adults hospitalised with microbiologically proven IPD were prospectively enrolled. The study started in 2009 with patients aged >= 50 years, whereas in 2010 and 2011, patients aged >= 18 years were included. The clinical presentation, patient profile, treatment, outcome, and mortality were recorded during hospitalisation. Outcome was also assessed one month after discharge. Of the 1, 875 patients with IPD identified, 1, 332 {{were included in the}} analysis. <b>Bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> affecting 1, 049 of the patients, was the most frequent IPD type (79 %), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer were the main comorbidities. One-third of patients required admission to intensive care unit. A total of 208 (16 %) patients died during hospitalisation and an additional 21 (2 %) within one month after discharge.

Methods Population-based case-control study that included 88 case patients over 60 years-old with a laboratory-confirmed IPD (<b>bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> meningitis or sepsis) and 176 outpatient control subjects who were matched by primary care centre, age, sex and risk stratum. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for vaccination were calculated using conditional logistic regression, controlling for underlying conditions. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated as (1 - OR) × 100. Results Pneumococcal vaccination rate {{was significantly lower}} in cases than in control subjects (38. 6 % vs 59. 1 %; p = 0. 002). The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 72 % (OR: 0. 28; 95 % CI: 0. 15 - 0. 54) against all IPD and 77 % (OR: 0. 23; 95 % CI: 0. 08 - 0. 60) against vaccine-type IPD. Vaccination was significantly effective against all IPD in both age groups: 60 - 79 years-old (OR 0. 32; 95 % CI: 0. 14 - 0. 74) and people 80 years or older (OR: 0. 29; 95 % CI: 0. 09 - 0. 91).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness {{in relation to}} the efficacy of PCV- 13 among elderly (both the total population and those at increased risk) aged 65 years and older for the The Netherlands, for various levels of efficacy assumed. METHODS: Our previously published cost-effectiveness model was updated to include, age-specific epidemiological data and health care utilization and costs for a hypothetical cohort of elderly aged over 65 years {{of the population of the}} The Netherlands. This cohort was followed twice- once as unvaccinated and once as a vaccinated cohort- over a time period of 5 years. Outcome measures included costs, life-years (LYs), qualityadjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs). All analyses were performed from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Vaccination remained well below the € 80, 000 per LY except if the vaccine was only assumed to be protective against <b>bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> with a relatively low effectiveness (40 %) in combination with a high vaccine price (€ 65) and indirect effects of serotype replacement would largely offset the direct effect of vaccination. For various assumptions, introduction PCV- 13 (assuming a 60 % efficacy against invasive and non invasive disease due to vaccine serotypes, and a cost of € 50 per vaccinated person) the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio varies over from cost-saving to € 50, 676 per LY. More probable scenarios generated cost-effectiveness ratios which would be labeled as cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: In the The Netherlands, vaccination with PCV- 13 is likely to be considered cost-effective both for the total and for the high-risk population over 65 years of age from a societal perspective over a five-year time horizon.

Design Economic evaluation using a cohort model {{from the perspective of}} healthcare providers. Setting England. Participants People aged 2 years and older at increased risk of invasive pneumococcal disease due to chronic kidney disease; splenic dysfunction; HIV infection; a compromised immune system; chronic heart, liver, or respiratory disease; or diabetes. Main outcome measures Costs, gains in life years and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios. Results Increasing indirect protection resulting from the vaccination programme of infants using the 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine means that the burden of disease preventable by targeting high risk groups will diminish in time. Under base case assumptions-that is, no overall impact on non <b>bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> in high risk groups and assuming the high risk vaccination programme would be launched two to three years after the infant programme-the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was estimated to be more than 30 pound 000 ((sic) 37 216; $ 48 210) per QALY gained for most risk groups. If, however, the vaccine does not offer protection against non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia or the vaccine was introduced concomitantly with the infant 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccination programme then vaccinating high risk people would (more) likely be cost effective. Sensitivity analyses showed that the cost effectiveness was particularly sensitive to assumed herd benefits and vaccine efficacy estimates. Conclusion Under base case assumptions it is unlikely that a pneumococcal vaccination programme aimed at risk groups could be considered cost effective. Uncertainty could be substantially reduced by establishing the effectiveness of the 13 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against non-bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia, particularly in at risk groups...|$|E

Severity scores were calculated and the independent prognostic importance of different variables was analysed by multiple regression analyses. PSI oIV, CURB- 65 o 2, and the presence of one major or more than one minor risk factor in mATS all had a high sensitivity, but somewhat lower specificity for predicting death and ICU need. The death rate was 12 % (13 out of 114). Severity score and treatment in departments other than the Dept of Infectious Diseases were the only factors independently correlated to death. Patients treated in other departments more often had severe underlying illnesses and were more severely ill on admission. However, a significant difference in death rates remained after adjustment for severity between the two groups. In conclusion, all score systems were useful for predicting the need for intensive care unit treatment and death due to bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia.

Polymorphonuclear leucocytes (neutrophils) are considered to have {{a key role in}} the host's defence against Streptococcus pneumoniae but the mechanisms by which they kill the pneumococcus remain unclear. As reactive oxygen species are regarded as a major antimicrobial defence of phagocytes an attempt has been made to establish their role in the response of neutrophils to S pneumoniae. METHODS [...] S pneumoniae isolated from patients with <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia</b> were incubated with neutrophils in suspension and superoxide production was measured by reduction of ferricytochrome c. RESULTS [...] S pneumoniae did not stimulate superoxide production alone or in the presence of normal human serum. Spontaneous superoxide production by neutrophils was actually abrogated by S pneumoniae, as was the powerful respiratory burst stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate. This phenomenon depended on both the dose and the viability of the bacteria. With S pneumoniae in the logarithmic phase of growth inhibitory activity was confined to the organisms themselves but with organisms undergoing autolysis it was also present in filtered supernatants, suggesting that the inhibitory activity can be attributed to a factor released during autolysis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The GAVI Alliance {{supported}} 10 -valent {{pneumococcal conjugate vaccine}} (PCV 10) introduction in Kenya. We {{estimated the}} cost-effectiveness of introducing either PCV 10 or the 13 -valent vaccine (PCV 13) from a societal perspective and explored the incremental impact of including indirect vaccine effects. METHODS: The costs and effects of pneumococcal vaccination among infants born in Kenya in 2010 were assessed using a decision analytic model comparing PCV 10 or PCV 13, in turn, with no vaccination. Direct vaccine effects were estimated as {{a reduction in the}} incidence of pneumococcal meningitis, sepsis, <b>bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia</b> and non-bacteraemic pneumonia. Pneumococcal disease incidence was extrapolated from a population-based hospital surveillance system in Kilifi and adjustments were made for variable access to care across Kenya. We used vaccine efficacy estimates from a trial in The Gambia and accounted for serotype distribution in Kilifi. We estimated indirect vaccine protection and serotype replacement by extrapolating from the USA. Multivariable sensitivity analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo simulation. We assumed a vaccine price of US$ 3. 50 per dose. FINDINGS: The annual cost of delivering PCV 10 was approximately US$ 14 million. We projected a 42. 7 % reduction in pneumococcal disease episodes leading to a US$ 1. 97 million reduction in treatment costs and a 6. 1 % reduction in childhood mortality annually. In the base case analysis, costs per discounted DALY and per death averted by PCV 10, amounted to US$ 59 (95 % CI 26 - 103) and US$ 1, 958 (95 % CI 866 - 3, 425), respectively. PCV 13 introduction improved the cost-effectiveness ratios by approximately 20 % and inclusion of indirect effects improved cost-effectiveness ratios by 43 - 56 %. The break-even prices for introduction of PCV 10 and PCV 13 are US$ 0. 41 and 0. 51, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing either PCV 10 or PCV 13 in Kenya is highly cost-effective from a societal perspective.

40|$|Pneumococcal {{diseases}} {{are caused by}} a common bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus).  The pneumococcus bacterium has approximately 90 known serotypes, only some of which commonly cause disease.  Eleven serotypes are {{responsible for most of}} the disease in infants across the globe, with seven serotypes accounting for the majority of diseases in developed countries. The four remaining serotypes account for a significant proportion of disease in developing countries.  S. pneumoniae can be non-invasive or invasive, depending on the infection site. Non-invasive pneumococcal disease is more common and results in significant morbidity. Non-invasive disease is caused by infection of mucosal tissue, such as the upper respiratory tract, middle ear and sinuses.  This can lead to pneumonia, acute otitis media and sinusitis.   Invasive pneumococcal disease results from dissemination of bacteria into the bloodstream and central nervous system, and can lead to meningitis, bacteraemia and <b>bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia.</b>   [...] - 2 ̆ 7 Appropriately planned vegetarian diets are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain disease 2 ̆ 7.

40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae is a {{major cause}} of disease, ranging from {{uncomplicated}} respiratory infections to severe invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), including <b>bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> septicaemia with unknown focus and meningitis. Case fatality rate (CFR) remains high and antibiotic resistance is increasing globally. S. pneumoniae is surrounded by a polysaccharide capsule that can be divided into more than 90 immunologically different serotypes. Vaccination may reduce morbidity and mortality due to IPD. Two vaccine types exist: pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV- 23) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV- 7, 10, 13). The former contains 23 serotypes, but does not work in small children, whereas the latter also protects children below two years of age, but includes only 7, 10 and 13 serotypes, respectively. The aim was to explore the epidemiology of IPD before the introduction of PCV- 7 in the Swedish childhood vaccination programme, in January 2009 : serotype distribution, antimicrobial susceptibility and potential vaccine coverage among isolates causing IPD; mortality, case fatality rate and incidence of different IPD manifestations related to age and risk groups; the impact of serotype and genotype on manifestations and outcome; and finally, long-term changes in the epidemiology during 45 years. Consecutive isolates and clinical data from 836 adults and children with IPD were collected in the Västra Götaland region (VGR) and Halland during 1998 - 2001. Serotype and antibiotic susceptibility were tested. Clonal complex (CC) was determined for these isolates together with 424 IPD isolates from adults and children in Stockholm using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Clinical data for all 2977 IPD episodes in VGR during 1996 - 2008 were retrieved from hospital notes. Prevalence data for predisposing factors were included from patient registries and recent publications. Of 836 strains, 42 %, 70 %, 75 % and 94 % belonged to serotypes included in PCV- 7, - 10, - 13 and PPV- 23, respectively. Decreased susceptibility was uncommon, and largely confined to certain clones and serotypes, especially those included in PCV- 7. Serotypes 1 and 7 F were most common; they infected younger patients with less underlying disease and caused lower CFR than other serotypes, whereas 19 A caused higher CFR. Clonal distribution differed between adults and children. CC 306 (all serotype 1), caused lower CFR among adults than six other CCs. The relation between serotype and CC was complicated; clinical characteristics differed between some CCs within the same serotype and between some serotypes within the same CC; it was often difficult to determine whether these differences were related to serotype, CC or both. The annual incidence of IPD was 15 / 100, 000 and varied largely with age and underlying disease. It was highest at extremes of age and in patients with myeloma (2238 / 100, 000), followed by chronic lymphatic leukemia, haemodialysis, lung cancer, HIV, rheumatic diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus. In contrast, it was not elevated among asthma patients. When compared with data from previous studies during 45 years, the incidence increased threefold and the CFR dropped from 20 to 10 % for all IPD, whereas the incidence remained stable (1. 1 / 100, 000 /year) and the CFR dropped from 33 to 13 % for meningitis. In conclusion, incidence and CFR have changed considerably over time and vary widely between different age and risk groups. CFR is also influenced by serotype and genotype. These factors have to be considered during planning and evaluation of vaccination against pneumococci...|$|E

We compared {{the accuracy of the}} Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), the CURB- 65 and CRB- 65 score, the modified-American Thoracic Society score (ATS), the IDSA/ATS guidelines and the Pitt Bacteraemia score (PBS) in evaluating severity of illness in 766 patients with <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia.</b> We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity, the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) and the accuracy of the classification in predicting 14 -day mortality. The PSI and the IDSA/ATS guidelines were the most sensitive whereas the PBS and modified-ATS scoring systems were the most specific in predicting mortality. The NPV was comparable for all four scoring systems (all above 90 %), but the PPV was highest for PBS (54. 2 %) and lowest for PSI (23. 2 %). The predictive accuracy and discriminating power as measured by the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was highest for the PBS. Both the modified-ATS and the PBS scoring systems identified those patients who might benefit most from intensified care and monitoring. The PBS and modified-ATS proved superior to the IDSA/ATS guidelines, CURB- 65 and CRB- 65 with respect to their specificity and PPV. The low PPV of the PSI rendered it not usable as a parameter for decision-making in severely-ill patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLevofloxacin {{susceptibility}} {{testing was}} carried out {{for a total of}} 2539 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates obtained from January 2001 to February 2008 at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) and a further 228 pneumococcal isolates obtained from January 2004 to December 2006 at three other hospitals in different geographical areas in Taiwan. Levofloxacin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates were subsequently analysed for serotype and molecular epidemiology. Rates of levofloxacin non-susceptibility of S. pneumoniae increased significantly from 1. 2 % in 2001 to 4. 2 % in 2007 at NTUH. A total of 30 isolates of levofloxacin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC ≥ 4 mg/L) were available for evaluation of serotype, antimicrobial susceptibility, nucleotide sequence of the quinolone resistance-determining regions of parC, gyrA, parE and gyrB, reserpine effect on quinolone susceptibility and multilocus sequence type. Among these isolates, seven (23. 3 %) were from children, and two (6. 7 %; one from a 3 - and one from a 93 -year-old patient) were from blood. One levofloxacin-resistant isolate (MIC = 8 mg/L) was recovered from a previously healthy child with <b>bacteraemic</b> necrotizing <b>pneumonia</b> complicated by empyema and a haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. All isolates except two had Ser 79 and/or Asp 83 changes in ParC, and/or Ser 81 or Glu 85 changes in GyrA. An efflux phenotype concerning levofloxacin was detected in only one (3. 3 %) isolate. A novel clone (ST 3642), genetically related to Spain 9 V- 3 and belonging to serotype 11 A, was identified.

40|$|Invasive pneumococcal {{disease is}} a {{relevant}} public health problem in Brazil, especially among children and the elderly. In July/ 2010 a 10 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine {{was introduced to the}} immunization schedule of Brazilian children under two years of age. Between July/ 2010 and December/ 2013 we conducted a case-series study on invasive pneumococcal disease in Salvador, Brazil to describe the clinical and bacteriological profile of invasive pneumococcal disease cases during the post-implementation period. Eighty-two cases were eligible. Mean age was 31 years (interquartile range, 3 – 42); 17. 1 % and 30. 5 % were under 2 years and 5 years, respectively. Pneumococcal meningitis (n =  64, 78. 1 %), <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia</b> (n =  12, 14. 6 %) and bacteraemia (n =  6, 7. 3 %) were the clinical syndromes identified. Thirty-three different serotypes were found. Of these, serotype 14 (n =  12, 14. 6 %) was the most common, followed by 23 F (n =  10, 12. 2 %), 12 F (n =  8, 9. 8 %), 18  C (n =  5, 6. 1 %) and 6 B (n =  5, 6. 1 %). Investigations conducted in Salvador in the pre-vaccine period did not identify serotype 12 F {{as one of the most}} prevalent serotypes.

Among children under two years of age, the target group for 10 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, 11 (78. 6 %) of the 14 isolated strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae belonged to vaccine serotypes; at least 50 % of these children were not vaccinated.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{within a few years}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be the third leading cause of death worldwide. The morbidity and mortality associated with COPD are due, in part to acute exacerbation episodes (AECOPD), mainly caused by microbial pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, COPD is the main underlying disease associated with pneumococcal pneumonia episodes. This thesis describes four studies performed to gain insights into the role of pneumococci and their closely-related species S. pseudopneumoniae in causing acute exacerbation and pneumonia episodes in COPD patients. In the first study, a total of 188 sputum samples were obtained from AECOPD episodes occurring in severe COPD patients during a 1 -year period. Samples were quantitatively cultured; of them, S. pneumoniae was isolated in 31 (16. 5 %) episodes and S. pseudopneumoniae in 9 (4. 8 %) episodes. S. pneumoniae was the third most frequent cause after Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28. 8 %) and Haemophilus influenzae (19. 7 %). There are major differences in the invasiveness potential of pneumococci, depending on their serotype and genotype. Indeed, in our second study (from 2001 to 2008) we found an association of certain serotypes, and their related genotypes, with different pneumococcal infections. Serotypes 4 (ST 2474), 5 (Colombia 5 -ST 289) and 8 (Netherlands 8 -ST 53) were associated with <b>bacteraemic</b> <b>pneumonia,</b> serotypes 1 (Sweden 1 -ST 306) and 3 (Netherlands 3 -ST 180 and ST 2603) with bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic pneumonia, and serotypes 16 F (ST 3016 F), 11 A and non-typeable pneumococci with AECOPD episodes (P< 0. 05). Finally, in our experience, serotype 3 pneumococcus was the most frequent cause of pneumonia and acute exacerbations in COPD patients. Moreover, the implementation of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV 7 for children in 2001 in Spain {{has been shown to be}} highly effective in reducing invasive pneumococcal disease in children, and in adults as well due to the phenomenon of herd protection. This effect was also observed among pneumococci causing acute exacerbations in adults: PCV 7 serotypes decreased from 39. 4 % in the 2001 - 04 period to 11. 2 % in the 2009 - 12 period. In parallel, the prevalence of multi-drug resistant serotypes 15 A and 6 C has dramatically increased in recent years. For this reason, although the resistance rates of β-lactams decreased over time, macrolides and multi-drug resistance remained stable throughout the study period. The presence of bacteria colonizing the lower airways of most severe COPD patients results in bronchial epithelial injury and increases morbidity among these patients. In the third study (1995 - 2010 period), it was found that a third of recurrent pneumococcal acute exacerbations were relapses (caused by a pre-existing strain), mainly associated with serotypes 9 V and 19 F (P< 0. 02). This suggests an important role for capsular type in pneumococcal persistence. In view of these results, we analysed the impact of antimicrobial consumption in the development of pneumococcal resistance to β-lactams and fluoroquinolones in 13 patients with a long-time persistence of pneumococci (average time: 582 days, SD ± 362). Changes in quinolone-resistant determining regions (QRDR) involved in fluoroquinolone resistance were frequently observed in persistent strains after fluoroquinolone treatment; however, the penicillin-binding protein (PBP) sequences were stable over time, even though all but two patients received multiple courses of β-lactam treatment. These results suggest that an optimal combination of pbp genes is maintained to compensate for the fitness cost imposed by additional changes in these genes. Despite the genetic stability of these persistent strains, S. pneumoniae is naturally transformable and is able to acquire exogenous DNA, resulting in a dynamic and complex epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases. This genetic diversity was also observed among the 36 S. pseudopneumoniae strains analysed. Altogether, our studies can help to improve the understanding of the dynamics of S. pneumoniae and S. pseudopneumoniae populations causing disease in COPD patients. En aquesta tesis, es van dur a terme quatre estudis amb l’objectiu d’aprofundir en el paper de S. pneumoniae com a causant d’exacerbacions agudes i pneumònia en pacients amb MPOC. En el primer estudi, es van sembrar quantitativament un total de 188 mostres d’esput obtingudes durant episodis d’EAMPOC en pacients amb MPOC avançat, durant un any d’estudi (febrer 2010 - febrer 2011). S. pneumoniae es va aïllar en 31 (16. 5 %) episodis i fou la tercera causa d’exacerbació, després de Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28. 8 %) i Haemophilus influenzae (19. 7 %). En el segon estudi es va trobar una diferent associació d’alguns serotipus i del seus genotipus relacionats, en pacients amb MPOC amb diferents infeccions pneumocòcciques (període 2001 - 2008). El serotipus 3 va ser la causa més freqüent de pneumònia i d’EAMPOC, però els serotipus 4 (ST 2474), 5 (Colombia 5 -ST 289) i 8 (Netherlands 8 -ST 53) es varen associar amb pneumònia bacterièmica; serotipus 1 (Sweden 1 -ST 306) i 3 (Netherlands 3 -ST 180 i ST 2603) es varen associar amb pneumònia tant bacterièmica com no bacterièmica; mentre serotipus 16 F (ST 3016 F), 11 A i els pneumococs no-tipificables es varen associar amb EAMPOC (P< 0. 05). Degut a la implementació de la vacuna conjugada PCV 7, els serotipus inclosos en la vacuna han disminuït del 39. 4 % en el període 2001 - 2004 a 11. 2 % en el període 2008 - 2012. Paral•lelament a aquest descens, els serotipus 15 A i 6 C han augmentat dramàticament en els últims anys. Per aquesta raó, la multiresistència s’ha mantingut estable durant tot el període d’estudi. En el tercer estudi (1995 - 2010), es va observar que un terç dels episodis d’EAMPOC recurrents, varen ser causats per una soca preexistent, principalment serotipus 9 V i 19 F (P< 0. 05), considerant-se recaigudes. Aquest fet suggereix un paper important del tipus capsular en la persistència. Finalment, es va analitzar l’impacte del consum d’antimicrobians en el desenvolupament de resistència en 13 pacients colonitzats per pneumococc (temps mitjà: 582 dies, DS ± 362). Es van observar canvis en les QRDRs de les soques d’aquells pacients que van rebre tractament amb fluoroquinolones. En canvi, les PBPs de les soques persistents van romandre estables tot i els múltiples tractaments amb β-lactàmics que van rebre els pacients. En total, els estudis presentats han millorat el coneixement de la dinàmica de les poblacions de S. pneumoniae i S. pseudopneumoniae en pacients amb MPOC...|$|E
40|$|PRINCIPLES: A {{decrease}} in plasma lipids occurs during severe sepsis and has prognostic implications in critical illness. Whether lipids have prognostic implications or could help to differentiate community-acquired pneumonia from other {{lower respiratory tract}} infections remains unknown. METHODS: We analysed data from patients with lower respiratory tract infections enrolled in four prospective trials. We studied the time courses of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) and compared them with the underlying diagnosis and medical outcomes. RESULTS: Of 572 patients included, 372 had community-acquired pneumonia and 200 acute and exacerbations of chronic obstructive bronchitis. We found significantly lower concentrations of TC, LDL-C and HDL-C in all patients on admission as compared to hospital discharge, particularly in community-acquired pneumonia. A {{multivariate logistic regression analysis}} including HDL-C, CRP, age and diabetes showed that HDL-C (OR: 0. 18 [95 %CI 0. 11 - 0. 3]) and CRP (OR: 1. 01 [95 %CI 1. 01 - 1. 02]) were independent predictors of community-acquired pneumonia. TC levels were significantly lower in non-survivors than in survivors (3. 26 mmol/L [95 %CI 2. 58 - 3. 96] vs 3. 78 mmol/L [95 %CI 3. 01 - 4. 65]). The prognostic accuracy, defined as the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of TC to predict mortality, was 0. 63 (95 %CI 0. 53 - 0. 72) in all patients and increased to 0. 94 (95 %CI 0. 86 - 1. 00) in patients with <b>bacteraemic</b> community-acquired <b>pneumonia.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, low lipid levels, particularly low HDL-C, pointed to bacterial infection and low TC was predictive of adverse outcomes in patients with lower respiratory tract infections. Reflecting the severity of disease, plasma lipid levels may be a complementary tool in the diagnostic and prognostic workup of patients with lower respiratory tract infections...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, we {{evaluated}} rapid real-time PCR assays for ply, Spn 9802, and lytA applied to plasma samples {{for the detection}} of Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In a prospective study of CAP aetiology, an EDTA plasma sample was collected together with blood culture in 92 adult CAP patients and 91 adult controls. Among the 92 CAP patients, lytA PCR was positive in eight (9 %), Spn 9802 PCR was positive in 11 (12 %) and ply PCR was positive in 19 (21 %) cases. Of 91 controls, the ply PCR was positive in eight cases (9 %), but no positive cases were noted by Spn 9802 or lytA PCRs. Ten CAP patients had pneumococcal bacteraemia. Compared to blood culture, PCR for lytA, Spn 9802 and ply had sensitivities of 70 % (7 / 10), 60 % (6 / 10) and 70 % (7 / 10), and specificities of 96 % (79 / 82), 94 % (77 / 82) and 85 % (70 / 82) respectively. With blood culture and/or culture of representative sputum, and/or urinary antigen detection, S. pneumoniae was identified in 31 CAP patients. Compared to these tests in combination, PCR for lytA, Spn 9802 and ply showed sensitivities of 26 % (8 / 31), 32 % (10 / 31) and 42 % (13 / 31), and specificities of 100 % (61 / 61), 98 % (60 / 61) and 90 % (55 / 61) respectively. We conclude that Spn 9802 and lytA PCRs may be useful for the rapid detection of <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia,</b> whereas ply PCR is not specific enough for routine use and blood PCR with small plasma volumes is not useful {{for the detection of}} nonbacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia...|$|R

40|$|PCR is a rapid, {{reproducible}} {{method for}} nucleic acid detection. However, this technology displays significant deficiencies when applied in clinical microbiology. This work’s {{aim was to}} improve current diagnostics and provide sensitive and quantitative real-time PCRs. Paper I describes {{the development of a}} sensitive and specific quantitative real-time PCR for the detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae, based on the Spn 9802 DNA fragment. Applied to nasopharyngeal aspirates from 166 pneumonia patients, Spn 9802 PCR had a sensitivity of 94 % and a specificity of 98 %. In Paper II the performance of a ply gene PCR for identification of pneumococcal lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was evaluated on bronchoalveloar lavage fluids. At the detection limit 103 genome copies/mL, 89 % sensitivity but only 43 % specificity was achieved. Paper III shows that S. pneumoniae DNA is detectable in plasma from acutely febrile patients. Sensitivities were low (26 - 42 %) for detection of pneumococcal <b>pneumonia,</b> for <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia</b> they were 60 - 70 %. Paper IV describes evaluation of four PCR targets for Haemophilus influenzae detection. A real-time PCR based on the P 6 gene was developed and applied to 166 CAP patients, using cut-off of 104 genome copies/mL the assay had a sensitivity of 97 % and a specificity of 96 %. In paper V, the two real-time PCRs presented in papers I and IV were combined with a PCR for detection of Neisseriae meningitidis. The analytical sensitivity of this multiplex real-time PCR was not affected by using a mixture of reagents and a combined DNA standard (S. pneumoniae/H. influenzae) in single tubes. Applied to 156 LRTI patients, this PCR had sensitivities over 90 % for S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, and specificities of 89 % and 96 %, respectively. In conclusion, real-time PCR assays are useful for the diagnosis of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. They enable detection after antibiotic installation, and quantification increases the etiological specificity of pneumonia...|$|R

Over a 16 -month period, a total of 27 infants were either colonized (N= 14) or infected (N= 13). There were 15 cases of S. marcescens and 11 cases of K. pneumoniae. Both micro-organisms were involved in one fatal case. Seven preterm babies developed septicaemia, two had bacteraemia, three had respiratory infections and one had purulent conjunctivitis. The S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae isolates were investigated by three molecular methods: enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), arbitrary primed PCR with M 13 primer, and random amplification of polymorphic DNA. Different patterns {{were found in the}} 16 S. marcescens epidemic isolates from 16 newborn infants. The major epidemic-involved genotype was linked to the first nine cases and this was subsequently replaced by different patterns. Eight different typing profiles were also determined for the 13 K. pneumoniae isolates from 12 newborn infants. Four K. <b>pneumoniae</b> <b>bacteraemic</b> strains proved to be identical. In conclusion, the typing results revealed that two different micro-organisms (S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae) were simultaneously involved in invasive nosocomial infections in preterm newborns.

40|$|Community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP) and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) {{are very}} relevant pathologies among elderly people (≥ 65 y old), with a consequent high disease burden. Immunization with the 23 -valent {{pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine}} (PPV 23) has been differently implemented in the Italian regions in the past years, reaching overall low coverage rates even in those with medical indications. In 2010, the 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV 13) became available and recommended in the universal Italian infant immunization program. Since October 2012, indications for use of PCV 13 were extended to subjects ≥ 50 y to prevent invasive pneumococcal diseases. The Italian decision makers should now revise regional indications {{for the prevention of}} pneumococcal diseases in the elderly. Pharmaco-economic analyses represent a useful tool to value the feasibility of new immunization programs and their sustainability. Therefore, an ad hoc population model was developed in order to value the clinical and economic impact of an adult pneumococcal vaccination program in Italy. Particularly, different immunization scenarios were modeled: vaccination of 65 y-olds (1 cohort strategy), simultaneous vaccination of people aged 65 and 70 y (double cohort strategy) and, lastly, immunization of people aged 65, 70 and 75 y (triple cohort strategy), thus leading to the vaccination of 5, 10 and 15 cohorts during the 5 y of the program. In addition, the administration of a PPV 23 dose one year after PCV 13 was evaluated, in order to verify the economic impact of the supplemental serotype coverage in elderly people. The mathematical model valued the clinical impact of PCV 13 vaccination on the number of <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia</b> (BPP) and pneumococcal meningitis (PM) cases, and related hospitalizations and deaths. Although PCV 13 is not yet formally indicated for the prevention of pneumococcal CAP by the European Medicine Agency (differently from FDA, whose indications include all pneumococcal diseases in subjects ≥ 50 y), the model calculated also the possible impact of vaccination on CAP cases (non-bacteraemic), considering the rate of this disease due to S. pneumoniae. The results of the analysis show that, in Italy, an age-based PCV 13 vaccination program in elderly people is cost-effective from the payer perspective, with costs per QALY ranging from 17, 000 to 22, 000 Euro, according to the adopted vaccination strategy. The subsequent PPV 23 offer results in an increment of costs per QALY (from 21, 000 to 28, 000 Euro, according to the vaccination strategy adopted). Pneumococcal vaccination using the conjugate vaccine turned out to be already favorable in the second year of implementation, with incremental costs per QALY comparable to those of other already adopted prevention activities in Italy (for instance, universal HPV vaccination of 12 y-old girls), with further benefits obtained when extending the study period beyond the 5 -y horizon of our analysis...|$|R
40|$|Streptococcus pneumoniae {{also known}} as pneumococcus is a major {{contributor}} to the disease burden in the world. Infections caused by this bacterium include a wide spectrum of different disease types, from non-severe upper respiratory tract infections to invasive disease forms like bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia or meningitis, conditions attributed with a high rate of severe disease and mortality. An important feature of this bacterium is that it only causes disease under certain circumstances, and the most common outcome upon contact with this bacterium is transient nasopharyngeal colonization rather than disease from it. Some patient groups such as young children and older people are however at a substantially increased risk of severe disease from the pneumococcus. The aim of this thesis is to increase the understanding of factors of importance to severe pneumococcal disease. The first paper addresses the difficulties in obtaining an etiological diagnosis in pneumonias, which potentially would delay an optimal care and treatment of these patients. We were able to demonstrate that our RQ-PCR method targeting specific gene sequences within the bacteria S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis, increased the diagnostic yield from sputum samples significantly and also that this method seemed especially valuable in finding the causative bacterium when the patient had received antibiotics prior to specimen sampling. The second paper addresses the issue of how to identify patients that are at special risk for a severe outcome from pneumococcal pneumonia. We investigated this by analysing the ability of three different severity score systems, initially developed for the assessment of severity in all cause community acquired pneumonia, to predict mortality and need of ICU admission in <b>bacteraemic</b> pneumococcal <b>pneumonia.</b> We concluded that these severity scores worked fairly well also in this subgroup of patients, but also identified the CURB- 65 as the best score system since it was the most practical to use. The third paper addresses whether specific pneumococcal properties are able to influence the severity and outcome of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). We investigated the relationship between clonal affiliation / serotypes of pneumococci and patient characteristics and outcome of IPD. We concluded that some clones and serotypes seem more prone to cause severe disease among older patients burdened by comorbidities, and are thus behaving like opportunistic pathogens, while other clones and serotype tended to cause milder disease among younger and previously healthy individuals, thus behaving as primary pathogens. The fourth paper addresses the issue of preventing invasive pneumococcal disease. We investigated the effects of the large scale vaccination campaign with the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine directed towards all elderly persons in Stockholm County between 1997 and 2001. We studied the effects on incidence and serotype distribution of IPD, and concluded that a substantial decrease in vaccine-type IPD was seen among the vaccinated population, but not among other age groups, and also that no serotype replacement occurred during the 5 year study perio...|$|R

The nurses and the environment werechecked by microbiological studies. The antibiograms and theresults from two molecular typing methods (automated Riboprintingand ERIC-PCR) of all bacteraemic or colonising isolates fromnewborns and from patients elsewhere in the hospital during thesame time period, were compared in order to investigate theepidemiology of the clusters. Results: Totally 20 S. marcescens isolates, including 12 from newbornsand eight from other patients of the same hospital, and 10 K. pneumoniae strains from newborns were examined. An initialanalysis performed after the identification of the first nine newbornscontaminated by S. marcescens established clonal relationshipsamong all the isolates, including the two bacteraemic strains. Asecond analysis revealed one different pattern in three S. marcescensstrains successively isolated. Six genotypes unrelated tonewborns isolates were found in the eight strains from the otherexamined patients. The three K. <b>pneumoniae</b> <b>bacteraemic</b> strainsresulted genetically related among them but unrelated to the colonisingisolates. S. marcescens isolates among different molecularpatterns showed identical antibiograms. A focal source for bothmicroorganisms was not identified. Conclusion: Typing results revealed that two different microorganisms(S. marcescens and K. pneumoniae) were involved at the sametime in invasive nosocomial infections in premature newborns anddocumented two contemporaneous clonal clusters of cases. Heterogeneousgenotypes among both species were also demonstrated tobe simultaneously present in the neonatal intensive care unit...|$|R
