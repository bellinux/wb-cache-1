40|$|A key {{step in the}} {{evolutionary}} history of Odontoceti (echolocating toothed cetaceans) is {{the transition from the}} ancestral heterodont conditionÂ â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Â characterized by the presence of double-rooted cheek teeth <b>bearing</b> <b>accessory</b> denticlesÂ â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Â to the homodont dentition displayed by most extant odontocete species. During the last few decades, new finds and the reassessment of specimens in collections revealed an increased morphological disparity amongst the Oligoâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Miocene heterodont odontocetes. Based on a partly articulated skeleton from late Early Miocene (Burdigalian, 18. 8 â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 318. 0 Ma) beds of the Chilcatay Formation (Pisco Basin, Peru), we describe a new genus and species of heterodont odontocete, Inticetus vertizi, in the new family Inticetidae. This large dolphin is characterized by, amongst other things, a long and robust rostrum bearing at least 18 teeth per quadrant; the absence of procumbent anterior teeth; many large, broad-based accessory denticles in double-rooted posterior cheek teeth; a reduced ornament of dental crowns; the styliform process of the jugal being markedly robust; a large fovea epitubaria on the periotic, with a correspondingly voluminous accessory ossicle of the tympanic bulla; and a shortened tuberculum of the malleus. Phylogenetic analyses (with and without molecular constraint; with and without down-weighting of homoplastic characters) yielded contrasting results, with Inticetus falling either as a stem Odontoceti or as an early branching member of a large Platanistoidea clade. With its large size, robust rostrum and unusual dental morphology, and the absence of conspicuous tooth wear, Inticetus increases the morphological and ecological disparity of Late Oligoceneâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 Early Miocene heterodont odontocetes. Finally, this new taxon calls for caution when attempting to identify isolated cetacean cheek teeth, even at the suborder level. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Vpx is a virion-associated protein encoded by SIV SM, a {{lentivirus}} {{endemic to}} the West African sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys). HIV- 2 and SIV MAC, zoonoses resulting from SIV SM transmission to humans or Asian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), also encode Vpx. In myeloid cells, Vpx promotes reverse transcription and transduction by these viruses. This activity correlates with Vpx binding to DCAF 1 (VPRBP) and {{association with the}} DDB 1 /RBX 1 /CUL 4 A E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex. When delivered experimentally to myeloid cells using VSV G-pseudotyped virus-like particles (VLPs), Vpx promotes reverse transcription of retroviruses that do not normally encode Vpx. Results Here we show that Vpx has the extraordinary ability to completely rescue HIV- 1 transduction of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from the potent antiviral state established by prior treatment with exogenous type 1 interferon (IFN). The magnitude of rescue was up to 1, 000 -fold, depending on the blood donor, and was also observed after induction of endogenous IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by LPS, poly(I:C), or poly(dA:dT). The effect was relatively specific in that Vpx-associated suppression of soluble IFN-β production, of mRNA levels for ISGs, or of cell surface markers for MDDC differentiation, was not detected. Vpx did not rescue HIV- 2 or SIV MAC transduction from the antiviral state, even {{in the presence of}} SIV MAC or HIV- 2 VLPs bearing additional Vpx, or in the presence of HIV- 1 VLPs <b>bearing</b> all <b>accessory</b> genes. In contrast to the effect of Vpx on transduction of untreated MDDCs, HIV- 1 rescue from the antiviral state was not dependent upon Vpx interaction with DCAF 1 or on the presence of DCAF 1 within the MDDC target cells. Additionally, although Vpx increased the level of HIV- 1 reverse transcripts in MDDCs to the same extent whether or not MDDCs were treated with IFN or LPS, Vpx rescued a block specific to the antiviral state that occurred after HIV- 1 cDNA penetrated the nucleus. Conclusion Vpx provides a tool for the characterization of a potent, new HIV- 1 restriction activity, which acts in the nucleus of type 1 IFN-treated dendritic cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The hippolytid genus Lysmata is {{characterized}} by simultaneous hermaphroditism, a very rare sexual system among Decapoda. Specialized cleaning behavior is reported in a few pair-living species; these life history traits vary within the genus. Unfortunately, the systematics of Lysmata and the Hippolytidae itself are in contention, {{making it difficult to}} examine these taxa for trends in life history traits. A phylogeny of Lysmata and related taxa is needed, to clarify their evolutionary relationships and the origin of their unique sexual pattern. In this study, we present a molecular phylogenetic analysis among species of Lysmata, related genera, and several putative hippolytids. The analysis is based upon DNA sequences of two genes, 16 S mtDNA and nuclear 28 S rRNA. Phylogenetic trees were estimated using Bayesian Inference, Maximum Likelihood, and Maximum Parsimony. Results Phylogenetic analysis of 29 species of Lysmata, eight genera of Hippolytidae and two genera of Barbouriidae based on a single (16 S, 28 S) and combined gene approach (16 S+ 28 S) indicates that three groups of Lysmata differentiate according to antennular morphology: (1) Lysmata, having a multi-segmented accessory branch, (2) Hippolysmata (prior to Chace 1972), with a one-segmented accessory branch, and (3) a third group of Lysmata outliers, with one-segmented unguiform accessory branch, and close affinity to the genera Exhippolysmata and Lysmatella. The monophyly of the clade <b>bearing</b> a multi-segmented <b>accessory</b> branch is robust. Within the short accessory branch clade, species with specialized cleaning behaviors form a monophyletic clade, however, the integrity of the clade was sensitive to alignment criteria. Other hippolytid and barbouriid genera used in the analysis are basal to these three groups, including one displaying simultaneous hermaphroditism (Parhippolyte). The two barbouriid species occur in a separate clade, but among hippolytid taxa. Conclusions The data support the historical morphological division of Lysmata into clades based on accessory branch morphology. The position of the "cleaner" shrimps, indicates that specialized cleaning behavior is a derived trait. The topologies of the cladograms support the monophyly of the barbouriids, but do not support their elevation to familial status. Taxa ancestral to the genus Lysmata display simultaneous hermaphroditism, suggesting that this life history trait evolved outside the genus Lysmata. </p...|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{between humans}} and {{different}} types of equipment is unavoidable and thus human interfaces, such as feet, hands and buttocks, always experience various types of forces during such interactions. When the force per unit area, which is known as pressure, is excessive, people will experience pain or discomfort (Gonzalez et al., 1999). Therefore, {{the aim of this}} research was to determine a loading arrangement that would minimize potential pain and discomfort. Thus, the characteristics of pressure perception with different loading arrangements, namely (1) concentric probes (2) equal load distribution and (3) unequal load distribution have been tested and analyzed. The plantar foot tissue deformation was modeled using a two-element spring model. The tissue stiffness parameters on the plantar foot differ with location, indentation speed and probe area. The pressure perception characteristics were evaluated using pressure discomfort threshold (PDT) and pressure pain threshold (PPT) and the reliability analysis showed that both variables have very high test-retest reliability. It was found that the stiffness of the second deformation region is positively correlated with the PPT (r = 0. 75, p < 0. 001). According to the dimensional analysis, the PPT can be mathematically modeled in the form of PPT=c[(V. t) 2 /A]α or PPT=c[d 2 /A]α,(R 2 = 0. 98) where V is the indentation speed, t is the time of indentation, A is the probe area and d is the indentation depth. The coefficient, c, can characterize the tissue property and the exponent, α is possibly a representation of the spatial summation effect of pressure related pain. It is found that pressure sensation follows Stevens‘ power law (1957) and the exponent β of the power law shows a linear relationship with the probe area (A). Furthermore, the perceived pressure sensation can be mathematically modeled in the form of S = 0. 12 A 0. 6 P (R 2 = 0. 99) where P is the pressure of the probe. Among the three locations tested on the plantar foot, the heel had the highest PPT and PDT values, followed by the area under the third metatarsal phalangial joint. The lowest PPT and PDT were under the medial arch. The indentation speeds significantly affected the pressure thresholds, and the PPT and PDT increased when the indentation speed is increased. However, the probe gap or probe inner diameter of concentric indentors did not affect the pain thresholds. With dual probes, probe separations of less than 21 mm have no effect on PPT and PDT. However, uneven distribution of load between the two probes can significantly change the resultant pressure thresholds. Distributing the load in a 1 : 2 ratio between the two probes gave the highest PPT and PDT values, which is around 15. 6 % higher than that of even load distribution. A load arrangement that minimizes pressure discomfort and pain by suppressing the effect of spatial summation of pressure pain was determined. It is found that one way of suppressing the effects of spatial summation is unequal loading among probes. The findings of this research have important implications in the design of load <b>bearing</b> devices and <b>accessories.</b> The results of the research can also be useful in explaining why some footwear designs are more or less comfortable than other designs...|$|R
