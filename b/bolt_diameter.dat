The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a fatigue failure of those parts.|$|E

5000|$|... (To simplify matters, {{the term}} hexagon {{will be used}} in this {{paragraph}} to denote either bolt head or nut.) Whitworth (spanner) markings refer to the <b>bolt</b> <b>diameter</b> rather than the distance across the flats of the hexagon (A/F) as in other standards. Confusion also arises because BSF hexagon sizes can be one size smaller than the corresponding Whitworth hexagon. This leads to instances where a spanner (wrench) marked 7/16BSF is the same size as one marked 3/8W. In both cases the spanner jaw width of 0.710 in, the width across the hexagon flat, is the same. However, in World War II the size of the Whitworth hexagon was reduced to {{the same size as the}} equivalent BSF hexagon purely to save metal during the war and they never went back to the old sizes afterwards. Thus it is today uncommon to encounter a Whitworth hexagon which takes the nominally correct spanner. Spanners in this case may be marked 7/16BS to indicate that they have a jaw size of 0.710 in and are designed to take either the (later) 7/16 BSW or 7/16 BSF hexagon.|$|E

40|$|Many {{theoretical}} {{as well as}} {{experimental studies}} have been recently carried out by researchers {{working in the field}} of civil engineering on the design and verification problem of structural bolted joints for structures realized with Fibre Reinforced Polymers (FRP). It worth taking into account the results obtained by Camanho and Matthews [2], Ekh, Schön and Melin [3, 4], Hassan, Mohamedien and Rizkalla [5], Ireman [6], Kelly and Hallström [7], Li, Kelly and Crosky [8], Lie, Yu and Zhao [9], Starikov and Schön [10], Vangrimde and Boukhili [11, 12], Xiao and Ishikawa [13], Yan, Wen, Chang and Shyprykevich [14]. The results of these studies have highlighted the influence on typical failure modes of FRP bolted joints of some main factors as being: 1) stacking sequence of the laminates; 2) joint geometry: <b>bolt</b> <b>diameter,</b> plate width, end distance and thickness of the composite member; 3) matrix type and fibre nature. In this context, the aim of the research carried out by the authors is to investigate on the bearing failure mode of a laminate bolted joint and, in particular, to underline the effects of the fibre inclination angle, the laminate stacking sequence and the <b>bolt</b> <b>diameter</b> on the aforementioned failure mode. For the experimental tests circular specimens have been used, with 300 mm in diameter, built-in at the edge with a central hole. Some results, in terms of fiber inclination angle and laminate stacking sequence, have been just published by the authors in [15, 16]. The experimental results, showing the influence of <b>bolt</b> <b>diameter</b> on the bearing strength, represent the subject of the present paper. In order to perform the experimental investigation, two types of GFRP laminates were tested: unidirectional and cross-ply. In particular the stacking sequence of the unidirectional laminates (10 mm thick) was [CSM/ 08 /CSM], while for the cross-ply laminates were used two different stacking sequence. These latter were: [(CSM/ 06 / 906) s] and [(CSM/ 03 / 903) 2]s, where the number of plies and the thickness (12 mm) was constant. On both types of laminates three different values of the <b>bolt</b> <b>diameter</b> have been considered: 20 mm, 19 mm and 18 mm. All of them are relative to the same value of the hole diameter, equal to 21 mm. The experimental results have shown that the bearing strength depends significantly on the <b>bolt</b> <b>diameter</b> for both types of laminates considered. In particular, in the case of unidirectional laminates the experimental analysis carried out put in evidence a reduction of the bearing strength, passing from the maximum diameter considered of 20 mm to the minimum one of 18 mm, equal to 13...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} methods used for joining {{composite}} components for aircraft and spacecraft applications is mechanical fastening [1]. Mechanically fastened joints have the advantages of reliability, detachability and inspectability, and represent a well-established and well-known method. However, to reach a satisfactory structural coupling efficiency with composite materials is much more challenging {{than it is for}} metals due to the low bearing and shear strengths, the higher notch sensitivity, the dependence of the joint strength on laminate configuration, and the influence of environmental effects. These properties represent a limiting factor on the structural performance of composite structures. The load capacity of composite bolted joints is typically increased by means of a local laminate build-up at the structure coupling area. The resulting laminate thickness increase, especially for highly loaded root-joints, leads to additional laminate stresses due to eccentricities, particularly in the case of single-shear joints, to complex geometries of adjacent structures as well as to a significant weight increase due to larger grip lengths, larger <b>bolt</b> <b>diameters</b> and heavier metallic fittings.
