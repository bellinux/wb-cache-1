2500|$|The American {{literacy}} critic Harold Bloom called Fanny Price [...] "...a co-descendant, {{together with}} Locke's association-menaced will, of the English Protestant emphasis upon the will's autonomy". In this regard, Bloom argued that paradoxically it was Price's lack of will to dominate that causes her will to triumph {{in the end}} as her struggle just to be herself causes her to exercise enough moral influence to make her triumphant in the end. Bloom argued that Mansfield Park was a Romantic book, not in the High Romantic sense as practiced by the second generation Romantics, but in the quieter sense {{of the first generation}} Romantics who appreciated the sense of sublime quiet {{to be found in the}} countryside. The British writer C. S. Lewis condemned Price upon the grounds [...] "But into Fanny, Jane Austen, to counterbalance her apparent insignificance, has put really nothing except rectitude of mind, neither passion, nor physical courage, nor wit, nor resource". Bloom argued that though Lewis was correct on all these points, he missed the importance of Price's will to <b>be</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> a causal agent in the plot.|$|E
60|$|Yes, I {{want to see}} Béranger, and so does Robert. George Sand we came to know a {{great deal}} more of. I think Robert saw her six times. Once he met her near the Tuileries, offered her his arm, and walked with her the whole length of the gardens. She was not on that {{occasion}} looking as well as usual, being a little too much 'endimanchée' in terrestrial lavenders and supercelestial blues--not, in fact, dressed with the remarkable taste which he has seen in her at other times. Her usual costume is both pretty and quiet, and the fashionable waistcoat and jacket (which are a spectacle in all the 'Ladies' Companions' of the day) make the only approach to masculine wearings to be observed in her. She has great nicety and refinement in her personal ways, I think, and the cigarette is really a feminine weapon if properly understood. Ah, but I didn't see her smoke. I was unfortunate. I could only go with Robert three times to her house, and once she was out. He was really very good and kind to let me go at all, after he found the sort of society rampant around her. He didn't like it extremely, but, being the prince of husbands, he was lenient to my desires and yielded the point. She seems to live in the abomination of desolation, as far as regards society--crowds of ill-bred men who adore her à genoux bas, betwixt a puff of smoke and an ejection of saliva. Society of the ragged Red diluted with the lower theatrical. She herself so different, so apart, as alone in her melancholy disdain! I was deeply interested in that poor woman, I felt a profound compassion for her. I did not mind much the Greek in Greek costume who tutoyéd her, and kissed her, I believe, so Robert said; or the other vulgar man of the theatre who went down on his knees and called her 'sublime.' 'Caprice d'amitié,' said she, with her quiet, gentle scorn. A noble woman under the mud, be certain. I would kneel down to her, too, if she would leave it all, throw it off, and <b>be</b> <b>herself</b> <b>as</b> God made her. But she would not care for my kneeling; she does not care for me. Perhaps she doesn't care for anybody by this time--who knows? She wrote one, or two, or three kind notes to me, and promised to 'venir m'embrasser' before she left Paris; but she did not come. We both tried hard to please her, and she told a friend of ours that she 'liked us'; only we always felt that we couldn't penetrate--couldn't really touch her--it was all vain. Her play failed, though full of talent. It didn't draw, and was withdrawn accordingly. I wish she would keep to her romances, in which her real power lies.|$|E

5000|$|In the [...] "All New Hawkeye" [...] books, Kate and Clint {{retrieve}} Project Communion from Hydra, {{which turns}} out to be three innocent kids turned into powerful, psionic Inhumans from the Terrigen Mists. They don't trust S.H.I.E.L.D. with them, so they rescue the kids from S.H.I.E.L.D. and have them live in Barton's apartment, until Hydra tracks their location. When Clint deems the children too dangerous to hold, they reluctantly hand them over to Hydra. Kate's trust in Clint is shaken, and she starts operating solo for a short time while re-evaluating her life and relationship with Clint. Clint eventually helps her {{come up with a plan}} to rescue the children from Hydra and fake Project Communion's deaths in front of S.H.I.E.L.D. to keep Maria Hill away. They have the kids stay with Barney while Clint contacts the Avengers to get a good security system for them. Kate tells Clint she still wants to be a solo hero for a while in order to <b>be</b> <b>herself,</b> <b>as</b> she's idolized Clint for so long and used the Hawkeye identity to avoid becoming like her dad, but is ready to become her own person. The series also explores Kate's childhood, where she initially idolized her father and wanted to be like him, but after learning about his criminal activities, decides that it's best if she doesn't know what he does while he doesn't know what she does. This is realized after Kate was abducted by one of her dad's rival gangs, and she was rescued by Hawkeye and the Avengers, which inspired her to become a hero in the future.|$|E
