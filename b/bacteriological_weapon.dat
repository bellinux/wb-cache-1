With the March 13, 1991 decision, export controls exist on 50 chemicals and the warning list has now been reduced to zero. With regards to biological weapons, a whole new list of controls is now being discussed within the Australia Group. A list of 29 countries has been drawn up and the U. S. hope that the Australia Group will adopt similar controls when it meets in December 1991. The article also contains five annexes : the classification of groups countries for export control reasons; a list of countries under foreign policy controls; the classification of microorganisms according to their class and degree of pathogenicity; a list of the fifty precursors under control; and the chronological evolution of the U.

These forces were replaced by militia, draft levies, reservists, and cannibalized smaller units, all equipped with woefully outdated equipment. The Kwantung Army had also <b>bacteriological</b> <b>weapons,</b> prepared for use against Soviet troops (see. [...] "Detachment 731").

Prince Kan'in transmitted to the Army the emperor's first directive (rinsanmei) authorizing the use of chemical weapons on July 28, 1937.

40|$|Using now-closed {{files from}} the Chinese Foreign Ministry Archive and {{contemporary}} sources in Chinese, this chapter investigates {{the role of}} the Shenyang Trials of 1956 in configuring China’s postwar position and asserting a specifically Chinese communist response to Japanese war crimes. Within the matrix of East Asian war crimes trials of Japanese defendants, the Shenyang Trial was peculiar in that it served as the pre-eminent Chinese forum for prosecuting crimes committed {{under the auspices of the}} Japanese colonial experiment of Manchukuo. While the Khabarovsk Trials of December 1949 also exposed crimes committed in Manchuria with an emphasis on <b>bacteriological</b> <b>weapons</b> research, the Shenyang Trials held up to scrutiny Pu Yi, the puppet emperor, and various officials throughout the broader Manchukuo system. With the Shenyang Trials, the Communist Party of China (CPC) sought to move China beyond gratefulness for the Soviet intervention which had, in fact, crushed the puppet state and on toward a more assertive portrayal of CPC justice. They also exemplified how the government used show trials in the 1950 s to undergird public support, serve as instruments of propaganda internationally, and frame a model of Japanese postcolonial guilt in the face of contingent Chinese benevolence that persists to this day in the People’s Republic of China...|$|R

In the conference proceedings, there is a discussion remark Lewin was recorded to have made in an exchange with Arthur Kronfeld. After that, NKVD records indicate that James Lewin was a victim of the Stalinist purges (specifically, the so-called National Operations of the NKVD targeting Germans). On 8 September 1937 he was arrested, {{and at the end of}} October he confessed to alleged [...] "anti-Soviet - counter revolutionary activities, spying for the Gestapo, and the planning of terrorist attacks" [...] Such confessions are well-known to be factually unreliable based on other examples in which similar confessions were extracted under torture. For instance, while details of Lewin's family are accurate in the records, the recorded minutes of the interrogation allege that Lewin - an exiled Jew - had operated an ornamental fish store in Paris that was used as cover for Gestapo meetings. He was also alleged to have been running a production laboratory for chemical and <b>bacteriological</b> <b>weapons</b> at his Moscow apartment. Lewin and his case were transferred to Chelyabinsk and, on 31 December 1937, he was found guilty, sentenced to death, and executed the same day. He was probably buried in the mass grave with other victims of Stalinist oppression at Golden Mountain (Zlata Gora).|$|R
