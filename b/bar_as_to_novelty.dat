50|$|The {{issue of}} whether a finding in favor of Mr. Yount on his 42 U.S.C. 1983 claim would “necessarily imply the invalidity” of his {{criminal}} conviction for resisting arrest was submitted to the California Supreme Court for decision.

The California Supreme Court held that Mr. Yount’s civil claims were barred {{to the extent that}} they alleged that Officer Schrum was not entitled to use any force during the incident, because Mr. Yount’s resistance justified the use of reasonable force in response to his actions. The Court further held, however, that Mr. Yount’s civil claims were not <b>barred</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> Officer Shrum’s use of deadly force because Officer Schrum’s use of deadly force against Mr. Yount was not reasonable under the circumstances, and Mr. Yount’s conviction for resisting arrest did not, by itself, provide a justification for Officer Schrum’s use of deadly force against Mr Yount.|$|R

40|$|The Minor in the Civil Procedure JUDr. Jana Sladká Hyklová Abstract The thesis {{deals with}} {{the topic of the}} minor in civil procedure. This topic has not been yet {{properly}} compiled in Czech legal literature although the issues of participation of minors within civil proceedings are still actual and their importance is increasing. The basic legal source covering the chosen topic is Act No. 99 / 1963 Coll., Civil Procedure Code, which had to be amended more than 120 times. Procedural law in family law matters, which form substantial part of the content of this thesis topic, is firmly connected with substantive law. Substantive legislation is nowadays represented by Civil Code and Family Law, which are supposed to be replaced on 1 January 2014 with new code of civil law, Civil Code (Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll.). This is the reason why the thesis pays attention to the existing legislation <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>novelties</b> brought by the new code. Where needed, an analysis of new legislation in terms of proper procedural protection of the rights of minors is provided. New legislation of civil law brings the question of preparation of appropriate procedural code. On spring 2012 the draft of law of non contentious procedure which includes main principles and outline of this brand new procedural regulation was published. Where [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Background: The long-standing {{observation}} that the novelty-seeking personality trait is a predictor of drug use and other reinforcable risky behaviors raises the question <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how <b>novelty</b> and reward processing functionally interact in mesolimbic dopaminergic circuitry and how this interaction is modulated by the novelty-seeking personality trait. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) hemodynamic responses <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> and reward (monetary incentive) from the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA),the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and the hippocampus of 29 subjects were correlated with novelty-seeking scores. These correlations were compared with those obtained for scores of reward-dependence. The fMRI data were taken from two experiments in which the interaction of novelty and reward was manipulated as a within-subject variable, and long-term memory for the critical stimuli was assessed after 24 hours. Results: Novelty-seeking {{was positively correlated with}} SN/VTA activation elicited by novel cues that did not predict reward, whereas reward-dependence was related to activations elicited by novel cues that predicted reward. The positive correlation between SN/VTA responses <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> and novelty-seeking scores was accompanied by a negative correlation with reward-related SN/VTA activation and memory enhancement. Conclusions: SN/VTA responses <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> and reward are differentially affected by personality traits of novelty-seeking and reward-dependence. Importantly, novelty-seekers were more responsive to novel cues in the absence of reward and needed less reward to boost their memory for novel cues. These observations strongly suggest that for novelty-seekers, the motivational value of novelty is not necessarily based on actual reward-predicting stimulus properties...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} set of techniques for representing the high-level behavior of a digital subsystem {{as a collection of}} nondeterministic finite automata, NFA. Desired behavioral and implementation dynamics: dependencies, repetition, bounded resources, sequential character, and control state, can also be similarly modeled. All possible system execution sequences, obeying imposed constraints, are encapsulated in a composed NFA. Technology similar to that used in symbolic model checking enables implicit exploration and extraction of best-possible execution sequences. This provides a very general, systematic procedure to perform exact high-level synthesis of cyclic, control-dominated behaviors constrained by arbitrary sequential constraints. This dissertation further demonstrates that these techniques are scalable to practical problem sizes and complexities. Exact scheduling solutions are constructed for a variety of academic and industrial problems, including a pipelined RISC processor. The ability to represent and schedule sequential models with hundreds of tasks and one-half million control cases substantially raises the <b>bar</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> what is believed possible for exact scheduling models.
