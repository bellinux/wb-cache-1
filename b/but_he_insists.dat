5|$|Scholastic {{investigation}} of Vithoba's history often begins with {{consideration of the}} dating of the chief temple at Pandharpur, which {{is believed to be}} the earliest Vithoba temple. The oldest part of the temple dates to the Yadava period of the 12th and 13thcenturies. Most of the temple is believed to have been built in the 17thcentury, though addition to the temple has never ceased. The date the temple was first established is unclear to Bhandarkar, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> there is clear evidence to suggest it existed by the 13thcentury. According to S. G. Tulpule, the temple stood as early as 1189. In fact, a monument dated 1189 records establishment of a small Vithoba shrine at the present location of the temple; thus, Tulpule concludes, the worship of Vithoba predates 1189.|$|E

500|$|In his 1982 book, Abusing Science: The Case Against Creationism, philosopher {{of science}} Philip Kitcher {{specifically}} addresses the [...] "falsifiability" [...] question by {{taking into account}} notable philosophical critiques of Popper by Carl Gustav Hempel and Willard Van Orman Quine and provides a definition of theory other than {{as a set of}} falsifiable statements. As Kitcher points out, if one took a strictly Popperian view of [...] "theory," [...] observations of Uranus when it was first discovered in 1781 would have [...] "falsified" [...] Isaac Newton's celestial mechanics. Rather, people suggested that another planet influenced Uranus' orbit—and this prediction was indeed eventually confirmed. Kitcher agrees with Popper that [...] "there is surely something right in the idea that a science can succeed only if it can fail." [...] <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> that we view scientific theories as consisting of an [...] "elaborate collection of statements," [...] some of which are not falsifiable, and others—what he calls [...] "auxiliary hypotheses," [...] which are.|$|E

However, Smithers admits that he is glad that his father died as a real hero rather than from a tribe of savage Amazon women, which Burns told him earlier.
