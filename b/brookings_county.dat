50|$|Medary was {{the first}} {{official}} town in <b>Brookings</b> <b>County</b> {{and was one of}} the first three settlements in South Dakota, along with Flandreau and Sioux Falls. It was named for Governor Samuel Medary of Minnesota Territory. Medary was located and founded in May 1857 by the Dakota Land Company of St. Paul, Minnesota, which was headed by Major Franklin J. DeWitt and Alpheus G. Fuller. On the expedition to locate the claim, the men were joined by engineer Samuel A. Medary, Jr. They became the first residents of the town, staying there for the winter. In early 1858, other settlers began to move to the townsite. However, in June 1858, the settlers were driven away by Yankton and Yanktonnia Indians. Medary was abandoned until 1869, when 10 Norwegian settlers traveled from the east and resettled Medary at a location just north of the old townsite. On July 3, 1871, <b>Brookings</b> <b>County</b> was organized in Martin Trygstad's cabin in Medary. The line originally extended to about 2 miles south of Flandreau. The county lines were redrawn by the territorial legislature on January 8, 1873, where they remain today. The first post office in <b>Brookings</b> <b>County</b> was established in 1871 with Trygstad as postmaster. Medary was also the location of the first school sessions in <b>Brookings</b> <b>County,</b> which were held in volunteers' homes.
