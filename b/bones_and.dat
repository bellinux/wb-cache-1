5|$|In 2001, further {{research}} on the fossils was continued by two American scientists sponsored by the American Institute of Indian Studies, New Delhi and the National Geographic Society, U.S.A. The Americans, Paul Sereno and Jeff Wilson, started {{the reconstruction of the}} collection of dinosaur bones gathered in 1983 and 1984. The team of scientists, after a detailed study of the maps prepared earlier by Srivastava, were able to reconstruct the partial skull, left and right hip <b>bones,</b> <b>and</b> a sacrum. They interpreted the part of a skull and a horn as resembling those of dinosaurs found in Madagascar. Fossils of Rajasaurus were also found near Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh. In all, the collected fossils include a partial skull, limb bones, hip <b>bones,</b> <b>and</b> vertebrae.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyl larvae {{are often}} {{distinguished}} by poorly developed <b>bones</b> <b>and</b> {{the presence of}} a hyobranchial apparatus, a series of bones that gills would attach to in life. However, some fully mature temnospondyls also possess hyobranchial bones but did not have external gills. A dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults. Major body changes occur in metamorphosis, including the reshaping and strengthening of skull bones, the thickening of postcranial <b>bones,</b> <b>and</b> an increase in body size.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} the diagnostic value of scans with 99 mTc(V) -dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) to localize <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> joint infection compared with scans using 67 Ga. Methods: Thirty-six patients referred for investigation of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> joint infection were studied. In all patients, a bone scan was obtained initially. Subsequently, comparative scans with 99 mTc(V) -DMSA and 67 Ga were performed 1 wk apart. Microbiological findings, pathologic findings and/or clinical follow-up (until symptoms disappeared) were consid ered to be proof of the presence of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> joint infection. Results: Technetium- 99 m (V) -DMSA showed greater sensitivity and accu racy than 67 Ga in the assessment of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> joint infection, although the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: In comparison with a 67 Ga scan, a 99 rrTc(V) -DMSA scan, in combi nation with a bone scan, is a reliable way to diagnose <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> joint infection. Both tracers were useful in the diagnosis of <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> joint infection. Key Words: technetium- 99 m(V) -dimercaptosuccinic acid; gallium- 67; <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> joint infectio...|$|R

5|$|The Andean condor is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuelan Andes states. It is the national bird of Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. It {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the South American Andean regions, and has been represented in Andean art from c. 2500 BCE onward, and they are a part of indigenous Andean religions. In Andean mythology, the Andean condor was associated with the sun deity, and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world. The Andean condor is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures, and it was believed that the <b>bones</b> <b>and</b> organs of the Andean condor possessed medicinal powers, sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its <b>bones</b> <b>and</b> organs. In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting, a condor is tied to the back of a bull, where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it. The condor generally survives and is set free.|$|E

5|$|The {{human body}} absorbs {{strontium}} {{as if it}} were its lighter congener calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant health threat. The average human has an intake of about two milligrams of strontium a day.

Methods: We systematically searched for terms related to <b>bone</b> <b>and</b> joint disorder in the âDongeuibogam (Dong yibaojian) â, a seminal Korean medicine book.
