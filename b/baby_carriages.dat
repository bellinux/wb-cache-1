25|$|In {{his review}} (collected in The Present as History, 1953) Marxist Paul Sweezy joked that Hayek {{would have you}} believe that if there was an {{over-production}} of <b>baby</b> <b>carriages,</b> the central planners would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The cybernetic arguments of Stafford Beer in his 1974 CBC Massey Lectures, Designing Freedom – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are of interest in this regard, as is the technical work of Herbert A. Simon and Albert Ando on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.|$|E
25|$|As infants grow, food {{supplements}} are added. Many parents choose commercial, ready-made baby foods to supplement breast milk or formula for the child, while others adapt their usual meals for the dietary {{needs of their}} child. Whole cow's milk can be used at one year, but lower-fat milk is not recommended until the child is 2 to 3 years old. Weaning is the process through which breast milk is eliminated from the infant's diet through the introduction of solid foods in exchange for milk. Until they are toilet-trained, infants in industrialized countries wear diapers. The transition from diapers to cloth undergarments is an important transition {{in the development of}} an infant/baby to that of a toddler. Children need more sleep than adults—up to 18 hours for newborn babies, with a declining rate as the child ages. Until babies learn to walk, they are carried in the arms, held in slings or baby carriers, or transported in <b>baby</b> <b>carriages</b> or strollers. Most industrialized countries have laws requiring child safety seats for babies in motor vehicles.|$|E

Similarly, in 1861, a company making <b>baby</b> <b>carriages</b> was set up. These prams were exported to Canada, South America, India and South Africa.|$|E
