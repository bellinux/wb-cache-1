40|$|A {{large number}} of mite species infest animals. Most inhabit the skin, {{feathers}} or mucous membranes, although a few are endoparasites. Many mites are tolerated without consequences unless their populations become very large; other species regularly cause pruritus, mild to severe dermatitis, and hair or feather loss (mites found on the integument), or respiratory signs (air sac mites). Mites such as Sarcoptes scabiei (sarcoptic mange) and Psoroptes ovis (psoroptic mange) can cause significant economic losses in livestock from debilitation and damage to the hides and wool. Secondary bacterial infections and mortality can occur in severe mite infestations, notably during infestation with S. scabiei {{and other members of}} the Sarcoptidae. Sarcoptic mange is also a concern in threatened or fragmented wildlife populations; some populations have experienced severe declines in their numbers after these mites were introduced. Avian mites such as Ornithonyssus sylviarum, Orn, bursa, Dermanyssus gallinae, Knemidokoptes spp. and Sternostoma tracheacolum can cause disease in poultry or pet <b>birds.</b> <b>Mites</b> also affect laboratory and pet rodents, rabbits, exotic animals and reptiles. Humans occasionally become infested with zoonotic mites, which can cause discomfort and dermatitis. A few species can transmit diseases, such as human vesicular rickettsiosis. Mites from animals do not usually survive for very long on humans, and most zoonotic infestations are self-limiting...|$|R
50|$|Some genera of mites {{have adapted}} to infesting the lungs and air-sacs of birds or the lungs of mammals. Cytodites nudus is a typical species of this type. It infests poultry in North America and South Africa and may cause {{reduction}} in productivity of the birds. Another genus of similar <b>bird</b> infesting <b>mites</b> is Laminosioptes. The genus Pneumocoptes has species that infest the lungs of some monkey and rodent species. These mites aggregate in nodules within the lung but signs of clinical disease are not obvious. Pneumonyssus caninum infests the nasal sinuses of dogs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two new species, 1 new {{subspecies}} and 3 {{other species}} of <b>bird</b> nasal <b>mites</b> are described. The dorsal views of Ptilonyssoides novaeguineae (Hirst) and Ptilonyssus trouessarti Hirst are described and illustrated for the first time. Ptilonyssus terpsiphonei and Ptilonyssus estrildicola are recorded from New Guinea for the first time. This paper is based on material collected by the Bishop Museum staff in New Guinea. Ptilonyssoides novaeguineae and Ptilonyssus trouessarti were described by Hirst (1921), and the holotype was redescribed and illustrated by Fain & Hyland (1962). In Hirst's descriptions, he does not mention the dorsal aspect.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between host ecology and feather mite prevalence was analysed in <b>birds.</b> Feather <b>mites</b> are small arthropods (fam. Pterolichoidea and Analgoidea) commonly found on birds, although {{the nature of}} their interactions with the host (commensalism, mutualism or parasitism), still remains unclear. Host body mass and migratory behaviour were unrelated to feather mite prevalence. Contrary to expecta- tion, there was no differences in mite prevalence between colonial and solitary-breed- ing species. However, winter sociality was associated with increased prevalence, suggesting that winter and breeding sociality affected the distribution patterns of feather mites in different ways. Plumage dichromatism was negatively correlated with feather mite prevalence, a result that is opposite to that predicted by the Hamilton and Zuk hypothesis for the evolution of host secondary sexual characteristics in relation to parasitismPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that timber plantations could {{play an important role in}} the conservation of biodiversity in cleared rainforest landscapes, not only because of their potential to cost-effectively reforest large areas of land, but also because they may provide habitat for rainforest plants and animals. However, this last claim is largely untested. In this study, we surveyed the occurrence of a range of animal taxa (<b>birds,</b> lizards and <b>mites)</b> in monoculture and mixed species timber plantations and restoration plantings in tropical and subtropical Australia. We used the richness of 'rainforest-dependent' taxa (i. e., <b>birds,</b> lizards and <b>mites</b> associated with rainforest habitats) in reforested sites as our measure of their 'biodiversity value'. We also examined whether the biodiversity value of reforested sites was correlated with habitat attributes, including plant species richness and vegetation structure and, further, whether biodiversity value was affected by the proximity of reforested sites to intact rainforest. In general, our results showed that 特oung timber plantations (both monoculture and mixed species) supported few rainforest taxa; 牢irds associated with rainforest were poorly represented in young timber plantations, but moderately common in restoration plantings; 牦ew rainforest lizards were recorded in young reforested sites, except for restoration plantings in the tropics; 牲ainforest mites were generally detected more frequently in restoration plantings than cabinet timber plantations, while the richness of rainforest mites in monoculture plantations varied between regions; 牴he richness of rainforest birds in young reforested sites was positively correlated with plant species diversity and structural complexity; similar correlations were observed for rainforest lizards in the tropics; 牲ainforest mite richness was poorly correlated with measured habitat variables; and monoculture plantations close to intact forest tended to support more rainforest <b>birds,</b> lizards and <b>mites</b> than isolated plantations. These results suggest that plantations are likely to have limited value for rainforest taxa under conditions which often characterise broadscale reforestation: i. e., when plantations are established on cleared land, at some distance from intact forest and when plantations are managed intensively for timber production. Management of plantations for their faunal biodiversity values is likely to require the development of explicit design, management and harvest protocols, such as the incorporation of habitat features into plantations and/ or the reservation or restoration of native forest on part of the plantation estate.

5000|$|This is {{typically}} caused by sarcoptic mites. Sarcoptes scabiei is an example: it infests {{many species of}} mammals, including humans. Other common sarcoptic mites are in the genus Notoedres, and the genus Knemidokoptes (or Cnemidocoptes) which infest <b>birds.</b> Sarcoptic <b>mites</b> as adults are microscopic, nearly circular in outline, and their legs are short, adapted for burrowing. The females, after mating with males {{on the surface of}} their host's skin, burrow into the living layers of the epidermis (mainly the stratum spinosum). They make long tunnels horizontal {{to the surface of the}} skin. Eggs are laid in the tunnels and development of larvae and nymphs occurs in such tunnels. The feeding of the mites and their excretory products irritates and inflames the skin, causing intense pruritus. Dermal hypersensitivity reactions will develop in the host. Chronic infestations lead to thickening of the skin by overproduction of epidermal cells (acanthosis), resulting in a characteristic depilated and scaly appearance. Stress caused by the pruritus can be severe, and will result in lost productivity of most species of livestock animals. Camels are prone to severe infestation and wild animals such as foxes may die from sarcoptes infestation.|$|R
40|$|Many {{factors may}} affect {{symbiont}} distributions within host populations.

We investigated correlates of variation {{in the number of}} feather mites, Trouessartia sp. (Trouessartiidae), per individual in the Seychelles Warbler Acrocephalus sechellensis on Cousin Island. Warblers from territories exposed to high levels of salt sprat had lower feather mite loads than warblers from territories unaffected by salt spray. and juveniles had higher mite loads than adults. When the effects of salt spray were controlled for statistically, incubating <b>birds</b> had lower <b>mite</b> loads than <b>birds</b> in other stages of reproduction.

40|$|Abstract. The {{authors have}} {{established}} that oribatid mites (Acariformes, Oribatei) are transmitted by birds. More than 2, 100 birds of 150 species from different ecological groups were surveyed. 180 species of live oribatid mites {{were collected from}} bird feathers. Some oribatid mite species live in bird feathers constantly. The authors assume that oribatid mites feed not on the particles of the skin, but on fungi inhabiting bird feathers, as all oribatid mites are mycophagous. Oribatid mites were found in different forms of their lifecycle. It has been established that they reproduce in bird feathers. Transmis-sion of these microarthropods by birds may be a principle cause of their distribution, especially in the remote Arctic areas, on the Oceanic islands, and in the oases of deserts.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of feather mites (Astigmata) along {{the wing of}} passerine birds could change dramatically within minutes because of the rapid movement of mites between feathers. However, no rigorous study has answered how fine-tuned is the pattern of {{distribution of}} feather mites at a given time. Here we present a multiscale study {{of the distribution of}} feather mites on the wing of non-moulting blackcaps Sylvia atricapilla in a short time period and at a single locality. We found that the number and distribution of <b>mites</b> differed among <b>birds,</b> but it was extremely similar between the wings of each <b>bird.</b> Moreover, <b>mites</b> consistently avoided the first secondary feather, despite that it is placed at the centre of the feathers most used by them. Thus, our results suggest that feather mites do precise, feather-level decisions on where to live, contradicting the current view that mites perform ‘‘mass’’, or ‘‘blind’’ movements across wing feathers. Moreover, our findings indicate that ‘‘rare’’ distributions are not spurious data or sampling errors, but each distribution of mites on the wing of each bird is the outcome of the particular conditions operating on each ambient-bird-feather mite system at a given time. This study indicates that {{we need to focus on}} the distribution of feather mites at the level of the individual bird and at the feather level to improve our understanding of the spatial ecology of mites on the wings of birds.

40|$|Based on the HACCP {{principles}} {{the objective}} of this work was to identify the critical points of control in a feed mill to real capacity of production at 1, 000 ton. day- 1, located in the southwest of Brazil.   The presence of <b>birds,</b> rodents, insects, <b>mites</b> and fungi in the products, by-products, as well as internal and external areas of the industry were evaluated. The samplings of products and traps installation were the techniques utilized for the control. In addition, the receiving, pre-cleaning, drying and storage of corn, as well as dosage and mixing of feed were characterized the critical steps in the control of contamination. Furthermore, birds and rodents were the main contaminants observed during the production process, however, the high population of insects and fungal colonies found in the products meant the greatest risk of contamination to the final product. In conclusion, the use of Good Storage Practices and Manufacturing, trap installation, as well as intense cleaning and sanitation processes are immediate and efficiencies alternatives in the contamination control in feed mills...|$|R
40|$|A common {{assumption}} of studies examining host-symbiont interactions {{is that all}} symbiotic organisms are parasitic. Feather mites are widespread symbionts of birds that {{do not appear to}} deplete the host of any vital resources. Instead they feed on the oily secretions that cover the feathers and the detritus caught in these secretions. Therefore, a more logical assumption might be that feather mites are non-parasitic. We investigated whether infestation by a feather mite, Trouessartia sp. (Trouessartiidae), has any detrimental effects on the Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis. Feather mite load was not correlated with body condition. Survivorship of birds per territory was lower for <b>birds</b> with lower <b>mite</b> loads, but this result is explained by these birds also living in low-quality territories with low food availability. The amount of time birds spent grooming was not related to feather mite load and grooming did not decrease following the experimental removal of mites. Additionally, although males groom more than females, they do not have larger mite loads than females. Although this study is largely non-experimental, the combined results indicate that the relationship between these feather mites and the Seychelles warbler is probably benign. ...|$|R
40|$|Avian nasal mites are obligate endoparasites that {{spend their}} entire {{life in the}} {{respiratory}} system of birds. In North America, <b>bird</b> nasal <b>mites</b> are represented by different unrelated families in three different orders of mites: Rhinonyssidae (Mesostigmata), Ereynetidae (Prostigmata), and the Cytoditidae and Turbinoptidae (Astigmata). The most-diverse and most-abundant family of nasal mites is the Rhinonyssidae, in which mite species may have different levels of host specificity from host orders to families or even species level. Nasal mites in North America have been surveyed in different locations, such as studies ranging from the Gulf Coast of the US to Canada. From those surveys, the reported prevalence of nasal <b>mites</b> infesting <b>bird</b> hosts varied from approximately 25 - 45 % of species that were infested. In this study, I examined birds from three states in the US (Arkansas, Illinois and Texas) for nasal mites. I found levels of mite prevalence that were similar to results reported from other previous studies, and I added 21 new North American host records. I also studied host specificity within the bird families Parulidae and Emberizidae. I examined 149 birds from those two bird families, and 38 % of the species had nasal mites. These two host families were commonly infested by two Ptilonyssus nasal mites (P. sairae and P. japuibensis), which {{are part of a}} group of morphologically similar mites called the “sairae” complex. This complex suggest that all these related mite species could actually be a single mite species with a broad host range, or could be a related group of species, each of which is highly of specific. Additionally, I surveyed nasal mites collected from the brood parasite, brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater), in specimens from Texas and Arkansas. For this survey, 126 individuals were analyzed, and 84 (66. 6 %) were found to be infested with nasal mites, which included new host records for the cowbirds. I addressed the question of whether cowbirds acquire nasal mites when the host parent is feeding its young, or whether mites are transferred during Social interaction of related birds that are commonly found in large, multi-species flocks...|$|R
40|$|Translocation, introduction, reintroduction, and {{assisted}} migrations are species conservation {{strategies that are}} attracting increasing attention, especially {{in the face of}} climate change. However, preventing the extinction of the suite of dependent species whose host species are threatened is seldom considered, and the effects on dependent species of moving threatened hosts are unclear. There is no published guidance on how to decide whether to move species, given this uncertainty. We examined the dependent-host system of 4 disparate taxonomic groups: insects on the feather-leaf banksia (Banksia brownii), montane banksia (B. montana), and Stirling Range beard heath (Leucopogon gnaphalioides); parasites of wild cats; mites and ticks on Duvaucel's gecko (Hoplodactylus duvaucelii) and tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus); and internal coccidian parasites of Cirl Bunting (Emberiza cirlus) and Hihi (Notiomystis cincta). We used these case studies to demonstrate a simple process for use in species- and community-level assessments of efforts to conserve dependents with their hosts. The insects dependent on Stirling Range beard heath and parasites on tigers (Panthera tigris) appeared to represent assemblages that would not be conserved by ex situ host conservation. In contrast, for the cases of dependent species we examined involving a single dependent species (internal parasites of <b>birds</b> and the <b>mite</b> Geckobia naultina on Duvaucel's gecko), ex situ conservation of the host species would also conserve the dependent species. However, moving dependent species with their hosts may be insufficient to maintain viable populations of the dependent species, and additional conservation strategies such as supplementing populations may be needed. 9 page(s...|$|R
