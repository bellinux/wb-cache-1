5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support his struggle against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key <b>backer</b> of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical to the defense of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{examines}} {{the relations between}} Danish computer game developers and their <b>backers,</b> as they occur in projects crowdfunded on Kickstarter through reward based-crowdfunding. With a sociocultural perspective and a phenomenological hermeneutic approach, the thesis explores in a micro perspective, the nexus between the economic and cultural production modes, which constitutes reward crowdfunding. By employing a qualitative research method, {{in the form of}} an online focus group interview with five <b>backers,</b> and four separate offline interviews with game developers, the thesis {{examines the}} communication between developers and <b>backers</b> and the collaborative tendencies to which crowdfunding campaigns often refer, by drawing on the notions of participatory culture, collective knowledge, co-creativity and gift-economy. Furthermore, the thesis explores the underlying motivations for developers and <b>backers</b> using crowdfunding. In our study, we found that crowdfunding constitutes more than a regular trade exchange. We discovered that within a game development sphere, crowdfunding emulates crowdsourcing by including problem-solving approaches by the aid of a community to the benefit of both <b>backers</b> and developers. Both <b>backers</b> and developers are governed by non-monetary intrinsic motivations, and though the developers enjoys extrinsic monetary benefits from crowdfunding, none of the <b>backers</b> addressed this as an issue. With the aforementioned relationship, <b>backers</b> who pledge money to a crowdfunding project and perform tasks for said project, willingly pay to work for the developers. While this presents a potential exploitative business model, our <b>backers</b> in question raised no concern on the subject. Our study showed, that both parties value the relations enabled by crowdfunding, and they see it as mutually beneficial...|$|R
