25|$|Evacuation aids (suppositories or enemas) e.g. {{glycerine}} or bisacodyl suppositories may be prescribed. People {{may have}} poor resting {{tone of the}} anal canal, and consequently {{may not be able}} to retain an enema, in which case transanal irrigation (retrograde anal irrigation) may be a better option, as this equipment utilizes an inflatable catheter to prevent loss of the irrigation tip and to provide a water tight seal during irrigation. A volume of lukewarm water is gently pumped into the colon via the anus. People can be taught how to perform this treatment in their own homes, but it does require special equipment. If the irrigation is efficient, stool will not reach the rectum again for up to 48 hours. By regularly emptying the bowel using transanal irrigation, controlled bowel function is often re-established to a high degree in patients with <b>bowel</b> <b>incontinence</b> and/or constipation. This enables control over the time and place of evacuation and development of a consistent bowel routine. However, persistent leaking of residual irrigation fluid during the day may occur and make this option unhelpful, particularly in persons with obstructed defecation syndrome who may have incomplete evacuation of any rectal contents. Consequently, the best time to carry out the irrigation is typically in the evening, allowing any residual liquid to be passed the next morning before leaving the home. Complications such as electrolyte imbalance and perforation are rare. The effect of transanal irrigation varies considerably. Some individuals experience complete control of incontinence, and other report little or no benefit. It has been suggested that if appropriate, people be offered home retrograde anal irrigation.|$|E
2500|$|By the {{conclusion}} of this first run of leucotomies in February 1936, Moniz and Lima had operated on twenty patients with an average period of one week between each procedure; Moniz published his findings with great haste in March of the same year. The patients were aged between 27 and 62 years of age; twelve were female and eight were male. Nine of the patients were diagnosed as suffering from depression, six from schizophrenia, two from panic disorder, and one each from mania, catatonia and manic-depression with the most prominent symptoms being anxiety and agitation. The duration of the illness prior to the procedure varied from as little as four weeks {{to as much as}} 22 years, although all but four had been ill for at least one year. Patients were normally operated on the day they arrived at Moniz's clinic and returned within ten days to the Miguel Bombarda Mental Hospital. A perfunctory post-operative follow-up assessment took place anywhere from one to ten weeks following surgery. Complications were observed in each of the leucotomy patients and included: [...] "increased temperature, vomiting, bladder and <b>bowel</b> <b>incontinence,</b> diarrhea, and ocular affections such as ptosis and nystagmus, as well as psychological effects such as apathy, akinesia, lethargy, timing and local disorientation, kleptomania, and abnormal sensations of hunger". Moniz asserted that these effects were transitory and, according to his published assessment, the outcome for these first twenty patients was that 35%, or seven cases, improved significantly, another 35% were somewhat improved and the remaining 30% (six cases) were unchanged. There were no deaths and he did not consider that any patients had deteriorated following leucotomy.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the review}} was to {{summarize}} the longitudinal changes in bowel dysfunction among patients with rectal cancer within {{the first five years}} following sphincter-preserving resection. Methods: A series of literature searches were conducted on six English-language electronic databases. Articles published after 1990 were searched. A total of 29 articles (reporting 27 studies) was found. Results: Bowel dysfunction, including an alteration in the frequency of <b>bowel</b> movements, <b>incontinence,</b> abnormal sensations, and difficulties with evacuation, is reported among patients with rectal cancer within the first five years after sphincter-preserving resection. These problems are most frequent and severe within the first year, especially within the first six months, and stabilize after one year. Some of the problems may last for years. Conclusion: Supportive care for bowel dysfunction is needed, and should include the provision of information and psychological support delivered in multiple steps.
