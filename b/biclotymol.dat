The treatment was carried on in two ways: the first group of patients (22 children) was made of those, who received or dispersible pills, containing <b>biclotymol,</b> lysozyme and enoxolone; while in the therapy of children from the second group (24 children) they additionally used <b>biclotymol</b> {{in the form of a}} dosing spray. The treatment efficiency proved to be comparable, yet in spite of somewhat subjectively worse to lerance of the combined therapy its application is statistically reliable to quickly improve the pharyngoscopical picture and remove the pain syndrome.

40|$|Introduction. <b>Biclotymol</b> [bis(chloro- 4 -thymol) methyl] is a biphenol {{derivative}} {{used for}} local treatment of pharyngeal inflammatory diseases. It is an antiseptic drug with bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects. Objective: {{evaluation of the}} drug’s antibacterial activity towards opportunistic and normal oropharyngeal microflora and identification of its minimum bactericidal concentration for the main bacterial pathogens of the upper respiratory tract. Results: we revealed that antibacterial effect of <b>biclotymol</b> on mouth cavity microbiota manifests itself with elimination of such species and genera of opportunistic microflora as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus spp. and anginosus streptococci. We also revealed antibacterial activity of <b>biclotymol</b> against normal microbiota representatives, which included viridans streptococci. Out of this group of streptococci, only 1 / 3 of the initial amount of Streptococcus salivarius remained in place. Alongside identification of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <b>biclotymol</b> against opportunistic microflora we revealed the most sensitive bacteria requiring the lesser drug concentration for the antibacterial effect to take place – Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae; intermediate – Moraxella catarrhalis, S. pyogenes and S. aureus; and resistant – non-pathogenic Neisseria species. Among the strains that survived <b>biclotymol</b> exposure, MIC was the highest in Neisseria spp. – 20 mg/ml after a 30 ‑minute-long exposure. Conclusions: results of a study of antibacterial effect of a topical antiseptic containing <b>biclotymol</b> demonstrated that the drug’s bactericidal activity is primarily aimed at gram-positive cocci represented both by opportunistic and non-pathogenic microbes. Non-pathogenic Neisseria species abundantly inhabiting mouth cavity mucosae and gram-negative rod-like microbes, which are uncharacteristic of the biotope under study, appeared to be resistant to bactericidal effect of <b>biclotymol.</b> Preservation of these microbes may somewhat prevent oropharyngeal colonization by undesirable pathogenic species. </p...|$|E
40|$|We employ {{dielectric}} spectroscopy {{to monitor}} the relaxation dynamics and crystallization kinetics of the <b>Biclotymol</b> antiseptic in its amorphous phase. The glass transition temperature of the material as determined by dielectric spectroscopy is Tg= 290 ± 1 K. The primary (a) relaxation dynamics is observed to follow a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann temperature dependence, with a kinetic fragility index m= 86 ± 13, which classifies <b>Biclotymol</b> as a relatively fragile glass former. A secondary relaxation is also observed, corresponding to an intramolecular dynamic process of the non-rigid <b>Biclotymol</b> molecule. The crystallization kinetics, measured at four different temperatures above the glass transition temperature, follows an Avrami behavior with exponent virtually equal to n= 2, indicating one-dimensional crystallization into needle-like crystallites, as experimentally observed, with a time-constant nucleation rate. The activation barrier for crystallization {{is found to be}} Ea= 115 ± 22 kJmol(- 1) Postprint (author's final draft...|$|E
