40|$|Conflict and {{competition}} often impose costs on both winners and losers, and conflicting parties may prefer {{to resolve the}} dispute before it occurs. The equilibrium of a conflict game with side-payments predicts that with <b>binding</b> <b>offers,</b> proposers make and responders accept side-payments, generating settlements that strongly favor proposers. When side-payments are non-binding, proposers offer nothing and conflicts always arise. Laboratory experiments confirm that binding side-payments reduce conflicts. However, 30 % of responders reject <b>binding</b> <b>offers,</b> and offers are more egalitarian than predicted. Surprisingly, non-binding side-payments also improve efficiency, although less than binding. With binding side-payments, 87 % of efficiency gains come from avoided conflicts. However, with non-binding side-payments, only 39 % of gains come from avoided conflicts and 61 % from reduced conflict expenditures. ...|$|R
2500|$|Contract law {{concerns}} enforceable promises, and can {{be summed}} up in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept). In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: offer and acceptance, consideration and the intention to create legal relations. In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get £100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally <b>binding</b> <b>offer.</b> It was an invitation to treat, mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a reasonable man Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, [...] "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the [...] "distinct inconvenience" [...] of using a faulty product. [...] "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said Lord Justice Lindley, [...] "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".|$|E

This indicates that antioestrogen receptor antibodies recognise oestrogen receptors but not type II oestrogen binding sites.
