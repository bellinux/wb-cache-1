25|$|The Fairfield Osborn Preserve is a 450 acre {{nature reserve}} {{situated}} on the northwest flank of Sonoma Mountain in Sonoma County, California. There are eight plant communities within the property, oak woodland being the dominant type. Other communities include chaparral, Douglas fir woodland, native <b>Bunch</b> <b>grass,</b> freshwater marsh, vernal pool, pond and riparian woodland. The flora is extremely diverse including many native trees, shrubs, wildflowers, grasses, lichens and mosses. A diverse fauna inhabits this area including black-tailed deer, coyote, bobcat and an occasional mountain lion; moreover, there are abundant avifauna (including some neotropical migrants), amphibians, reptiles and insects.|$|E
40|$|Premise of research. African grass {{communities}} {{are dominated by}} two distinct functional types: tall, caespitose <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> and short, spreading lawn grasses. Functional type coexistence has been explained by differences in defoliation tolerance, because lawn grasses occur in intensively grazed areas while <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> are less associated with heavy grazing. If different responses to tissue loss explain their distribution, expectations are that biomass production and leaf-level physiology will be negatively impacted in bunch relative to lawn grasses. Methodology. We tested the influence of defoliation on three lawn and three <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> from Tanzania and South Africa by quantifying growth and measuring physiological response of these grasses to simulated herbivory in a glasshouse experiment. Specifically, we measured photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance, leaf dry matter content (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen, and leaf pigment concentrations in leaves of <b>bunch</b> and lawn <b>grasses</b> that were clipped or unclipped. Pivotal results. In contrast to our expectations, clipped lawn and <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> {{did not differ in}} photosynthesis, leaf nitrogen, or biomass production, and both lawn and <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> upregulated photosynthesis in response to clipping. However, defoliated <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> had higher rates of stomatal conductance and transpiration compared with defoliated lawn grasses. Also, leaf carotenoid concentrations increased in response to clipping for both functional types but much more in bunch than in lawn grasses. An analysis of leaf-level physiological relationships with structural equation modeling showed that lawn and <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> exert control over carbon gain in different ways. In <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses,</b> net carbon gain was associated with leaf-level structural properties (LDMC and SLA) that varied in response to defoliation, while in lawn grasses, increased carbon gain was the result of increased leaf [N] subsequent to defoliation. Conclusions.  The varied responses of lawn and <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> to defoliation appear to arise from their different investments in defense and carbon assimilation subsequent to defoliation. <b>Bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> invest relatively more in carotenoid production, likely as a mechanism to enhance regrowth and protect costly leaves from photodamage. Moreover, <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> maintain efficient carbon assimilation by structural adjustments in leaves (decreasing LDMC subsequent to defoliation), while lawn grasses maintain efficient water use by increasing leaf [N] subsequent to defoliation. Thus, we conclude that a key difference between lawn and <b>bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> is not defoliation tolerance per se but physiological adaptations that constrain them to environments with different moisture availability subsequent to defoliation.

60|$|Onward, therefore, {{the little}} band urged their way, keeping along {{the course of}} a stream called John Day's Creek. The cold was so intense that they had {{frequently}} to dismount and travel on foot, lest they should freeze in their saddles. The days which at this season are short enough even in the open prairies, were narrowed to a few hours by the high mountains, which allowed the travellers but a brief enjoyment of the cheering rays of the sun. The snow was generally at least twenty inches in depth, and in many places much more: those who dismounted had to beat their way with toilsome steps. Eight miles were considered a good day's journey. The horses were almost famished; for the herbage was covered by the deep snow, so that they had nothing to subsist upon but scanty wisps of the dry <b>bunch</b> <b>grass</b> which peered above the surface, and the small branches and twigs of frozen willows and wormwood.|$|E
60|$|Of all {{his late}} party, he now {{retained}} with him merely {{a small number}} of free trappers, with whom he intended to sojourn among the Nez Perces and Flatheads, and adopt the Indian mode of moving with the game and grass. Those bands, in effect, shortly afterward broke up their encampments and set off for a less beaten neighborhood. Captain Bonneville remained behind for a few days, that he might secretly prepare caches, in which to deposit everything not required for current use. Thus lightened of all superfluous encumbrance, he set off on the 20th of November to rejoin his Indian allies. He found them encamped in a secluded part of the country, {{at the head of a}} small stream. Considering themselves out of all danger in this sequestered spot from their old enemies, the Blackfeet, their encampment manifested the most negligent security.

60|$|Encamping at {{the west}} Bute, they found a place swept by the winds, {{so that it was}} bare of snow, and there was {{abundance}} of <b>bunch</b> <b>grass.</b> Here the horses were turned loose to graze throughout the night. Though for once they had ample pasturage, yet the keen winds were so intense that, in the morning, a mule was found frozen to death. The trappers gathered round and mourned over him as over a cherished friend. They feared their half-famished horses would soon share his fate, for there seemed scarce blood enough left in their veins to withstand the freezing cold. To beat the way further through the snow with these enfeebled animals seemed next to impossible; and despondency began to creep over their hearts, when, fortunately, they discovered a trail made by some hunting party. Into this they immediately entered, and proceeded with less difficulty. Shortly afterward, a fine buffalo bull came bounding across the snow and was instantly brought down by the hunters. A fire was soon blazing and crackling, and an ample repast soon cooked, and sooner dispatched; after which they made some further progress and then encamped. One of the men reached the camp nearly frozen to death; but good cheer and a blazing fire gradually restored life, and put his blood in circulation.|$|E

The green of their foliage somewhat resembled cedars, but their berries were gray-blue, almost lavender in color. I tasted several from different trees, until I found one with sweet, somewhat acrid taste. Significant it was that this juniper had broken branches where bears had climbed to eat the fruit, and all around on the ground beneath was bear sign. Edd said the tracks were cold, but all the same he had to be harsh with the hounds to hold them in. I counted twenty piles of bear manure under one juniper, and many places where bears had scraped in the soft earth and needles.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to test the relationships between Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and remotely sensed vegetation indices for AGB assessments in the Kimberley area in Western Australia. For 19 different sites, vegetation indices were derived from eight Landsat ETM+ scenes over a period of two years (2011 – 2013). The sites were divided into three groups (Open plains, <b>Bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> and Spinifex) based on similarities in dominant vegetation types. Dry and green biomass fractions were measured at these sites. Single and multiple regression relationships between vegetation indices and green and total AGB were calibrated and validated using a "leave site out" cross validation. Four tests were compared: (1) relationships between AGB and vegetation indices combining all sites; (2) separate relationships per site group; (3) multiple regressions including selected vegetation indices per site group; and (4) as in 3 but including rainfall and elevation data. Results indicate that relationships based on single vegetation indices are moderately accurate for green biomass in wide open plains covered with annual grasses. The cross-validation results for green AGB improved for a combination of indices for the Open plains and <b>Bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> sites, but not for Spinifex sites. When rainfall and elevation data are included, cross validation improved slightly with a Q 2 of 0. 49 – 0. 72 for Open plains and <b>Bunch</b> <b>grasses</b> sites respectively. Cross validation results for total AGB were moderately accurate (Q 2 of 0. 41) for Open plains but weak or absent for other site groups despite good calibration results, indicating strong influence of site-specific factors...|$|R
