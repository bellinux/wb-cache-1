5|$|The Delaware State Route System {{includes}} Delaware's {{portion of}} the Interstate Highway System and U.S. Highway System along with state routes. The system also includes special routes of the U.S. and state routes, such as alternate, business, and truck routes. These routes consist of a banner denoting the type of special route above the route marker. Alternate routes provide a second alignment of a route between two points. DE 10 Alternate provides an alternate routing to DE 10 between Willow Grove and Rising Sun by passing through Woodside while DE 10 passes through Camden. Business routes pass through the <b>business</b> <b>area</b> of a city while the main route bypasses it. DE 1 Business passes through the central portion of Milford while DE 1 bypasses {{the city to the}} east. Truck routes provide an alternate route for trucks around a certain portion of a route. DE 14 Truck provides a route for truck traffic that bypasses the section of DE 14 that passes through Harrington. Suffixed routes also exist for short alignments that branch off their parent routes, in which a letter suffix is added after the route number. DE 1 has three suffixed routes in the Rehoboth Beach area while DE 9A provides access to the Port of Wilmington from DE 9. In addition to these systems are other state roads designated with a maintenance road number.|$|E

The highway runs along Savidge Street and crosses a bridge over the channel that connect the river with Spring Lake. On the opposite shore, the trunkline continues along Savidge Street, running between the river to its south and the lake to its north. M-104 crosses the central <b>business</b> <b>area</b> of the village of Spring Lake. East of downtown, the highway transitions to follow Cleveland Street which continues due east to Nunica. The landscape becomes more rural east of Spring Lake where the highway crosses terrain with a mix of open fields and woods. There are various businesses and homes that line the roadway. The eastern terminus of M-104 is located at the exit9 interchange along I-96 just west of Nunica.|$|E
5|$|US10 {{enters the}} state after it crosses Lake Michigan from Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to Ludington. Traffic is carried {{across the lake}} {{during the summer months}} on the SS Badger, a privately owned carferry. Heading eastward from the ferry, the highway runs along Pere Marquette Lake and then northward through a light {{industrial}} area along James Street in Ludington. At the intersection with Ludington Avenue in the downtown <b>business</b> <b>area,</b> the trunkline turns to the east. US10 runs through commercial and residential areas on its course out of town. Near the Mason County Airport, the highway intersects the northern end of Business US31 (Bus. US31, Pere Marquette Highway). About {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) east of that intersection, US10 meets the interchange that marks the northern end of the US31 freeway in the state. From here to Scottville, the two highways run concurrently together through a mix of rural fields and forests. On the west side of town, US31 turns northward along the Scottville Bypass, and US10 continues through the middle of town on State Street. The road heads eastward roughly parallel to the Pere Marquette River. Near Custer, US10 crosses into the Manistee National Forest.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) is a {{business}} loop serving Pontiac and Auburn Hills. It uses portions of former Business M-24 (Bus. M-24) through town. The highway starts as an eight-lane freeway at an interchange on I-75 in Bloomfield Township. The freeway continues past an interchange with Opdyke Road to end at Square Lake Road, dropping to six lanes. BL I-75 continues to M-1 at Woodward Avenue. Square Lake Road continues to the west as Bus. US24, BL I-75 turns northwesterly along the eight-lane divided Woodward Avenue, running concurrently with Bus. US24 into downtown Pontiac. At {{the south side of}} downtown, Woodward drops to six lanes the two directions of Woodward Avenue split and form a four-lane loop. The Woodward Avenue Loop encircles downtown Pontiac, and it is crossed by the eastbound direction of M-59 running on Huron Street. One block north, the westbound direction of M-59 runs along University Drive and turns to follow BL I-75/Bus. US24 (Woodward Avenue Loop). The loop intersects Perry Street another block further north, and BL I-75 turns northeasterly onto the two-way Perry Street. BL I-75 passes through residential areas and a minor <b>business</b> <b>area</b> along the four-lane Perry Street. Outside of the downtown area, Perry Street widens to include a center turn lane. North of Walton Boulevard in Auburn Hills, the street name changes to Lapeer Road. BL I-75 intersects Opdyke Road a couple hundred feet west of I-75 before crossing the freeway. Lapeer Road continues as a six-lane, divided roadway to the ramps of a double trumpet interchange, where the BL I-75 designation ends. The roadway however, continues as M-24 providing access to the Palace of Auburn Hills. On average each day in 2013, 9,829vehicles use the business loop between the two M-59 junctions, and 73,795vehicles do so on the freeway stub east of Opdyke Road, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E

5|$|Immediately after CR 557 joins US 40, {{the road}} enters Buena, Atlantic County and {{continues}} southeast into inhabited areas. After {{running through the}} commercial center of town, the road comes to the southern terminus of Route 54 and {{the eastern end of}} CR 619 in a <b>business</b> <b>area</b> located on the outskirts. At this point, it enters Buena Vista Township, and CR 557 splits form US 40 by heading to the southeast on Buena-Tuckahoe Road. From this point, US 40 becomes concurrent with CR 557 Truck and enters dense woodland containing homes and businesses as well as occasional farms. The road reaches the residential community of Richland, where it encounters the eastern terminus of CR 540 and CR 622 and crosses a Conrail Shared Assets Operations railroad line. Upon leaving Richland, the route crosses into Hamilton Township, where it runs through Mizpah before heading back into forested areas and a few residential sectors. US 40 intersects the eastern terminus of CR 552, briefly becoming a divided highway before turning east into denser inhabited areas. The highway intersects CR 559 Truck/CR 606, at which point it becomes concurrent with CR 559 Truck. The route meets Route 50, where CR 557 Truck splits to the south. Route 50 joins US 40 before the road crosses the Great Egg Harbor River. Upon crossing the river, the road enters Mays Landing and turns north into the downtown area. CR 559 Truck splits southbound to follow CR 617 to the east. A short distance later, the road meets CR 559 and US 40 splits from Route 50 by turning east onto that route. This intersection marks the beginning of CR 559 Truck northbound. The road passes more development before CR 559 splits from the road by heading southeast. US 40 heads east out of Mays Landing, where it continues through woodland and increasing residential development. The road widens into four lanes as it comes to US 322 (Black Horse Pike) near the Hamilton Mall. At this point, US 40 forms a concurrency with US 322, which lasts {{for the remainder of the}} route.|$|E

25|$|Dr. James Day, an El Paso historian, {{said that}} downtown's main <b>business</b> <b>area</b> was {{originally}} centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue.

Several African Americans and around 300 Chinese Americans also lived in Chihuahuita. Many of the Chinese Americans participated in the building of railroads in the El Paso area.

25|$|Lippstadt was {{not used}} as an active RAF base and {{eventually}} the destroyed airfield and its facilities were completely removed. The British Army constructed a new garrison (Camp El Alamein) spreading a mean part of the former airfield. From 1958 to 2007 the Bundeswehr used the garrison as Lipperland-Kaserne. The surroundings including the Luftwaffe garrison was used for creating new urban settlements in the late 1940s/early 1950s. Since 2013 an investor is rising a <b>business</b> <b>area</b> {{in the northern part}} and family homes in the south of the area of the former Bundeswehr garrison.
