40|$|The vast {{majority}} of world trade is carried by the sea shipping industry and petroleum is still the major energy source. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is an urgent need for both industry and government to promote green shipping. To move shipping towards a more environmentally and financially sustainable future, we consider to develop an integrated fleet deployment and <b>bunker</b> <b>management</b> model in this paper. The fleet deployment refers to the decisions on which ships to operate on which route, at what speed and what cargos to be transported. The <b>bunker</b> <b>management</b> refers to the decision on which ships to bunker on which port and at what volume. A more realistic fuel consumption function with considering not only cruise speed but also freight tonnage on board is adopted in the proposed optimization model, which can further improve its effectiveness in practice. An efficient algorithm termed "Most Promising Area Search" (MPAS) is developed afterwards to solve the corresponding mixed integer programming problem, which can guarantee to converge to a local optimal solution. The benefits of the integrated model and the computational performance of the MPAS are illustrated by numerical examples and a case study...|$|E
40|$|Maritime <b>bunker</b> <b>management</b> (MBM) {{controls}} the procurement {{and consumption of}} the fuels used on board and therefore manages {{one of the most}} important cost drivers in the shipping industry. At the operational level, a shipping company needs to manage its fuel consumption by making optimal routing and speed decisions for each voyage. But since fuel prices are highly volatile, a shipping company sometimes also needs to do tactical fuel hedging in the forward market to control risk and cost volatility. From an operations research perspective, it is customary to think of tactical and operational decisions as tightly linked. However, the existing literature on MBM normally focuses on only one of these two levels, rather than taking an integrated point of view. This is in line with how shipping companies operate; tactical and operational <b>bunker</b> <b>management</b> decisions are made in isolation. We develop a stochastic programming model involving both tactical and operational decisions in MBM in order to minimize the total expected fuel costs, controlled for financial risk, within a planning period. This paper points out that after the latest regulation of the Sulphur Emission Control Areas (SECA) came into force in 2015, an integration of the tactical and operational levels in MBM has become important for shipping companies whose business deals with SECA. The results of the computational study shows isolated decision making on either tactical or operational level in MBM will lead to various problem. Nevertheless, the most server consequence occurs when tactical decisions are made in isolation...|$|E

40|$|The {{shipping}} industry {{carries over}} 90 {{percent of the}} world’s trade, and is hence {{a major contributor to}} CO 2 and other airborne emissions. As a global effort to reduce air pollution from ships, the implementation of the ECA (Emission Control Areas) regulations has given rise to the wide usage of cleaner fuels. This has led to an increased emphasis on the management and risk control of maritime bunker costs for many shipping companies. In this paper, we provide a novel view on the relationship between <b>bunker</b> risk <b>management</b> and CO 2 emissions. In particular, we investigate how different actions taken in <b>bunker</b> risk <b>management,</b> based on different risk aversions and fuel hedging strategies, impact a shipping company’s CO 2 emissions. We use a stochastic programming model and perform various comparison tests in a case study based on a major liner company. Our results show that a shipping company’s risk attitude on bunker costs have impacts on its CO 2 emissions. We also demonstrate that, by properly designing its hedging strategies, a shipping company can sometimes achieve noticeable CO 2 reduction with little financial sacrifice...|$|R

The research includes bunkering port selection (where to bunker), bunkering amounts and ship speed adjustment. The main reason to take all these elements into account is that these three components are interrelated. In the research, a theoretical model is developed on which an optimization of the three above-mentioned parameters is performed. The optimization in their research is done based on the fuel cost and {{does not take into}} account which parameters might affect the decision to bunker at a certain port.|$|R

40|$|Master of Landscape ArchitectureDepartment of Landscape Architecture/Regional and Community PlanningWilliam P. Winslow IIISand bunkers serve {{multiple}} {{roles as}} {{components in the}} game of golf and golf course design. Bunkers began on early Scottish linksland courses as natural areas of exposed sand. However, as golf has grown since those early beginnings centuries ago, bunkers have become designed, constructed and maintained elements of the course. Significant resources are now used to build and maintain bunkers, in some cases more than are used on greens. As economic factors cause those in the golf business to search for opportunities to be more efficient, <b>bunker</b> maintenance and <b>management</b> plays a key role. This study identifies and analyzes the factors that are most important to bunker design, maintenance and management. It also examines the <b>bunker</b> design – <b>management</b> relationship and the impacts that bunker design decisions have on golf course management. 	A survey questionnaire targeted toward golf course designers and golf course superintendents was used to obtain opinions and statistical data pertaining to the study. A total of 109 completed surveys were returned. Survey responses were used to determine: 1. The importance of bunkers 2. Bunkers’ roles and characteristics 3. The most important factors related to bunker design and maintenance 4. The reasoning behind undertaking bunker modification projects 5. The degree of involvement among parties involved in bunker design and 		 construction. Additional analysis was undertaken to determine potentially important differences or disconnects between the responses of the two survey groups – golf course architects and superintendents. 	Survey results and analysis indicate that the primary roles of bunkers are intended for player strategy and course aesthetics. The most important factors in bunker design and construction are their; location, visual appearance, drainage and structural quality, all of which directly impact a bunker’s overall maintainability. The results of the study and literature review show that the <b>bunker</b> design – <b>management</b> relationship appears to {{play a significant role in}} the playability and continued quality of bunkers over the long term. Issues that arise related to <b>bunker</b> maintenance and <b>management</b> can often be traced back to less than thoughtful decisions or actions made during design and construction. 	Conclusions are also presented regarding limitations of the study and potential areas for future related research. Additional exploration regarding the specifics of bunker design, construction and maintenance, as well as the associated resource expenditures, would be of relevance to professionals practicing in golf course architecture and maintenance. Future research also might focus on golf course components beyond bunkers using methodology similar to that set forth in this study...|$|R

Transit work (p-km) captures transit task performed over distance. Transit productiveness (p-km/h) captures transit work performed over time. This paper applies productive performance with risk assessment to quantify transit system reliability. Theory is developed to monetize transit segment reliability risk {{on the basis of}} demonstration Annual Reliability Event rates by transit facility type, segment productiveness, and unit-event severity. A comparative example of peak hour performance of a transit sub-system containing bus-on-street, busway, and rail components in Brisbane, Australia demonstrates through practical application the importance of valuing reliability. Comparison reveals the highest risk segments to be long, highly productive on street bus segments followed by busway (BRT) segments and then rail segments. A transit reliability risk reduction treatment example demonstrates that benefits can be significant and should be incorporated into project evaluation in addition to those of regular travel time savings, reduced emissions and safety improvements. Reliability can be used to identify high risk components of the transit system and draw comparisons between modes both in planning and operations settings, and value improvement scenarios in a project evaluation setting. The methodology can also be applied to inform daily transit system operational management...|$|R
40|$|This Article first {{examines}} {{the efforts of}} the port-city of Singapore to enhance safety and to prevent ship-source pollution in its port and waters by adopting and effectively implementing the international rules and standards established in the conventions of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). It then reviews the measures taken by Singapore since 2002 to enhance security in its port and its surrounding waters. This is followed by an examination of how Singapore has worked together with Indonesia and Malaysia to enhance safety, security, and environmental protection in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. Finally, it considers what additional cooperative measures may be necessary to enhance maritime security and minimize the threat of ship-source pollution in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. The efforts of Singapore to enhance safety, security, and environmental protection in its port and waters cannot be understood without a basic comprehension of Singapore’s geography and the importance of shipping to its economy. Singapore is a small city-state in Southeast Asia. At the end of 2007, its total population was approximately 4. 6 million, of which about 3. 6 million were citizens or permanent residents. Singapore was founded by the British as a treaty port and became independent in 1965. It consists of one main island and several nearby smaller islands. Its total land area is about 682. 7 square kilometers. It has about 193 kilometers of coastline and its sea area is less than ten square kilometers. Singapore is located {{at the end of the}} Malay Peninsula and at the southern end of the Malacca Strait, which lies between the Indonesian island of Sumatra and the peninsula of Malaysia, and is approximately 500 miles in length. To the north, Singapore is separated from the State of Johor in Malaysia by the Johor Strait, which is thirty miles long and ranges from three-quarters of a mile to three miles in width. To the south, Singapore is separated from the Riau Islands of Indonesia by the Singapore Strait, which runs for fifty miles from the end of the Malacca Strait in the west to the South China Sea in the east. The Singapore Strait is about ten miles wide but it narrows to less than one mile at Philips Channel near Singapore. The Malacca Strait and the Singapore Strait are connected. They are treated by the three littoral States of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore, and by the IMO, as a single strait, which is referred to as the Straits of Malacca and Singapore. The Straits of Malacca and Singapore is one of the busiest and most important straits in the world. It is on the main shipping route between the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, and it is vitally important for trade and commerce between Europe, the Middle East, and India to the west, and China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia to the east. More than 60, 000 vessels pass through the Straits annually, carrying half the world’s oil flows and one-third of the world’s sea-borne trade. Singapore’s strategic location and natural deep-water harbor have enabled it to develop its port and transform the city into a global sea transportation hub. More than 200 shipping lines call on Singapore, and on an average day there are approximately 1000 ships in port. As an international maritime center, Singapore offers a full range of maritime services, including cargo handling, <b>bunkering,</b> professional ship <b>management</b> and shipbroking services, and international legal and arbitration expertise. Singapore has consistently ranked as the world’s busiest container port. It is also a major importer of oil, a major oil refining center, and one of the world’s largest bunkering ports. Singapore has major maritime interests as a flag State and as a port State. The number of ships under the Singapore registry has increased steadily in recent years and the registry is now ranked in the top ten of the world’s largest ship registries. The maritime sector is a key sector of the Singapore economy. It is estimated that there are more than 5000 maritime companies and organizations in Singapore, employing close to 100, 000 persons, and that the maritime sector contributes approximately seven percent of Singapore’s gross domestic product. Given the importance of the maritime sector to Singapore’s economy, the safe and secure passage of ships through the Straits of Malacca and Singapore is vital to its national interests. Singapore has also made a serious effort to balance environmental and developmental matters, while protecting its coastal and marine areas from all sources of pollution. It has a very strong interest in ensuring that ships entering its port and passing through its waters comply with international standards on ship-source pollution...|$|R
