50|$|SOCRATES or Space Optical Communications Research Advanced Technology Satellite is a Japanese micro-satellite {{launched}} in 2014. The satellite is purely a technology demonstrator {{intended to help}} AES company to gain experience in basic mission control, attitude control and spacecraft communications. Its main experiment is SOTA (Small Optical TrAnsponder), an optical small satellite communications demonstrator.All subsystems of spacecraft are powered by solar cells mounted on spacecraft <b>body</b> and <b>stub</b> wings, with estimated electrical power of 120W BOL degrading to 100W EOL.|$|R
50|$|The achaierai resembles an {{enormous}} 15 ft flightless bird with four stilt-like legs, a plump, hulking <b>body,</b> blunt, shaggy <b>stubs</b> for wings, and a parrot-like head. Its plumage is mostly red with orange and yellow highlights, though its sides and stumpy wings are blue and green.|$|R

Blood, blood stained objects, tissues, flesh, semen, vaginal swab from rape victim, hair, teeth, bone, saliva, epithelial cells, objects forcibly touched especially where body fluids/epithelial cells are left-over (for touch DNA analysis), bite marks on <b>body,</b> cigarette <b>stubs,</b> drinking bottles, toothbrush etc are some of the frequently observed and collected exhibits during investigation of a crime scene.|$|R
50|$|Hodoyoshi-3 is a Japanese micro-satellite {{launched}} in 2014.

For orbit-keeping, a hydrogen peroxide thruster is used. The latest information is available on FACEBOOK page. The satellite was developed under the Funding Program for World-Leading Innovation R&D on Science and Technology.|$|R

2500|$|The {{air-cooled}} Villiers 10D [...] engine had a {{unit construction}} three-speed manual gearbox without reverse. This had an output of [...] at 4,400rpm which the manufacturers claimed gave a power-to-weight ratio of [...] per ton unladen. The engine unit sat in an alloy cradle {{ahead of the}} front wheel, together forming part of its support. Both front wheel and engine were sprung {{as part of the}} trailing link front suspension system, which was fitted with a single coil spring and an Andre Hartford friction damper. The rear wheels were rigidly mounted to the <b>body</b> on <b>stub</b> axles with suspension provided by low pressure [...] "balloon" [...] type tyres. Starting was achieved by using a pull handle mounted under the dash panel and connected by cable to a modified kick-start lever on the engine. The steering comprised a system of pulleys and a cable usually referred to as [...] "bobbin and cable", connecting a conventional steering wheel to the front steering unit. The bobbin and cable steering arrangement was replaced by a rack and pinion system in October 1950. Brakes were provided on only the rear wheels; they were conventional drum brakes operated by a system of cables and rods.|$|R

Such changes were usually made available as kits to enable existing owners to upgrade their own cars retrospectively.|$|R

2500|$|The entire <b>body,</b> {{including}} the <b>stub</b> feet, {{is littered with}} numerous papillae: warty protrusions that carry a mechanoreceptive bristle (responsive to mechanical stimuli) at the tip, {{each of which is}} also connected to further sensory nerve cells lying beneath. The mouth papillae, the exits of the slime glands, probably also have a function in sensory perception. Sensory cells known as [...] "sensills" [...] on the [...] "lips" [...] or labrum respond to chemical stimuli and are known as chemoreceptors. These are also found on the two antennae, which can be regarded as the velvet worm's most important sensory organs. Except in a few (typically subterranean) species, one simply constructed eye (ocellus) lies laterally, just underneath the head, behind each antenna. This consists of a chitinous ball lens, a cornea and a retina and is connected to the centre of the brain via an optic nerve. The retina comprises numerous pigment cells and photoreceptors; the latter are easily modified flagellated cells, whose flagellum membranes carry a photosensitive pigment on their surface. The rhabdomeric eyes of the Onychophora are thought to be homologous with the median ocelli of arthropods; this would imply that the last common ancestor of arthropods bore only median ocelli.|$|R
