60|$|Cap'n Bill at once formed {{his army}} into line of battle {{and had them}} all remove the {{cumbersome}} raincoats, which they piled in a heap {{at the edge of}} the Fog Bank.

60|$|To-day, {{instead of}} the red legs of the French soldiers, you see the <b>blue</b> <b>legs</b> of the Italian soldiers, and {{instead of the}} fierce faces of their officers, the serious, intelligent, mostly spectacled faces of the Italian officers, in {{sweeping}} cloaks of tender blue verging on lavender. They are soldierly men none the less for their gentler aspect, and perhaps something the more; and a better thing yet {{is that there are}} comparatively few of them. There are few of the privates also, far fewer than the priests and the students of the ecclesiastical schools, who dress like priests and go dashing through the streets in files and troops.|$|E
60|$|It was an ancient, dark-looking room, with oaken wainscoting, a sanded floor, {{and a high}} mantel-piece. The {{walls were}} ornamented {{with three or four}} old {{coloured}} prints in black frames, each print representing a naval engagement, with a couple of men-of-war banging away at each other most vigorously, while another vessel or two were blowing up in the distance, and the foreground presented a miscellaneous collection of broken masts and <b>blue</b> <b>legs</b> sticking up out of the water. Depending from the ceiling in the centre of the room, were a gas-light and bell-pull; on each side were three or four long narrow tables, behind which was a thickly-planted row of those slippery, shiny-looking wooden chairs, peculiar to hostelries of this description. The monotonous appearance of the sanded boards was relieved by an occasional spittoon; and a triangular pile of those useful articles adorned the two upper corners of the apartment.|$|E
60|$|Josie {{was about}} to sit down {{beside her on the}} rustic seat and wait, when her quick eye saw afar off two manly forms arrayed in white flannel; their <b>blue</b> <b>legs</b> seemed bearing them towards the battle going on in the distance; but they never reached the fray; for with a cry of joy, Jo raced away to meet them, bent on {{securing}} this heaven-sent reinforcement. Both paused as she came flying up, and both raised their hats; but oh, the difference there was in the salutes! The stout youth pulled his off lazily and put it on again at once, as if glad to get the duty over; the slender being, with the crimson tie, lifted his with a graceful bend, and held it aloft while he accosted the rosy, breathless maid, thus permitting her to see his raven locks smoothly parted, with one little curl upon the brow. Dolly prided himself upon that bow, and practised it before his glass, but did not bestow it upon all alike, regarding it as a work of art, fit only for the fairest and most favoured of his female admirers; for he was a pretty youth, and fancied himself an Adonis.|$|E

60|$|His {{face was}} beautiful, but lacked expression. His eyes were large and blue {{in color and}} his teeth finely formed and white as snow.

He wore a robe of scarlet, which did not cover his arms and extended no lower than his bare knees. On the bosom of the robe was embroidered a terrible dragon's head, as horrible to look at as the man was beautiful. His arms and legs were left bare and the skin of one arm was bright yellow and {{the skin of the}} other arm a vivid green. He had one <b>blue</b> <b>leg</b> and one pink one, while both his feet--which showed through the open sandals he wore--were jet black.|$|R
