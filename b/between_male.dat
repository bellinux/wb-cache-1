5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area that is also favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely <b>between</b> <b>male</b> territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial battles <b>between</b> <b>male</b> Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), {{the fighting}} dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to superficially distinguish <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size {{may have}} affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though {{it is impossible to}} determine how.|$|E

5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling.

5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching and snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E
5|$|Most slaves {{worked as}} {{plantation}} laborers. Relatively few Brazilians owned slaves and most {{small and medium-sized}} farms employed free workers. Slaves could be found scattered throughout society in other capacities: some were used as house servants, farmers, miners, prostitutes, gardeners and in many other roles. Many emancipated slaves went on to acquire slaves and there were even cases of slaves who had their own slaves. While slaves were usually black or mulatto there were reported cases of slaves {{who appeared to be}} of European descent—the product of generations of inter-ethnic sexual relations <b>between</b> <b>male</b> slave owners and their female mulatto slaves. Even the harshest slave owners adhered to a long-established practice of selling slaves along with their families, taking care not to separate individuals. Slaves were regarded by law as properties. The ones who were freed immediately became citizens with all civil rights guaranteed—the only exception being that, until 1881, freed slaves were barred from voting in elections, although their children and descendants could vote.|$|E

5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} usually solitary, though aggregations of 2050 {{individuals}} have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations {{of several hundred}} zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female sharks, and {{in both cases the}} biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.|$|E
25|$|The wide gap <b>between</b> <b>male</b> {{and female}} labor force {{participation}} rates and ratios, and the gap <b>between</b> <b>male</b> and female employers is indicative of gender inequality within the private sector of majority Muslim countries. However, numerous reasons may account for these outcomes such as weak education infrastructure for women, low levels of economic development, or simply capital-intensive resource development. The latter characteristic is probably given how many majority Muslim nations are net oil exporters.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany {{anatomical}} {{differences exist}} <b>between</b> <b>males</b> and females; these are manifested on {{a molecular level}} by different hormonal environments. Although several molecular differences in adult tissues have been identified, a comprehensive investigation of the gene expression differences <b>between</b> <b>males</b> and females has not been performed. We surveyed the expression patterns of 13, 977 mouse genes in male and female hypothalamus, kidney, liver, and reproductive tissues. Extensive differential gene expression was observed {{not only in the}} reproductive tissues, but also in the kidney and liver. The differentially expressed genes are involved in drug and steroid metabolism, osmotic regulation, or as yet unresolved cellular roles. In contrast, very few molecular differences were observed <b>between</b> the <b>male</b> and female hypothalamus in both mice and humans. We conclude that there are persistent differences in gene expression <b>between</b> adult <b>males</b> and females.

40|$|Male {{mortality}} excess by {{causes of}} death in selected European countries in 2000 - 2013 period Abstract The aim of this thesis is to analyse and to evaluate current differences in mortality <b>between</b> <b>males</b> and females in selected European countries by {{causes of death}}. The thesis tries to capture the main features of so-called male mortality excess, and also tries to find its specifics in each individual state. Selected countries (the Czech Republic, Sweden, France and Spain) represent individual European macro-regions. The analyzed causes of death (neoplasms, diseases of nervous system, diseases of circulatory system, diseases of respiratory system and external causes) were selected based on the highest difference {{in the proportion of}} standardized mortality rates in total mortality <b>between</b> <b>males</b> and females. In the analytical part of the thesis, the methods of standardization, mortality tables and Pollard's two-dimensional decomposition of the difference in life expectancy at birth <b>between</b> <b>males</b> and females are used. To illustrate the situation of male mortality excess on the different groups of causes of death, contour plots of contributions to the difference in life expectancy at birth <b>between</b> <b>males</b> and females were created.
