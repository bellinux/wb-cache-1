5|$|Smith headed west, {{across the}} Ligurian Alps, towards {{southern}} France, which he knew {{had just been}} invaded by Allied troops, principally Americans, Free French and British. He and Bill were assisted along the way by Italian partisan groups and other locals. After 10 days on the road, three other Allied personnel—a Frenchman, an Austrian and a Pole—joined the trek, having met Smith and Bill at a partisan camp. The lingua franca of the group having changed to Italian, the five men hiked to the border, where they were taken in by an old farmer, Jean <b>Batiste</b> Chambrin, who gave them {{instructions on how to}} pass the German sentries guarding the border with France. The soldiers decided that because it would be too risky to try to cross all together, Smith and Bill would go first, with the Frenchman, Austrian and Pole following the next day.|$|E

Boyd states that the band composed 9 minute Pink Floyd-esq progressive rock songs in their earlier days, but the band ended up unhappy with the end results, and strayed away from the approach upon becoming {{more familiar with the}} Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Wilcox stated that drumming of John Bonham, Joseph Modeliste, and Russell <b>Batiste</b> were particularly influential to his drumming style.|$|E
25|$|Smith joined Sammy Hagar in {{the studio}} to work on music for his twelfth studio album.

25|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} an {{adjustment}} for {{the captain of}} Panathinaikos. Unable to contribute to Head Coach Obradović's demanding systems as efficiently as before, he was not starting any of the games anymore.

Along with the team's new stars Dimitris Diamantidis, Jaka Lakovič, and Mike <b>Batiste,</b> PAO {{made it to the}} EuroLeague Final Four in Moscow, losing to Šarūnas Jasikevičius' and Anthony Parker's Maccabi Tel Aviv.

25|$|Yarns {{from these}} fibers are woven into {{a variety of}} {{different}} weaves, the most notable of which include broadcloth, with double the number of warp to weft threads, giving a smooth, formal shirting; twill, where the tucks of the weft do not line up, giving a diagonal pattern, a weave used for most country checked (e.g. Tattersall) shirtings; poplin, with a heavier warp than weft, giving more formal fabric; and Oxford weaves. Plain Oxford or pinpoint Oxford weaves are popular as casual fabrics, so are generally used in combination with a button-down collar, while royal Oxford is versatile enough to be used on both sporty and formal shirts. There are many other weaves or variations on these, including end-on-end patterns, where alternate white and coloured threads are used, giving a mottled appearance, or more exotic weaves, including voile and <b>batiste,</b> which are extremely light fabrics only used for summer shirts or on the unseen parts of formal shirts.|$|E

Zinni, called for the {{resignation}} of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, accusing him of [...] "abysmal" [...] military planning and lack of strategic competence. The ethics of a system under which serving generals felt compelled to publicly support policies that they privately believed were potentially ruinous for the country and cost the lives of military personnel, did not escape critical public comment, and was mocked by political satirist Stephen Colbert at a dinner attended by President George W. Bush and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace. Rumsfeld resigned in November 2006. By 2008, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, felt obliged to pen an open letter in which he reminded all servicemen that [...] "The U.S. military must remain apolitical at all times." ...|$|E

When she was 13, she was cast in her first film, the 1995 comedy Friday. She first gained critical recognition for her performance as the troubled teen Cisely <b>Batiste</b> in Kasi Lemmons' 1997 film Eve's Bayou; she received two award nominations, including her first NAACP Image Award nomination. According to Good, she grew up [...] "super nerdy, super skinny, buckteeth, big ole afro and yet I had a sense of confidence about myself, like, 'they just don't get it yet'. She was a fan of Justin Timberlake and Usher in her teens. Good did not have any role models until early adulthood, when she began admiring actress Charlize Theron.|$|E
2500|$|From the beginning, {{the music}} of the Dirty Dozen was a {{departure}} from the traditional New Orleans brass band sound, and as the band's popularity increased the distance between them and more traditional groups only grew. When Kirk and Charles Joseph left the band suddenly in 1991, citing the pressures of the group's demanding touring schedule, Davis was forced to replace Kirk Joseph not with another sousaphonist but with an electric bass player. Similarly, in 1994 drummers Lionel <b>Batiste</b> (who had replaced Benny Jones on bass drum some years earlier) and Jenell Marshall left the group; Davis was unable to find a pair of drummers who met his expectations, and instead hired a single musician to play drum kit. The subsequent addition of a keyboard player and guitarist removed the band still further from its street band roots. [...] Finally, throughout the band's history they relied on written arrangements to a far greater extent than do most other New Orleans brass bands.|$|E
