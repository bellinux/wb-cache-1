5|$|After {{missing the}} first three matches of the 1906–07 season due to cricketing commitments, Bell was chosen to replace McFarlane for the visit of Nottingham Forest on 15 September 1906. Two weeks later he scored twice in the 4–0 home win over Burton United, {{and went on to}} score three more goals in his next four appearances, {{including}} a late winner away at Leeds City.

40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} links between {{end-user}} order flows as seen by a major European commercial bank and macroeconomic fundamentals. We show that both exchange rate changes and flows are only weakly related to macroeconomic news announcements and hypothesise that “the cat is already out of <b>the</b> bag ” <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>news</b> is announced. Instead, order flows of financial and corporate customers reflect in real time the evolution of macroeconomies. The actions of the banks receiving the order flows in turn reveal {{the information to the}} market as a whole which prices the exchange rate accordingly. <b>By</b> <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>news</b> is announced, <b>the</b> exchange rate already contains the majority of the information...|$|R
