40|$|The use {{of fantasy}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> of <b>the</b> period 1250 - 1650 A. D. will be {{discussed}} under five categories. 1. Fantasy was used by artists in religious paintings, which served as a visual book to be viewed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> people. <b>The</b> <b>artist</b> used fantasy to show or illustrate events or miracles {{which could not be}} logically explained. 2. Fantasy was used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> to portray Greek and Roman mythological subjects and events. 3. Fantasy was used <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artists</b> to present allegorical figures and ideas. 4. Fantasy was used to illustrated dreams or visions. 5.

5|$|The {{importance}} of high-contrast patterns for successful disruption was predicted {{in general terms}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Abbott Thayer in 1909 and explicitly by the zoologist Hugh Cott in 1940.

5|$|A painter whose {{creative}} output spanned {{nearly three}} decades, controversy erupted briefly in 1999, when disputed declarations were made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> regarding whether some works under his signature {{had been painted}} by some female relatives. Creator of the work Straightening spears at Ilyingaungau (1990), Tolson's paintings are held by several major Australian public galleries, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, National Gallery of Victoria and the National Museum of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) (Latinized from Andries van Wezel), {{professor}} of anatomy at the University of Padua, {{is considered the}} founder of modern human anatomy. Originally from Brabant, Vesalius published the influential book De humani corporis fabrica ("the structure of the human body"), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543. The accurate and intricately detailed illustrations, often in allegorical poses against Italianate landscapes, {{are thought to have}} been made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Jan van Calcar, a pupil of Titian.|$|E

5|$|Development {{began in}} November 1994 by the lead programmer, Simon Carter, and took {{two and a}} half years to develop. The game used the engine for Magic Carpet, and the first version was merely {{scrolling}} around a map and entering third-person. The engine was built by Glenn Corpes. Molyneux then developed a 2D prototype containing features that made it into the final game. The prototype focused on constructing the dungeon, and included the Treasure room, Hatchery, Training room, and Dungeon Heart. The characters were designed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist,</b> Mark Healey.|$|E
5|$|In 1852, Queen Victoria {{commissioned}} a painting <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> William Wyld which became A view of Manchester from Kersal Moor (pictured). The painting, which depicts the moor as a beautiful pastoral scene overlooking Castle Irwell racecourse {{and the industrial}} landscape of Manchester, {{is now in the}} Royal Collection, where it is listed as Manchester from Higher Broughton. A steel line engraving of the painting by the engraver Edward Goodall was also commissioned.|$|E
5|$|In the game's present, Nagi's {{descendant}} and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, Susano, {{refuses to}} believe in Nagi's legend and frees Orochi, who escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from Nippon. Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and asks her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Issun (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu begins to restore the land to its normal state.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the oldest}} sectors of Dubrovnik was {{constructed}} around a Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards {{a bit more than}} it does today. It was constructed {{on the site of the}} Pre-Romanesque cathedral and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour. The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Nikola Božidarević around 1500.|$|E
5|$|The 1145 {{apparition}} {{was recorded}} by the monk Eadwine. The 1986 apparition exhibited a fan tail similar to Eadwine's drawing. Some claim that Genghis Khan was inspired to turn his conquests toward Europe by the 1222 apparition. The 1301 apparition may have been seen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Giotto di Bondone, who represented the Star of Bethlehem as a fire-colored comet in the Nativity section of his Arena Chapel cycle, completed in 1305. Its 1378 appearance is recorded in the Annales Mediolanenses {{as well as in}} East Asian sources.|$|E
5|$|The Ashford Ring Road was {{completed}} in November 1974 around the town centre {{in an attempt to}} relieve congestion, though part of it involved demolition of existing properties and part of the old market. It initially opened as one way, but was converted back into a two-way operation in 2007, at a total cost of £14m, so the town centre could expand and accommodate more people. The two-way route incorporates the first shared space scheme in the country. An art installation, Lost O, curated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Michael Pinsky, was created as part of this redevelopment but confused drivers.|$|E

5|$|The Church of San Benedetto in Catania (Illustrations 15 and 16) is a {{fine example}} of a Sicilian Baroque interior, {{decorated}} between 1726 and 1762, the period when Sicilian Baroque was at the height of its fashion and individuality. The ceilings were frescoed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Giovanni Tuccari. The most spectacular part of the church's decoration is the nun's choir (Illustrations 16), created c. 1750, which was designed {{in such a way that}} the nuns' voices could be heard during services, but the nuns themselves were still quite separate from and unseen by the less spiritual world outside.|$|E

The earliest recipe was collected in 1841; the last in 1897. The book was edited <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Catherine Frances Frere, who had seen two other cookery books through to publication, {{at the request of}} Clark's husband.|$|E
5|$|The Mari Lwyd was {{utilised}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> Clive Hicks-Jenkins in {{a series}} of drawings from around 2000 that focused on a metamorphosing horse/man as a nightmarish harbinger of his father's death. Catriona Urquhart wrote a sequence of poems titled The Mare's Tale which were published alongside Hicks-Jenkins' images in 2001. In her 1977 novel Silver on the Tree, the author Susan Cooper included an appearance from the Mari Lwyd.|$|E

5|$|The sculpture's roughly cubical {{arrangement}} cleverly {{ensures that}} the overall composition retains a harmonious equilibrium. It is lightened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>artist</b> dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the piece. By putting {{the children in the}} place of Seneb's legs, the artist adds to the sense of symmetry. He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure, preserving an appearance of normality without disguising Seneb's unusual physique. The family's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed {{on either side of the}} children and on the horizontal face of the base.|$|E
5|$|Townshend sold Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret {{two years}} after Etty's death for 510guineas.
