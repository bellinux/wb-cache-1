5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from their mothers. <b>Babies</b> <b>are</b> often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off their mothers during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E
5|$|In {{the scene}} when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> perched {{all over the}} building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a {{reference}} to his own cameo appearance in the film. The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in Citizen Kane, in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches {{his wife in the}} musical.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} women with SCI giving birth and having healthy <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> increasing. Around a half to two-thirds of women with SCI report {{they might want to}} have children, and 14–20% do get {{pregnant}} at least once. Although female fertility is not usually permanently reduced by SCI, there is a stress response that can happen immediately post-injury that alters levels of fertility-related hormones in the body. In about half of women, menstruation stops after the injury but then returns within an average of five months—it returns within a year for a large majority. After menstruation returns, women with SCI become pregnant at a rate close to that {{of the rest of the}} population.|$|E

5000|$|On 18 June 1930 a <b>baby</b> boy <b>was</b> {{found in}} the First Class {{carriage}} of a train travelling from Waterloo by Mr Paul Broome, the railway guard. The <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> found with a note which indicated whoever left him contemplated suicide. The <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> taken to Kingston Hospital. [...] CID investigated the issue but whoever left the <b>baby</b> <b>was</b> never found.|$|R

5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} non-contributory old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{of giant}} mouse lemurs include the Madagascar buzzard, Madagascar owl, fossa, and the narrow-striped mongoose. Giant mouse lemurs {{reproduce}} once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day gestation. <b>Babies</b> <b>are</b> initially {{left in the}} nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild {{is thought to be}} five to six years. Both species are listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under CITES Appendix I, which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The Duke Lemur Center coordinated the captive breeding of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.|$|E
25|$|When newborn <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> breastfed, the babies' livers and the mothers' {{breast milk}} provide {{sufficient}} quantities of copper {{for the first}} 4–6 months of life. When <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> weaned, a balanced diet should provide adequate sources of copper.|$|E

25|$|Providing {{that there}} are no interruptions, all <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> said to follow this process and it is {{suggested}} that trying to rush the process or interruptions such as removing the baby to weigh or measure is counter-productive and may lead to problems at subsequent breastfeeds.|$|E
25|$|Neonates (<b>babies)</b> <b>are</b> around 70–80cm {{long and}} receive no parental care. Because of their small size, they often {{fall prey to}} other animals. Should they survive, they grow rapidly until they reach sexual {{maturity}} in their first few years, after which their rate of growth continues at a slower pace.|$|E
25|$|About {{one to two}} per {{thousand}} <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> affected. Males are affected about four times more often than females. The condition is very rare in adults. The first description of pyloric stenosis was in 1888 with surgery management first carried out in 1912 by Conrad Ramstedt. Before surgical treatment most babies died.|$|E

25|$|If day-old <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> {{presented}} with their mother's voice speaking normally, abnormally (in monotone), and a stranger's voice, they react {{only to the}}ir mother's voice speaking normally. When a human and a non-human sound is played, babies turn their head only {{to the source of}} human sound. It has been suggested that auditory learning begins already in the pre-natal period.|$|E
40|$|In a {{study of}} 52, 266 live {{singleton}} deliveries in a total population male <b>babies</b> <b>were</b> delivered at earlier gestations than female. This difference was not due to induction or elective caesarean section. Female <b>babies</b> <b>were</b> more likely to present and be delivered by the breech.

25|$|Kangaroo care or Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), {{sometimes}} called skin-to-skin care, {{is a technique}} of newborn care where <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> kept skin-to-skin with a parent, typically their mother. It is most commonly used for low birth-weight preterm babies, who {{are more likely to}} suffer from hypothermia, while admitted to a neonatal unit to keep the baby warm and support early breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|Rats in New York {{have been}} known to overrun {{restaurants}} after hours and crawl up sewer pipes, as well as enter apartments through toilets. They have attacked homeless people, eaten cadavers in the city morgue, and bitten infants and young children to get food off their faces. <b>Babies</b> <b>are</b> frequent victims, especially if left alone with food or a bottle.|$|E
25|$|Fetal {{position}} (the way the <b>babies</b> <b>are</b> {{lying in}} the womb) usually determines if they are delivered by caesarean section or vaginally. A review of good quality research on this subject found that if the twin that will be born first (i.e. is lowest in the womb) is head down {{there is no good}} evidence that caesarean section will be safer than a vaginal birth for the mother or babies.|$|E
