Adults could reach a length of 8–9meters (26–30ft) from snout to tail.

5|$|Antibaryons are {{not listed}} in the tables; however, they simply would have all quarks changed to antiquarks, and Q, B, S, C, B′, would be of {{opposite}} signs. Particles with † next to their names have been predicted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standard</b> Model but not yet observed.

5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standard</b> Model.|$|E

60|$|To {{arrive at}} a just {{estimate}} of a renowned man's character one must judge it <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of his time, not ours. Judged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of one century, the noblest characters of an earlier one lose much of their luster; judged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of to-day, there is probably no illustrious man {{of four or five}} centuries ago whose character could meet the test at all points. But the character of Joan of Arc is unique. It can be measured <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> of all times without misgiving or apprehension as to <b>the</b> result. Judged <b>by</b> any of them, it is still flawless, it is still ideally perfect; it still occupies the loftiest place possible to human attainment, a loftier one than has been reached by any other mere mortal.|$|R

5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc drives, and generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard,</b> or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E
5|$|The Standard Chartered {{series was}} a series of {{emergency}} bearer cheques issued <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standard</b> Chartered Bank (hence the title on the top of these cheques) and the Cargill Cotton Group. They were authorised by the Reserve Bank as legitimate issues and were valid for six months from the date of issue, the first currency notes of the Zimbabwean dollar to have a time limit. They carry the signature of the company's finance director Priscilla Mutenbwa and operations director Stephen Newton-Howes.|$|E
5|$|The {{invariant}} mass of {{an electron}} is approximately kilograms, or atomic mass units. On {{the basis of}} Einstein's principle of mass–energy equivalence, this mass corresponds to a rest energy of 0.511MeV. The ratio between the mass of a proton and that of an electron is about 1836. Astronomical measurements show that the proton-to-electron mass ratio has held the same value for {{at least half the}} age of the universe, as is predicted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standard</b> Model.|$|E

5|$|Cardigan Welsh Corgis {{continued}} to be rarer than Pembrokes, with only 11 registrations made in the war year of 1940. Both breeds survived the Second World War, although the Cardigans registered with the Kennel Club numbered only 61 {{by the end of}} the war. Pembrokes became very popular during the post war years in the United Kingdom; in 1953 it was ranked as the fourth most popular breed by the Kennel Club, behind the English Cocker Spaniel, the German Shepherd and the Pekingese. In 1955, the reserve Best in Show at Crufts was the Pembroke Welsh Corgi Kaytop Maracas Mint, who was beaten <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standard</b> Poodle Ch. Tzigane Affri of Nashend. The Corgi breeds declined in popularity: veterinary physician Brian Singleton suggested in The Times in 1963 that this was due to issues with their temperament.|$|E
5|$|Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel is a {{situation}} comedy radio show starring two of the Marx Brothers, Groucho and Chico, and written primarily by Nat Perrin and Arthur Sheekman. The series was originally broadcast in the United States on the National Broadcasting Company's Blue Network beginning November 28, 1932, and ended May 22, 1933. Sponsored <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Standard</b> Oil Companies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Louisiana and the Colonial Beacon Oil Company, it was the Monday night installment of the Five-Star Theater, an old-time radio variety series that offered a different program each weeknight. Episodes were broadcast live from NBC's WJZ station in New York City and later from a sound stage at RKO Pictures in Los Angeles, California, before returning to WJZ for the final episodes.|$|E

When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in front of the other flags in a single file, or on the right as seen <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer).
