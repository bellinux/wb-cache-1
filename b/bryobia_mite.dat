50|$|The great {{majority}} of Bryobia mites are asexual (although certain species do reproduce sexually). Their populations are all female, and individuals reproduce by thelytoky, a form of parthenogenesis. They emerge from unfertilized eggs. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the asexual species in the genus are not a monophyletic group; indicating that asexual reproduction evolved several times or that sexuality re-evolved. The asexual species have {{a high level of}} genetic diversity considering that they are clones; this may have arisen through hybridization and mutation. In at least two species, namely Bryobia kissophila and B. praetiosa, asexuality is caused by the parasitic bacterium Wolbachia. This bacterium causes functional apomixis in the mites, so that a female produces only offspring that are identical to her. It is possible that Wolbachia could influence the reproductive processes of most <b>bryobia</b> <b>mite</b> species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bryobia</b> <b>mites</b> feed on plants. They {{puncture}} {{the plant}} tissues with their sucking mouthparts. They are often found on leaves, {{but they also}} live on branches and twigs.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bryobia</b> <b>mites</b> {{are among}} the largest spider mites. The adult is {{visible to the naked}} eye. Mites of this genus are mainly {{distinguished}} by the arrangement of the setae on their bodies. In general, these mites are red in color with whitish setae and long legs with hooked claws.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known species is Bryobia praetiosa, the clover mite or brown clover mite, an {{economically}} important pest of over 250 species of plants. It occurs nearly worldwide. Like other <b>bryobia</b> <b>mites,</b> this species is herbivorous, {{but there have been}} occasional reports of it occurring as an ectoparasite on humans, particularly children. It causes an itchy skin irritation. There has also been an isolated case report of an infestation in a domestic cat.|$|R
50|$|The {{life history}} is {{variable}} across species. Typically, {{it takes about}} {{a month for a}} mite to develop from egg and larva to adult.This depends on environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. Some species overwinter in the egg stage. Some species have a single generation per year, while others have several. The eggs are laid singly or in clutches, and some mites may cover the eggs with dust or other matter. Unlike some other spider <b>mites,</b> <b>bryobia</b> <b>mites</b> do not spin webs.|$|R

40|$|Balaustium medicagoense Meyer & Ryke (Acari: Erythraeidae) and Bryobia spp. Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) are {{significant}} emerging pests in Australian grains and pastures. Despite this, {{there is limited}} information known on their basic biology, such as species status and reproductive modes, {{making it difficult to}} develop effective and sustainable control strategies. The species/strain status of Balaustium and <b>Bryobia</b> <b>mites</b> from southern Australia was examined using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequence data. In addition, the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method was used to examine the reproductive mode and genetic diversity of Ba. medicagoense from 16 populations within southern Australia. Results indicate {{that there is only one}} species of Balaustium (Ba. medicagoense) and as many as seven species of <b>Bryobia</b> <b>mites</b> currently present in grain crops, pastures and roadsides within southern Australia. The Bryobia species complex consists of four recently described lineages (Bryobia sp. I, Bryobia sp. IV, Bryobia sp. VII, and Bryobia praetiosa Koch) and three additional genetic lineages (Bryobia sp. VIII, Bryobia sp. IX, and Bryobia sp. X) that have not been described previously. Bryobia sp. VIII, B. sp. IX, and B. sp. I seem to be the most abundant species present in Australian broadacre agriculture (i. e., land suitable for farms practicing large-scale crop [agriculture] operations). The AFLP data revealed that Ba. medicagoense reproduces asexually and that genetic diversity was low with only 10 genotypes found. These findings indicate a new complex of pest mites are present within Australian grain crops and pastures and this has implications for their control...|$|R
40|$|The clover <b>mite,</b> <b>Bryobia</b> praetiosa Koch, {{is a tiny}} {{relative}} of spiders and ticks. Thousands of clover mites can appear during spring or fall, and they are often found crawling around windows or other areas of a house. Clover mites are distinguished from other species of household-invading mites by their reddish-green color and long front legs. The front legs are {{as long as the}} body and almost twice the length of the other legs. These distinguishing features can be seen {{with the aid of a}} magnifying glass. Vast numbers of clover mites can invade a house through cracks and tiny openings around windows and doors. Clover mites do not bite people or pets and do not damage the house or furniture, but they can stain light-colored walls, carpet, fabrics or papers when crushed...|$|R
40|$|Evaluating the {{economic}} impact of an introduced pest is most useful if it can be carried out before the pest arrives, so that contingency plans for eradicating it can be developed. This has been done by MAFQual (the quality control section of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries) for critical quarantine pests such as Tephritidae (fruit flies). Critical quarantine pests are defined as those which would cause immediate loss of valuable export market access. For quarantine pests (i. e., those serious plant pests which do not occur in New Zealand, but which would not necessarily cause loss of export market access) it is difficult to develop contingency plans in advance. For a quarantine pest, therefore, the decision on whether to attempt to eradicate, contain, or accept the pest must be made after establishment. A cost-benefit analysis must be undertaken comparing all of the costs of an eradication with the benefits of avoiding the damages caused by the introduced pest. Provided the benefits outweigh the costs, eradication can be accepted as a viable option. These procedures were followed before removal of the <b>mite</b> <b>Bryobia</b> lagodechiana Reck from a rose garden in Auckland...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study of phytoseiid populations was made of two well- cultivated and regularly sprayed apple orchards with two unsprayed orchards in Cache Valley, northern Utah. Two phytoseiid species, Typhlodromus mcgregori Chant and T. occidentalis Nesbitt were observed on the apple leaves, under the bark, and occasionally in the litter and soil. Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) occurred in the soil and litter and occasionally under bark. T. mcgregori was dominant in the unsprayed orchards, and T. occidentalis in the sprayed. Of the phytophagous mites, which served as food for the phytoseiids, the two-spotted mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch was dominant. Other phytophagous mites were the brown <b>mite,</b> <b>Bryobia</b> rubrioculus (Scheuten), the European red mite, Panonychus ulmi (Koch), and the McDaniel mite, Tetranychus mcdanieli McGregor. The study suggests T. mcgregori to be a non-specific, facultative predator of phytophagous mites. T. mcgregori was adversely affected by standard pesticide practices, but T. occiden talis survived in larger numbers. The phytoseiids seem well adjusted to {{the environment of the}} unsprayed orchards and to contribute to the low phytophagous mite populations in those orchards. In the sprayed orchards, the phytoseiids failed to control the high populations of phytophagous mites which developed. No statistical differences were found in the efficiencies of the mite brushing machine and Berlese funnels in removing either phytoseiid or phytophagous mites from apple leaves...|$|R
40|$|Many {{arthropods}} {{are infected}} with vertically transmitted, intracellular bacteria manipulating their host's reproduction. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is commonly observed and is expressed as {{a reduction in the}} number of offspring in crosses between infected males and uninfected females (or females infected with a different bacterial strain). CI is often related to the presence of Wolbachia, but recent findings indicate that a second reproductive parasite, Cardinium, is also capable of inducing CI. Although both Wolbachia and Cardinium occur in arthropods and may infect the same host species, little is known about their interactions. We observed Wolbachia and Cardinium in the sexual spider <b>mite</b> <b>Bryobia</b> sarothamni (Acari: Tetranychidae) and investigated the effects of both bacteria on reproduction. We performed all possible crossing combinations using naturally infected strains, and show that Cardinium induces strong CI, expressed as an almost complete female mortality. B. sarothamni is the third host species in which Cardinium-induced CI is observed, and this study reveals the strongest CI effect found so far. Wolbachia, however, did not induce CI. Even so, CI was not induced by doubly infected males, and neither singly Wolbachia-infected nor doubly infected females could rescue CI induced by Cardinium-infected males. Possibly, this is related to the differences between Cardinium strains infecting singly and doubly infected individuals. We found a cost of infection in single infected individuals, but not in doubly infected individuals. We show that infection frequencies in field populations ranged from completely uninfected to a polymorphic state. In none of the populations infections were fixe...|$|R
