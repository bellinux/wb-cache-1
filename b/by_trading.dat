5|$|After 1462 Wallachia {{preserved}} its autonomy {{mainly through}} {{the intervention of}} Stephen the Great of Moldavia. At {{the end of the}} century, however, Radu IV the Great (14951508) became an obedient subject of the sultan and visited Istanbul annually to personally offer the tribute. Even so, he could only stay in power by collaborating with the powerful Craioveşti family, strongly connected to the Ottomans <b>by</b> <b>trading.</b> In 1512 a member of this family, Neagoe (15121521) rose to throne, but he adopted the dynastic name of Basarab in order to legitimize his rule. He wrote the first original work of Romanian literature, titled Teachings, to his son, Teodosius on moral, political, and military questions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts <b>by</b> <b>trading</b> with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E

5|$|Minutes {{before the}} NHL trade {{deadline}} on February 27, 2012, Hodgson was dealt, along with defenceman Alexander Sulzer, to the Buffalo Sabres {{in exchange for}} fellow rookie forward Zack Kassian and defenceman Marc-André Gragnani. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the trade {{as an effort to}} balance his team out <b>by</b> <b>trading</b> Hodgson's skill and finesse in return for Kassian's size and toughness. Analysts from TSN and The Vancouver Sun also echoed the sentiment, commenting that while the Canucks gained elements in Kassian that were required to succeed in the playoffs, Hodgson's skill set reflected the style of play that Vancouver's success was based upon.|$|E

5|$|The Eleventh Five-Year Plan of the Soviet Union {{delivered}} a disappointing result: {{a change in}} growth from 5 to 4%. During the earlier Tenth Five-Year Plan, they had tried to meet the target of 6.1% growth, but failed. Brezhnev was able to defer economic collapse <b>by</b> <b>trading</b> with Western Europe and the Arab World. The Soviet Union still out-produced the United States in the heavy industry sector during the Brezhnev era. Another dramatic result of Brezhnev's rule was that certain Eastern Bloc countries became more economically advanced than the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of his fortune, however, came from moneylending. Up until their expulsion in 1290, the major moneylenders in England were Jews, who were not covered by Christian bans on usury. During the reign of Henry III, however, the Jews were taxed at extortionate rates, and many were forced to sell acquired debts at reduced prices. These debts were lucrative, because the buyers were not bound by the existing contract. They could demand higher rates, or sometimes even take forfeit in land. Stratton {{was one of the}} greater beneficiaries of the opportunities offered <b>by</b> <b>trading</b> in Jewish debts. From at least 1271 he was also associated with the Riccardi, a major Italian financier family.|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} being upset by LSU, Alabama {{returned}} to Bryant–Denny {{and began a}} three-game homestand to end the season by defeating long-time rival Mississippi State 30–10.

In the second, Alabama reached the end zone {{for the first time on}} the evening after Greg McElroy hit Marquis Maze for a 45-yard touchdown reception and a 13–3 lead. After a punt on the next Bulldog series, an 80-yard Maze touchdown return was called back as a result of an illegal block on the play by Alex Watkins. On the next play, Mark Ingram took a short bubble screen pass from McElroy 78-yards for a 20–3 lead at the half.|$|E

5|$|After his {{coaching}} stint, {{he worked as}} a scout for three years before becoming general manager of the Lakers prior to the 198283 season. NBA.com credits West in creating the great 1980s Lakers dynasty, which brought five championship rings (1980, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988) to Los Angeles. After a slump in the early 1990s, West rebuilt the team of coach Del Harris around center Vlade Divac, forward Cedric Ceballos, and guard Nick Van Exel, which won 48 games, and went to the Western Conference Semifinals; for turning the team around, West received his first Executive of the Year Award. <b>By</b> <b>trading</b> Vlade Divac for Kobe Bryant, signing free agent center Shaquille O'Neal, and signing six-time NBA champion Phil Jackson as a coach, West laid down the fundaments of the Lakers three-peat which saw L.A. win three NBA titles from 2000 to 2002.|$|E
5|$|Expectations {{were high}} for the 2008 season, but Cleveland {{finished}} last in the AFC North with a 4–12 record. Anderson shared starts with Ken Dorsey, who the Browns had acquired <b>by</b> <b>trading</b> away Trent Dilfer, and Brady Quinn, a young quarterback the team drafted in 2007. The Browns never contended during 2008 and failed to score a touchdown in the final six games. Near {{the end of the}} season, two scandals shook the team. It was revealed that several Browns players, including Winslow, were suffering from staph infections, which raised questions about sanitation in the Browns' Berea practice facilities. In November, Savage found himself {{in the center of a}} media storm after an angry e-mail exchange with a fan was published on Deadspin, a sports blog. Shortly after the final game, a 31–0 loss to the Steelers, Lerner fired Savage and, a day later, Crennel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Creeks, escaped African slaves, and other Indians from {{northern}} Florida {{displaced by the}} Creek War formed the area's Seminole nation. After {{the end of the}} Seminole Wars in 1842, the Seminoles faced relocation to Indian territory near Oklahoma. A few hundred Seminole hunters and scouts settled within what is today Big Cypress National Preserve, to escape the forced emigration to the west. From 1859 to about 1930, the Seminoles and Miccosukee, a similar but linguistically unique tribe, lived in relative isolation, making their living <b>by</b> <b>trading.</b> In 1928, surveying and construction began on the Tamiami Trail, along the northern border of Everglades National Park. The road not only bisected the Everglades but also introduced a steady, if small, traffic of white settlers into the Everglades.|$|E

5|$|The Giants did not draft {{a player}} in the first round on 11 occasions. Two of those picks, for the 1967 and 1968 drafts, were traded to the Minnesota Vikings in 1967 as part of a deal for quarterback Fran Tarkenton. During the 1974 season, the Giants dealt their 1975 first-round choice to the Dallas Cowboys for another quarterback, Craig Morton. In another case when the Giants used first-round draft picks to trade for a quarterback, the team {{acquired}} 2004 first overall pick Eli Manning from the San Diego Chargers, in a deal that included their 2004 and 2005 first-round picks; the Giants had already selected Philip Rivers with the 2004 pick, the fourth in that year's draft. The Giants used multiple first-round selections in 1951, 1972, and 1984; in the second instance; they gained a selection <b>by</b> <b>trading</b> Tarkenton back to the Vikings.|$|E

Romero combined for a one-hit, complete-game shutout of the Marlins {{in the first}} game back, extending the Phillies' winning streak to six games, and their record to 10–3 in the month of July. The streak was extended to eight straight games as the Phillies swept Florida in three games of the series (one game was postponed due to weather). Happ raised his record to 7–0 on the season with another seven-inning shutout performance. The streak continued as the Phillies opened a series at home against the Chicago Cubs; Chad Durbin earned his first save in 11 months by pitching three scoreless innings of relief. Werth's three-run home run in the 13th inning the next night gave the Phillies a walk-off win for their tenth consecutive, but Chicago ended the season-high streak with a 10–5 defeat on July 22. The Phillies won three of their next four, and bolstered their rotation <b>by</b> <b>trading</b> for Cliff Lee. The 2008 American League Cy Young Award winner came from the Cleveland Indians along with outfielder Ben Francisco on July 29; the Phillies gave up four minor leaguers—catcher Lou Marson, infielders Jason Donald and pitchers Carlos Carrasco and Jason Knapp. Lee and Francisco joined the Phillies in San Francisco after the Phillies' series victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks, and both started the final game in July. Lee pitched a complete-game four-hitter on July 31, allowing one run over nine innings of work. The Phillies finished July with a 20–7 record, their first 20-win month since May 2001.|$|E
