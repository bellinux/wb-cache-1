In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, <b>Brazil</b> <b>nuts,</b> sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations.

40|$|Aim Our {{goal was}} to test the {{hypothesis}} that ancient humans substantially contributed to shaping the current distribution of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> (Bertholletia excelsa), an Amazonian tree species that has been important for human livelihoods since pre-Columbian times. We scrutinized the putative association between <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> and Amazonian Dark Earth soils (ADE) and geometric earthworks called geoglyphs, and examined the existence of continental patterns in human footprints on <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> stands. Location Amazon Basin. Methods We carried out a spatially explicit meta-analysis of the variation of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> stand metrics across the Amazon Basin based on 87, 617 density estimates and 488 average stand diameter assessments, and related these to previously published datasets and suitability maps of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut,</b> ADE and geoglyphs. Results We found consistently higher <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> suitability scores, stand densities and average stand diameters in the vicinities of ADE than at larger distances, regardless of their position along a gradient from south-western to north-eastern Amazonia. For geoglyph sites such a pattern was only found for <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> habitat suitability scores. The available data further revealed an accumulation of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> stands with increasing densities and average diameters from south-western to central and eastern Amazonia. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that the chance of encountering <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> stands bearing the marks of past human influences increases from south-western to central and eastern Amazonia. In south-western Amazonia, the regeneration of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> seems to have been controlled predominantly by natural processes, whereas in central and eastern Amazonia, anthropogenic disturbance has been more important since pre-Columbian times. However, it remains challenging to disentangle human influences on the distribution and abundance of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> from existing environmental gradients across the Amazon Basin. In general, the results of this meta-analysis bode well for the future coexistence of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> with different forms of contemporary human land use...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{regeneration}} of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> trees {{depends on}} tree-fall {{gaps in the}} forest. However, shifting cultivation fallows also create comparable biotic and abiotic opportunities for the dispersion and establishment of this gap-loving species. At the same time, the ability of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> trees to resprout enables fallow individuals to survive successive slash-and-burn cycles. Recognizing the importance of shifting cultivation for the food security of forest dwellers, we investigated whether {{the high level of}} <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> regeneration found in cultivation fallows could be explained by the resprouting capability of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> trees, the number of cultivation cycles, past agricultural use and distance to the nearest conspecific productive adults. We found that the <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> tree population density increased from 8. 86 treesha− 1 to 13. 69 treesha− 1 and 27. 09 treesha− 1 at sites after one, two and three or more shifting cultivation cycles, respectively. As a consequence of resprouting, after a certain number of shifting cultivation cycles, the fallows become dominated by <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> trees, and the landholders may decide to preserve them and to exclude enriched sites from future agricultural use. Protected for their extractive value, the secondary forests spontaneously enriched with <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> trees are allowed to develop into nut-producing forests that have reduced chances of conversion into crops or pastures, thus reversing the classical process of Amazon forest degradation...|$|R

5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), <b>Brazil</b> <b>nuts</b> (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E

40|$|Although many {{examples}} of multiple-use forest management {{may be found in}} tropical smallholder systems, few studies provide empirical support for the integration of selective timber harvesting with non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction. <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> (Bertholletia excelsa, Lecythidaceae) is one of the world's most economically-important NTFP species extracted almost entirely from natural forests across the Amazon Basin. An obligate out-crosser, <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> flowers are pollinated by large-bodied bees, a process resulting in a hard round fruit that takes up to 14 months to mature. As many smallholders turn to the financial security provided by timber, <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> fruits are increasingly being harvested in logged forests. We tested the influence of tree and stand-level covariates (distance to nearest cut stump and local logging intensity) on total nut production at the individual tree level in five recently logged <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> concessions covering about 4000 ha of forest in Madre de Dios, Peru. Our field team accompanied <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> harvesters during the traditional harvest period (January-April 2012 and January-April 2013) in order to collect data on fruit production. Three hundred and ninety-nine (approximately 80 %) of the 499 trees included in this study were at least 100 m from the nearest cut stump, suggesting that concessionaires avoid logging near adult <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> trees. Yet even for those trees on the edge of logging gaps, distance to nearest cut stump and local logging intensity did not have a statistically significant influence on <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> production at the applied logging intensities (typically 1 - 2 timber trees removed per ha). In one concession where at least 4 trees ha- 1 were removed, however, the logging intensity covariate resulted in a marginally significant (0. 09) P value, highlighting a potential risk for a drop in nut production at higher intensities.

Semi-defatted <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> cake and cassava flour were used to formulate the mixtures for extrusion. A complete factorial central composite design (2 (3)) with 3 independent variables, and the response surface methodology were used to evaluate the results of the proximate composition and caloric value, according to the variations in the quantity of nut, moisture content and temperature. The results indicate that the mixtures with higher <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> levels present higher levels of protein, fat and ash, while the mixtures with less <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> present higher levels of carbohydrate.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine {{the relative merits of}} history, skin prick testing, measurement of serum-specific IgE and challenge in the diagnosis of <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> allergy. METHODS: Fifty-six children and adults with a history of an allergic reaction to <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> or evidence of sensitization were investigated by questionnaire (n= 56), skin prick tests (SPTs) (n= 53), measurement of serum-specific IgE to <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> (n= 54) and double-blind, placebo-controlled labial, and if necessary oral, challenges (n= 19). RESULTS: <b>Brazil</b> <b>nut</b> allergy occurred in highly atopic individuals of any age with a strong family history of atopy. In 24 of 56 (43 %), the history of an immediate reaction was sufficient to make a diagnosis with confidence and an oral challenge was considered unsafe. Of the 19 subjects undertaking the 'gold standard' test of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, food challenge, all six subjects with a SPT of at least 6 mm had a positive challenge and all three subjects with a SPT of 0 mm had a negative challenge. In the remaining 10 (53 %) subjects, where SPT was between 1 and 5 mm and serum-specific IgE was less than 3. 5 kU/L, an oral challenge was performed resulting in three positive and seven negative challenges.

Jessie Bond, who had played Pitti-Sing in the 1885 première, was unimpressed: [...] "Who, I want to know, intended that the Mikado should prance about like a madman, hissing out his lines like a serpent? ... The raving monster we so often see now is not one bit like the suave and oily Mikado created [...] at the Savoy." [...] The Times thought that he [...] "undoubtedly loses {{a good deal of the}} Mikado's humour... his 'humane Mikado' scene is the one which seems to have travelled farthest from the 'Savoy tradition'." [...] A later Times review commented more favourably: [...] "Mr Darrell Fancourt... can (and did) add a terrifying aspect to the benignity of his humaner punishment manifesto, and left us wondering how his vocal cords ever managed to function normally after those expressions of emphasis with which he punctuated its paragraphs." [...] The Manchester Guardian praised Fancourt's fresh approach and added, [...] "He makes more of the punishment-fitting-the-crime song than we can remember having seen from any other actor." [...] The Pall Mall Gazette said, [...] "Mr Fancourt has recognised that people can do with a 'thrill' in these Grand Guignol days.

[...] Another critic described the sound of Fancourt's laugh as [...] "a dragon getting up steam".
