5|$|The band {{arrived in}} Japan on 9 August, {{a week before}} the tour started, to a strong reception, and were greeted with gifts and flowers. Birch was not {{confident}} that the recording quality would be satisfactory, since the equipment supplied by Warner Bros. did not have any <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> and that the recorder's size did not appear big enough on sight to capture a commercial quality recording. The band were uninterested in the end result, concentrating on simply being able to deliver a good show. Lord later noticed however that he felt this attitude meant the spontaneity of the performances and interplay between the band members was captured well.|$|E
25|$|Crucial to the {{survival}} of a glacier is its mass balance or surface mass balance (SMB), the difference between accumulation and ablation (sublimation and melting). Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, causing changes in the surface mass balance. Changes in mass <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> a glacier's long-term behavior and are the most sensitive climate indicators on a glacier. From 1980–2012 the mean cumulative mass loss of glaciers reporting mass balance to the World Glacier Monitoring Service is −16 m. This includes 23 consecutive years of negative mass balances.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general dc-link voltage <b>balancing</b> <b>control</b> method for multilevel inverters {{based on a}} generalized space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) scheme, with no requirements for additional auxiliary- power circuits. The SVPWM scheme generates all the available switching states and switching sequences based on two simple mappings, and calculates the duty cycles simply as for a two level SVPWM, thus independent {{of the level of}} the inverter. The optimal switching sequence and optimal duty cycles for dc-link voltage <b>balancing</b> <b>control</b> are provided in the paper. Because all the measured signals are instantaneous values, the dc-link voltage <b>balancing</b> <b>control</b> method in the paper is suitable for any load without any assumption on the output current waveforms. The dc-link voltage <b>balancing</b> <b>control</b> in the paper is effective even when the capacitances of the dc-link capacitors of the multilevel inverter are not strictly equal or the voltage of the dc source of the multilevel inverter is fluctuating. Simulation results for a five-level inverter are given...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel model {{predictive}} control algorithm to achieve voltage regulation and simultaneous thermal and SOC balancing of a modular battery using limited future load information. The modular battery {{is based on}} multilevel converter (MLC), which provides a large redundancy in voltage synthesis and extra degree-of-freedom in control. The proposed algorithm is based on orthogonal decomposition of controller into two components, one for voltage control {{and the other for}} <b>balancing</b> <b>control.</b> The voltage control decisions are made using a simple minimum norm problem whereas the <b>balancing</b> <b>control</b> decisions are made in two stages. The first stage computes a <b>balancing</b> <b>control</b> policy based on an unconstrained LQ problem and the second stage enforces constraint on control actions via projection on a time-varying control constraint polytope. The control algorithm shows promising performance in a simulation study of a four cell modular battery.

40|$|Various <b>balancing</b> {{topology}} and <b>control</b> {{methods have}} been proposed for the inconsistency problem of battery packs. However, these strategies only focus on a single objective, ignore the mutual interaction among various factors and are only based on the external performance of the battery pack inconsistency, such as voltage balancing and state of charge (SOC) balancing. To solve these problems, multi-objective predictive <b>balancing</b> <b>control</b> (MOPBC) based on predictive current is proposed in this paper, namely, in the driving process of an electric vehicle, using predictive control to predict the battery pack output current the next time. Based on this information, {{the impact of the}} battery pack temperature caused by the output current can be obtained. Then, the influence is added to the battery pack <b>balancing</b> <b>control,</b> which makes the present degradation, temperature, and SOC imbalance achieve balance automatically due to the change of the output current the next moment. According to MOPBC, the simulation model of the balancing circuit is built with four cells in Matlab/Simulink.

Two actuators are used for <b>balancing</b> <b>control</b> by virtue of gyro effect and one actuator for driving movements. Since the space is limited and weight balance {{is an important factor}} for the successful <b>balancing</b> <b>control,</b> careful mechanical design is considered. To compensate for uncertainties in robot dynamics, a neural network is added to the nonmodel-based PD-controlled system. The reference compensation technique (RCT) is used for the neural network controller to help GYROBO to improve balancing and tracking performances. Experimental studies of a self-balancing task and a line tracking task are conducted to demonstrate the control performances of GYROBO...|$|R
5000|$|Postural {{control has}} been defined as the control of the body’s {{position}} in space for the purposes of balance and orientation. The postural control system adjusts its goal under different circumstances to maintain a steady, erect stance, maintenance of balance, and conservation of energy. There are various methods to identify the dynamics of human <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> Perturbed standing and Unperturbed standing are usually studied for quantifying <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> Center of mass (CoM), center of pressure (CoP) and electromyogram (EMG), joint moments, joint angles and angular velocities measures are commonly used to quantify human <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> Any external or internal perturbation that changes the projection of the CoM to the limits of the base of support, and the alignment between CoM and CoP, may lead to postural challenge. Balance mechanisms are anticipatory postural adjustments (APA), triggered by feedforward mechanisms prior to the perturbation [...] and Compensatory postural adjustments (CPA) that are initiated by sensory feedback signals. In one of the methods, the sensitivity of the CoP, EMG, CoM to external perturbations or to sensory perturbations have been quantified by estimated frequency response functions (FRFs). By combining sensory and mechanical perturbations and measuring both EMG and CoM responses the dynamics of the musculo-skeletal system and the gain and phase characteristics of reflexive feedback pathways are identified separately.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores how organisations <b>balance</b> <b>controlling</b> and {{enabling}} uses {{of management}} control systems (MCS), {{and how this}} balance facilitates the creation of dynamic tensions and unique organisational capabilities. By employing Simons' (1995) levers of control framework in a case study setting, the paper investigates the challenges faced by senior managers when they use MCS simultaneously to direct and empower. The findings indicate {{a number of factors}} - internal consistency, logical progression, historical tendency, dominance, and suppression - that impact the capacity of organisations to balance different uses of MCS. The interactive lever of control also plays a significant role in achieving and sustaining a <b>balance</b> between <b>controlling</b> and enabling uses of MCS, {{and its impact on the}} other levers is seen to constitute a unique organisational capability in its own right.
