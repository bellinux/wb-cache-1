25|$|In {{order to}} enter any section of line, the train crew must obtain {{permission}} from Control and the relevant token. Each section of {{line is a}} token <b>block</b> <b>section.</b> The WHR uses the traditional Staff and Ticket system in which trains can either be issued with the section token staff or a numbered ticket. Tickets allow multiple trains to pass one-at-a-time through a section in one direction. The Controller advises the train crew which method they will be using. Tickets are kept in a locked box opened by a key on the token staff. This means the last train must use the token staff {{to pass through the}} section, so it can be used for trains to travel in the opposite direction. For additional protection, both the footplate crew and the guard must see the token or ticket before the train can depart.|$|E
500|$|The ride {{experience}} was different in its earlier years. Passengers would enter under {{the middle of}} the coaster's lift. After entering an eerie space soundtrack played. The first room was [...] "Mission Control". Black lights lit the room. Travel posters and a rocket diagram were on the side walls. Two airport loading gates were seen next to two TV monitors (showing the head of the company [...] "The Dispatch Master" [...] or random space pilots) and were on either side of a desk in the middle. An employee sitting at the desk would say to the riders that the loading gates on were both malfunctioning and the riders had to be rerouted through the [...] "service rooms" [...] of the hangar. Walking into the next room deemed [...] "Rocket Recovery", guests would see a [...] "rocket locator" [...] robot named [...] "Dave" [...] working up on a platform at a terminal trying to contact the companies rockets (one according to him crashed outside of Akron). Walking down another hallway, guests could glance at crates inside of a warehouse within the building. After the short hallway, guests entered the [...] "Repair Bay". A room showcasing a [...] "binocular security camera" [...] robot named [...] "Franc" [...] looking around the room (he was later removed). There were also suspended conveyor baskets carrying various items, a high voltage generator, pneumatic robotic arms [...] "repairing" [...] a rocket, and a security scanner that flashed [...] "REJECT" [...] after scanning guests.A small room outside the Repair Bay had the company's logo subtlety broken to reveal the ride's true name. Entering the [...] "Launch Area" [...] rockets moved from behind a curtain without passengers. After ten people loaded on a rocket the ride began. The rocket moved out on a <b>block</b> <b>section</b> where an [...] "on-board computer" [...] welcomed you and started the [...] "automatic launch sequence". Two spinning laser light spheres projected a star field around the rocket as it climbed the lift. Upon reaching the top your computer takes notice of nearby [...] "space pirates" [...] and begins to perform abrasive maneuvers. As riders went through the coaster, they would see exploding rockets, meteors, laser projections, and a satellite that shot lasers. Your on-board computer shouts [...] "I'm losing control, I'm losing control!" [...] before an Alaskan landscape came into view and the rockets entered the brake run. Riders entered the unloading station where they were greeted by an employee that yells [...] "WELCOME TO ALASKA!" [...] The riders disembarked their vehicle and exited on the left.|$|E

2500|$|The {{warning signal}} {{is the most}} unusual of {{the three types of}} British {{permissive}} signal. It is, like the shunt-ahead, placed under the signal governing entry to the section ahead, but its function is very different. For a signalman to accept a train, both his <b>block</b> <b>section</b> and the line for a quarter mile inside his outer home signal must usually be clear; the quarter mile is a precaution in case the driver fails to stop in time for the outer home signal. However, it is possible to accept a train under the [...] "Warning Arrangement" [...] if the <b>block</b> <b>section,</b> but not the quarter-mile overlap, is clear. As its name implies, the signalman must stop and caution the driver of the train concerned, and the warning signal simply replaces the signalman's caution where this operation is frequent. Because there is no margin for braking error, the warning arrangement cannot usually be applied to passenger trains: its commonest use is to allow a goods train to run into a section to shunt a siding {{in the middle of that}} section, while a train is still occupying the station ahead.|$|E
2500|$|After {{passenger}} services ceased on the Richborough Port branch, it was worked [...] "on demand" [...] to the facilities at Sandwich Road and Richborough Castle. [...] The siding at Poison Cross amounted to Eastry's goods yard, so main line train engines ventured this far to handle vehicles if necessary (the short distance was a separate <b>block</b> <b>section).</b> [...] Alarmingly, {{towards the end}} main line trains could be left waiting, {{even if they had}} passengers, for the engines to run as far as Richborough Castle and back if need be.|$|E
2500|$|The {{station was}} reopened on 11 December 1905 as Fotherby Halt to {{coincide}} with the introduction of a motor train service by the Great Northern Railway. It consisted of two low parallel halt platforms to the south of the level crossing; a crossing box (the <b>block</b> <b>section</b> being Ludborough-Louth North) was sited at the northern end of the up platform next to the crossing and opposite Fotherby gatehouse which served as the crossing keeper's cottage. Passenger services called at the station upon request only. The station closed on 11 September 1961, the same day as [...] to the north which had opened on the same day as part of the rail motor service.|$|E

In addition to his inexperience, the signalling between Gerrards Cross and High Wycombe was unusually complex, with several track circuit <b>block</b> <b>sections</b> and intermediate <b>block</b> <b>sections.</b> The signal box diagram was subsequently altered to make its indications less ambiguous.|$|R

5000|$|The {{signalling}} system is normally permissive: {{the driver of}} a train is permitted to proceed into an occupied <b>block</b> <b>section</b> without first obtaining authorisation.

40|$|Dispatchers often set noncrossing <b>block</b> <b>sections</b> (NCBSs) for railway out-of-gauge train (OGT) {{running on}} {{double-track}} railway line for safety reasons. In this paper, we will investigate the best location, length, {{and number of}} noncrossing <b>block</b> <b>sections</b> to reduce railway capacity loss due to the operation of OGTs. Firstly, yielding, overtaking, stopping, starting, and other operation rules for OGTs running on double-track railway line were designed, and a simulation model based on cellular automata was further put forward. Then, an assessment model for double-track railway line capacity loss due to the operation of OGTs was set up. Some simulation experiments and the comparisons of these results were further given to achieve the optimal setting of NCBS for OGTs running on double-track railway line. In the case of NCBSs number minus one, capacity loss caused by the operation of OGTs can be reduced up to 15. 2 % in the upstream direction and 6. 3 % in the downstream direction. Also, the NCBSs should lie at the nearest <b>block</b> <b>sections</b> (BSs) to depot stations and the NCBSs lengths should be as less as possible...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{a study on}} the {{correlation}} among capacity, <b>block</b> <b>sections</b> length, typology of services and timetables for high density lines such as urban railway corridors is presented. The adopted methodology is explained as well as the use of simulation for the analysis of sensitivity. Stability and robustness of selected timetables are investigated. In particular, railway system's performances are linked to timetable planning criteria, i. e. to the definition of appropriated recovery times and buffer times, which influence the definition of available capacity. The possibility to find a trade-off value among these parameters is described. In this context the differences between theoretical timetables (which are defined by technical features of infrastructure and rolling stock) and the adopted timetables (which include recovery and buffer times and are functional to a defined level of service) are explained. The estimation of correlations among capacity, <b>block</b> <b>sections</b> length, timetable and operational plan is conceived as a basis to provide guidelines to design new urban railways or to evaluate possible reliability effects of actions on <b>block</b> <b>sections</b> (often with changes on the adopted signalling) or timetables. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

5000|$|The {{signalling}} system is permissive; {{the driver of}} a train is permitted to proceed into an occupied <b>block</b> <b>section</b> without first obtaining authorisation. Speed in this situation is limited to 30 kilometres per hour (19 mph) and if speed exceeds 35 km/h (22 mph), the emergency brake is applied and the train stops.

40|$|Background: Differentiation between {{benign and}} {{malignant}} serous effusions always poses a great diagnostic dilemma. Differentiation often requires clinical findings, morphological evaluation and sometimes immunocytochemistry. Diagnostic possibility is enhanced if cell blocks are made {{along with the}} conventional cytology smears. This will help the clinicians in both treating the patient and determining {{the outcome of the}} disease process. Materials and methods: This hospital-based cross sectional analytical study was carried out in Department of Pathology in National Academy of Medical Sciences, Bir Hospital for one year. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the smears cytology with cell <b>blocks</b> <b>sections</b> in serous effusions. Results: The four criteria scored for each technique were volume of background blood, amount of diagnostic cellular material, degree of cellular degeneration and trauma and architectural preservation. Background blood, amount of diagnostic material present and retention of architecture was more in cell <b>block</b> <b>sections</b> compared with smears cytology; whereas cellular degeneration and trauma was less appreciated in cell <b>block</b> <b>sections</b> which scored more than the smears cytology. Conclusion: Cell block preparation is simple, rapid and inexpensive technique for serous fluids in which malignant cells can be reliably detected thus avoiding unnecessary invasive procedure in patient management.
