5|$|The Forerunner Saga reveals Guilty Spark to have <b>barely</b> {{survived the}} events of Halo 3. His body <b>barely</b> {{functioning}} and his memory {{of the last few}} years erased from his fight with Chief, he was recovered by the UNSC ship Rubicon and interrogated by ONI for information about the Forerunners. During the interrogation, the <b>barely</b> functioning Spark had breached the Rubicon's firewalls and overpowered the onboard A.I. When the interrogation was over, his monitor body shut down and was launched into space, but his mind remained in the ship, informing the crew {{that he was going to}} search for the Librarian and restore his friends Riser and Vinnerva from his life as Chakas before placing the crew in cryostasis and taking the ship for his own to search for the Forerunner.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Allingham {{was posted}} to the RNAS Air Station at Great Yarmouth {{where he worked}} in {{aircraft}} maintenance. On 13 April 1916, King George V inspected the air station and its aircraft. Allingham later reported disappointment at <b>barely</b> missing an opportunity {{to speak with the}} king.|$|E
5|$|After the separation, Margo {{moves into}} Beale's {{apartment}} {{and they get}} married soon afterwards. In response to the marriage, Susanna impulsively marries Lincoln (Alexander Skarsgård), a bartender whom she <b>barely</b> knows. Maisie bonds with Lincoln, but Susanna quickly grows resentful of how much Maisie warms to him.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht Goštautas (Olbracht Gasztołd), Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and voivode of Vilnius, is <b>barely</b> {{visible in}} the top right of the painting. His {{presence}} in the painting is intended to symbolize {{the wisdom of the}} king as a legislator.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, our factory used {{to produce}} 600 tons of soap annually. Due to the {{physical}} and economic obstacles we face {{now because of the}} Israeli occupation – and especially the checkpoints – we produce <b>barely</b> half that amount today.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, Stonehenge {{recommended}} {{a cross between}} a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever. He found the crossbreed to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could <b>barely</b> carry a hare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} near Bryansk, initial Soviet {{performance}} was <b>barely</b> {{more effective than}} at Vyazma. The Second Panzer Group executed an enveloping movement around the city, linking with the advancing 2nd Army and capturing Orel by 3 October and Bryansk by 6 October.|$|E
5|$|Revenues grew {{along with}} {{ridership}} {{over the first}} three years, but ridership remained below expectations. In 2008 {{the second year of}} operation, revenues fell <b>barely</b> short of THSRC's expectations a year earlier of a doubling of first-year results.|$|E
5|$|The Himalia {{group is}} spread over <b>barely</b> 1.4Gm in semi-major axes, 1.6° in {{inclination}} (27.5±0.8°), and eccentricities between 0.11 and 0.25. It {{has been suggested}} that the group could be a remnant of the break-up of an asteroid from the asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of FBO/Robertson-Cole pictures, produced during either the silent era or the transitional period of the conversion to sound cinema, {{are considered to be}} lost films, with no copies now known to exist. Partly in consequence, many of FBO's star actors are <b>barely</b> remembered today.|$|E
5|$|While the {{perianth}} may point forwards, in {{some species}} such as N. cyclamineus it is folded back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while in some other {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium (Table I), it is reduced to a few <b>barely</b> visible pointed segments with a prominent corona.|$|E
5|$|A rebellious Nemo {{lives with}} his mother and her new partner, Harry, in Montreal. He sees a new girl, Anna, in his school and is {{immediately}} smitten. One day on the beach, Anna asks if he would like to swim with her and her friends. Nemo insults her friends and they <b>barely</b> see each other again.|$|E
5|$|A small {{offering}} chapel is adjoining {{the eastern}} side of the main pyramid and is <b>barely</b> visible today. It consisted of a central two pillared room with a large quartzite false door and two narrow chambers on the sides. Like the mortuary temple, the chapel was floored with black basalt. Its walls however were made of Tura limestone and granite and were adorned with fine reliefs of offering scenes.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Heraclea, Attalus and Sulpicius sacked both Oreus, on the {{northern}} coast of Euboea, and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. However, with their forces divided, Philip, alerted by signal fire, attacked and took Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was <b>barely</b> able to escape to his ships.|$|E
5|$|After {{occupying the}} capital, Habré {{consolidated}} power by occupying {{the rest of}} the country. In <b>barely</b> six weeks, he conquered southern Chad, destroying the FAT, Kamougué's militia; Kamougué's hopes for Libyan help failed to materialize. The rest of the country was conquered, {{with the exception of the}} Tibesti.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the equaliser United won another corner, again taken by Beckham. He landed {{the ball on the}} head of Sheringham who nodded it to Solskjær who in turn toe-poked it into the roof of the net. Oliver Kahn, the Bayern goalkeeper, was motionless on the line. United had completed the come-back. Bayern <b>barely</b> had time to restart the game, which referee Collina brought to a close just a few seconds later.|$|E
5|$|Although Jean-Jacques Dessalines, {{a pivotal}} {{figure in the}} Haitian Revolution, is <b>barely</b> {{mentioned}} in the novel, the one page dedicated to him emphasizes his connection to African gods while neglecting to mention any of his other features that made him an effective leader. While Dessaline's belief in African gods is highlighted, Henri Christophe's abandonment of the religion is stressed, being identified {{as the reason for}} his downfall.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he spent}} <b>barely</b> 10 or 12 weeks {{in any one}} year in Whitby, he was still {{attached}} to it. Shortly before his death he published A Haunt of Ancient Peace, a history of Bagdale Old Hall (with Sir D'Arcy Power, KBE), and also made several large donations: £3000 to Whitby Parish Church, £2000 to the museum and £500 to the Whitby Literary and Philosophy Society.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{authors have}} implicated Domitian {{in the death}} of his brother, either by {{directly}} accusing him of murder, or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead, even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother. It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had <b>barely</b> seen Titus after the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|Arya Stark {{successfully}} secures passage back to Westeros by bribing a Westerosi trader. However, she is subsequently attacked on {{a nearby}} bridge and repeatedly stabbed in the abdomen by the Waif, {{in the guise of}} an elderly woman. Arya pushes the Waif away, and <b>barely</b> escapes by jumping off the bridge and swimming away underwater. After surfacing, she is then left stumbling through the streets, critically wounded.|$|E
5|$|At 05:13 on 5 August, Bridgeports lookouts spotted Ushant Light. At 06:40, SC-48 sighted a torpedo {{and sounded}} a warning. Two minutes later, men {{on board the}} tender saw the torpedo wake on Bridgeports port quarter. Orders came down for full left rudder and full speed ahead. Bridgeport swung <b>barely</b> out of harm's way as men on her stern {{observed}} the torpedo disappear {{on the port side}} and reappear to starboard. It passed five feet astern, <b>barely</b> clearing the rudder. The starboard battery fired one shot {{in the direction of the}} torpedo—which broached on the starboard quarter—while the port guns fired in the direction from which the torpedo had come. Meanwhile, two destroyers, with a number of subchasers, hurried toward the spot where the torpedo wake had apparently begun and dropped depth charges. Bridgeport ceased fire and resumed her place in the formation. Through all this activity, no one actually saw the submarine that had fired the torpedo.|$|E
5|$|At mid-September the Eighth Army and the ROK Army {{were still}} engaged with North Korean forces at nearly all {{points of the}} Pusan Perimeter. After {{two weeks of the}} {{heaviest}} fighting of the war they had just <b>barely</b> turned back the North Korean Great Naktong Offensive on the main axes of the attack around the approaches to Masan.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the novel, Charles {{returns from}} Europe; he and Mary {{establish}} something of a life together, but Mary is unhealthy and can <b>barely</b> stand {{to be in the same}} room with her husband; the last few lines of the novel imply that she will die young.|$|E
5|$|Balotelli {{was named}} in the final 23-man squad for the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championships and scored the opening goal against the hosts Sweden in the 23rd minute. <b>Barely</b> 15 minutes later he was shown a red card for retaliating against a Swedish midfielder Pontus Wernbloom. Italy were {{eliminated}} by eventual champions Germany in the semi-finals, following a 1–0 defeat.|$|E
5|$|By 1939, it {{was clear}} that war was looming, and the team began to turn their primary {{attention}} from ASV back to AI. A new set, built by combining the transmitter unit from the latest ASV units with the EMI receiver, first flew in a Battle in May 1939. The system demonstrated a maximum range that was <b>barely</b> adequate, around , but the too-long minimum range proved to be a far greater problem.|$|E
5|$|By July7, most of {{the deep}} {{convection}} associated with Blanca had dissipated, and the remaining convection was confined to an outer band southeast of the center. Later that day, the system was <b>barely</b> holding on to tropical storm intensity as the center became devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. A brief burst in convection allowed Blanca to maintain 40mph (65km/h) winds, minimal tropical storm intensity, for several more hours before being downgraded to a tropical depression.|$|E
5|$|By most {{accounts}} Allen's first marriage was an unhappy one. His wife was rigidly religious, prone to criticizing him, and <b>barely</b> {{able to read}} and write. In contrast, Allen's behavior was sometimes quite flamboyant; and he maintained an interest in learning. In spite of these differences the marriage survived until Mary's death in 1783. Allen and Mary had five children together (Loraine, Joseph, Lucy, Mary, and Pamela), only two of whom reached adulthood.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Sri Lanka became {{independent}} in 1948, about {{sixty percent of}} government jobs were held by Tamils, who formed <b>barely</b> fifteen percent of the population. The elected Sinhalese leaders of the country saw this {{as the result of}} a British stratagem to control the majority Sinhalese, and deemed it a situation that needed correction by implementation of the Policy of standardization.|$|E
5|$|Cabin in the Cotton (1932) is a Warner Bros. message {{film about}} the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an {{unspecified}} southern state where workers are given <b>barely</b> enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners. The film is decidedly anti-capitalist; however, its preface claims otherwise: In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.|$|E
5|$|Considered only a two-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, Blount was {{not ranked}} among the best running back {{prospects}} {{in the nation in}} the Class of 2005. <b>Barely</b> recruited out of high school, he attended camp at Auburn University but was not offered an athletic scholarship. He nonetheless intended to go to Auburn but did not qualify academically, so he headed for junior college at East Mississippi Community College.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a shot that was <b>barely</b> pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E
5|$|Ernest Manning succeeded Aberhart as premier. Under Manning, Social Credit {{moved away}} from the {{monetary}} theory of Douglas and towards traditional conservatism. Manning lead the party through seven-straight massive majorities, (although in 1955 his government received <b>barely</b> more seats than Aberhart had received in 1940, due to a strong but short-lived Liberal drive). After 24 years as premier, Manning resigned in 1967.|$|E
5|$|France's {{intervention}} in the coup was openly applauded by the Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, Niger, and Upper Volta. In fact, France was <b>barely</b> criticised at all in Africa, other than a mild response by Dahomey and one by the Democratic Republic of Congo. The matter was not discussed at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers of the OAU, held on 24 February–29 February in Lagos. The revolutionary movement in French Africa immediately retrogressed following the coup.|$|E
5|$|Frank, Ashley, Rhett {{and several}} other accomplices make a night raid on a shanty town after Scarlett is {{attacked}} while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral <b>barely</b> over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children {{and that they will}} no longer share a bed.|$|E
