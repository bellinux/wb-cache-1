40|$|Neurotoxicity and {{mechanistic}} {{data were}} collected for six alpha-cyano pyrethroids (beta-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenpropathrin and lambda-cyhalothrin) and up to six non-cyano containing pyrethroids (bifenthrin, S-bioallethrin [or allethrin], permethrin, pyrethrins, resmethrin [or its cis-isomer, cismethrin] and tefluthrin under standard conditions. Factor analysis and multivariate dissimilarity analysis were employed to evaluate four independent data sets comprised of (1) fifty-six behavioral and physiological parameters from an acute neurotoxicity functional observatory battery (FOB), (2) eight electrophysiological parameters from voltage clamp experiments conducted on the Na(v) 1. 8 sodium channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes, (3) indices of efficacy, potency and binding calculated for calcium ion influx across neuronal membranes, membrane depolarization and glutamate released from rat brain synaptosomes and (4) changes in chloride channel open state probability using a patch voltage clamp technique for membranes isolated from mouse neuroblastoma cells. The pyrethroids segregated into Type I (T [...] syndrome-tremors) and Type II (CS syndrome [...] choreoathetosis with salivation) groups based on FOB data. Of the alpha-cyano pyrethroids, deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin and cypermethrin arrayed themselves strongly in a dose-dependent manner along two factors that characterize the CS syndrome. Esfenvalerate and fenpropathrin displayed weaker response profiles compared to the non-cyano pyrethroids. Visual clustering on multidimensional scaling (MDS) maps based upon sodium ion channel and calcium influx and glutamate release dissimilarities gave similar groupings. The non-cyano containing pyrethroids were arrayed in a dose-dependent manner along two different factors that characterize the T-syndrome. Bifenthrin was an outlier when MDS maps of the non-cyano pyrethroids were based on sodium ion channel characteristics and permethrin was an outlier when the MDS maps were based on calcium influx/glutamate release potency. Four of six alpha-cyano pyrethroids (lambda-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and fenpropathrin) reduced open chloride channel probability. The R-isomers of lambda-l-cyhalothrin reduced open channel probability whereas the S-isomers, antagonized {{the action of the}} R-isomers. None of the non-cyano pyrethroids reduced open channel probability, except <b>bioallethrin,</b> which gave a weak response. Overall, based upon neurotoxicity data and the effect of pyrethroids on sodium, calcium and chloride ion channels, it is proposed that <b>bioallethrin,</b> cismethrin, tefluthrin, bifenthrin and permethrin belong to one common mechanism group and deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin and cypermethrin belong to a second.

40|$|Abstract: The {{toxicity}} of a neem extract RB-a {{in comparison with}} a pyrethroid, Coopex, was studied along with their effects on GPT and GOT activities and oxygen consumption in S. oryzae. The LD 50 value of Coopex {{was found to be}} 6. 128 µg/cm 2 whereas RB-a was found not to be an acute contact poison. Even at a dose of 1257 µg/cm 2 it could cause 34 % mortality of S. oryzae. The oxygen consumption under the effects of Coopex was found to decline less i. e. at 6. 12 µg/cm 2 from 0. 0005191 to 0. 0006589, as compared to RB-a where the rate of respiration declined more i. e. at 1257 µg/cm 2 from 0. 0005191 to 0. 0002076. Coopex brought about an inhibition of 62. 77 % in GPt activity and caused almost no inhibition of GOT activity in insects treated with its LD 50.

40|$|Isolated {{presynaptic}} nerve terminals (synaptosomes) prepared from rat brain {{were used}} to evaluate the action of a classic T-syndrome (cismethrin) and CS-syndrome (deltamethrin) pyrethroid on voltage-sensitive calcium channels by measuring calcium influx and neurotransmitter release with multiple fluorescent assays. Both cismethrin and deltamethrin stimulated calcium influx in a stereospecific manner; however, they did so by different mechanisms. Neurotransmitter released occurred only with synaptosomes treated with deltamethrin. This release was stereospecific, stimulated by depolarization, unaltered by tetrodotoxin, but blocked by ω-conotoxin MVIIC. ^ Electrophysiological experiments with Cav 2. 2 expressed in Xenopus oocytes validated the interaction of deltamethrin with this N-type calcium channel. Thus, cismethrin and deltamethrin elicit different actions at presynaptic nerve terminals. The modification of Cav 2. 2 voltage-sensitive calcium channels by deltamethrin is consistent with enhanced neurotransmitter release, a physiological response that has been observed during acute neurotoxicity of CS syndrome pyrethroids. ^ Rat brain synaptosomes were also {{used to evaluate the}} action of 11 pyrethroids (bifenthrin, <b>bioallethrin,</b> cismethrin, cyfluthrin, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, esfenvalerate, fenpropathrin, permethrin, and tefluthrin) by measuring calcium uptake, membrane depolarization, and neurotransmitter release as before. Our results indicate that only a subset of the commercially available pyrethroids act as voltage-sensitive calcium channels agonists (permethrin, cyfluthrin, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, and esfenvalerate). Pyrethroids that significantly enhanced calcium influx were also more potent in releasing neurotransmitter. Increased glutamate release appears to be due to an agonistic action of these compounds on Cav 2. 1 and Cav 2. 2 voltage-sensitive calcium channels, most associated with neurotransmitter release. ^ Biochemical and electrophysiological experiments provide functional evidence for a distinct mechanism of action for some of the pyrethroids on voltage-sensitive calcium channels at the presynaptic nerve terminal that results in enhanced neurotransmitter release, a response that is consistent with the observed symptomology of CS-syndrome pyrethroids. Such results will allow a more complete understanding of the molecular and cellular nature of pyrethroid-induced neurotoxicity and expand our knowledge of the structure-activity relationships of pyrethroids in regards to the voltage-sensitive calcium channel. ...|$|E
40|$|Fulltext: Biocidal sprays are {{frequently}} used by consumers in indoor areas to control pests. To obtain data on indoor contaminations, different insecticide aerosol sprays were applied in furnished model rooms (40 m³). On the one hand, the sprays were used {{according to the}} manufacturers' instructions (spraying for about 10 - 20 sec), {{and on the other}} hand under worst-case conditions (spraying for 2 min). Within two weeks, four spray applications with correct use and three worst-case applications were performed. Indoor air was collected a) during the spraying process, b) 2 - 4 h after spraying (in case of correct use the room was ventilated for 30 min), and c) about two weeks after the last application. The applied sprays contained i) tetramethrin/d-phenothrin (0. 15 g/ 0. 15 g), ii) pyrethrum extract/PBO (0. 25 g/ 1 g), and iii) chlorpyrifos/bioallethrin/PBO (0. 5 g/ 0. 15 g/n. s.) per 100 g spray. During spraying, concentrations of biocides in the air (mean values from 3 or 4 measurements) ranged from 100 - 1020 µg/m³ for correct use (290 - 6020 µg/m³ for worst case). Highest concentrations of 2510 µg/m³ (10340 µg/m³) were measured for the synergist PBO. Two to four h after application, concentrations of the active ingredients in the indoor air were down to 0. 1 - 0. 8 % (1 - 11 % for worst case). Three weeks after the last application, concentrations between 0. 02 - 1 µg/m³ were measured for both scenarios. To determine the surface load, pads of filter paper were placed horizontally at different positions in the room. The amounts of active ingredients were determined at different times (after first and last applications and about two weeks later). Concentrations varied from 10 - 480 ng/cm² (70 - 5700 ng/cm² for worst case) for biocides and from 300 - 2260 ng/cm² (1000 - 16500 ng/cm² for worst case) for PBO.

40|$|Five commercially {{available}} insect sprays were applied {{in a model}} room. Spraying was performed {{in accordance with the}} manufacturers' instructions and in an overdosed manner in order to simulate worst-case conditions or an unforeseeable Misuse. In addition, we examined electro-vaporizers. The Respicon (TM) aerosol monitoring system was applied to determine inhalation exposure. During normal spraying (10 seconds) and during the following 2 - 3 minutes, exposure concentrations ranged from 70 to 590 mu g/m(3) for the pyrethroids tetramethrin, d-phenothrin, cyfluthrin, bloallethrin, and the pyrethrins. Calculated inhalable doses were 2 - 16 mu g. A concentration of approximately 850 mu g chlorpyrifos/m(3) (inhalable dose: approximately 20 mu g) was determined when the "Contra insect fly spray" was applied. Highest exposure concentrations (1100 - 2100 mu g/m(3)) were measured for piperonyl butoxide (PBO), corresponding to an inhalation intake of 30 - 60 mu g. When simulating worst-case conditions, exposure concentrations of 200 - 3400 mu g/m(3) and inhalable doses of 10 - 210 mu g were determined for the various active substances. Highest concentrations (4800 - 8000 mu g/m(3)) were measured for PBO (inhalable: 290 - 480 mu g). By applying the electro-vaporizer "Nexa Lotte" plug-in mosquito killer concentrations for d-allethrin were in the range of 5 - 12 mu g/m(3) and 0. 5 - 2 mu g/m(3) for PBO while with the "Paral" plug-in mosquito killer concentrations of 0. 4 - 5 mu g/m(3) for pyrethrins and 1 - 7 mu g/m(3) for PBO were measured. Potential dermal exposures were determined using exposure pads. Between 80 and 1000 mu g active substance (tetramethrin, phenothrin, cyfluthrin, <b>bioallethrin,</b> pyrethrins, chlorpyrifos) were deposited on the clothing of the total body surface area of the spray user. Highest levels (up to 3000 mu g) were determined for PBO. Worst-case uses of the sprays led to 5 - 9 times higher concentrations. Also a 2 -hour stay nearby an operating electro-vaporizer led to a contamination of the clothing (total amounts on the whole body were 450 mu g d-allethrin and 50 mu g PBO for "Nexa Lotte" plug-in mosquito killer and 80 mu g pyrethrins and 190 mu g PBO for "Paral" plug-in mosquito killer). Human blomonitoring data revealed urine concentrations of the metabolite (E) -trans-chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid ((E) -trans-CDCA) between 1. 7 mu g/l and 7. 1 mu g/l after 5 minutes of exposure to the different sprays. Also the use of electro-vaporizers led to (E) -trans-CDCA concentrations in the urine in the range of 1. 0 mu g/l to 6. 2 mu g/l (1 - 3 hours exposure period). The exposure data presented can be used for performing human risk assessment when these biocidal products were applied indoors. The airborne concentrations of the non-volatile active chemical compounds could be predicted from first principles using a deterministic exposure model (SprayExpo) ...|$|E

The results showed that the tested chemicals were very effective in controlling eggs, larvae and pupae at laboratory. By making use of the preference of F. taiwana, they could be trapped by physical control with a artificial blood membrane added by human blood and lactic acid, black flannelette spread by human perspiration all of which were placed 100 cm above the ground at 39 ℃ water bath. The midge would also approach to CO 2 mixed with human breath and dry ice. Based on these observations, an auto trap for F. taiwana was invented. When comparing the effectiveness of different sources of CO 2 that the trap adopted, CO 2 discharged from a steel tube was better than that from other resources. Heater did not influence the trapping effect of CO 2. As for colors of background of the sucker, black, yellow, blue and green were more effective in attracting the midge than brown, red, dark red and white. Regarding the proper distance of the trap from the ground, it could attracted more adults at 40 - 70 cm above the ground but not at all beyond 230 cm. The best CO 2 discharged rate was 200 and 500 ml/min especially when the discharge exit was placed at 15 - 20 cm from the fan blades. When the wind blowing rate was higher than 2. 2 m/s, no midge could be caught. However, when it was under 0. 5 m/s, the numbers greatly increased. When three sets of traps were placed in areas with high density of the midge for a long time, the mean numbers of the midge they caught were 346. 7, 422. 7 and 327. The investigation of the density of daily population presence by the trap found that the peak appeared from 16 : 00 to 17 : 00, the result being {{similar to that of the}} study by the human body. 化學防治台灣鋏蠓時，利用有機磷劑 Chlorpyrifos，Fenitrothion ，Malathion，Primiphos-methyl、除蟲菊精之 Permethrin、以及 IGR 類之 Pyriproxyfen 和 Diflubenzuron 等作為室內試驗防治台灣鋏蠓卵 、幼蟲及蛹之藥劑，對卵之 LC 50 分別為 0. 04874 ， 0. 00076 ， 0. 21142 ， 0. 01733 ， 0. 22478 ， 0. 08719 及 0. 06333 (% concentration = mg A.
