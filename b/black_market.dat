5|$|Because of {{the tight}} rationing, a <b>black</b> <b>market</b> {{in food and}} other {{consumer}} goods emerged. Food on the <b>black</b> <b>market</b> was extremely expensive. Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, the <b>black</b> <b>market</b> spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration {{were involved in the}} <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E

5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} is the <b>black</b> <b>market.</b> FairTax supporters {{state that the}} <b>black</b> <b>market</b> is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a sales tax, supporters argue that <b>black</b> <b>market</b> activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit sales tax), but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the trading}} of tiger parts in Asia {{has become a}} major <b>black</b> <b>market</b> {{industry}} and governmental and conservation attempts to stop it have been ineffective to date. Almost all black marketers engaged in the trade are based in China and have either been shipped and sold within in their own country or into Taiwan, South Korea or Japan. The Chinese subspecies was almost completely decimated by killing for commerce due to both the parts and skin trades in the 1950s through the 1970s. Contributing to the illegal trade, {{there are a number of}} tiger farms in the country specialising in breeding the cats for profit. It is estimated that between 5,000 and 10,000 captive-bred, semi-tame animals live in these farms today. However, many tigers for traditional medicine <b>black</b> <b>market</b> are wild ones shot or snared by poachers and may be caught anywhere in the tiger's remaining range (from Siberia to India to the Malay Peninsula to Sumatra). In the Asian <b>black</b> <b>market,</b> a tiger penis can be worth the equivalent of around $300 U.S. dollars. In the years of 1990 through 1992, 27 million products with tiger derivatives were found. In July 2014 at an international convention on endangered species in Geneva, Switzerland, a Chinese representative admitted for the first time his government was aware trading in tiger skins was occurring in China.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the unique <b>black</b> <b>markets</b> of asset pooling and leasing services, which exposes {{the nature and}} extent of industry-specific threats. We explore how firms providing such services together with their network structures that constitute the foundations of asset pooling and leasing respond to the threat of <b>black</b> <b>markets.</b> We encapsulate detecting and encountering the threat of <b>black</b> <b>markets</b> through the theoretical lens of agility, which encompasses the elements of sensing and responding (Overby et al. 2006; Roberts and Grover 2012). This novel concept of responding to threats using the agility lens has not been adequately addressed by past studies on enterprise agility. Through a case study of a global asset pooling and leasing company, we reveal the criticality of network structures, the impracticality of IT and inadequate tracking mechanisms that challenge firms in minimizing such threats...|$|R

5|$|Sometimes {{arms were}} {{purchased}} on the <b>black</b> <b>market</b> from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports. Purchases {{were made by}} individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important. All such purchases were highly risky, as the Gestapo {{was well aware of}} this <b>black</b> <b>market</b> in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{alternative}} role of large-scale money finance as a fiscal instrument for financing indirectly from <b>black</b> <b>markets</b> when an economy is heavily controlled. It demonstrates that (1) in the Japanese national accounts, aggregate expenditure exceeded aggregate income by income leakages to <b>black</b> <b>markets</b> under the strict price {{control of the}} wartime and postwar years 1937 - 1949, and (2) in order to cover a financial shortage resulting from such income leakages, private agents bartered directly with illegal dealers, but the government let the Bank of Japan (BoJ) underwrite public bonds instead of dealing directly with formal/poor agents or illegitimate/rich agents. The BoJ notes issued to the government were eventually held {{as a means to}} conceal income by illegal dealers. Some policy implications for currency reforms are also explored with consideration {{for the fact that the}} emergence of <b>black</b> <b>markets</b> necessitated the BoJ's direct underwriting...|$|R

Its release was later postponed to the third quarter of 2009. A demo for the game, released on 4 March 2010, attracted more than two million players. According to studio founder Christofer Sundberg, the demo was envisioned as a smaller version of the game so players could fully experience its open-ended gameplay. After Japanese publisher Square Enix acquired Eidos Interactive, it announced that the game would be released in North America on 23 March 2010 and in Europe on 26 March.

5|$|Gameplay {{takes place}} in the Fragmented Sectors, an area of outer space filled with asteroids that are rich in mineral resources. The aim of the game is to {{colonise}} and mine the asteroids for the various ores found on them and then sell the ore to the Federation. The player can use the proceeds for empire expansion, purchasing new technologies, construction of buildings, ships and missiles, spying, trading and also to pay fines should the Federation impose any. Construction of the various missiles and ships requires quantities of different ores, so the decision to sell to the Federation is not straightforward. The game has a stock market where commodities can be bought and sold. There is also a <b>black</b> <b>market</b> offering unauthorised information regarding individual spies and colony supervisors, and illicit trade in rare ores and missiles. The manual states that any TetraCorp employee caught selling ore on the <b>black</b> <b>market</b> will be terminated.|$|E
