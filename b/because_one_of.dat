On another occasion he personally shot every fifth member of a crew because one had not returned to the camp. The main murder site at Płaszów was Hujowa Górka ("Prick Hill"), a large hill that was used for mass killings and murders. Pemper testified that 8,000 to 12,000 people were murdered at Płaszów.|$|E

5|$|In January 1141 William {{was elected}} Archbishop of York. Originally, the cathedral chapter of York had elected Waltheof in 1140, but that {{election}} was set aside <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Waltheof's supporters {{had made an}} uncanonical gift to secure Waltheof's election. Then Henry of Blois tried to secure the see for Henry de Sully, another nephew of Stephen and Henry's. Sully's election was opposed by Pope Innocent II, who refused to confirm him as archbishop while he retained his post as Abbot of Fécamp. It was only at a third election, held in January 1141, that William was selected. Whether {{he had been a}} candidate in the previous two elections is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In May 1919, upon {{receiving}} {{an invitation from}} fellow Jewish artist Marc Chagall, Lissitzky returned to Vitebsk to teach graphic arts, printing, and architecture at the newly formed People's Art School– a school that Chagall created after being appointed Commissioner of Artistic Affairs for Vitebsk in 1918. Lissitzky was engaged in designing and printing propaganda posters; later, he preferred to keep quiet about this period, probably <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> main subjects of these posters was the exile Leon Trotsky. The quantity of these posters is sufficient to regard them as a separate genre in the artist's output.|$|E
5|$|In the Seminoles' sixth {{game of the}} season, they {{traveled}} to Charlottesville, Virginia to face the Virginia Cavaliers. In a hard-fought game, the Seminoles lost, 2621, earning their first loss of the season. After winning their next two games, Florida State lost to NC State, Clemson, and 19th-ranked Florida, {{the first time they}} had three consecutive losses since 1983. Florida State ended the regular season with a conference record of 53, but <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those losses had been against a Coastal Division opponent, Florida State finished with the best Atlantic Division record and was named that division's representative to the ACC Championship Game.|$|E

Anelka's first goal for Manchester City in September 2002 was later credited as an own goal to Everton's Tomasz Radzinski. Javier Hernández was denied a hat-trick against Aston Villa in November 2011 after the committee ruled his second goal was actually an own goal by Ron Vlaar.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the first}} game was outsourced to Bowne Global, and was handled by the writer Alexander O. Smith and the editor Steve Anderson.

The Japanese justice system of the original still remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} of state inheritance taxes on two estates also plagued Black. In the first case, Governor Stanley {{had made a}} compromise {{settlement of}} back taxes with L. V. Harkness before his death. The compromise was criticized, and although Black asked {{the attorney general to}} investigate, the case was not decided during Black's tenure as governor. In the second case, Stanley had appointed three special attorneys to collect inheritance taxes from the estate of Mrs. Robert Worth Bingham. Black wanted the attorneys to resign and save the state their large fees, but refused to remove them outright. This action was made more damning <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the attorneys was a member of Black's campaign staff.|$|E

5|$|The team {{employs the}} {{differential}} diagnosis method, listing possible etiologies on a whiteboard, then eliminating most of them, usually <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the team (most often House) provides logical reasons for ruling them out. Typically, the patient is misdiagnosed at least once and accordingly receives some treatments that are at best useless; this usually causes further complications, but—as {{the nature of the}} complications often provides valuable new evidence—eventually these help them diagnose the patient correctly. House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character. Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin IV, who {{had become}} seriously ill, made Guy of Lusignan bailli (or regent) in October 1183. Within a month, Baldwin {{dismissed}} Guy, and had Guy's five-year-old stepson, Baldwin V, crowned king. Raynald was not present at the child's coronation, because he attended the wedding of his stepson, Humphrey, and BaldwinIV's sister, Isabella, in Kerak. Saladin unexpectedly invaded Oultrejordain, forcing the local inhabitants to seek refuge in Kerak. After Saladin broke into the town, Raynald only managed to escape to the fortress <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his retainers had hindered the attackers from seizing the bridge between {{the town and the}} castle. Saladin laid siege to Kerak. According to Ernoul, Raynald's wife sent dishes from the wedding to Saladin, persuading him to stop bombarding the tower where her son and his wife stayed. After envoys from Kerak informed BaldwinIV of the siege, the royal army left Jerusalem for Kerak under the command of the king and RaymondIII of Tripoli. Saladin abandoned the siege before their arrival on 4December. On Saladin's order, Izz al-Din Usama had a fortress built at Ajloun, near the northern border of Raynald's domains.|$|E
5|$|By lap 105, Kyle Busch held a 3.1-second {{lead over}} Kenseth. Three laps later, the third caution was {{triggered}} when Stewart's car made heavy {{contact with the}} turn-two wall after his right-front tire burst. Stewart grazed his foot and climbed out of his car; emergency workers helped take him to a waiting car that {{took him to the}} infield medical center for further examination. All of the race leaders, including Edwards, chose to make pit stops for tires and car adjustments under caution. NASCAR required Edwards to fall back {{to the end of the}} longest line <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his crew members had allowed one of his tires to roll away from his pit box during his stop. Kyle Busch maintained the lead at the restart on lap 114; he was followed by Kenseth and Gordon. Kenseth passed Kyle Busch to take the lead on lap 117. On the same lap, Gordon passed Busch. By lap 135, Kenseth had opened up a 2.2-second lead over Gordon. Biffle moved in front of Burton for fourth place on the 139th lap. On lap 144, Robby Gordon's right-front tire blew, causing him to hit the turn-two wall, and the fourth caution was triggered. All of the race leaders made pit stops during the caution.|$|E

5|$|In December 1984, Silcott {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} a 22-year-old boxer, Anthony Smith, at a party in Hackney. Smith had been slashed more than once on his face, there were two wounds to his abdomen, a lung had been lacerated and his aorta cut. Silcott was charged with the murder in May 1985 and was out on bail when Blakelock was killed in October that year. At first he told police he had not known Smith and had not been at the party, {{although}} at trial he acknowledged having been there. He said Smith had started punching him, and that he had pushed Smith back but had not been carrying a knife. Silcott was convicted of Smith's murder in February 1986, while awaiting trial for the Blakelock murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment; he was released in 2003 after serving 17 years. After the conviction he told his lawyer he had indeed known Smith, that there had been bad blood between them, and that he had stabbed the man in self-defence, <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Smith's friends had had a knife.|$|E
5|$|In the 1918–19 season Holmes {{appeared}} in 20 regular season {{games for the}} Metropolitans, winning 11 and losing nine, with no shutouts and a 2.25goals-against average. In the PCHA playoffs, Holmes played two games, winning and losing one apiece, and surrendering five goals in total. The Metropolitans made the Stanley Cup finals once more. Playing against the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL), the series was abandoned tied at two wins apiece, because of the Spanish Influenza pandemic. Montreal could not continue the series <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their players, Joe Hall, was severely ill with influenza; however, the Metropolitans {{did not wish to}} accept the Cup by default. Hall eventually died on April 5, 1919, five days {{after the end of the}} series, in a Seattle hospital. The only draw of the series was a scoreless affair; after playing 20minutes of overtime, referee Mickey Ion called the game off.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} {{numerous}} {{areas in the}} world have shown that HHT occurs at roughly the same rate in almost all populations: somewhere around 1 in 5000. In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a founder effect, in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate of a particular genetic trait <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these ancestors harbored this trait. In Haut Jura, this {{has been shown to be}} the result of a particular ACVRL1 mutation (named c.1112dupG or c.1112_1113insG).

5|$|The {{localization}} of {{the game}} was outsourced to a company called Bowne Global, and was handled by writer Alexander O. Smith, who was {{not familiar with the}} Ace Attorney series prior to working on it, and editor Steve Anderson. While the Japanese version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localized version is set in the United States. They would normally have left the setting vague while adapting cultural differences that the target audience would not understand, but <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the episodes involves time zones, they had to specify where the game takes place, and chose the United States without thinking a lot about it. This became an issue in later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious. All the voice roles in the localized version of the game were handled by localization staff; Takumi had wanted to do the English voice for Phoenix, but it was handled by Ben Judd.|$|E
5|$|EarthBound, {{known in}} Japan as , is a {{role-playing}} video game published by Nintendo for the Super NES video game console in 1994. Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka reprised their roles from Mother as composers for the game, and {{were joined by}} assistant composers Hiroshi Kanazu and Toshiyuki Ueno. In an interview with Weekly Famitsu, Keiichi Suzuki commented on how the SNES gave the composers much more freedom to compose what they wanted than the NES, which made development of the music for EarthBound much easier than for its predecessor. This freedom was partially {{a result of the}} larger memory space available, <b>because</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the many problems the composers had in the first game was trying to get all of their music on to the cartridge. Another advantage was that the SNES could support playing eight notes at the same time, which when combined with the increased sound quality meant that he could compose music for the game in a similar fashion to how he would compose music for real life. Suzuki cited John Lennon as an influential figure to all the composers while the soundtrack was being developed, as his songs about love matched up with the feeling of the game. Critics and players have noted similarities between parts of some songs in the game to popular songs, including several suspected homages to songs by Lennon and The Beatles. Legal issues surrounding these similarities were suspected to prevent the game from being released on the Virtual Console outside of Japan, but the rumors were ultimately proved untrue.|$|E
