5|$|As Miss Oregon, Anderson's {{activities}} included {{public appearances}} {{across the state}} of Oregon. Notable appearances included participating in local pageants, welcoming Air National Guard members home to Oregon, and serving as a judge for the Just For Men World <b>Beard</b> <b>and</b> Moustache Championships. Anderson's reign as Miss Oregon continued until June 27, 2015, when she crowned her successor, Ali Wallace, Miss Oregon 2015.|$|E
5|$|Satan preaches from {{a raised}} earth mound and {{is dressed in}} {{clerical}} clothing {{that may be a}} soutane. He has a goat-like <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> horns, and stands in silhouette, accentuating his heavy body and gaping mouth, which is depicted as if he is screaming. His form may be derived from a 1652 illustration of the Canaanite idol Molech, as illustrated by Athanasius Kircher.|$|E
5|$|The shred {{music of}} the 1980s was a major {{influence}} on the progressive rock groups of the 1990s. Some of the newer bands, such as the Flower Kings, Spock's <b>Beard</b> <b>and</b> Glass Hammer, played a 1970s-style symphonic prog but with an updated sound. A number of them began to explore the limits of the CD in the way that earlier groups had stretched the limits of the vinyl LP.|$|E

25|$|Peter {{implemented}} social modernization in {{an absolute}} manner by introducing French and western dress to his court and requiring courtiers, state officials, {{and the military}} to shave their <b>beards</b> <b>and</b> adopt modern clothing styles. One means of achieving this end was the introduction of taxes for long <b>beards</b> <b>and</b> robes in September 1698.|$|R
5|$|After his defeat, Macrinus {{sent his}} son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while he himself {{returned}} to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle. News spread of Macrinus' defeat, however, and many civilians who had supported him were slain {{in the city}} and on the roads. Macrinus then shaved off his <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> hair to disguise himself {{as a member of the}} military police. Fleeing the city at night on horseback, he reached Cilicia along with a few companions, masqueraded as a military courier, and secured a carriage to drive to Eribolon, near Nicomedia. From there he set sail for Chalcedon.|$|E
5|$|Five years later, Woodruff disguises {{himself with}} a <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> monocle and assumes a new {{identity}} {{in an attempt to}} court Allen. She is able to recognize him as Woodruff because of his fear of fire tongs. Because she is friends with the governor, she is able to arrange her husband's release from prison. Victor locates Woodruff in a casino and kills him. At trial, he declares that the prohibition against double jeopardy prevents his prosecution for the murder; he is set free to live happily with his wife.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Yojimbo, Kurosawa found himself under {{pressure}} from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before Yojimbo, reworking it to include the hero of his previous film. Sanjuro {{was the first of}} three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer Shūgorō Yamamoto (the others would be Red <b>Beard</b> <b>and</b> Dodeskaden). It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than Yojimbo, though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing Yojimbos box office success and garnering positive reviews.|$|E

5|$|Many {{years after}} the events of God of War III, Kratos has {{ended up in the}} world of Norse mythology. He now has a son named Atreus and Kratos teaches the boy hunting and {{survival}} skills. A mentor and protector to his son, who seeks his father's respect, Kratos must master the rage that has driven him for many years. He hopes to teach Atreus and make amends for his past. Since Kratos lost his infamous double-chained blades in his climactic battle with Zeus, he now uses a magical battle axe. His attire and personality have also changed as he now sports a full <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> presents a calmer demeanor than the previous games.|$|E
5|$|Solar deities play a {{major role}} in many world {{religions}} and mythologies. The ancient Sumerians believed that the sun was Utu, the god of justice and twin brother of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, who was identified as the planet Venus. Later, Utu was identified with the East Semitic god Shamash. Utu was regarded as a helper-deity, who aided those in distress, and, in iconography, he is usually portrayed with a long <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> clutching a saw, which represented his role as the dispenser of justice.|$|E

5|$|The {{fan base}} went wild, and a riotous celebration {{gathered}} at Ebisu Bridge in Dōtonbori, Osaka. There, {{an assemblage of}} supporters yelled the players' names, and with every name, a fan resembling {{a member of the}} victorious team leaped from the bridge into the waiting canal. However, lacking a Caucasian person to imitate MVP Randy Bass, the rabid crowd seized a plastic statue of Colonel Sanders (like Bass, the Colonel had a <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> was not Japanese) from a nearby KFC and tossed it off the bridge as an effigy.|$|E

Accompanied by the android, Adaam-12, he first accepts a job from the Big Cargo corporation carrying simple cargo containers. Shortly afterwards, the Nuclear Star corporation approaches him to carry nuclear waste. After several runs, Buck Mann attracts the attention of the pirates Brown <b>Beard</b> <b>and</b> Captain Black, who continuously harass him as his missions become more and more lucrative.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{story about}} an aloviti man, who is {{described}} as unusually tall, thin, bony-faced, and with a long <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> moustache. When the weather was nice, he worked and behaved like the other people in his village, {{but as soon as the}} dark clouds covered the sky, he used to close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone and in a trance as long as the bad weather and thunder lasted. Historical persons believed to be aloviti men are Stefan Nemanja, and Stefan Dečanski.|$|E

Giant Schnauzers come in two color patterns: Solid black, and a color known as pepper and salt, with banded hairs of {{alternating}} white and black, appearing gray hairs at a distance. Where legal, they are shown with cropped ears and docked tails. Like other schnauzers, they have a distinct <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> eyebrows. Today, the Giant Schnauzer participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. It is also used as a police dog.|$|E
5|$|At {{the sight}} of hail clouds, the alovit man would fall into a trance-like sleep, before his soul issued from his body and flew up to the clouds. In the manner of an ala, his soul led the clouds over the fields of a {{neighbouring}} village. A man, who {{was thought to be}} alovit, was described as unusually tall, thin, and bony-faced, with a long <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> moustache. When the weather was good, he worked and behaved like the others in his village, but as soon as dark clouds covered the sky, he would close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone {{for as long as the}} bad weather lasted. People also talked that he suffered from epilepsy. In the region of Boljevac, the epileptics were said to be alovit—their souls went out of their bodies during epileptic fits and led hail clouds.|$|E
5|$|In late 1962, {{after the}} Cuban Missile Crisis had settled {{well enough to}} permit the {{evacuated}} servicemen's families to return to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara was eager to do more for morale there. He asked Perry Como to bring his television show to the Naval base. Perry and his cast and crew were at Guantanamo when the loved ones began their return. The first entertainers to visit the base since the crisis, the Como show filmed there for eight days. Some highlights of the program, which {{was seen in the}} US on December 12, 1962, included Como's shaving a serviceman with a Castro-like <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> the enthusiastic participation when Perry asked for volunteers to come on stage to do the Twist with the lovely ladies who were part of the visiting dance troupe.|$|E

5|$|The {{forms in}} which the gods are shown, {{although}} diverse, are limited in many ways. Many creatures that are widespread in Egypt were never used in divine iconography. Others could represent many deities, often because these deities had major characteristics in common. Bulls and rams were associated with virility, cows and falcons with the sky, hippopotami with maternal protection, felines with the sun god, and serpents with both danger and renewal. Animals that were absent from Egypt {{in the early stages}} of its history were not used as divine images. For instance, the horse, which was only introduced in the Second Intermediate Period (c. 1650–1550 BC), never represented a god. Similarly, the clothes worn by anthropomorphic deities in most periods changed little from the styles used in the Old Kingdom: a kilt, false <b>beard,</b> <b>and</b> often a shirt for male gods and a long, tight-fitting dress for goddesses.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, {{by having a}} larger and heavier black beak, shaggy {{feathers}} around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, <b>beard</b> <b>and</b> body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (C. corone) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.|$|E
5|$|In the 1949–50 season, the Wildcats lost {{several of}} the leading players from their championship-winning teams to graduation, {{including}} <b>Beard</b> <b>and</b> Groza. In response, Rupp made Spivey {{the focal point of}} the team, and the team exceeded expectations. In a February 18, 1950 game against Georgia Tech, which the Wildcats won 97–62, Spivey broke the team record for points in a game with 40, two more than Groza scored in a game the previous season. That record has since been broken, but his 42field goal attempts remain a school record as of 2010. Spivey tied another of Groza's point-scoring records on March 5 with a 37-point performance in a Southeastern Conference (SEC) Men's Basketball Tournament game. Kentucky won over Tennessee 95–58 to win the SEC Tournament for the seventh consecutive season. Kentucky ended the regular season with a 25–4 record, and Spivey averaged 19.4points a game. Despite the Wildcats' record and SEC title, the NCAA Tournament selection committee did not give the team a berth in the 1950 tournament. Kentucky did gain a berth to the National Invitation Tournament, but was eliminated in the quarterfinals by City College of New York (CCNY), 89–50. In that game, Spivey was forced to the bench for the final nineminutes of the first half after accumulating fourpersonal fouls. At the end of the season, Spivey was named to the All-SEC team, and the Associated Press selected him for its 1950 All-American third team.|$|E
