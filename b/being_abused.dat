5|$|Megan's lawyer ex-husband Todd (Jeffrey Nordling) {{arrives at}} Megan's work, needing {{forensic}} testing for evidence {{that his client}} Manny Santos (Carlos Apostle), is a juvenile. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) greets him, and she asks Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) to help examine him. Curtis finds evidence which suggests Manny has received recent trauma to ribs and other body parts, suggesting that he’s <b>being</b> <b>abused.</b> Curtis explains to Todd that Manny is a juvenile, but {{he will not be}} able to be released back to his former home, as he is <b>being</b> <b>abused</b> there. Meanwhile, the evidence for the murderer fits a partial match to Mike, so Megan concludes that Ed is not Mike's father. She goes to visit Jen; however she slams the door in her face. Megan walks into her house and finds Mike's real father Tim (Timothy Devlin), holding Ed's and Jen's baby daughter hostage. Tim takes Jen into the garden when the police arrive, so Bud shoots him in the leg and arrests him and Jen is reunited with Sophie and Mike.|$|E
5|$|From then on, Kouao kept Climbié {{away from}} hospitals, turning instead to churches. Kouao {{said to the}} pastors {{that she was the}} mother and that demons were inside Climbié. The pastor at the Mission Ensemble Pour Christ, Pascal Orome, offered prayers for Climbié to cast out the devil, and thought that her {{injuries}} were due to demonic possession. On another occasion, Kouao took Climbié to a church run by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, where the pastor, Alvaro Lima, suspected she was <b>being</b> <b>abused,</b> although he took no action. He said in the inquiry that Climbié told him that Satan had told her to burn herself. The pastor did not believe her, but he still believed that a person could be possessed.|$|E

5|$|Morales {{was first}} sent to Cámus's unit, the 3rd Regiment of the Line, {{which was at}} the front of Chile's campaigns during much of the war. Although she officially was not a soldier and was not {{supposed}} to participate in combat, this did not deter her from fighting alongside the men of her regiment. Indeed, she was noted for her great skill with a rifle. She fought at the amphibious landing and fierce ensuing assault on a Peruvian position of the Battle of Pisagua on 2 November 1879 and at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November. She was looked up to by the men of her unit for her selfless nursing of the wounded after battles. She also put herself at risk several times to save captured Peruvian soldiers from <b>being</b> <b>abused</b> by her compatriots.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{then settled}} an {{incident}} involving {{the abuse of}} the protection afforded by icons of the princeps, in which the emperor's images were being used to shield the guilty. Gaius Cestius Gallus brought a complaint into the Senate, and claimed he was <b>being</b> <b>abused</b> under this safeguard by Annia Rufilla. Drusus was soon brought in to weigh on the matter, for the Senate felt only {{a member of the}} imperial family could speak on such a delicate matter. At the request of many senators, Drusus had Rufilla arrested and imprisoned. Later, he was given credit for the condemnation of two Roman equites, Considius Aequus and Coelius Cursor, who had attacked the praetor, Magius Caecilianus, with false charges of maiestas. It is unlikely that he himself was responsible, for every verdict was given by the Senate with Tiberius' authority, but this did not prevent his popularity.|$|E

Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has already set it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow through him.|$|E

5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman <b>being</b> <b>abused</b> by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.|$|E
5|$|He {{was sent}} to Belgian Second Division side Royal Antwerp on a loan spell. He {{got off to a}} bad start at the club and asked to return to Old Trafford after <b>being</b> <b>abused</b> by Antwerp {{supporters}} outside the Bosuilstadion, and had to be talked into staying by manager Regi Van Acker. Following this start the club then won 15 matches in a row and Higginbotham become popular with the fans. However, the season ended with defeat in a play-off game, and after the final whistle there was an alleged attack on referee Amand Ancion by teammate Ronnie Wallwork. Higginbotham was subsequently banned from football for a year for his involvement. In September 1999, a Belgian court reduced Higginbotham's ban to four months. Ancion maintained that Wallwork had grabbed him by the throat and that Higginbotham had headbutted him. Higginbotham always maintained his innocence, stating that he had tried to intervene peacefully after Wallwork had confronted Ancion in an aggressive manner. Alex Ferguson believed the player's innocence and handed both players four-year contracts as the club appealed their suspensions.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2002 Aspect {{published}} Alan Grant's Smallville: Dragon, {{about an}} ex-convict who assumes the abilities and {{appearance of a}} dragon after he is exposed to kryptonite in a cave; the mutation drives {{him to try to}} kill everyone who testified against him. In the novel, Clark is hypnotized into believing that he is a normal teenager with no special abilities. A month after the publication of Grant's novel Bennett and Gottesfeld wrote Little, Brown Young Readers' Flight, about a young girl (Tia) who Clark discovers has wings. He and his friends believe that Tia is <b>being</b> <b>abused</b> by her father, and teach her to overcome her fear of flying so she can find her mother. Flight (like See No Evil) was a planned episode, but the crew was uncertain that they could get the flying effects right and the idea was scrapped. Nancy Holder wrote the third novel in the Aspect series. Published on January 1, 2003, Hauntings follows Clark and his friends as they investigate a ghostly presence in a Smallville house. Little, Brown Young Readers then published Animal Rage by David and Bobby Weiss, about animal-rights activist Heather Fox (who can change into any animal she touches). Heather uses this ability to harm people who hurt animals until Clark discovers it and stops her. Aspect published Dean Wesley Smith's Whodunit, in which Clark, Chloe, Lana and Pete investigate the murder of a boy and his sister while Lex tries to decide whether to ransom his kidnapped father or try rescuing Lionel himself.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} high-quality performance, some musicians take chemical substances. Some musicians take drugs or alcohol {{to deal with the}} stress of performing. As a group they have a higher rate of substance abuse. The most common chemical substance which is abused by pop musicians is cocaine, because of its neurological effects. Stimulants like cocaine increase alertness and cause feelings of euphoria, and can therefore make the performer feel as though they in some ways ‘own the stage’. One way in which substance abuse is harmful for a performer (musicians especially) is if the substance <b>being</b> <b>abused</b> is aspirated. The lungs are an important organ used by singers, and addiction to cigarettes may seriously harm the quality of their performance. Smoking causes harm to alveoli, which are responsible for absorbing oxygen.|$|E
