5|$|Around this time, Thomas {{developed}} {{an interest in}} archaeology, entomology, and ornithology, as well as drawing. In 1913 his family made plans for him to join the Royal Navy, although he failed the entrance exam due to alleged poor eyesight. At {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, Lethbridge was sent to Wellington College in Berkshire, while his mother and siblings moved to Buckhurst in Wokingham, Berkshire. In February 1919 Violet and her children moved to Manor House in Finchampstead, where Jacintha and Bill became seriously ill {{as a result of a}} flu pandemic; the former survived <b>but</b> <b>Bill</b> died in March.|$|E
5|$|Bill (W. Earl Brown) is a {{survivor}} who lives just outside Boston, {{and is a}} business partner of Joel and Tess. A paranoid, aggressive and distrustful {{man in his late}} forties, Bill lives alone in a heavily fortified town, laden with booby traps that include some captured Infected. During the game, Joel finds Bill in the hope that he will pay off a debt by fixing up a car for them to drive to Tommy's, <b>but</b> <b>Bill</b> insists that the only working car battery is in the unexplored part of town. After fighting their way to the local high school, Bill discovers the battery he was going to use is missing. They escape the swarms of infected surrounding the school, and find themselves in an abandoned house, where Bill discovers his partner, Frank, has committed suicide by hanging there, and it is revealed that the two had had a falling out and Frank had been planning to escape in Bill's car. After getting the car started, Joel drops Bill off, and expresses sympathy for what happened between him and Frank. Bill merely responds by ensuring that their debt is settled and then ordering Joel to leave the town.|$|E

5|$|Craig had {{a strong}} Sheffield Shield season in 1960–61. At the time, {{he had become a}} {{production}} manager at his pharmaceutical firm and declared that the season would be his last owing to work commitments. His employers had been pressuring him to commit to a career after cricket. Early in the campaign, Craig scored consecutive centuries against Queensland and Victoria. He then scored 83 as New South Wales defeated the touring West Indians by an innings and 97 runs, but he was overlooked for Test selection. He ended his season with 197 in an innings victory over Western Australia. Overall, he totalled 710 runs at 59.16, as New South Wales won their eighth successive Shield. After a successful campaign, he reversed his decision and made himself available for the 1961 tour of England, <b>but</b> <b>Bill</b> Lawry was selected ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had more}} {{success in the}} tour matches, taking 85 wickets at 18.37 in all {{first-class}} fixtures. This ranked him third among the Australians in the wicket-taking and fifth in the averages. He bowled more overs than everyone <b>but</b> <b>Bill</b> Johnston, allowing Bradman to ease the workload on pace spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller, and conserve their energy for the Tests. Johnson's most successful match with the ball was against Gloucestershire, in which he took match figures of 11/100. He was also more prolific with the bat outside the Tests, scoring 543 runs at 30.16, with a top-score of 113 not out against Somerset. He also made 80 against a Marylebone Cricket Club team that consisted almost entirely of Test players. Johnson was prominent in the field, taking 23 catches, the most by a non-wicket-keeper on tour.|$|E
5|$|Braham flew in {{the first}} wave. As Braham's wave reached Leeuwarden in the Netherlands and while {{four of the five}} RAF fighters made no contact, Braham {{attracted}} two enemy night fighters. The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (Night Fighter Wing 1). Five had taken off under the command of Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories. Schnaufer led his flight out toward the echo but turned back himself after engine trouble. Using his Serrate radar detector, Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters' Lichtenstein radar. He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft, an Experten with 15 air victories from 4./NJG 1. Kraft was killed. Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also. Its pilot, Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive. Braham considered shooting at one crew member, likely Vinke, who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft, <b>but</b> <b>Bill</b> Gregory persuaded him not to. Braham's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim. Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter. One reason for firing at close-range was Braham's high state of fatigue. In such a state Braham could barely keep his eyes open. Whenever he peered ahead they smarted and misted.|$|E

25|$|Bill Edrich {{did some}} {{service as a}} fastish bowler with a {{slinging}} action while Norman Yardley's all-round skill won him a place in all the Tests. With his deceptively plain-looking medium-pace he actually took Bradman's wicket in three successive Test innings, and without any help from a fielder at that. But our out-cricket was simply not good enough. Wright was the best bowler (23 at 44 runs apiece), Bedser was still an enthusiastic and tireless learner (15 at 54), <b>but</b> <b>Bill</b> Voce aged 37, {{in one of the}} hottest Australian summers, could not recapture the old magical fire.|$|E

25|$|Bobby Simpson and Grahame Thomas {{were soon}} out to leave Australia 36/2, <b>but</b> <b>Bill</b> Lawry and Bob Cowper saw {{out the day}} and batted {{through most of the}} next. Their {{carefully}} complied third wicket stand of 212 avoided the follow-on and England's best chance of regaining the Ashes, but failed to entertain the crowd. Lawry made a typical 108 in 369 minutes, but Cowper was 159 not {{out at the end of}} the third day and Australia 333/3. The fourth day was washed out, rendering the final day of the series academic as a result could not be forced on the flat wicket. Cowper, however, took his score to 307, the first Test triple century to be made in Australia and at 727 minutes the longest. It was his highest Test and First Class score and remains the highest and longest Ashes century down under though Matthew Hayden's 380 against Zimbabwe in 2002–03 is now the highest Test century. In the end he was bowled by Barry Knight (2/105) on 543/8 and Simpson declared to leave England just over an hour to bat.|$|E
25|$|The fourth Test, {{in front}} of Hutton's home crowd, was Hutton's least {{successful}} of the series. Having been put into bat by Hassett, the first time an Australian captain had fielded first against England since 1909, Hutton was bowled second ball by a Yorker from Lindwall. England never recovered, batting very slowly to score 167 and after the first innings, Australia led by 99 with three days left. Hutton scored only 25 in the second innings but England batted for a long time, assisted by rain, leaving Australia 177 in 115 minutes to win the game. The tourists were winning easily when Hutton asked Bailey to use the negative tactic of leg theory, bowling wide of leg stump to {{make it hard to}} score runs, while using a long run-up to waste time. Only twelve overs were bowled in the last 45 minutes, then considered slow, Australia lost a wicket and the tactics resulted in Australia being 30 short of their target when the game ended. Wisden noted that only a defensive policy had prevented England losing. Hutton was criticised for negativity by the Australian press, <b>but</b> <b>Bill</b> Bowes wrote that the gravity of the situation justified Hutton's tactics.|$|E
25|$|A {{major part}} of the MCC tour was to fly the flag, promote cricket {{throughout}} Australia and earn revenue for the English counties. All these were fulfilled by playing upcountry games against local grade cricket teams and as these sides were roughly the equivalent to Lancashire League they provided the tourists with valuable practice before taking on the state sides and Australia. Northam was a small mining town 60 miles inland from Perth, but the mine was played out and the local economy was geared to sheep-raising. After regaining their land legs from their voyage the team travelled up. It had been 10 years since the MCC had toured Australia in 1936-37, the town was decorated as if for a fête and the players were entertained by the locals. The Northam captain won the toss and batted, but his team was soon out as big left-arm fast bowler Bill Voce of Bodyline fame took 3/11 and Peter Smith 5/55 with his leg-spin. The opener Tetlaw top-scored with 34 and added 44 for the fifth wicket with Lawrence (32). Slater made 26 batting at number 7, but no one else reached double figures and they were out for 123. Len Hutton (51) and Cyril Washbrook (47) added 93 for the first wicket, then Denis Compton hit 84 with 11 fours and Wally Hammond 131 with 19 fours and 4 sixes before he 'retired out' and declared the innings at 409/6 after tea the next day. This proved sufficient to bowl out the Northam team for 71, Tetlaw (29) again top-scored, <b>but</b> <b>Bill</b> Edrich added figures of 6/20 to his three first innings catches and 38 not out. Smith took 4/18 and the MCC won by an innings and 215 runs inside two days.|$|E
