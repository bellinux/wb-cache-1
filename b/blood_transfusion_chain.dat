40|$|Background. Haemovigilance is {{a system}} {{consisting}} of the detection, collecting and analysis of information regarding unwanted and unexpected effects of blood transfusion that {{make it possible to}} take action in order to improve blood trasfusion safety. In a broader sense, it is defined as a set of surveillance procedures covering the whole transfusion chain from the collection of blood to the follow-up of recipients. In some European countries a haemovigilance system based on legislation was introduced during the last ten years, European Haemovigilance Network was organised and some results from the existing surveillance systems were reported. The paper presents haemovigilance activities in Slovenia. Conclusions. In Slovenia, many elements of haemovigilance are already included in the <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain,</b> but no unique system of data collection exists. We expect a new legislation on blood transfusion to help us with introducing a data collection system, analysis and activities in order to further improve blood transfusion safety. </p...|$|E
40|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, attention was focused on the restructuring and reorganization of nationally supported safe and sustainable blood supply systems. Networking and human capacity building in transfusion medicine were developed through World Health Organization initiatives. Educational materials were created for the core elements of the <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain.</b> However, the management aspects of transfusion medicine as well as applied health science research in transfusion medicine were not addressed. In 2000, the World Health Organization initiated the creation of the Academic Institute for International Development of Transfusion Medicine (IDTM). This would focus on the development of a postgraduate master's course in management of transfusion medicine (MMTM) and the development of research programs for transfusion medicine-related health sciences. The Academic Institute IDTM was created at the University of Groningen Faculty of Medical Sciences, The Netherlands. The MMTM course was thus established, and since September 2007 fourteen fellows from economically restricted countries have entered the course. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{haemovigilance}} system {{makes it possible}} to identify critical points in <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> from blood collection to the patient and to introduce new measures, thus creating conditions for better transfusion safety. Methods: Data on haemovigilance in Slovenia in years 2003 – 2010 were obtained from annual reports. The collected data were systematically and chronologically arranged, displayed in tables and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results: From 2003 to 2010, there were 1, 333 adverse reactions reported: 511 allergic, 25 anaphylactoid, 604 febrile nonhaemolytic, 22 haemolytic reactions, 4 TRALI, 69 TACO, 11 suspected transfusion-transmitted infections and 74 cases classified as others. From 2003 – 2010, 104 (7. 8 %) reactions were considered severe. There are considerable differences among Slovenian hospitals as to the number of reports, ranging from 0. 4 to 3. 1 per 1, 000 blood components issued in 2010. Severe adverse events were reported, such as wrong blood in test tubes and incorrect blood component transfused. There were also some severe adverse reactions reported during the collection of blood from donors, defective plastic blood bags, positive test results and adverse events during the storage and distribution of blood. Conclusions: The collected data are the foundation for the improvement of blood safety by implementing new technologies as well as continuous training of clinical and transfusion staff and optimal blood usage...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of UHF {{electromagnetic}} fields produced by a RFID reader on a blood bag are evaluated numerically in several configurations. The results of the simulation, field level and distribution, specific absorption rate (SAR), and heating time show that an exposure to a typical reader field leads to a temperature increase smaller than 0. 1 C and to a SAR smaller than 1 W/kg. As a consequence, no adverse biological effects occur during a typical UHF RFID reading cycle on a blood bag. Therefore, the blood contained in a bag traced using UHF-RFID is as safe as those traced using barcodes. The proposed analysis supports the use of UHF RFID in the <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> supply <b>chain...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: The 2011 Dutch <b>Blood</b> <b>Transfusion</b> Guideline for {{hospitals}} incorporates seven internal quality indicators {{for evaluation of}} the hospital <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain.</b> The indicators aim to measure guideline compliance {{as shown by the}} instatement of a hospital transfusion committee and transfusion safety officer (structural indicators), observance of transfusion triggers and mandatory traceability of labile blood components (process indicators). Study Design and Methods: Two voluntary online surveys were sent to all Dutch hospitals for operational years 2011 and 2012 to assess compliance with the guideline recommendations. Results: Most hospitals had a hospital transfusion committee and had appointed a transfusion safety officer (TSO). In 2012, only 23 % of hospitals complied with the recommended minimum of four annual transfusion committee meetings and 8 h/week for the TSO. Compliance with the recommended pretransfusion haemoglobin threshold for RBC transfusion was achieved by 90 % of hospitals in over 80 % of transfusions; 58 % of hospitals measured the pretransfusion platelet count in over 80 % of platelet transfusions and 87 % of hospitals complied with the legally mandatory traceability of blood components in over 95 % of transfusions. Conclusion: With the current <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> indicators, it is feasible to monitor aspects {{of the quality of the}} hospital <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> practice and to assess guideline compliance. The results from this study suggest that there are opportunities for significant improvement in <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> practice in the Netherlands.

40|$|Background. The risk {{of severe}} adverse events to <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> is very low. More {{frequent}} are adverse events to transfusion, {{which are not}} severe, but must also be treated. Introduction of the haemovigilance system {{is a way of}} detecting and analysing them in order to correct their cause and to prevent their recurrence. Methods. In 2002 we collected data on transfusion adverse events registered by the <b>Blood</b> <b>Transfusion</b> Centre of Slovenia and <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> departments in Slovene general hospitals. Results. 86 adverse events to transfusion were reported in 2002.  The most frequent were non-haemolytic fever (42 cases) and allergic reactions (27 cases). 5 cases of haemolysis and 1 of pulmonary oedema were also reported. 11 cases were not categorised. Conclusions. We suppose that the collected data is not complete. However, it does give us insight into the clinical part of the <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain.</b> The most frequently registered adverse events in Slovenia are the same as in other countries. The presented data {{is the beginning of a}} systematic registration, using standard forms and reporting.

40|$|Context: Certain quality {{indicators}} are mandatory {{in the maintenance}} and improvement of quality in blood transfusion. Monitoring of such indicators should be done regularly and deficiencies are to be corrected for effective blood transfusion services. Aims: To study the usefulness of monitoring of the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) core indicators in blood transfusion and in the maintenance of hemovigilance. Settings and Design: Hemovigilance is a "quality process" to improve quality and increase the safety of blood transfusion. It covers and surveys all activities of the <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> from donors to recipients. Core indicators′ monitoring {{is a part of}} the hemovigilance process. Materials and Methods: A 2 -year retrospective study was conducted in a blood storage unit of a NABH accredited tertiary care hospital of a metropolitan city. Four NABH core indicators in blood transfusion were observed and monitored by the clinical and blood storage unit staff of different levels. Results: It was observed that there was an improvement in quality by core indicators monitoring with decreased wastage of blood and blood components, decreased average turnaround time for issue of blood and blood components, and lesser number of transfusion reactions. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that monitoring of NABH core indicators results in the enhancement of quality and safety in blood transfusion services, reducing the incidence of transfusion reactions...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{transfusion}} {{is beneficial}} and life saving measure in many cases, but some times carries some risks for recipients, so measures {{should be taken}} to prevent or minimize these blood transfusion associated risks(Haemovigilance), along the <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> in blood bank and hospital by collecting information and analysis of collected data for assessment and evaluation. This study is directed to determine the prevalence of P. falciparum infection and anti MSP 1 - 19 among clinically healthy blood donors as an example for haemovigilance system, and to initiate a haemovigilance system to improve blood transfusion safety and efficacy, {{for the first time in}} Sudan in police hospital blood bank. Beside examination that concern safety of blood transfusion which include HIV and HBV, screening for P. falciparum malaria has been included in this study.

40|$|Objective: RFID offers great {{opportunities}} to health care. Nevertheless, prior experiences {{also show that}} RFID systems have not been designed and tested {{in response to the}} particular needs of health care settings and might introduce new risks. The aim {{of this study is to}} present a framework that can be used to assess the performance of RFID systems particularly in health care settings. Methods: We developed a framework describing a systematic approach that can be used for assessing the feasibility of using an RFID technology in a particular healthcare setting; more specific for testing the impact of environmental factors on the quality of RFID generated data and vice versa. This framework is based on our own experiences with an RFID pilot implementation in an academic hospital in The Netherlands and a literature review concerning RFID test methods and current insights of RFID implementations in healthcare. The implementation of an RFID system within the <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> inside a hospital setting was used as a show case to explain the different phases of the framework. Results: The framework consists of nine phases, including an implementation development plan, RFID and medical equipment interference tests, data accuracy- and data completeness tests to be run in laboratory, simulated field and real field settings. Conclusions: The potential risks that RFID technologies may bring to the healthcare setting should be thoroughly evaluated before they are introduced into a vital environment. The RFID performance assessment framework that we present can act as a reference model to start an RFID development, engineering, implementation and testing plan and more specific, to assess the potential risks of interference and to test the quality of the RFID generated data potentially influenced by physical objects in specific health care environments.

40|$|Introduction. The {{concept of}} blood safety {{includes}} the entire <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> {{starting with the}} collection of blood from the blood donor, and ending with <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> to the patient. The concept involves quality management system as the systematic monitoring of adverse reactions and incidents regarding the blood donor or patient. Monitoring of near-miss errors show the critical points in the working process and increase transfusion safety. Objective. The aim {{of the study was}} to present the analysis results of adverse and unexpected events in transfusion practice with a potential risk to the health of blood donors and patients. Methods. One-year retrospective study was based on the collection, analysis and interpretation of written reports on medical errors in the <b>Blood</b> <b>Transfusion</b> Institute of Vojvodina. Results. Errors were distributed according to the type, frequency and part of the working process where they occurred. Possible causes and corrective actions were described for each error. The study showed that there were not errors with potential health consequences for the blood donor/patient. Errors with potentially damaging consequences for patients were detected throughout the entire <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain.</b> Most of the errors were identified in the preanalytical phase. The human factor was responsible for the largest number of errors. Conclusion. Error reporting system has an important role in the error management and the reduction of transfusion-related risk of adverse events and incidents. The ongoing analysis reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the entire process and indicates the necessary changes. Errors in transfusion medicine can be avoided in a large percentage and prevention is costeffective, systematic and applicable...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> has health-related, {{economical}} {{and safety}} implications. In order to optimise the <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain,</b> comprehensive research data are needed. The Dutch Transfusion Data warehouse (DTD) project aims {{to establish a}} data warehouse where data from donors and transfusion recipients are linked. This paper describes {{the design of the}} data warehouse, challenges and illustrative applications. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative data on blood donors (eg, age, blood group, antibodies) and products (type of product, processing, storage time) are obtained from the national blood bank. These are linked to data on the transfusion recipients (eg, transfusions administered, patient diagnosis, surgical procedures, laboratory parameters), which are extracted from hospital electronic health records. APPLICATIONS: Expected scientific contributions are illustrated for 4 applications: determine risk factors, predict blood use, benchmark blood use and optimise process efficiency. For each application, examples of research questions are given and analyses planned. CONCLUSIONS: The DTD project aims to build a national, continuously updated transfusion data warehouse. These data have a wide range of applications, on the donor/production side, recipient studies on blood usage and benchmarking and donor-recipient studies, which ultimately can contribute to the efficiency and safety of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion...</b>|$|R

The records of all patients who underwent esophageal resection (n = 316) at UCLA Medical Center from 1970 to 1993 were reviewed. Statistical analysis included univariate (log-rank χ 2) and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards) analyses with other known risk factors. High-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> (> 8 units) but not low-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> (1 to 8 units) were associated with {{a significant decrease in}} long-term survival (median survival: no transfusion, 22 months; low-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion,</b> 14. 5 months, versus high-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions,</b> 6. 5 months; p < 0. 01). Multivariate analysis revealed that the shorter survival with high-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> was a result of an increased number of postoperative complications. High-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> were not associated with increases in tumor recurrence or infectious complications. The association between shorter survival and high-volume <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> in esophageal cancer may, therefore, be because of the circumstances necessitating transfusion rather than any immunosuppressive effects of the transfused blood.

Explanation of connections between perioperative <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> and postoperative septic complication worldwide is not well documented. Many studies have described a correlation between perioperative <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> and postoperative infections. On the contrary, other studies indicate that factors influencing the need for <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> during surgery have a greater bearing than <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> per se on the occurrence of postoperative complications.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} nursing care for {{patients}} during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration. The thesis {{is divided into}} two parts, theoretical and practical. In the theoretical part <b>blood,</b> <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> and nursing care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration are described. In the practical part quantitative research was used and the data collection technique was an anonymous questionnaire designed for nurses working in different departments. The research survey was conducted in Strakonice Hospital, plc, and Písek Hospital, plc, where a total of 130 questionnaires were distributed, 119 questionnaires were returned. The research sample contained 113 properly completed questionnaires, which was defined as 100 %. The objective of this thesis was to identify the knowledge and skills of nurses in the care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration. The other objective was to find out what new knowledge would the nurses apply in the care for patients during <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> administration. To meet these objectives, three following hypotheses were set.

40|$|Background. Even though <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> is a {{relatively}} safe form of therapy, because of the eventual administrative errors in the <b>transfusion</b> <b>chain</b> between the <b>blood</b> donor and the recipient of <b>blood,</b> <b>transfusion</b> errors still occur. Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} ensure an utmost extent of safety and reliability of all transfusion related procedures. The safety of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> can be improved by preventive actions, i. e. implementation of the total quality management concept, haemovigilance and virtual transfusion laboratory. In the resulting system, the information web, robotics, computer sciences and communication technologies ensure safe and reliable identification of the patients, blood donors, corresponding test samples and blood products. Apart form this; the modern technologies enable the automation of laboratory testing, the integrity of laboratory results and enable an optimal use of blood. Conclusions. For an improved transfusion safety in Slovenia, adoption of corresponding prevention as well as haemovigilance is necessary. Identification errors can be prevented by implementation of the wristbands systems with the code bars for the tagging of the patient and his biological samples, whereas the administrative errors in the <b>blood</b> bank and <b>transfusion</b> laboratory can be prevented by implementation of information systems and automation. We assume that the virtual transfusion laboratory will {{become an integral part of}} the new Slovenian transfusion web and will speed up, unify and simplify today’s methods of ordering and administering blood products. To the attending physician, it will enable the choice of optimal transfusion therapy schedule and at the same time, it will enable the supervision of individual orders, deviations and indications, all of which is needed in order to analyse and improve the quality and the costs of the treatment. These services represent the first obligatory step for the modernisation of the transfusion medicine and accordingly, of the Slovenian health system in sense of the total quality assurance. </p...|$|R

Although <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> is an important treatment in different clinical settings, there are still lack of much randomized clinical trials. Nowadays <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> can be called a safe treatment. This {{might be due to}} an increasing awareness of the effects and risks of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion.</b> In clinical transfusion practice a transfusion trigger is handled for the prescription of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion.</b> This transfusion trigger is based on hemoglobin (Hb) levels for red <b>blood</b> cell (RBC) <b>transfusion</b> and on platelet count for platelet transfusions. Possibilities to improve the safety of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion</b> are improvement of the blood components and reduction of the amount of <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions.</b> This thesis describes 1) an in vitro study of a new pathogen technique for platelet concentrates and 2) a new model for RBC transfusion therapy for acute anemia. This model uses subjective health related quality of life criteria, which are validated in this thesis...|$|R
2500|$|A {{blood product}} (or blood-based product) is any {{component}} of blood which is collected from a donor {{for use in}} a <b>blood</b> <b>transfusion.</b> <b>Blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> can be life-saving in some situations, such as massive blood loss due to trauma, or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery. <b>Blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> may also be used to treat a severe anaemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease. People with hemophilia usually need a replacement of clotting factor, which is a small part of whole blood. [...] People with sickle-cell disease may require frequent <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions.</b> [...] Early <b>blood</b> <b>transfusions</b> consisted of whole blood, but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood, such as fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate.|$|R
