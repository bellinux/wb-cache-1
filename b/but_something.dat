5|$|Women {{are neither}} victims of {{deceitful}} men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who {{can choose to}} 'bestow' their favours on a man who will 'enjoy' them. In the earliest examples of the redefinition that develops throughout Fielding's works, virtue is no longer simply virginity, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> malleable and powerful {{in the hands of}} a woman granted the agency and intelligence to determine her own sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Most {{of these}} events were {{organized}} by agencies of the Mexican and Central American governments, and their respective tourism industries expected to attract thousands of visitors. Mexico is visited by about 22 million foreigners in a typical year. However, in 2012, the national tourism agency expected to attract 52 million visitors just to the regions of Chiapas, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Tabasco and Campeche. A Maya activist group in Guatemala, Oxlaljuj Ajpop, objected to the commercialization of the date. A spokesman from the Conference of Maya Ministers commented that for them the Tikal ceremony is not a show for tourists <b>but</b> <b>something</b> spiritual and personal. The secretary of the Great Council of Ancestral Authorities commented that living Maya felt they {{were excluded from the}} activities in Tikal. This group held a parallel ceremony, and complained that the date has been used for commercial gain. In addition, before the main Tikal ceremony, about 200 Maya protested the celebration because they felt excluded. Most modern Maya were indifferent to the ceremonies, and the small number of people still practising ancient rites held solemn, more private ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|As Belle {{is walking}} down the road, she runs into The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return <b>but</b> <b>something</b> changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into an ordinary man, but becomes furious and shakes off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more important to him than she is. Belle admonishes him for not believing she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E

25|$|The use of {{the word}} {{alloantigen}} actually masks the fact that HLA are infrequently autoantigens in the donor, and therefore their function is not as antigens, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> else.

It appears that these two have been abandoned or forgotten when the populous fled the area. Sometimes he thinks he hears people and wonders if they are coming back.|$|E
25|$|England {{suffered}} further losses {{early on}} day 2, with Paul Collingwood shouldering arms to a straight delivery, and Stuart Broad failing as a batsman on his debut. Matt Prior batted {{very well for}} 79, and only fell when trying to accelerate the scoring with 9 wickets down. Before this, Ryan Sidebottom had provided him with good assistance with a partnership worth 74. England were all out for 351 – a somewhat below par total, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> to work with for the bowlers.|$|E

25|$|Originally the Kouros type {{represented}} the archaic-thought that nature expresses itself in ideal everlasting simple-forms {{which can be}} traced by the senses and depicted in a way of illusive-reality. Matter was not regarded lifeless <b>but</b> <b>something</b> full of life, in an almost animistic belief. These ideas seem to go parallel with the natural- philosophical conceptions of Thales from Miletus who searched a simple material-form behind the appearances of the things and also believed that matter was alive (υλοζωϊσμός). This material character is paralleled in sculpture by the absolute representation of blooming life through unnaturally simplified forms.|$|E
25|$|By 1824, an {{estimated}} 70 to 100 wagons, {{each of which}} was loaded with four or five tons of coal, made a daily trip on the turnpike, transporting to the docks near Manchester the million or more bushels (30,000 metric tons) of coal that were produced in Chesterfield County each year. The heavily loaded coal wagons tended to cut deep ruts in the turnpike, raising clouds of dust in summer and churning the road into mud in the rainy season. As there were few options for shunpiking, citizens whose faster buggies dawdled along behind the lumbering wagons urged the state legislature {{to do something about}} ita canal, a better road, <b>but</b> <b>something.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bill meets Heather again, who {{encourages}} her to {{look into}} the puddle once more, then apparently vanishes. The Doctor investigates, and notes that the reflection is not a reflection, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> mimicking them and that the puddle is not made of water. Bill returns to her flat, and is chased by a moving body of fluid, which takes Heather's form. She runs to the Doctor's office, where fluid-Heather materialises, forcing him and Bill into the TARDIS. The Doctor moves the TARDIS elsewhere in the university, where he and Nardole check on a vault they have been guarding. They conclude that fluid-Heather is only interested in Bill just as the creature appears, causing the trio to flee in the TARDIS.|$|E

25|$|This season {{revolves}} around Catherine and Vincent trying {{to pursue a}} relationship together, whilst being hunted down by a top-secret government organization named Muirfield who want Vincent dead. Muirfield are revealed to have conducted a high-profile secret experiment on soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. These experiments resulted in every soldier becoming physically stronger and faster, hoping this would win the war quicker. <b>But,</b> <b>something</b> went wrong, as the entire force went out of control with their new abilities. The government gave orders to kill them all, but Vincent escaped {{and has been in}} hiding ever since. Muirfield make several attempts to capture Vincent during this season, and even enlist the help of Cat and those close to her to capture him.|$|E
25|$|From {{one of his}} {{experiments}} emerged the Cyber Series – artificial humanoids possessing superhuman {{strength and}} agility. <b>But</b> <b>something</b> was amiss: The 5000 original Cybers, engineered {{to be the perfect}} servants, mimicked human emotions too closely, displaying free will of their own. When they disobey orders from Reichter, he orders all of the Cyber Series to be destroyed. After Cyber-29 died falling from a cliff, Reichter transfers his brain into the body of a panther and names him Data-7. Cyber-6 was the only true Cyber to survive the massacre, escaping {{with the help of a}} black slave who hid her away in a fishing village. When Reichter interrogates to kill the slave, Cybersix arrives at the city of Meridiana, where she battles Reichter and his minions, and disguises herself as fellow teacher Adrian Seidelman after the real one is killed in a car wreck.|$|E
25|$|Chase {{reports from}} orbit that an Ashiyyur warship is inbound at high speed. Then another appears, slowing to make orbit around Sim's world of exile. Alex warns Chase {{to abandon their}} rented ship for the Corsarius; she does so just before the first Ashiyyur warship destroys their rented ship. Alex joins her and learns that the Armstrong drive on the Corsarius won’t be fully charged for about a day. Their problem is to stay alive until the Armstrong drive is ready. They borrow a classic {{maneuver}} from one of Sim’s battles and leave orbit at high speed headed directly toward the incoming Ashiyyur warship, which cannot slow its speed quickly enough to meet them. It uses lasers to disable Corsarius magnetic drives; Chase realizes too late that she has forgotten to raise the ship’s shields. The Ashiyyur warship reverses its trajectory and reaches them about ten hours before they can jump. It demands their surrender. Through a strategem, Alex and Chase are able to fire Corsarius’ major weapons at it, damaging it badly and forcing it to flee. Ten hours later, the interstellar drive activates. It is not an Armstrong drive <b>but</b> <b>something</b> else, product of Rashim Machesney’s genius. In an eye blink, Corsarius is in orbit around Rimway, and safe.|$|E

500|$|During {{the show}} itself, Bowie {{incorporated}} {{a wide variety}} of props: [...] "I'm really attempting {{to do a lot of}} stuff!

[...] Bowie described how he assembled the show, saying, [...] "The idea was to concoct surrealist or minimalist stage pieces to accompany rock-and-roll songs. I wanted to bridge together some kind of symbolist theater and modern dance. Not jazz dance, certainly not MTV dance, <b>but</b> <b>something</b> more influenced by people like Pina Bausch and a Montreal group called [...] There are some symbolist pieces, some minimalist pieces, and some vulgar pieces, too – some straightforward vaudeville bits." ...|$|E
