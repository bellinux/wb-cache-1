50|$|With their vast {{experience}} of developing turbochargers, General Electric turned their expertise {{to improving the}} Type I. A modified version, the Type I-A, incorporating partitions in the <b>blower</b> <b>casing</b> to separate the air flow into each of the individual combustion chambers {{at the suggestion of}} Whittle, began testing in May 18, 1942, and developed a thrust of 1,250 lbf, at an overall pressure ratio of 3:1.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we have modeled a {{high-temperature}} Root's type compressor and compared predicted results with measurements. Compression process is modeled using multiple control volumes. Initially, there are two control volumes connected by an “expansion nozzle” naturally formed by the rotor tip and the <b>blower</b> <b>casing.</b> The “nozzle” has time-varying geometry and is modeled to allow transition from choked to non-choked flow. The well-filling process is modeled via expansion of the compressed gas from the high-pressure reservoir into the well through this “nozzle. ” When the pressures in the well and reservoir equalize, the “passive” part of the compression process is taken to be complete. At this point, the gas in the well {{is assumed to be}} fully-mixed and the two control volumes are subsequently considered as one. Then the “active” part of compression takes place. Numerical computations are shown to agree well with the experimental data...|$|E
