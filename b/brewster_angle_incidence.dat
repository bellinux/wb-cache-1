40|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the existence of longitudinal- and transverse-like optical modes of Si–N bond in vibrational absorption spectrum of hydrogenated amorphous silicon nitride thin films. One of the longitudinal-like optical resonances coincides with the transverse-like mode of Si–O bond, and the other closely neighbors the bending mode of N–H bond. We have also shown that the conventionally assigned asymmetric stretching mode of Si–N bond is merely a transverse-like mode of the bond. The microstructures of both longitudinal- and transverse-like modes can well be apprehended by a p-polarized beam at an oblique incidence light, especially at <b>Brewster</b> <b>angle</b> <b>incidence.</b> The spectrum distortion induced by interference fringes can be eliminated at this condition. © 1998 American Institute of Physics...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the behavior of}} full-vector electromagnetic Bessel beams obliquely incident at an interface between two electrically different media. We employ a Fourier transform domain representation of Bessel beams to determine their behavior upon reflection and transmission. This transform, which is geometric in nature, consists of elliptical support curves with complex weighting associated with them. The behavior of the scattered field at an interface is highly complex, owing to its full-vector nature; nevertheless, this behavior has a straightforward representation in the transform domain geometry. The analysis shows that the reflected field forms a different vector Bessel beam, but in general, the transmitted field cannot be represented as a Bessel beam. Nevertheless, using this approach, we demonstrate a method to propagate a Bessel beam in the refractive medium by launching a non- Bessel beam at the interface. Several interesting phenomena related to the behavior of Bessel beams are illustrated, such as polarized reflection at <b>Brewster's</b> <b>angle</b> <b>incidence,</b> and the Goos-Hänchen and Imbert-Federov shifts {{in the case of}} total reflection. © 2013 Optical Society of America...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{report a}} {{powerful}} and general concept {{for the design of}} three-dimensional metamaterials suitable for optically probed nanoscale sensing, combining the environmental sensitivity of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) and a low absorption of the probe light, even when the LSPRs are supported by lossy plasmonic elements. This concept is based on the tuning of the plasmon-induced <b>Brewster</b> conditions (<b>angle</b> of <b>incidence</b> and photon energy) of the material by suitable tailoring of its structure. This tuning is made possible by the interplay between LSPRs and optical interferences, i. e., the so-called plasmonic optical interferences.
