Thirteen important attributes were used to measure credit cardholders' attitude.

In this study, perceived credibility, amount of information on Internet banking, perceived enjoyment, and social norm are added to the model, in addition to perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use. More importantly, the estimated linear regression model suggests that perceived credibility and social norm are significant determinants of Internet <b>banking</b> <b>acceptance</b> among Muslims. In contrast, the estimated linear regression model suggests that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment and social norm are significant determinants of Internet <b>banking</b> <b>acceptance</b> among non-Muslims.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} revised {{technology}} acceptance model to measure consumers' <b>acceptance</b> of Internet <b>banking,</b> the Internet <b>banking</b> <b>acceptance</b> model (IBAM). Data was collected from 618 university {{students in the}} United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. The results suggest the importance of attitude, such that attitude and behavioral intentions emerge as a single factor, denoted as "attitudinal intentions" (AI). Structural equation modeling confirms the fit of the model, in which perceived usefulness and trust fully mediate the impact of subjective norms and perceived manageability on AI. The invariance analysis demonstrates the psychometric equivalence of the IBAM measurements between the two country groups. At the structural level, the influence of trust and system usefulness on AI varies between the two countries, emphasizing the potential role of cultures in IS adoption. The IBAM is robust and parsimonious, explaining over 80 % of AI. Internet <b>banking</b> Technology <b>acceptance</b> Cross-market examination Saudi Arabia United Kingdom...|$|R

As one {{percent increase in the}} retention of Internet <b>banking</b> <b>acceptance</b> will typically bring 18 percent reduction in operating cost (Bhattacherjee, 2001), indifference towards consumers’ adoption of Internet banking services may result in a big loss to the financial institutions. Therefore, this study is conducted to help banks mitigate the key cause of profit reduction in Internet banking industry which is an insufficient understanding of customer behaviour and preference by recommending effective strategies to help banks retain existing Internet banking customers. A questionnaire was developed based on the theoretical framework, tested in a pilot study, and finally distributed to a sample of 1, 200 Internet banking users from major cities in the United States and Malaysia. Malaysian females have significantly higher behavioural intention to use Internet banking services compared to their counterparts in the United States.

40|$|Technology <b>acceptance,</b> {{especially}} internet <b>banking</b> <b>acceptance</b> {{has become}} a vital issue {{in the business world}} today. A number of studies agree on the importance of customer adoption and full utilization of internet banking services as the key factors for banks to achieve the benefits from launching this channel (eg. Guriting & Ndubisi, 2006; Nor, 2005; Yousafzai, 2005; Mols et al., 1999). They also highlight the crucial role of the comprehensive understanding of the factors and their interactions with each other that influence customers in accepting and using internet banking services. A review of literature related to internet banking indicates that while there are numerous studies that have tried to identify the factors affecting non-adopters and/or users of internet banking there is no single study, specifically in Saudi Arabia, that sheds light on the factors affecting dormant users of internet banking. Hence, the present study provides additional insights into this issue. The study adds to the body of knowledge in the technology acceptance field by developing a comprehensive model for internet <b>banking</b> <b>acceptance.</b> The model extended the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to include additional components, namely task-technology fit (TTF), perceived trust and perceived risk. The subjects for this study were Saudi bank customers who are dormant users of internet banking services. One thousand copies of the questionnaire were distributed in five Saudi cities: Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Abhah and Buraydah. A total of 430 completed questionnaires were received, giving a response rate of 43 % of the original sample. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was the statistical technique employed in this study. The main {{results of this study suggest}} that two factors, namely perceived usefulness and service visibility directly influence Saudi customers’ intention to use internet banking. Perceived ease of use is indirectly significant on the behavioral intentions through perceived usefulness. Moreover, perceived trust, system reliability and accessibility significantly influence perceived ease of use of internet banking. The results also reveal that customer trust in internet banking can be developed by focusing on only one theoretical construct of trust, perceived bank trustworthiness of the internet banking provider. Based on the findings, implications for internet banking practice and related future research have been identified. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
