5|$|In 1932, Fairbanks' two-story school, {{built in}} 1907, <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> the ground. A new, $150,000 three-story {{concrete}} art deco building was proposed as a replacement, and after heated debate, a $100,000 bond measure was approved in 1933. On January 22, 1934, {{the new school}} opened. It had space for about 500 students, but the town's growth required renovation and expansion in 1939 and 1948.|$|E
5|$|Princeton University {{built the}} chapel {{to replace the}} Marquand Chapel, which stood between where the present chapel and McCosh Hall stand until it <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> the ground in 1920.

5|$|Property {{damage was}} {{estimated}} at $150,000–200,000. All of the film in the facility was destroyed; more than 40,000 reels of negatives and film prints <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> ashes inside their film cans. Fifty-seven truckloads of burned film were hauled from the site to have their silver content extracted. Each can contained about five cents' worth of silver; the salvaged metal returned $2,000.|$|E

5|$|The Tripurarahasya, a south Indian Shakta text, retells the story, {{giving more}} {{importance}} to the Goddess. When Shiva wishes to see Vishnu's Mohini form again, Vishnu fears {{that he may be}} <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> ashes like Kamadeva by the ascetic Shiva. So, Vishnu prays to goddess Tripura, who grants half of her beauty to Vishnu, begetting the Mohini-form. As Shiva touches Mohini, his seed spills, indicating a loss of the merit gained through of all his austerities.|$|E
5|$|The Tudor Revival-style Briarcliff Lodge {{was opened}} in 1902 as a premier resort hotel. It was {{surrounded}} by Walter Law's dairy barns and greenhouses, and hosted numerous distinguished guests, including Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt.

The old conspirator, however, was soon disposed of, <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> death in her hall near Helmsdale. The Orkneyinga Saga names Svein Asleifsson as the killer, {{and says that}} he came to Caithness from the south, from Atholl, with Rognvald's blessing and Matad's help. This Svein Asleifsson had also been the man in whose custody Earl Paul had disappeared.|$|E

In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> the ground by Avidius Cassius in 164 AD. The Parthians made peace but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.|$|E
5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the capture of Saborsko.

The arriving French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then <b>burned</b> <b>to</b> prevent their capture. As the French worked {{their way up the}} channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport's harbour.
