The {{first year of the}} deal, in 2008–09, saw Bieksa make $4.25 million, while the remaining two years were set at $3.5 million. He had one more season left on his original contract at $550,000.|$|E
5|$|Bouwmeester {{experienced}} a <b>break-out</b> season after the NHL resumed play in 2005–06, scoring 5 goals, 41 assists and 46 points in 82 games, all career highs, and {{was invited to}} join Team Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics {{in the place of}} injured defenceman Scott Niedermayer. He made news that off-season in his hometown of Edmonton when he was arrested for driving under the influence, a charge he pleaded guilty to the following summer.|$|E
5|$|From these positions, the New Zealanders {{were ordered}} to capture Belhamed, Sidi Rezegh proper and Ed Duda. This was to precede a renewed <b>break-out</b> {{offensive}} by the 70th Division. Scobie had informed Lieutenant-General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the XIII Corps commander, responsible for all operations near Tobruk, that the positions between him and Ed Duda were strongly defended. Godwin-Austen assured Scobie that he was {{under no obligation to}} attack until the New Zealand Division had taken Ed Duda. Undertaking a night assault, the New Zealand infantry captured Belhamed despite strong resistance, but their attacks to take their other objectives were repulsed.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1932, {{after nine}} pictures, Tracy {{remained}} virtually {{unknown to the}} public. He considered leaving Fox once his contract was up for renewal, but a rise in his weekly rate to $1,500 convinced him to stay. He continued to appear in unpopular films, with Me and My Gal (1932) setting an all-time low attendance record for the Roxy Theatre in New York City. He was loaned to Warner Bros. for 20,000 Years in Sing Sing (1932), a prison drama co-starring Bette Davis. Tracy was hopeful {{that it would be}} his <b>break-out</b> role, but despite good reviews this failed to materialize.|$|E
5|$|Weidling {{had given}} the order for the {{survivors}} to break out to the north-west; the plan got underway at around 23:00. The first group from the Reich Chancellery, led by Mohnke, tried but could not break through the Soviet rings and was captured the next day. Like others from the Führerbunker who were captured, he was interrogated by SMERSH. On the third <b>break-out</b> attempt from the Reich Chancellery, made around 01:00 (2 May), Bormann managed to cross the Spree. Arthur Axmann, who followed the same route, reported seeing Bormann's body {{a short distance from}} the Weidendammer bridge.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{sea trials}} in early 1941, Tirpitz briefly {{served as the}} centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible <b>break-out</b> attempt by the Soviet Baltic Fleet. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway {{to act as a}} deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, Tirpitz was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the St Nazaire Raid had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. Tirpitz acted as a fleet in being, forcing the British Royal Navy to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.|$|E
50|$|If a {{trend line}} is plotted {{on the lower}} lows or the higher highs of a trend over a longer trend, a microtrend line is plotted when all or {{almost all of the}} highs or lows line up in a short multi-bar period. Just as <b>break-outs</b> from a normal trend are prone to fail as noted above, microtrend lines drawn on a chart are {{frequently}} broken by subsequent price action and these <b>break-outs</b> frequently fail too. Such a failure is traded by placing an entry stop order 1 tick above or below the previous bar, which would result in a with-trend position if hit, providing a low risk scalp with a target {{on the opposite side of}} the trend channel.|$|R

5|$|Due to the NHL's {{decision}} to lock out the players {{at the start}} of the 2012–13 season until a new collective bargaining agreement could be reached, Johansen was reassigned to the Blue Jackets' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. On February 24, 2013, Johansen was re-called by the Blue Jackets for the remainder of the season, which began on January 19 after an agreement was reached. In the 2013–14 season, Johansen had a <b>break-out</b> year, scoring 33 goals and 30 assists for a total of 63 points, a career high. He was the third Blue Jacket in franchise history to post 30 goals or more in one season.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>break-out</b> by the US 1st and 3rd Armies {{from the}} beachhead during the Battle of Normandy after Operation Cobra on 25 July 1944, Adolf Hitler ordered an {{immediate}} counterattack against Allied {{forces in the}} form of Operation Lüttich. Lieutenant General Omar Bradley—the commanding general of the US 12th Army Group—was notified of the counterattack in advance through signals intercepted via Ultra radio intercepts and deciphering and thus prepared his troops and their commanders to defeat this counteroffensive and to encircle as much of the Wehrmacht force as possible. By the afternoon of 7 August, Operation Lüttich had been defeated by concerted, large-scale fighter-bomber air strikes against the German tanks and trucks. In the process, forces of the German 7th Army became further enveloped by the Allied advance out of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|Following his <b>break-out</b> season, the Predators and Hamhuis {{agreed to}} a four-year, $8 million {{contract}} on September 21, 2006. He earned $1.5 million {{in his first year}} of the deal, gradually increasing to $2.5 million in his fourth. His offensive production dipped to a career-low 20 points in the season following the signing. In 2007–08, he recorded four goals and 27 points over 80 games. Hamhuis scored his first Stanley Cup playoff goal in game four of the opening round against the Detroit Red Wings, a 3–2 win. However, Nashville lost the next two games and were eliminated. Hamhuis continued scoring at the same pace in the following two seasons, recording 26 and 24 points in 2008–09 and 2009–10, respectively.|$|E

50|$|Tick-Tock {{assisted}} in the capture of Spider-Woman, and helped Locksmith imprison her with their other captives. He used his power to help prevent <b>break-outs,</b> anticipating the prisoners' attempts before they could happen, {{but he did not}} foresee that when Spider-Woman broke out, she would change costumes with Gypsy Moth. Placing the two women in each other's cells, Spider-Woman was able to escape, and set all of the captives free. Locksmith collapsed, and Tick-Tock was sent to prison.|$|R

5|$|In 1929 Zhu and Mao {{were forced}} to flee Jinggangshan to Ruijin {{following}} Kuomintang military pressure. Here they formed the Jiangxi Soviet, which would eventually grow to cover some 30,000 square kilometers (11,584 square miles) and include some three million people. In 1931 Zhu was appointed leader of the Red Army in Ruijin by the CPC leadership. He successfully led a conventional military force against the Kuomintang in the lead-up to the Fourth Counter Encirclement Campaign; However, {{he was not able}} to do the same during the Fifth Counter Encirclement Campaign and the CPC fled. Zhu helped form the 1934 <b>break-out</b> that began the Long March.|$|E
5|$|In {{his senior}} season Breslin was {{named one of the}} team's {{alternate}} captains. Playing on a line with future National Hockey League (NHL) player Doug Weight, Breslin had a <b>break-out</b> season. He set career highs in goals (25), assists (37), and points (62). During the year he tied a school record for points in a game with a seven-point performance against Ohio State. The scoring output helped him tie another school record when the two teams played the following day. Adding another three points in the second game, Breslin brought his two-game total to 10, tying the record for points in a series. Lake Superior State finished first in the CCHA, but was again defeated in the quarterfinals of the 1991 NCAA Tournament.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds his}} changes to Kazran's past have locked him {{out from the}} spire's controls, but the Doctor devises a solution: by having Abigail sing through {{one half of the}} broken sonic screwdriver, the other half, still in the shark, will {{resonate}} in the atmosphere and disrupt the storm to allow the ship to land safely. Kazran releases Abigail knowing this will be the last time, but Abigail understands and believes it is time for them to share a Christmas Day. The plan works successfully, and the resulting cloud <b>break-out</b> creates snowfall that falls around the city. As the Doctor rejoins Amy and Rory and prepares to take young Kazran back to the past, old Kazran and Abigail enjoy one last shark-led carriage-ride together.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} tumuli formed on the aa-dominated lava fan complex which {{developed}} in the medial zone of the 1983 flow-field of Mount Etna during the later stages of the eruption. This complex flow-field formed on shallow sloping ground below a scarp between 1900 and 1700 m asl. A major tube system fed a branching tube network in the fan complex. Numerous tumuli and <b>break-outs</b> of lava formed in the fan. Three main types of tumulus are identified: (1) Focal tumuli, which are formed from the break-up and uplift of `old´, thick lava crust and themselves become sustained sites for the distribution of lava both as flows and within distributary tubes. These focal tumuli are significant centres associated with major tubes. (2) Satellite tumuli, which are typically elongate, whale-back shaped features that branch out from focal tumuli. These satellite tumuli were initially lava flows erupted from a focal tumulus. The crust of the flow slowed or {{came to a halt}} and the rigid crust became uplifted and fractured, forming a dome-shaped ridge feature. These satellite tumuli continued to be fed from the focal tumulus and became sites of lava emission with numerous <b>break-outs.</b> (3) Distributary tumuli formed on the fan associated with short-lived <b>break-outs</b> from tubes and are relatively simple structures formed from limited effusion of toey lobes and pahoehoe lava. The major tumuli on the fan complex show distinct dilation fractures. The fracture surfaces provide good exposure of the crust and three distinct zones are recognised – an upper zone showing columnar jointing, a middle zone consisting of planar fracture surfaces and a basal zone with distinctive banded planar fracture surfaces showing evidence of both brittle and ductile formation. Using these data a model is proposed for tumulus growth. Field analysis of the fan complex shows how it was fed by a branching tube system, leading to flow thickening, formation of tumuli and numerous ephemeral boccas...|$|R
5|$|The {{second wave}} of exterminations in the Soviet Union met with armed {{resistance}} in some areas, though the chance of success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, {{so there was no}} way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass <b>break-outs</b> were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.|$|R
50|$|In stage lighting, a multicable (otherwise {{known as}} {{multi-core}} cable or mult) {{is a type}} of heavy-duty electrical cable used in theaters to power lights. The basic construction involves a bundle of individual conductors surrounded by a single outer jacket. Whereas single cables only have three conductors, multicable has ten or more. They are configured to run in six or eight-circuit varieties. Typically, both ends of multicable have a specific connector known as a Socapex Connector. Technicians then combine the cables with <b>break-outs</b> and break-ins, which essentially are an octopus-like adapter with one Socapex end and six to eight Edison, twist-lok, or stage pin style connectors.|$|R
5|$|The {{version of}} events {{recorded}} by history {{is based on the}} accounts of Burnham, Ingram and Gooding, the Matabele present at the battle (particularly inDuna Mjaan), and the men of Forbes's column. Burnham, Ingram and Gooding's stories closely corroborate each other; their {{version of events}} was accepted as true by the Court of Inquiry at Bulawayo in December 1893. First-hand Matabele accounts such as Mjaan's, which were first recorded during 1894, appear to confirm the character of the <b>break-out,</b> saying that three of the white men they were fighting—including Burnham, whom several of them recognised—left during a lull in the battle, just after Wilson withdrew to his final position.|$|E
5|$|With {{the defeat}} of Germany, the {{question}} became {{what to do with}} the ships of the High Seas Fleet. Because no neutral nation wanted to host the rebellious sailors of the mutinous armada, the Allies eventually decided to have the force interned at Scapa Flow, with the guns of the Grand Fleet's ships nearby in case of any attempt at a <b>break-out.</b> On 15 November, Beatty met with Hipper's representative, Rear Admiral Hugo Meurer, to arrange the surrender of the German ships. Meurer agreed to surrender to Beatty in the Firth of Forth. From there, the German vessels would proceed to Scapa Flow, until their ultimate fate was decided by the Paris Peace Conference.|$|E
5|$|After sea trials, Tirpitz was {{stationed}} in Kiel and performed intensive training in the Baltic. While the ship was in Kiel, Germany invaded the Soviet Union. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the possible <b>break-out</b> of the Soviet fleet based in Leningrad. Tirpitz was briefly made the flagship of the squadron, which consisted of the heavy cruiser , the light cruisers , , , and , several destroyers, and two flotillas of minesweepers. The Baltic Fleet, {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral Otto Ciliax, patrolled off the Aaland Islands from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and Tirpitz resumed training. During the training period, Tirpitz tested her primary and secondary guns on the old pre-dreadnought battleship , which had been converted into a radio-controlled target ship. The British Royal Air Force (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on Tirpitz while she {{was stationed}} in Kiel.|$|E
50|$|Locksmith and Tick-Tock {{eventually}} captured Spider-Woman herself, imprisoning {{her with}} their other captives. Tick-Tock used {{his power to}} help prevent <b>break-outs,</b> anticipating the prisoners' attempts before they could happen. Spider-Woman had Tigra insult Poltergeist enough to start a fight, in which they shorted out their specially designed prisons. Spider-Woman then had Gypsy Moth use her powers to swap their costumes. Tick-Tock did not foresee this change. Once placed in Gypsy Moth’s specific prison, Spider-Woman broke free and released everyone else. After everyone was free, Locksmith collapsed upon having a nervous breakdown. Gypsy Moth restrained Locksmith and Tick-Tock {{long enough for the}} authorities to collect them.|$|R
25|$|The Libyan Government {{rejected}} the allegations about Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency {{head of the}} Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation {{on the order of}} the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate <b>break-outs</b> prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.|$|R
30|$|Migrant {{entrepreneurs}} {{often have}} {{to work in an}} unfamiliar and risky business environment in urban agglomerations (see Sahin 2012). Some may tend to be risk-avoiding and hence concentrate on traditional market segments (e.g., markets for ethnic products). Consequently, they may be less entrepreneurially-oriented in terms of risk attitudes concerning undertaking innovative business activities. Many migrant entrepreneurs appear to operate in limited markets with products oriented towards their own ethnic or socio-cultural group. Clearly, urban social bonds and networks offer a support system for these entrepreneurs. In such a captive market the prospects for <b>break-outs</b> towards serving the wider community are almost nil, as these markets are by definition limited and competitive (the ‘ethnic mobility trap’; see Wiley 1970).|$|R
