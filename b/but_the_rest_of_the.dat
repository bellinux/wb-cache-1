5|$|The 16th-century English Reformation, {{during which}} the Church of England {{broke away from the}} {{authority}} of the pope and the Catholic Church, split the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall. Sir John Southworth, head of the family, was a leading recusant who had been arrested several times for refusing to abandon his Catholic faith. His eldest son, also called John, did convert to the Church of England, for which he was disinherited, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family remained staunchly Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{commissioning}} in 1932–33, the D class {{formed the}} 1st Destroyer Flotilla {{assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet. The flotilla toured the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea in September–November 1933. After refitting in the UK during 1934, the flotilla {{was transferred to the}} China Station, arriving at Hong Kong in January 1935 and renumbered as the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. Most of the flotilla was sent to the Red Sea during the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935–36. They returned to the Hong Kong in mid-1936 and remained there until World War II began. Diamond {{was in the midst of}} a refit that lasted until November, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flotilla was immediately transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. Daring was kept in the Red Sea for escort duties until November, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flotilla was used on contraband patrol duties upon arrival. They all needed repairs which were made before the end of the year.|$|E

5|$|Following relegation in 1980, Bolton signed former Manchester United European Cup winning striker Brian Kidd from Everton for £150,000 as they {{prepared}} to challenge {{for a quick}} return to the First Division. Kidd scored a hat-trick in his third game for Bolton, a 4–0 win over Newcastle United in the league, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season was a struggle as Bolton finished close to the relegation places. By {{the end of the}} 1981–82 season, Bolton were no closer to promotion and had lost several key players including Peter Reid and Neil Whatmore. The following season Bolton were relegated to the Third Division after losing 4–1 at Charlton Athletic on the final day.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, {{at the head of}} not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her quarterdeck. As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the quarterdeck to organise resistance.|$|E
5|$|Rain from Hurricane Dean closed several roads {{throughout}} Puerto Rico {{and there}} was heavy surf along the island's coast, but no deaths or injuries were reported. The hurricane's outer bands swept over Cuba between August 19 and August 21, bringing heavy rain and high seas, but sparing the island its damaging winds. In the Cayman Islands, rain flooded roads and there were high waves along the coast, but no deaths or serious injuries were reported. There were localized power outages and the water supply was shut off briefly, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island's infrastructure was unaffected. Approximately 2,000people weathered the storm in temporary shelters.|$|E

5|$|Swedbank Stadion has {{an overall}} {{capacity}} of 24,000 spectators. It comprises four stands: the Western Stand; the Eastern Stand and the Southern Stand, {{both of which}} have two tiers; and the Northern Stand, which is terraced. The lower-right part of the Southern Stand also features terracing for away supporters, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stand is seated. The lower tier has 10,000 seats, and the upper tier has 8,000 seats. The Northern Stand has a capacity of 6,000 standing supporters, which can be transformed into an all-seated section with a capacity of 3,000 if required. This is done for matches played by Malmö FF in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The 1956 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the VII Olympic Winter Games (French: Les VIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver) (Italian: VII Giochi olimpici invernali), was a winter multi-sport event celebrated in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. This celebration of the Games was held from 26 January to 5 February 1956. Cortina, which had {{originally}} been awarded the 1944 Winter Olympics, beat out Montreal, Colorado Springs and Lake Placid {{for the right to}} host the 1956 Games. The Cortina Games were unique in that many of the venues were within walking distance of each other. The organising committee received financial support from the Italian government for infrastructure improvements, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> costs for the Games had to be privately financed. Consequently, the organising committee was the first to rely heavily on corporate sponsorship for funding.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch {{is a small}} finch, 10cm (4in) in length. The {{adult male}} has a bright green body and wings, red head, and scarlet rump and tail. The blackish {{feathering}} of the chin becomes dark blue on the lower throat and turquoise on the upper breast before fading into the green of the underparts. The stubby bill is blackish-grey, the eyes are reddish-brown and the legs and feet are pinkish-brown. The female {{is very similar to}} the male, but possibly slightly duller and with paler flanks. Young birds have a dark-tipped yellow bill and sometimes a bluish face which gradually turns red, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plumage is like the adult. Full mature plumage is achieved at about 20 months. Some rare individuals of this parrotfinch have the entire head and face blue, apparently due to a natural mutation.|$|E

5|$|The tunnels were {{enlarged}} {{by removing}} {{several of the}} cast iron segments from each tunnel ring, excavating a void behind to the required new diameter and reinstalling the segments with additional packing spacers. The northern section of the C between Euston and Moorgate was closed from 8 August 1922, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> line remained open with enlargement works taking place at night. A collapse on 27 November 1923 caused when a train hit temporary shoring on the incomplete excavations near Elephant & Castle station filled the tunnel with soil. The line was briefly operated in two parts, but was completely closed on 28 November 1923.|$|E
5|$|Villa Real was now {{surrounded}} by hostile territory, and any Spanish help {{was too far}} away to be of value. The colonists quickly ran short of food and responded by taking up arms and riding against the Indians in search of food and slaves. The Indians abandoned their towns and hid their women and children in caves. The rebellious populations concentrated themselves on easily defended mountaintops. At Quetzaltepeque a lengthy battle was fought between the Tzeltal Maya and the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of a number of Spanish as a result of rocks being cast down upon them from the mountaintop. The battle lasted various days, and the Spanish were supported by indigenous warriors from central Mexico. The battle eventually resulted in a Spanish victory, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province of Chiapa remained rebellious.|$|E

5|$|While {{fighting}} the Lydians, Cyrus had sent {{messages to the}} Ionians asking them to revolt against Lydian rule, which the Ionians had refused to do. After Cyrus completed the conquest of Lydia, the Ionian cities now offered to be his subjects under the same terms {{as they had been}} subjects of Croesus. Cyrus refused, citing the Ionians' unwillingness to help him previously. The Ionians thus prepared to defend themselves, and Cyrus sent the Median general Harpagus to conquer Ionia. He first attacked Phocaea; the Phocaeans decided to entirely abandon their city and sail into exile in Sicily, rather than become Persian subjects (although many subsequently returned). Some Teians also chose to emigrate when Harpagus attacked Teos, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ionians remained, and were in turn conquered.|$|E
5|$|Among the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden was {{the initial}} front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the contested {{election}} of 1876. After Tilden declined a nomination {{due to his}} poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders. Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa, and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings, along with various favorite sons. Each {{of the other candidates}} had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War; Thurman was generally well liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views on the silver question were uncertain. Cleveland, too, had detractors—Tammany remained opposed to him—but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends. Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820. On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won. Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate.|$|E
5|$|By February 26 city {{officials}} had determined One Meridian Plaza {{was not in}} danger of collapse. There was structural damage to horizontal steel beams and floor sections {{on most of the}} fire damaged floors. Under extreme fire exposure the beams and girders sagged and twisted and cracks appeared in the concrete floors. However, the overall structure was stable and able to support the weight of the building. Thermal expansion of the steel frame caused some of the granite panels to be dislodged from the building's facade. The streets and buildings around One Meridian Plaza were closed and cordoned off. The 20-story Morris Building and several three-story shops behind One Meridian Plaza on Chestnut Street were damaged by falling debris and sat unused for years until they were demolished in 2000. The neighboring Girard Trust Building, then called Two Mellon Plaza, experienced extensive water damage forcing the closure of the building. A bank in the building reopened a month later <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower remained vacant for years. The roads around the building were closed for months after the fire, including a portion of two of Philadelphia's major streets, Broad and Market.|$|E

5|$|IFK {{won their}} first Allsvenskan title in 1934–35, the ten {{previous}} seasons {{of the league}} saw the club finish in the top four. Swedish football was dominated by teams from Gothenburg during these years, but IFK Göteborg were surprisingly relegated in 1937–38, although the team was promoted back to Allsvenskan the next season. Back in the highest division, IFK finished second, with the league continuing despite the outbreak of World War II. IFK won another title in 1941–42 with a strong team, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decade saw mixed results. The 1940s team included the talented Gunnar Gren, who became the top scorer in 1946–47. He was also awarded Guldbollen as {{the best player in}} Sweden, and won an Olympic gold medal with the Swedish team at the 1948 Olympics. When Gren left in 1949, IFK were relegated from Allsvenskan the following season. As happened the last time IFK played in a lower league, they were promoted directly back to Allsvenskan after one season in Division 2. IFK went on to compete in a European Cup—the European Champion Clubs' Cup—for the first time in 1958, but were eliminated in the second round by SC Wismut. In 1959, the all-time Allsvenskan record attendance of 52,194 was set when IFK played Örgryte IS at Nya Ullevi.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Jefferson's presidency, the United States {{had paid}} tribute {{to a number of}} Arab states in the Mediterranean to prevent attacks on its shipping. By the time Jefferson assumed office, the United States Navy had been {{developed}} {{to the point where it}} might adequately defend American shipping interests. Jefferson consequently refused to pay tribute in 1801 to Yusuf Karamanli, the ruler of Tripoli, after which the Tripolitans began attacking and seizing American merchant vessels. In a cabinet discussion held in early 1801 to formulate a response, it was suggested that the President declare war on Tripoli. Lincoln pointed out that only Congress had the authority to declare war, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet was intent on taking some sort of action. The matter was tabled until May 1801, when the cabinet voted to send a naval squadron to the area to defend the country's merchant interests.

5|$|The Chapel of St Michael and All Angels and the Lady Chapel are at {{the east}} end of the outer north and south aisles respectively, and contain 20 of the 28 stone heads carved by Thomas Earp of Lambeth in 1878–1880, mostly {{depicting}} biblical characters such as Salome and John the Baptist, or historical figures like St Helen and Martin Luther. Ten are paired {{on opposite sides of the}} five pillars defining the inner edge of the Lady Chapel aisle, and another ten are similarly arranged in the Chapel of St Michael and All Angels. The corbels of the north, west and south doors bear six more heads, those by the west door depicting Queen Victoria and Archbishop Tait; and Jesus and Moses are higher on the corbels of the west window.
