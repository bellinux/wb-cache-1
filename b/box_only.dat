25|$|Arsenal's {{second game}} in the Emirates Cup was against Ligue 1 runners up Monaco. Wenger fielded a 4–3–3 formation, which saw the {{introduction}} of first team names Wojciech Szczęsny, Laurent Koscielny, Jack Wilshere, Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud into the side. Summer signings Sánchez and Chambers started the match, which also served as the debut for £12million signing Mathieu Debuchy. Arsenal had needed only a draw to claim the Emirates Cup and entered the game looking for that draw. However, Monaco were gifted the only goal of the match in the 37th minute when Radamel Falcao was given {{the freedom of the}} Arsenal penalty area to head home João Moutinho’s free-kick, awarded for Wilshere's clumsy lunge on Nabil Dirar, a challenge that booked the English midfielder. Having won 5–1 against Benfica 24 hours earlier, Arsenal struggled against the French side and created {{little in the way of}} clear-cut chances. Sánchez played on both flanks and then through the middle in the second period before being withdrawn in the 74th minute. Following the introduction of Chuba Akpom into the side, Arsenal showed direct running and looked for an equaliser. Akpom, who replaced Sánchez, was brought down by Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subašić as Akpom burst into the <b>box,</b> <b>only</b> for referee Martin Atkinson to award a free-kick rather than a penalty— despite replays showing the foul was clearly inside the area. The game finished 1–0 to Monaco, and with Valencia winning 3–1 against Benfica earlier that day, the Spanish side won the trophy.|$|E
25|$|Barbara Wright first {{appears in}} the first Doctor Who serial, An Unearthly Child (1963), where she is {{teaching}} history at Coal Hill School in London in 1963, working with science teacher Ian Chesterton (William Russell). They are curious about their student Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), who shows an unusually advanced knowledge of science and history, but a rudimentary knowledge of other subjects. In an attempt {{to learn more about}} Susan, Barbara and Ian follow her home to a junkyard, where they hear her voice coming from {{what appears to be a}} police box. During a confrontation with her grandfather, the Doctor (William Hartnell), Barbara rushes in to the police <b>box,</b> <b>only</b> to discover that its exterior hides the much larger interior of the TARDIS. After the Doctor reveals to Barbara and Ian that he and Susan are aliens exiled from their own planet, he tells them he cannot risk their revealing information about the TARDIS to their contemporary world, and dematerialises the craft against Susan's protests. At this point in the series the Doctor had no control over where or when it would land, making a return to London in 1963 impossible to co-ordinate. They are transported back in time to 100,000 BCE Earth, where they are captured by a prehistoric tribe seeking the secret of fire. Once they escape back to the TARDIS, their second trip takes them to the planet Skaro, where they encounter the Daleks for the first time. At the end of the first episode of that serial, Barbara becomes separated from her fellow travellers and is threatened by an unseen creature with a metal arm, marking the first appearance of a Dalek.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plant and}} take off is {{initiated}} typically three steps out from the final step. Vaulters will usually count their steps backwards from their starting point to the <b>box</b> <b>only</b> counting the steps taken on the left foot (vice versa for left-handers) except for the second step from the box, which is taken by the right foot. For example; a vaulter on a [...] "ten count" [...] (referring {{to the number of}} counted steps from the starting point to the box) would count backwards from ten, only counting the steps taken with the left foot, until the last three steps taken and both feet are counted as three, two, one. These last three steps are normally quicker than the previous strides and are referred to as the [...] "turn-over". The goal of this phase is to efficiently translate the kinetic energy accumulated from the approach into potential energy stored by the elasticity of the pole, and to gain as much initial vertical height as possible by jumping off the ground. The plant starts with the vaulter raising their arms up from around the hips or mid-torso until they are fully outstretched above the head, with the right arm extended directly above the head and the left arm extended perpendicular to the pole (vice versa for left-handed vaulters). At the same time, the vaulter is dropping the pole tip into the box. On the final step, the vaulter jumps off the trail leg which should always remain straight and then drives the front knee forward. As the pole slides {{into the back of the}} box the pole begins to bend and the vaulter continues up and forward, leaving the trail leg angled down and behind.|$|E

I wish you would try to write to me everything about home and the particulars of Andrew's funeral, and how you all are getting along. I have not received the Eagle with the little piece in. I was in hopes Jeff would have sent it. I wish he would yet, or some of you would; I want to see it. I think it must have been put in by a young man named Howard; he is now editor of the Eagle, and is very friendly to me.|$|E
60|$|But Miss Dorothy {{was not of}} {{a nature}} to remain {{dependent}} upon a censor's favour. The minx deported herself like any London belle of experience, as tho' she had known the world from her cradle. She {{was not to be}} deceived by the face value of the ladies' praises, nor rebuffed unmercifully by my Aunt Caroline, who had held the sceptre {{in the absence of a}} younger aspirant. The first time these ladies clashed, which was not long in coming, my aunt met with a wit as sharp again as her own, and never afterwards essayed an open tilt. The homage of men Dolly took as Caesar received tribute, as a matter of course. The doctor himself rode to the races beside the Manners coach, leaning gallantly over the door. My lady held court in her father's box, received and dismissed, smiled and frowned, with Courtenay as her master of ceremonies. Mr. Dulany was one of the presidents of the Jockey Club that year, and his horse winning the honours he presented her with his colours, scarlet and white, which she graciously wore. The doctor swore he would import a horse the next season on the chance of the privilege. My aunt was furious. I have never mentioned her beauty because I never could see it. 'Twas a coarser type than attracted me. She was then not greatly above six and thirty, appearing young for that age, and she knew the value of lead in judicious quantity. At that meet gentlemen came to her <b>box</b> <b>only</b> to tally of Miss Manners, to marvel that one so young could have the 'bel air', to praise her beauty and addresse, or to remark how well Mr. Durlany's red and white became her. With all of which Mrs. Grafton was fain to agree, and must even excel, until her small stock of patience was exhausted. To add to her chagrin my aunt lost a pretty sum to the rector by Mr. Dulany's horse. I came upon her after the race trying to coax her head-dress, through her coach door, Mr. Allen having tight hold of her hand the while.|$|E
