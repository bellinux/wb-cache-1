5|$|The lungs {{are part}} of the lower {{respiratory}} tract, and accommodate the <b>bronchial</b> airways when they branch from the trachea. The lungs include the <b>bronchial</b> airways that terminate in alveoli, the lung tissue in between, and veins, arteries, nerves and lymphatic vessels. The trachea and bronchi have plexuses of lymph capillaries in their mucosa and submucosa. The smaller bronchi have a single layer and they are absent in the alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Four main {{histological}} subtypes are recognised, {{although some}} cancers may contain {{a combination of}} different subtypes, such as adenosquamous carcinoma. Rare subtypes include carcinoid tumors, <b>bronchial</b> gland carcinomas and sarcomatoid carcinomas.|$|E
5|$|In early 2015 Robinson {{underwent}} {{surgery to remove}} a <b>bronchial</b> carcinoid tumour; he returned {{to work at the}} BBC on 13 April 2015, as part of its coverage of the 2015 general election and beyond. The operation was reported to have been a “complete success”.|$|E
5|$|Some {{people suffer}} from {{allergic}} reactions after handling onions. Symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, <b>bronchial</b> asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. Allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly {{due to the}} denaturing of the proteins from cooking.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bronchial</b> {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the hole in the airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Despite pleas from Kate, Sayid {{sets off}} {{to explore the}} island's {{shoreline}} in self-imposed isolation, needing time {{to come to terms}} with his actions in torturing Sawyer, while Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) helps Shannon by making a eucalyptus salve to clear her <b>bronchial</b> passages. Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) convinces Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) to move to the caves, because they made a deal that if Charlie found peanut butter, she would move; Charlie shares an imaginary jar of peanut butter with her. Sawyer attempts to burn the letter he wrote, but he finds himself unable to go through with it.|$|E
5|$|Following Sean Connery's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor. He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a <b>bronchial</b> infection and several panic attacks. Joe Kidd received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times writing that it was unremarkable, with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 November 1991, just over 24 hours after issuing that statement, Mercury {{died at the age}} of 45 at his home in Kensington. The {{official}} cause of death was <b>bronchial</b> pneumonia resulting from AIDS. Mercury's close friend, Dave Clark of The Dave Clark Five, had taken over the bedside vigil when he died. Austin phoned Mercury's parents and sister to break the news of his death, which reached newspaper and television crews by the early hours of 25 November.|$|E
5|$|The river martins are in {{some ways}} {{intermediate}} between typical swallows and other passerines: they have stout bills, large feet and relatively strong legs, which is unusual in aerial feeders. They also have a large syrinx (vocal organ) and a different <b>bronchial</b> structure. The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of these two martins suggest that they are relict populations {{of a group of}} species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolutionary history, and they may be the most primitive of the swallows. Like other early hirundine lineages, they nest in burrows, rather than adopted nest holes or mud nests.|$|E
5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the increased number of gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted <b>bronchial</b> pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E
5|$|Asthma, chronic bronchitis, {{bronchiectasis}} {{and chronic}} obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are all obstructive lung diseases characterised by airway obstruction. This limits {{the amount of}} air that is able to enter alveoli because of constriction of the <b>bronchial</b> tree, due to inflammation. Obstructive lung diseases are often identified because of symptoms and diagnosed with pulmonary function tests such as spirometry. Many obstructive lung diseases are managed by avoiding triggers (such as dust mites or smoking), with symptom control such as bronchodilators, and with suppression of inflammation (such as through corticosteroids) in severe cases. One common cause of COPD and emphysema is smoking, and common causes of bronchiectasis include severe infections and cystic fibrosis. The definitive cause of asthma is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 {{of a heart}} embolism. His {{father did}} not arrive home until after his son's death. Boyce was so saddened over his son's death that his own health suffered. One of Boyce's last efforts was to publish his son's letters from his South Seas expeditions: Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea. Boyce died from <b>bronchial</b> {{pneumonia}} on June 11, 1929, in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa, Illinois, on June 13, 1929, in the Ottawa Avenue Cemetery, with West delivering the eulogy. Boy Scouts maintained an honor guard with an American flag in a heavy rainstorm in two-hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers. BSA officials sent his widow a telegram that said the entire American nation owed him a debt of gratitude. A statue that commemorates his contribution to the Boy Scouts of America was placed near his grave on June 21, 1941, which West dedicated.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the <b>bronchial</b> tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Wilkinson {{served in}} Churchill's wartime {{coalition}} {{as a junior}} minister, mainly at the Ministry of Home Security where she worked under Herbert Morrison. She supported Morrison's attempts to replace Clement Attlee as the Labour Party's leader; nevertheless, when he formed his postwar government, Attlee appointed Wilkinson as Minister of Education. By this time, her health was poor, a legacy of years of overwork. She saw her main task in office as {{the implementation of the}} wartime coalition's 1944 Education Act, rather than the more radical introduction of comprehensive schools favoured by many in the Labour Party. Much of her energy was applied to organising the raising of the school-leaving age from 14 to 15. During the exceptionally cold weather of early 1947, she succumbed to a <b>bronchial</b> disease, and died after an overdose of medication, which the coroner at her inquest declared was accidental.|$|E
5|$|Formby took a {{break from}} work until mid-1954, when he starred in the revue Turned Out Nice Again, in Blackpool. Although the show was {{initially}} scheduled to run for 13 weeks, it was cut short after six when Formby suffered again from dysentery and depression. He again announced his retirement, but continued to work. After some television appearances on Ask Pickles and Top of the Town, in late 1954 and early 1955 respectively, Formby travelled to South Africa for a tour, where Beryl negotiated {{an agreement with the}} South African premier Johannes Strijdom to play in venues of Formby's choice, and then sailed to Canada for a ten-day series of performances. On the return voyage he contracted <b>bronchial</b> pneumonia, but still joined the cast of the non-musical play Too Young to Marry on his arrival in Britain.|$|E
5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the <b>bronchial</b> openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has low {{plasma protein}} binding (approximately 31%, but highly variable) and an {{apparent}} volume of distribution at steady state of around 40–50liters. Peak serum concentrations (Cmax) are reached {{one to two}} hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from bone matrix and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid of the lower respiratory tract is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported <b>bronchial</b> fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults.|$|E
5|$|Shepard died {{unexpectedly}} {{during the}} afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a bladder stone from him. They instructed him to eat lightly, only well before the operation. They gave him the anesthetic ether at 12:45p.m. For a few minutes Shepard {{did not seem to}} react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed, so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or <b>bronchial</b> tubes. The doctors then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10p.m. His cause of death was edema and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.|$|E
5|$|Complications {{may also}} be severe and {{long-lasting}} or permanent, such as vocal cord damage, esophageal perforation and retropharyngeal abscess, <b>bronchial</b> intubation, or nerve injury. They may even be immediately life-threatening, such as laryngospasm and negative pressure pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), aspiration, unrecognized esophageal intubation, or accidental disconnection or dislodgement of the tracheal tube. Potentially fatal complications more often associated with prolonged intubation and/or tracheotomy include abnormal communication between the trachea and nearby structures such as the innominate artery (tracheoinnominate fistula) or esophagus (tracheoesophageal fistula). Other significant complications include airway obstruction due to loss of tracheal rigidity, ventilator-associated pneumonia and narrowing of the glottis or trachea. The cuff pressure is monitored carefully {{in order to avoid}} complications from over-inflation, many of which can be traced to excessive cuff pressure restricting the blood supply to the tracheal mucosa. A 2000 Spanish study of bedside percutaneous tracheotomy reported overall complication rates of 10–15% and procedural mortality of 0%, which is comparable to those of other series reported in the literature from the Netherlands and the United States.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a <b>bronchial</b> rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
25|$|Clearance of <b>bronchial</b> {{secretions}} {{is essential}} for good pulmonary health and can help limit injury from acute and chronic lung infections. Children and adults with increased <b>bronchial</b> secretions can benefit from routine chest therapy using the manual method, an a cappella device or a chest physiotherapy vest. Chest physiotherapy can help bring up mucous from the lower <b>bronchial</b> tree, however an adequate cough is needed to remove secretions. In people who have decreased lung reserve and a weak cough, use of an insufflator-exsufflator (cough-assist) device may be useful as a maintenance therapy or during acute respiratory illnesses to help remove <b>bronchial</b> secretions from the upper airways. Evaluation by a Pulmonology specialist however, should first be done to properly assess patient suitability.|$|E

25|$|Barnett died in London in 1901 of <b>bronchial</b> {{pneumonia}} {{following an}} operation.|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about how M. laryngeus causes disease. Symptoms do not arise until the worms have reached the adult stage and obstruct the <b>bronchial</b> airways leading to asthma-like {{symptoms}} and coughing. Similar symptoms are seen in humans, {{as well as the}} domestic ungulates and ruminant hosts. <b>Bronchial</b> inflammation or hemotypsis may occur due to the worms attaching to the mucosal walls and ingesting red blood cells.|$|E
25|$|Robert Tiffany died in St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, of <b>bronchial</b> {{pneumonia}} and renal failure, aged 50.|$|E
25|$|A {{separate}} system {{known as the}} <b>bronchial</b> circulation supplies blood to the tissue of the larger airways of the lung.|$|E
25|$|He died at {{his home}} in Syracuse after an illness of several months. Cause of death on January 31, 1929, was <b>bronchial</b> pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|He toured India in the 1984–85 season, {{being one}} of three selectors. However Hogg {{returned}} home early due to a <b>bronchial</b> infection.|$|E
25|$|Durbin {{returned}} {{again to}} Anderson where he remained {{the rest of}} his life. He died on December 18, 1928, of <b>bronchial</b> pneumonia following an attack of influenza. He was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|Motility of mucocilia in the airways — Positive {{pressure}} ventilation {{appears to}} impair mucociliary motility in the airways. <b>Bronchial</b> mucus transport was frequently impaired and associated with retention of secretions and pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Cancer in the <b>bronchial</b> tree {{is usually}} painless, but ear and facial pain {{on one side}} of the head has been {{reported}} in some patients. This pain is referred via the auricular branch of the vagus nerve.|$|E
25|$|Martita Hunt died of <b>bronchial</b> asthma at {{her home}} in Hampstead, London, aged 69, on 13 June 1969. Her estate was valued at £5,390. She never married. She was an aunt of actor Gareth Hunt.|$|E
25|$|In cardiac uses, {{it works}} as a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholinergic antagonist, {{increasing}} firing of the sinoatrial node (SA) and conduction through the atrioventricular node (AV) of the heart, opposes {{the actions of the}} vagus nerve, blocks acetylcholine receptor sites, and decreases <b>bronchial</b> secretions.|$|E
25|$|The {{tertiary}} butyl {{group in}} salbutamol {{makes it more}} selective for β2 receptors, which are the predominant receptors on the <b>bronchial</b> smooth muscles. Activation of these receptors causes adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP, beginning the signalling cascade that ends with the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation and lowering the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (myosin phosphorylation and calcium ions are necessary for muscle contractions). The increase in cAMP also inhibits inflammatory cells in the airway, such as basophils, eosinophils, and most especially mast cells, from releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Salbutamol and other β2 receptor agonists also increase the conductance of channels sensitive to calcium and potassium ions, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of <b>bronchial</b> smooth muscles.|$|E
25|$|Polonium 210 is {{a natural}} {{contaminant}} of tobacco, providing additional evidence for the link between smoking and <b>bronchial</b> cancer. It is also extremely toxic, with one microgram being enough to kill the average adult (250,000 times more toxic than hydrogen cyanide by weight).|$|E
