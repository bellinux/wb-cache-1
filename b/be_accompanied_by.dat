5|$|Diagnosis of {{epilepsy}} can be difficult. A {{number of}} other conditions may present very similar signs and symptoms to seizures, including syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic attacks and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES). In particular a syncope can <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> a short episode of convulsions. Nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, often misdiagnosed as nightmares, {{was considered to be}} a parasomnia but later identified to be an epilepsy syndrome. Attacks of the movement disorder paroxysmal dyskinesia may be taken for epileptic seizures. The cause of a drop attack can be, among many others, an atonic seizure.|$|E
5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} {{small pieces}} of hay or straw, can become lodged {{in the eyes of}} guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Holkham's north-facing coastal {{location}} {{can attract}} {{large numbers of}} migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with a north to north-east wind.

Vagrant rarities such as Pallas's, Radde's or dusky warblers may occur; a red-breasted nuthatch in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.|$|E

5|$|In January 1909, Austro-Hungarian admirals {{circulated}} {{a document}} {{calling for a}} fleet of four dreadnoughts. A constitutional crisis in 1909–10 meant no construction could be approved. In spite of this, two dreadnoughts were laid down by shipyards on a speculative basis – due especially to the energetic manipulations of Rudolf Montecuccoli, Chief of the Austro-Hungarian Navy – and later approved along with an additional two. The resulting ships, all , were to <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> a further four ships, but these were cancelled on the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this {{is the belief that}} all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised to build up the church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E
5|$|Meningitis is {{an acute}} {{inflammation}} of the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, known collectively as the meninges. The most common symptoms are fever, headache, and neck stiffness. Other symptoms include confusion or altered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light or loud noises. Young children often exhibit only nonspecific symptoms, such as irritability, drowsiness, or poor feeding. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of meningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> a characteristic rash.|$|E

5|$|The {{black mamba}} is graceful but skittish and often unpredictable. It is agile and can move quickly, it is shy and secretive by nature and, like most snakes, it avoids threats. In the wild, a black mamba seldom tolerates humans {{approaching}} {{more closely than}} about 40 meters. When confronted {{it is likely to}} gape in a threat display, exposing its black mouth and flicking its tongue. It also is likely to form a hood by spreading its neck-flap as cobras do. The mamba's hood however, is narrower than that of a typical cobra. The threat display may <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> audible hissing.|$|E

This would <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> a state-owned 'Public British Energy Company', a measure that the party hopes will keep consumer costs affordable. The party would also abandon catch quotas set by the EU's Common Fisheries Policy and establish 'no fishing zones' to ensure plentiful stocks.|$|E

5|$|The {{positive}} charge in ions {{is achieved by}} stripping away electrons from atomic nuclei. The number of electrons removed is related to either the increase in temperature or the local density of other ionised matter. This also can <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> the dissociation of molecular bonds, though this process is distinctly different from chemical processes of ion interactions in liquids or the behavior of ions existing in metals. The response of plasma to electromagnetic fields can be usefully employed in many modern technological devices, such as plasma televisions or plasma etching.|$|E
5|$|A bite from a {{black mamba}} causes initial {{neurological}} and neuromuscular symptoms that may commonly include headache and a metallic taste in the mouth, which may <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> a triad of paresthesias, profuse perspiration and salivation. Other symptoms may include ptosis and gradual bulbar palsy. Localised pain or numbness around the bite site is common but not typically severe; therefore, application of a tourniquet proximal to the bite site is feasible and may assist in slowing the onset of prominent neurotoxicity. Without appropriate treatment, symptoms typically progress to more severe reactions such as tachydysrhythmias and neurogenic shock, leading to death by asphyxiation, cardiovascular collapse, or respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may <b>be</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
