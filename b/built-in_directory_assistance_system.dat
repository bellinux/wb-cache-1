5000|$|To provide {{higher levels}} of {{automation}} to operator services, CCI introduced in the early 1980s various Automatic Voice Response (AVR) systems tightly integrated with its popular <b>Directory</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>systems.</b> AVR provided voice response of the customer requested data, almost universally starting the prompt with {{a variant of the}} phrase, [...] "The number is". Early systems were based on very small vocabulary synthesised speech chips, follow-on systems utilized 8-bit PCM, and later ADPCM voice playback using audio authored either by CCI or the local phone company.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an accurate and efficient algorithm for very-large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition {{based on an}} HMM-LR algorithm. The HMM-LR algorithm uses a generalized LR parser as a language model and hidden Markov models (HMMs) as phoneme models. To reduce the search space without pruning the correct candidate, we use forward and backward trellis likelihoods, an adjusting win-dow for choosing only the probable part of the trellis for each predicted phoneme, and an algorithm for merging candi-dates that have the same allophonic phoneme sequences and the same context-free grammar states. Candidates are also merged at the meaning level. This algorithm is applied to a telephone <b>directory</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> that recognizes spon-taneous speech containing the names and addresses of more than 70, 000 subscribers (vocabulary size is about 80, 000).

This algorithm was also ap-plied to a multi-modal telephone <b>directory</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system,</b> and the system was evaluated from the human-interface point of view.

This paper {{describes}} an accurate and efficient algorithm for very-large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition {{based on an}} HMM-LR algorithm. The HMM-LR algorithm uses a generalized LR parser as a language model and hidden Markov models (HMMs) as phoneme models. To reduce the search space without pruning the correct candidate, we use forward and backward trellis likelihoods, an adjusting window for choosing only the probable part of the trellis for each predicted phoneme, and an algorithm for merging candidates that have the same allophonic phoneme sequences and the same context-free grammar states. Candidates are also merged at the meaning level. This algorithm is applied to a telephone <b>directory</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> that recognizes spontaneous speech containing the names and addresses of more than 70, 000 subscribers (vocabulary size is about 80, 000).

40|$|The {{automated}} <b>directory</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>system</b> (ADAS) {{is traditionally}} formulated as an {{automatic speech recognition}} (ASR) problem. Recently, it has been formulated as a voice search problem, where a spoken utterance is firstly converted into text, {{which in turn is}} used to search for the listing. In this paper, we focus on the design and development of the utterance-to-listing component of ADAS. We show that many theoretical and practical issues need to be resolved when applying the basic idea of voice search to the development of ADAS. We share our experiences in addressing these issues, especially in pre-processing the listing database, generating a high performance LM, and developing efficient, accurate, and robust search algorithms. Field tests of our prototype system indicate that an 81 % task completion rate can be achieved.

40|$|<b>Directory</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>systems</b> are {{amongst the}} most {{challenging}} applications of speech recognition. Today, complete automation of the service fails because of the lacking accuracy of current speech recognizers, which are simply not able to differentiate between hundreds of thousands or even millions of different names occurring in large cities. In this paper, we show that this situation can be remedied by systematically combining all available knowledge sources (last names, first names, street names, partly including their spelled versions) in a statistically optimal way. Especially designed confidence measures for N-best lists are proposed to detect misrecognized turns. Applying these techniques in a hierarchical setup is judged as the enabling step for automating large scale <b>directory</b> <b>assistance.</b> In first experiments, we e. g. are able to service 72 % of the inquiries for a database of 1. 3 million entries with a remaining error rate of only 6 % (or 62 % with an error rate of 2 %). 1...|$|R
40|$|The large-vocabulary name {{recognition}} technique {{is one of}} the challenging tasks in the application of Chinese speech recognition technology. It can be applied on long-list automatic attendant <b>systems</b> and automatic <b>directory</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>systems.</b> A Chinese name has usually two to three characters with each character pronounced as a single syllable. It is a high perplexity task to recognize a word from a long-list of candidates, like more than three hundred thousand unique names in our experiments, given a very short utterance like one to two seconds of speech. Two novel approaches under an interactive framework are proposed in this paper to aid the recognition of a Chinese name: Character Description Recognition (CDR) and Syllable Spelling Recognition (SSR). Together with our robust finite-state recognizer given a graph-structured syllable lexicon for the full names, we achieved a very promising {{name recognition}} success rate, 94. 5 %, in our system-initiative dialogue system. 1...|$|R
