Chris's exit storyline saw him decide to be a full-time father to his child with Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell), and move to New York. When Nate told Chris {{that he did not want}} to move to New York, they decided to end their relationship. Wyatt commented [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>coming.</b> Chris has decided that he wants to go to New York and Nate is staying in Erinsborough."

500|$|Welcoming the deal, {{the deputy}} general {{secretary}} of the Communication Workers Union, Dave Ward said, [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>coming,</b> but this deal delivers on the major issues that postal workers have fought for. There's a balance of pay and operational changes that will help to offset job losses and ensure our members are fairly rewarded for change." [...] Royal Mail's outgoing chief executive, Adam Crozier said that the resolution was [...] "a good deal for our customers as it ensures stability over the next three years," [...] and allowed Royal Mail to proceed with modernisation. On 27 April the Communication Workers Union announced that its members had voted two to one in favour of the deal, thus ending the dispute.|$|E
500|$|Ahead of Challinor's {{first season}} as a Football League player, he {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>coming</b> so I'm going to embrace it and enjoy every minute. I think almost every team I have played for has gone on to reach the League so to finally achieve it is a dream come true but it doesn't end there". He made his first {{appearance}} as a League player in a League Cup first round match away to Doncaster Rovers on 11 August 2012 as an 87th-minute substitute for McLaughlin. York lost 4–2 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 extra time draw, although Challinor was successful in converting his penalty.

500|$|There {{has been}} some {{resistance}} within the astronomical community toward the reclassification. Alan Stern, principal investigator with NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, derided the IAU resolution, stating that [...] "the definition stinks, for technical reasons". Stern contended that, {{by the terms of}} the new definition, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune, all of which share their orbits with asteroids, would be excluded. He argued that all big spherical moons, including the Moon, should likewise be considered planets. He also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Marc W. Buie, then at the Lowell Observatory petitioned against the definition. Others have supported the IAU. Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Eris, said [...] "through this whole crazy circus-like procedure, somehow the right answer was stumbled on. It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>coming.</b> Science is self-correcting eventually, even when strong emotions are involved." ...|$|E

In the song, Kelly addresses the people who doubted his ability to come back after the surgery and the rumors that surrounded him while he was in recovery. Reviews for [...] "Shut Up" [...] were generally positive: Spin (magazine) wrote, [...] "Kelly taking aim at the haters who said [...] "he's washed up, he's lost it." [...] He hasn't.

2500|$|Nick and Sharon {{remained}} {{apart for}} a number of months. However, they worked together in court to legally adopt Cassie as their own. Nick moved back into the family home, Case explained [...] "Neither knew what the other wanted. So, Sharon went to bed and Nick slept on the couch." [...] During this time, they reconnected and eventually got back together, as Nick grew even closer to Cassie as his own daughter. The show's then head-writer at the time Kay Alden, said [...] "This has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>coming</b> for Sharon and Nick [...] For the last several months, there's been a lot of stop-and-go — and mixed messages — between them. But now the feelings they have for each other are definitely clear." [...] Sharon and Nick were awarded custody of Cassie, and Nick adopted Cassie and became her father. Joshua Morrow stated: [...] "Nick has accepted Cassie as his daughter. He loves her as much as he loves Noah. She's an incredible child and Nick is crazy about her". Of their reunion, Case said: [...] "Happiness doesn't just mean lying around in bed saying, 'I love you' everyday {{for the rest of their}} lives. Love expresses itself in other ways. One way is getting over the hurdles of life together. So, I'm sure they will be more hurdles to come." ...|$|E

2500|$|Presidents serve a twelve-month {{term and}} cannot {{normally}} serve two terms in succession. Notable exceptions occurred during World War I and World War II. In 1914, Lord Hawke was appointed President and {{was asked to}} remain in the post till the end of the war. As a result, Hawke was MCC President for five years from 1914 to 1918 inclusive and was succeeded in 1919 by the former Hampshire slow left-arm bowler Henry Forster, who shortly afterwards succeeded to the title of Lord Forster of Lepe. Throughout the war, Lord's was used for military purposes, including training and recreation. Problems frequently arose but, in Wisden's view, Hawke was [...] "the greatest help in giving wise counsel towards their solution". Hawke's tenure was exceeded by that of Stanley Christopherson who was appointed in 1939 and remained in situ for seven years until 1945 before he was succeeded by General Ronald Adam. In his Barclays World of Cricket essay about the MCC Presidency, E. W. Swanton said that [...] "there is no pretence of democracy about it" [...] and commented on how few were untitled up to the Second World War. As he said, membership of the aristocracy was a more important factor than any cricketing prowess. Change has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> <b>coming</b> but in the 21st century there have been MCC Presidents who as players were wholly professional: Tom Graveney, Derek Underwood and Mike Gatting.|$|E

He even scolded me for not having married; and when I tried to coax him out of it, he said it was for my good, and he wanted to see after his business in Peru. I put him in mind how dear granny had begged him to stay at home; but he told me I knew nothing about it, and that he would have gone long ago if I had not been an obstinate girl, and had known how to play my cards. I said something about going home, but that made him more furious than ever. But, after all, it is not fair to tell all about the last few months.
