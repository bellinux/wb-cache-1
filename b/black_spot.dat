5|$|On July 19, 2009, {{an impact}} site was {{discovered}} at approximately 216 degrees longitude in System 2. This impact {{left behind a}} <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> in Jupiter's atmosphere, similar in size to Oval BA. Infrared observation showed a bright spot where the impact took place, meaning the impact warmed up the lower atmosphere in the area near Jupiter's south pole.|$|E
50|$|The {{body color}} is brown or olive to blackish, with round <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> likely. The fins are greyish to blackish; the caudal fin has <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> or <b>black</b> cross bars. Juveniles are brown, with <b>black</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|R

5|$|However, the {{controlled}} access highways on Hamersley's southern and western boundaries physically isolate the suburb from its neighbours and limit southbound exits to just two, Erindale Road and Wanneroo Road. This results in considerable rush hour congestion on {{the stretch of}} Erindale Road between Eglinton Crescent and Reid Highway. In 2004, Main Roads Western Australia provided a grant of $48,000 to the City of Stirling under its <b>Black</b> <b>Spot</b> Programme to improve the traffic flow in this area.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, 2009, exactly 15 {{years after}} the SL9 impacts, a new <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> {{about the size of}} the Pacific Ocean {{appeared}} in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Thermal infrared measurements showed the impact site was warm and spectroscopic analysis detected the production of excess hot ammonia and silica-rich dust in the upper regions of Jupiter's atmosphere. Scientists have concluded that another impact event had occurred, but this time a more compact and strong object, probably a small undiscovered asteroid, was the cause.|$|E
5|$|During 2016, the {{intersection}} with Gosnells Road West was upgraded with longer and extra turning lanes, better cycling and pedestrian facilities, and better street lighting and CCTV {{as part of}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Spot</b> program. This project was funded by the Western Australian State government, and cost $2.4 million. During 2016 and 2017, as part of Main Roads Western Australia's Traffic Congestion Management Program, {{the intersection}} with Kelvin Road was upgraded to improve traffic flow and safety. New and longer turning lanes were added, This project cost $7.5 million and was funded by the Western Australia state government.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{distress}} signal, the TARDIS lands {{aboard a}} 17th-century pirate ship {{stranded in the}} middle of an ocean. The ship's crew have been terrorised by a Siren-like creature (Lily Cole) who marks people with black spots on their palms after they are injured. Her song then lulls victims into a trance, making them want to go to her, which apparently disintegrates them. Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) receives a cut during a tussle with the pirates, and finds a <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> on his hand, but is prevented from succumbing to the song of the Siren by Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and the Doctor (Matt Smith).|$|E
5|$|Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project, and {{was largely}} unguided. It was tasked with {{research and development}} of almost any piece of equipment that might help with the mission outlined in its charter. As a result, few of the programs came to fruition and fewer still left a definitive mark on the conflict. The developments under Shed Light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under Project Gunship (notably under Gunship II and Gunship III). They were fitted with many of the sensors developed under Shed Light, but took on a life all their own. Shed Lightâ€™s most visible programs, <b>Black</b> <b>Spot</b> and Tropic Moon, have largely fallen into obscurity.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) is {{a species of}} longtailed carpet shark, family Hemiscylliidae, found in shallow, tropical waters off Australia and New Guinea (and possibly elsewhere). The common name of this shark comes from the very large, white-margined <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> behind each pectoral fin, which are reminiscent of military epaulettes. A small species usually under 1m (3.3ft) long, the {{epaulette shark}} has a slender body with a short head and broad, paddle-shaped paired fins. The caudal peduncle (to which the tail fin is attached) comprises over half the shark's length. Adults are light brown above, with scattered darker spots and indistinct saddles.|$|E
5000|$|Saperda punctata {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 11 - 18 mm. The head, pronotum and elytra are greenish, with four <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> on pronotum and six <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> on each elytron.|$|R
50|$|The {{head and}} thorax are {{white and the}} abdomen is yellow-orange with a row of <b>black</b> <b>spots.</b> The forewing is white with a {{variable}} pattern of <b>black</b> <b>spots,</b> with some individuals lacking any spots. The hindwing is yellow-orange in males and white in females. Both sexes have 3 or 4 <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> or blotches on the hindwings. The wingspan measures 4.5 to 6.8 cm.|$|R
50|$|This dendronotid nudibranch is pale {{brown with}} <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> on the ceratal tubercles. There are rows of tubercles tipped with <b>black</b> <b>spots</b> {{running across the}} body between the cerata; {{typically}} four tubercles in a row.|$|R
5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} the Causeway had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The Narrows. That bridge was eventually built as the Narrows Bridge. Opened in 1959, the Narrows Bridge alleviated the traffic problems at the Causeway; the Narrows and the Causeway continued {{to be the only}} road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on the Causeway from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into a traffic light controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the Causeway.|$|E
5|$|Surmising the Siren {{is using}} {{water as a}} portal, the Doctor instructs {{everyone}} to seek refuge in the ship's dry magazine. There, they find Toby Avery (Oscar Lloyd), {{the son of the}} ship's captain Henry Avery (Hugh Bonneville), who stowed away on the ship in order to join the crew after his mother died, unaware of his father's illicit deeds. He too has a <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> on his palm due to a fever. In an attempt to escape, the Doctor and Avery board the TARDIS, but find it is acting haphazardly, and are forced to evacuate, and they watch as it dematerializes by itself. After another shipmate is taken by the Siren in a dry room, the Doctor realizes the Siren is using reflection to appear. In response they rid the ship of reflective surfaces, including the ship's stolen treasure.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} and pelvic fins are {{broad and}} rounded and are thickly muscled. The two similarly-sized dorsal fins are placed well {{back on the}} body. The anal fin is low and positioned {{just in front of}} the caudal fin. The caudal fin has only an upper lobe, which contains a prominent ventral notch near the tip and is angled almost horizontally relative to the body. Adult epaulette sharks are beige to brownish above with many widely spaced brown spots and subtle darker bands. There is a very large <b>black</b> <b>spot</b> ringed in white located behind each pectoral fin; this pair of spots are the origin of this shark's common name. Juveniles have alternating light and dark bands over their body and fins, which break up as they mature. Epaulette sharks are typically 7090cm (2735 in) long; the maximum reported length is 107cm (42in).|$|E

5|$|The winter fur is dense, soft, silky and {{relatively}} long. For the northern foxes, the fur is very long, dense and fluffy, but is shorter, sparser and coarser in southern forms. Among northern foxes, the North American varieties generally have the silkiest guard hairs, while most Eurasian red foxes have coarser fur. There are three main colour morphs; red, silver/black and cross (see Mutations). In the typical red morph, their coats are generally bright reddish-rusty with yellowish tints. A stripe of weak, diffuse patterns of many brown-reddish-chestnut hairs occurs along the spine. Two additional stripes pass down the shoulder blades, which, {{together with the}} spinal stripe, form a cross. The lower back is often a mottled silvery colour. The flanks are lighter coloured than the back, while the chin, lower lips, throat and front of the chest are white. The remaining lower {{surface of the body}} is dark, brown or reddish. During lactation, the belly fur of vixens may turn brick red. The upper parts of the limbs are rusty reddish, while the paws are black. The frontal part of the face and upper neck is bright brownish-rusty red, while the upper lips are white. The backs of the ears are black or brownish-reddish, while the inner surface is whitish. The top of the tail is brownish-reddish, but lighter in colour than the back and flanks. The underside of the tail is pale grey with a straw-coloured tint. A <b>black</b> <b>spot,</b> the location of the supracaudal gland, is usually present {{at the base of the}} tail. The tip of the tail is white.|$|E
