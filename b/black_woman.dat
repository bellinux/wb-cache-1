5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a <b>black</b> <b>woman,</b> it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
50|$|Comparatively {{looking at}} gender, race, and sexual orientation, <b>black</b> <b>women</b> same sex-sex couples {{are likely to}} face more {{economic}} disparities than <b>black</b> <b>women</b> in an opposite sex relationship. <b>Black</b> <b>women</b> in same-sex couples earn $42,000 compared to <b>black</b> <b>women</b> in opposite sex relationships who earn $51,000. That is a twenty-one percent increase in income. Economically, <b>black</b> <b>women</b> same-sex couples are also {{less likely to be}} able to afford housing/property together. Approximately fifty percent of <b>black</b> <b>women</b> same-sex couples can afford to buy housing compared to white women same-sex couples who have a seventy-two percent rate in home ownership.|$|R

The {{definition}} of black female sexuality was always defined by an outside group looking in, first by white males and then by white females. Black females must define their own sexuality in order to overcome oppression. She states that this repeated silence has become a notion of [...] "invisibility" [...] to describe black females' lives. Even women with prestige in academia are still under invisibility when they are told what issues they can and cannot lecture about. Hammonds continues to extend the [...] "invisibility" [...] of <b>black</b> <b>women</b> to the field of medicine and science. <b>Black</b> <b>women</b> have been oppressed for so many years that negative stereotypes have been formed about <b>black</b> <b>women</b> and now to <b>black</b> <b>women</b> with AIDS.

5|$|Early August 8, 1840, the Comanches {{surrounded}} the small port of Linnville, Texas, {{which was the}} second largest port in the Republic of Texas at the time, and began pillaging the stores and houses. Linnville, which is now a ghost town, was located 3.5 miles northeast of present-day Port Lavaca. The Comanches reportedly killed three whites, including customs officer Hugh Oran Watts, who had delayed his escape to retrieve a gold watch at his home (reportedly a family heirloom). After killing Watts, the Comanche captured his wife of only three weeks, the former Juliet Constance, and a <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> and child.|$|E
40|$|Although {{there are}} {{multiple}} pathways to successful aging, little is known {{of what it means}} to age successfully among <b>black</b> <b>women.</b> There is a growing body of literature suggesting that <b>black</b> <b>women</b> experience a number of social challenges (sexism and rac-ism) that may present as barriers to aging successfully. Applying aspects of the Strong <b>Black</b> <b>Women</b> ideal, into theoretical concepts of successful aging, may be particularly relevant in understanding which factors impair or promote the ability of <b>black</b> <b>women</b> to age successfully. The Strong <b>Black</b> <b>Women</b> archetype is a culturally salient ideal prescrib-ing that <b>black</b> <b>women</b> render a guise of self-reliance, selflessness, and psychological, emotional, and physical strength. Although this ideal has received considerable atten-tion in the behavioral sciences, it has been largely absent within the gerontology field. Nevertheless, understanding the dynamics of this cultural ideal may enhance our knowl-edge while developing an appreciation of the black woman’s ability to age successfully. Rather than summarize the social, physical, and mental health literature focusing on health outcomes of <b>black</b> <b>women,</b> this conceptual review examines the Strong <b>Black</b> <b>Women</b> archetype and its application to the lived experiences of <b>black</b> <b>women</b> and con...|$|R

Ross moved back to Chicago and led the mathematics department at an experimental school started by Ph.D.s during the Great Depression, People's Junior College, where he also taught physics. Ross became an assistant professor at St. Louis University in 1935 and stayed for about 11 years. In an interview, he said he advocated for a student who became the first <b>black</b> <b>woman</b> in the South to receive a master's degree in mathematics. This exception led the university to admit black students despite the idea's widespread unpopularity. During World War II, Ross served as a research mathematician for the U.S. Navy. He befriended Hungarian mathematician Gábor Szegő while in St. Louis, who recommended Ross for a 1941 Brown University summer school that prepared young scientists to assist in the war, a program Ross attended. He occasionally worked on proximity fuzes for Stromberg-Carlson's laboratory from 1941 to 1945 before accepting a position as head of University of Notre Dame's mathematics department in 1946.
