40|$|Abstract Background The TRPV 4 gene encodes a calcium-permeable ion-channel that {{is widely}} expressed, {{responds}} to many different stimuli and participates in an extraordinarily {{wide range of}} physiologic processes. Autosomal dominant <b>brachyolmia,</b> spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type (SMDK) and metatropic dysplasia (MD) are currently considered three distinct skeletal dysplasias with some shared clinical features, including short stature, platyspondyly, and progressive scoliosis. Recently, TRPV 4 mutations {{have been found in}} patients diagnosed with these skeletal phenotypes. Methods and Results We critically analysed the clinical and radiographic data on 26 subjects from 21 families, all of whom had a clinical diagnosis of one of the conditions described above: 15 with MD; 9 with SMDK; and 2 with <b>brachyolmia.</b> We sequenced TRPV 4 and identified 9 different mutations in 22 patients, 4 previously described, and 5 novel. There were 4 mutation-negative cases: one with MD and one with SMDK, both displaying atypical clinical and radiographic features for these diagnoses; and two with <b>brachyolmia,</b> who had isolated spine changes and no metaphyseal involvement.

40|$|The spondylometaphyseal dysplasias (SMDs) are a {{group of}} short-stature {{disorders}} distinguished by abnormalities in the ver-tebrae and the metaphyses of the tubular bones. SMD Kozlowski type (SMDK) is a well-defined autosomal-dominant SMD characterized by significant scoliosis and mild metaphyseal abnormalities in the pelvis. The vertebrae exhibit platyspondyly and overfaced pedicles similar to autosomal-dominant <b>brachyolmia,</b> which can result from heterozygosity for activating mutations in the gene encoding TRPV 4, a calcium-permeable Ion channel. Mutation analysis in six out of six patients with SMDK demonstrated heterozygosity for missense mutations in TRPV 4, and one mutation, predicting a R 594 H substitution, was recurrent in four patients. Similar to autosomal-dominant <b>brachyolmia,</b> the mutations altered basal calcium channel activity in vitro. Metatropic dysplasia is another SMD that has been proposed to have both clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Patients with the nonlethal form of metatropic dysplasia present with a progressive scoliosis, widespread metaphyseal involvement of the appendicular skeleton, and carpal ossification delay. Because of some similar radiographic features between SMDK and metatropic dysplasia, 'FRPV 4 was tested as a disease gene for nonlethal metatropic dysplasia. In two sporadic cases, heterozygosity for de novo missense mutations in TRPV 4 was found. The findings demonstrate that mutations in TRPV 4 produce a phenotypic spectrum of skeletal dysplasias from the mild autosomal-dominant <b>brachyolmia</b> to SMDK to autosomal-dominant metatropic dysplasia, suggesting that these disorders should be grouped into a new bone dysplasia family. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 channel, TRPV 4, is a Ca(2 +) and Mg(2 +) {{permeable}} non-selective cation channel {{involved in}} many different cellular functions. It is activated {{by a variety of}} physical and chemical stimuli, including heat, mechano-stimuli, endogenous substances such as arachidonic acid and its cytochrome P 450 -derived metabolites (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids), endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol), as well as synthetic alpha-phorbol derivatives. Recently, TRPV 4 has been characterized as an important player modulating osteoclast differentiation in bone remodelling and as a urothelial mechanosensor that controls normal voiding. Several TRPV 4 gain-of-function mutations are shown to cause autosomal-dominant bone dysplasias such as <b>brachyolmia</b> and Koszlowski disease. In this review we comprehensively describe the structural, biophysical and (patho) physiological properties of the TRPV 4 channel and we summarize the current knowledge about the role of TRPV 4 in the pathogenesis of several diseases. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The brachyolmias {{constitute}} a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal dysplasias {{characterized by a}} short trunk, scoliosis and mild short stature(1). Here, we identify a locus for an autosomal dominant form of <b>brachyolmia</b> on chromosome 12 q 24. 1 - 12 q 24. 2. Among the genes in the genetic interval, we selected TRPV 4, which encodes a calcium permeable cation channel of the transient receptor potential (TRP) vanilloid family, as a candidate gene because of its cartilage-selective gene expression pattern. In two families with the phenotype, we identified point mutations in TRPV 4 that encoded R 616 Q and V 620 I substitutions, respectively. Patch clamp studies of transfected HEK cells showed that both mutations resulted in a dramatic gain of function characterized by increased constitutive activity and elevated channel activation by either mechano-stimulation or agonist stimulation by arachidonic acid or the TRPV 4 -specific agonist 4 alpha-phorbol 12, 13 -didecanoate (4 alpha PDD). This study thus defines a previously unknown mechanism, activation of a calcium-permeable TRP ion channel, in skeletal dysplasia pathogenesis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dominant {{mutations}} in the receptor calcium channel gene TRPV 4 {{have been associated}} with a family of skeletal dysplasias (metatropic dysplasia, pseudo-Morquio type 2, spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type, <b>brachyolmia,</b> and familial digital arthropathy) as well as with dominantly inherited neuropathies (hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy 2 C, scapuloperoneal spinal muscular atrophy, and congenital distal spinal muscular atrophy). While there is phenotypic overlap between the various members of each group, the two groups were considered to be totally separate with the former being strictly a structural skeletal condition and the latter group being confined to the peripheral nervous system. We report here on fetal akinesia as the presenting feature of severe metatropic dysplasia, suggesting that certain TRPV 4 mutations can cause both a skeletal and a neuropathic phenotype. Three cases were detected on prenatal ultrasound because of absent movements in the second trimester. Case 4 presented with multiple joint contractures and absent limb movements at birth and was diagnosed with "fetal akinesia syndrome". Post-interruption and post-natal X-rays showed typical features of metatropic dysplasia in all four. Sequencing of the TRPV 4 gene confirmed the presence of de novo heterozygous mutations predicting G 78 W (Case 1), T 740 I (Cases 2 and 3), and K 276 E (Case 4). Although some degree of restriction of movements is not uncommon in fetuses with skeletal dysplasia, akinesia as leading sign is unusual and suggests that certain TRPV 4 mutations produce both chondrodysplasia and a peripheral neuropathy resulting in a severe "overlap" phenotype. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dominant {{mutations}} in the TRPV 4 gene {{result in a}} bone dysplasia family and form a continuous phenotypic spectrum that includes, in decreasing severity, lethal, and nonlethal metatropic dysplasia (MD), spondylometaphyseal dysplasia Kozlowski type (SMDK), and autosomal dominant <b>brachyolmia.</b> Several rare variant phenotypes that have some overlap but deviate in some ways from the general pattern have also been described. The known variant phenotypes are spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia Maroteaux type (Pseudo-Morquio type 2), parastremmatic dysplasia, and familial digital arthropathy with brachydactyly. Interestingly, different TRPV 4 mutations {{have been associated with}} dominantly inherited neurologic disorders such as congenital spinal muscular atrophy and hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Finally, a small number of patients have been identified in whom a TRPV 4 mutation results in a phenotype combining skeletal dysplasia with peripheral neuropathy. The TRPV 4 gene encodes a regulated calcium channel implicated in multiple and diverse cellular processes. Over 50 different TRPV 4 mutations have been reported, with two codons appearing to be mutational hot spots: P 799 in exon 15, mostly associated with MD, and R 594 in exon 11, associated with SMDK. While most pathogenic mutations tested so far result in activation of the calcium channel in vitro, the mechanisms through which TRPV 4 activation results in skeletal dysplasia and/or peripheral neuropathy remain unclear and the genotype-phenotype correlations in this group of disorders remains somewhat mysterious. Since the phenotypic expression of most mutations seems to be relatively constant, careful clinical and radiographic assessment is useful in directing molecular analysis. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Background Mutations in TRPV 4, a {{gene that}} encodes a Ca 2 + {{permeable}} non-selective cation channel, have recently been found in a spectrum of skeletal dysplasias that includes <b>brachyolmia,</b> spondylometaphyseal dysplasia, Kozlowski type (SMDK) and metatropic dysplasia (MD). Only a total of seven missense mutations were detected, however. The full spectrum of TRPV 4 mutations and their phenotypes remained unclear. Objectives and methods To examine TRPV 4 mutation spectrum and phenotype-genotype association, we searched for TRPV 4 mutations by PCR-direct sequencing from genomic DNA in 22 MD and 20 SMDK probands. Results TRPV 4 mutations were found {{in all but one}} MD subject. In total, 19 different heterozygous mutations were identified in 41 subjects; two were recurrent and 17 were novel. In MD, a recurrent P 799 L mutation was identified in nine subjects, as well as 10 novel mutations including F 471 del, the first deletion mutation of TRPV 4. In SMDK, a recurrent R 594 H mutation was identified in 12 subjects and seven novel mutations. An association between the position of mutations and the disease phenotype was also observed. Thus, P 799 in exon 15 is a hot codon for MD mutations, as four different amino acid substitutions have been observed at this codon; while R 594 in exon 11 is a hotspot for SMDK mutations. Conclusion The TRPV 4 mutation spectrum in MD and SMDK, which showed genotype-phenotype correlation and potential functional significance of mutations that are non-randomly distributed over the gene, was presented in this study. The results would help diagnostic laboratories establish efficient screening strategies for genetic diagnosis of the TRPV 4 dysplasia family disease...|$|E
