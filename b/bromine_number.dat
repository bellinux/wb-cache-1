50|$|The <b>Bromine</b> <b>Number</b> {{is useful}} {{as a measure of}} {{aliphatic}} unsaturation in gasoline samples. The California ARB, in its Motor Vehicle Fuels Compliance Assistance Program, indicated that every unit of <b>Bromine</b> <b>Number</b> is equivalent to twice the percentage point of olefin content in gasoline. So, a gasoline with <b>Bromine</b> <b>Number</b> 30 would have an olefin content of not more than 15 vol%. One refinery compiled a year's worth of data on <b>Bromine</b> <b>Number</b> and the corresponding olefin content of gasoline. The data showed that the <b>Bromine</b> <b>Number</b> of gasoline is about 2.4 times the olefin content. A gasoline with <b>Bromine</b> <b>Number</b> of 30 would then have an olefin content of about 12.5 percent by volume, which is slightly lower than ARB's assumption, but still is higher than the CaRFG maximum limit of 10 percent by volume.|$|E

Experiments of simulatedwaste polymers thermal cracking in a batch reactor were carried out. Thermal cracking wasrealised at the temperature 450 °C. The principal process products, gaseous and liquid hydrocarbonfractions are similar to the refinery cracking products. Liquid cracking products are unstable due to the olefins content and their chemical composition andproperties strongly depend on the applied feed composition.

According to XRD, TPR, and BET data, the presence of nickel oxide {{did not seem to}} damage the crystalline framework of the catalytic supports. Hydrocracking experiments were carried out in a stirred autoclave reactor at 300 degrees C for 120 min under 2. 0 MPa of hydrogen. The results suggested the existence of a balance between the acid and metal function over bifunctional catalysts, which affects hydrogenation and hydroisomerization of thermal cracking waxes. Hydrocracking reactions took place extensively over mixture of Ni/HBeta and ZSM- 5, leading toward higher fractions of gases (30. 2 %) and diesel (23. 5 %). The higher fractions of gasoline (33. 5 %) and lube base oil (19. 0 %) were obtained over mixture of Ni/HSAPO- 11 and ZSM- 5.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the effect of <b>bromine</b> atoms <b>number</b> present in two tested substances derivatives of 2 -furylethylene on cell proliferation. The substances carrying one or two Br atoms were coded as MA and G 1 respectively. The neutral red uptake (NRU) assay and mitotic index (MI) were used for this purpose. The presence of two bromine atoms on the molecule of G 1 inhibited markedly the cytotoxicity of this composite. For CHO cell line, the IC 50 values were 256. 6 µM for G 1 and 134. 5 µM for MA; whereas in SK MEL- 3 (human melanoma) cell line, the IC 50 were 413. 4 µM and 264. 1 µM for G 1 and MA respectively. The IC 50 values obtained in both cell lines were higher than 100 µM and showed no specificity for tumoral cells.

40|$|The phase-vanishing (PV) {{method is}} based on {{spontaneous}} reaction controlled by diffusion of reagents into fluorous media, such as perfluorohexanes (FC- 72) and polyperfluoroethers. Thus, the original PV reaction utilizes a triphasic test tube method composed of a bottom reagent phase, a middle fluorous phase, and a top substrate phase. In such a triphasic system, the fluorous phase acts as a liquid membrane to transport the bottom reagents to the top organic phase containing substrates. In the end, the bottom layer disappears and two phases remain. Since the first demonstration of the PV method by bromination of alkenes with molecular <b>bromine,</b> a <b>number</b> of applications have been developed thus far. These include halogenation of alcohols with SOBr 2 and PBr 3, demethylation of methoxyarenes with BBr 3, cyclopropanation of alkenes by CH 2 I 2 -AlEt 3, and Friedel-Crafts acylation of aromatic compounds with SnCl 4. A fluorous triphasic U-tube method is effective for chlorination of alcohols based on lighter (less dense) reagents such as SOCl 2 and PCl 3. A system using a solution containing reagents as a bottom phase is useful for oxidation with m-CPBA, which may {{be defined as a}} new category for the "extractive PV" method. Recent advances include a " quadraphasic" PV method, in which an aqueous "scavenger" phase is added to the original triphasic PV method to remove acidic by-products. © 2008 The Japan Chemical Journal Forum and Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of olefinic content in conversion {{processes such as}} the etherification of olefins in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) gasoline is essentially required. Gas chromatography (GC) is the well-established method for the quantitative analysis of olefins in etherification processes. The current state-of-the-art GC methods employing highly specific long single capillary columns such as Petrocol-DH are being used {{for the analysis of}} gasoline-range hydrocarbons. However, the method needs many standard reference samples of respective components in a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, which limits the scope of the analytical method. The alternative approach followed by this investigation is based on the reactive method of the analysis of olefins in FCC light gasoline by subjecting them to hydrogenation and estimating the olefinic content by GC comparing the gas chromatograms of the original feed and hydrogenated product using a Petrocol-DH column. A decrease in the quantity and disappearances of the peaks are assumed as olefins, and their number and total composition is calculated. In this study the <b>bromine</b> <b>number</b> method is used to estimate the olefinic content for a comparison of results with the adopted proposed methodology. The adopted methodology quantitates olefinic content in FCC light gasoline, which is comparable with reported literature values and the <b>bromine</b> <b>number</b> method. With the availability of standard reference samples of some important major reactive olefins, the adopted methodology can also give component-wise analysis as well as total olefinic content in a single step in processes such as etherification. The methodology can be also useful in reactions in which the conversion of total olefinic content is needed such as hydration, esterification, and alkylation of olefins in a complex mixture of hydrocarbons apart from the etherification of olefins in FCC gasoline...|$|E
40|$|Indonesia {{possesses}} {{great potential}} for developing renewable resources as alternative fuels. For example, turpentine oil obtained from Pinus merkusii, which contains mostly monoterpene hydrocarbons (C 10 H 16). The oil is highly suitable to be processed for biokerosene or even jet biofuel. It consists of hydrocarbons {{within the range of}} C 10 to C 15. However, it contains insufficient H and thus needs to be upgraded. In the present work, electrochemical hydrogenation was used for upgrading. In the electrochemical cell, stainless steel, silver, and carbon were used alternately for the anode, while copper and silver Raschig rings were used for the cathode. An electrolyte solution of cuprous ammonium formate was utilized not only as a source of H but also to draw the unsaturated hydrocarbons into the aqueous phase. The electrolyte : oil ratio (up to 2 : 1), electrolyte concentration (between 0. 4 and 2 M) and reaction time were varied throughout the experiments. The <b>bromine</b> <b>number</b> (unsaturation level) of the turpentine oil, which was initially 1, 86 (mole Br 2 /mole), was lowered significantly to 0. 69 - 0. 90.

40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{have been}} shown to disrupt thyroid hormone (TH) functions on experimental animals, and one of the proposed disruption mechanisms is the competitive binding of PBDE metabolites to TH transport proteins. In this report, a nonradioactive, site-specific fluorescein-thyroxine (F-T 4) conjugate was designed and synthesized as a fluorescence probe to study the binding interaction of hydroxylated PBDEs to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and transthyretin (TTR), two major TH transport proteins in human plasma. Compared with free F-T 4, the fluorescence intensity of TTR-bound conjugate was enhanced by as much as 2 -fold, and the fluorescence polarization value of TBG-bound conjugate increased by more than 20 -fold. These changes provide signal modulation mechanisms for F-T 4 as a fluorescence probe. Based on fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime measurements, the fluorescence intensity enhancement was likely due to the elimination of intramolecular fluorescence quenching of fluorescein by T 4 after F-T 4 was bound to TTR. In circular dichroism and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements, F-T 4 induced similar spectroscopic changes of the proteins as T 4 did, suggesting that F-T 4 bound to the proteins at the T 4 binding site. By using F-T 4 as the fluorescence probe in competitive binding assays, 11 OH-PBDEs with different levels of bromination and different hydroxylatior, positions were assessed for their binding affinity with TBG and TTR, respectively. The results indicate that the binding affinity generally increased with <b>bromine</b> <b>number</b> and OH position also played an important role. 3 -OH-BDE- 47 and 3 '-OH-BDE- 154 bound to TTR and TBG even stronger, respectively, than T 4. With rising environmental level and high bioaccumulation capability, PBDEs have the potential to disrupt thyroid homeostasis by competitive binding with TH transport proteins...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the accumulation of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in the brain compared with that in other tissues among different vertebrates. We collected mice, chickens, ducks, frogs, and fish from an e-waste recycling region in Taizhou, China, and measured PBDE concentrations in brain, liver and muscle tissues. The levels of PBDE in the tissues of mice, chickens, ducks, frogs and fish ranged 0. 45 - 206, 0. 06 - 18. 8, 1. 83 - 112, 2. 75 - 108, and 0. 02 - 32. 0 ng/g wet weight, respectively. Preferential distribution in the liver and muscle relative to the brain was observed for PBDEs in mice, chickens, ducks and frogs. However, a high retention in the brain compared to the liver and muscle was observed in fish. Comparison of the brain/liver concentration (B/L) ratios revealed differences in PBDEs accumulation in the brain among these vertebrates. PBDEs accumulation in the brain was greatest in fish, followed by frogs, while the lowest accumulation occurred in the brains of mammals and birds. The findings apparently coincided with {{the evolution of the}} blood-brain barrier (BBB) across vertebrates, i. e. the BBB of fish might be less efficient than those of mammals, birds and amphibian. Low brominated congeners (such as BDE- 28, BDE- 47 and BDE- 99) were predominant in the brains of investigated vertebrates, whereas BDE- 209 was most abundant in liver and muscle tissues of mice, chickens and ducks. Significant differences in B/L ratios among PBDE congeners were found in both mice and chickens (p < 0. 05). Particularly in mice, the B/L ratios of PBDE congeners presented a declining trend with increased <b>bromine</b> <b>number.</b> Our findings suggested that low brominated congeners might have a higher capacity to penetrate the BBB and accumulate in the brain, whereas high brominated congeners such as BDE- 209 might have less potency to pass through the barrier. Further experimental studies are needed to confirm our findings. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
