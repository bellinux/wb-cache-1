40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{two studies}} {{of the effects of}} flow control devices on the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a high speed Coanda flow that is formed when a supersonic jet issues from a radial nozzle and adheres to a tulip-shaped body of revolution. Shadowgraphy and other flow-visualization techniques are used to reveal the various features of the complex flow fields. The acoustic characteristics are obtained from far- and near-field measurements with an array of microphones in an anechoic chamber. First the effects of incorporating a step between the annular exit slot and the Coanda surface are investigated. The step is incorporated to ensure that the <b>breakaway</b> <b>pressure</b> is raised to a level well above the maximum operating pressure. It substantially increases the complexity of the flow field and acoustic characteristics. In particular, it promotes the generation of two groups of discrete tones. A theoretical model based on a self-generated feedback loop is proposed to explain how these tones are generated. The second study investigates the effects of replacing the annular exit slot with a saw-toothed one with the ain of eliminating the discrete tones and thereby substantially reducing the level of noise generated.

40|$|Abstract. The main {{function}} of a fuel injector nozzle is to break fuels into droplets, form the spray pattern, and propel the droplets into a combustion chamber. The amount of spray volume at a given operating pressure, the travel speed, and spacing between the jets of fuel can also {{be determined by the}} nozzle. In fuel injection, the smallest possible droplet size is desired for the most flow. This work presents an opportunity to use the Schlieren arrangement as a visualization method to view the flow of fuel from a three-hole fuel injector nozzle which cannot be seen by the naked eye. The jet flow of diesel Fuel was investigated by Schlieren photography. A test rig was designed and constructed to accommodate the nozzle; optical mirrors were arranged according to Schlieren specifications in order to allow the jet to be photographed. The <b>breakaway</b> <b>pressure</b> of the nozzle was varied between 60 bar to 80 bar. Each hole of the nozzle is 0. 26 mm in diameter and 120 ° apart; the third jet could not be seen from the images because the camera took x-y dimension images. The spray pattern observed from the two dimensional images of the jets developed were seen to be well dispersed. Su et al [3] found that emissions could be reduced in diesel engines if the injector nozzle produces smaller and more dispersed droplets...|$|E

40|$|Why do {{highly trained}} athletes {{often fail to}} perform up to their {{potential}} under stressful conditions? Baumeister (1984) suggested that individuals who undergo self‐consciousness training would not suffer performance decrements as often as {{those who do not}} undergo self‐consciousness training. Consequently, {{the purpose of the present}} study was to ascertain whether players who undergo self‐consciousness training adapt to pressure situations better than players who do not undergo training. Choking in front of a soccer goal was examined in two skill levels (low‐skill and high‐skill players), two task complexities (soccer penalty kicks and <b>breakaways),</b> two <b>pressure</b> situations (low‐ and high‐pressure), and three experimental conditions (single task, dual task, self‐consciousness). Choking occurred in the simple task of penalty kicks, but not the complex task of breakaways. Furthermore, the single‐task (control group) and the dual‐task treatments experienced performance decrements under high‐pressure conditions, while participants who underwent self‐consciousness training improved performance under high‐pressure situations. These findings are consistent with the explicit monitoring hypothesis of choking under pressure and the current research in sport and exercise psychology (Baumeister, 1984; Beilock 2 ̆ 6 Carr, 2001; Beilock, Carr, MacMahon, 2 ̆ 6 Starkes, 2002). The findings offer a method of preventing or minimizing the vulnerability of chocking under pressure...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} demands in hydropower and other industries today stems from the emphasis on preserving the environment. Usage of mineral and synthetic oils in sliding bearings of hydropower plants raises concerns about the environmental impact of these lubricants in case of spillage into downstream water. These concerns have led to attempts in using water as lubricant and the concept of oil-free systems in hydropower generation. Realization of this concept however poses many challenges including the choice of bearing materials and this necessitated research pertaining to the tribological behaviour of polymers in lubricated conditions. In this work, several studies have been carried out in order to obtain an insight into polymers’ tribological performance and associated mechanisms in the presence of lubricants. Extensive tribological studies on several unfilled polymers in water lubricated contacts demonstrated the superior wear resistance of UHMWPE. It was also found that the frictional behaviour of the unfilled polymers was influenced by their water contact angle and relative energy difference with regard to water. Studies on the effect of counter surface roughness characteristics on tribological behaviour of polymeric materials revealed their significant influence on friction and wear behaviour of polymer-metal contacts. Using a small scale journal bearing configuration, it was found that dynamic friction of polymer bearings can be significantly reduced using a shaft of reduced surface roughness. However, depending on the bearing material, this can adversely affect the material’s breakaway frictional response and thereby increase the torque required for machine start-up; a critical issue in applications such as pumped storage hydropower plants. Further studies using a pin on plate configuration revealed that variations in surface roughness characteristics of the metallic counter surfaces can significantly alter the wear resistance of the polymeric materials which cannot modify the topography of the counter surfaces in a tribological contact. Investigations regarding the influence of incorporation of various micro/nano carbon based fillers/reinforcements in the polymer matrix revealed their great potential for enhancing the friction and wear behaviour of the polymer composites. However these effects {{have been found to be}} strongly influenced by presence/absence of other reinforcements in the polymer matrix and/or by alterations in the operating conditions. Application of polymers as bearing lining materials also exhibits the potential of enhancing the performance of oil lubricated bearings. Therefore a part of this work was aimed at investigating the tribological characteristics of several polytetrafluoroethylene based materials at the onset of sliding (<b>breakaway)</b> at various <b>pressures</b> and temperatures. The results of this study showed dramatic reduction in breakaway friction using PTFE based materials in comparison to the conventional Babbitt (white metal) bearing lining material utilized in oil-lubricated sliding bearings of hydropower plants.
