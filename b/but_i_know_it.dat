500|$|He {{conceived}} it in 2001 and NBC ordered 13 episodes {{the following}} year; the show's original pilot used a single-camera setup but NBC executives {{felt it would}} have more appeal as a multiple-camera setup, so it was re-shot. Appel noted of the show: [...] "There's a sense sometimes in Hollywood that writers and producers who come from animated shows maybe have something to prove to justify their credibility as live-action show-runners or writers. My own experience has been fortunate. I haven't felt that. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> exists." [...] The show was not acclaimed: Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said it was [...] "too cartoonish to work." [...] Appel then wrote {{and worked as a}} co-executive producer on The Bernie Mac Show and Kitchen Confidential, and appeared as Josh in the 2004 film I â™¥ Huckabees.|$|E
500|$|Al Kooper {{recalled}} {{that both the}} album title, Blonde on Blonde, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. [...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> was all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Even Flow" [...] {{features}} lyrics {{written by}} vocalist Eddie Vedder and music written by guitarist Stone Gossard. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "I {{know it was}} a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it." [...] Drummer Dave Krusen said, [...] "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." [...] He added that [...] "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> felt better." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. I swear to God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was not {{kindness}} {{that prompted}} the offer. It is not true that suffering ennobles the character; happiness does that sometimes, but suffering, for the most part, makes men petty and vindictive.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no! <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it,</b> all the same. It was {{not such}} a very wicked thing, as those things go. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> liked your not liking it. Will you let me say {{something}} to you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Stairway to Heaven" [...] {{is often}} rated among the {{greatest}} rock songs of all time. According to music journalist Stephen Davis, although {{the song was}} released in 1971, it took until 1973 before the song's popularity ascended to truly [...] "anthemic" [...] status. As Page himself recalled, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was good, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>it</b> {{was going to be}} almost like an anthem ... <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>it</b> was the gem of the album, sure." ...|$|R
