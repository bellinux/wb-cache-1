5000|$|Although the {{relative}} motion {{at this stage}} is the greatest, {{the surface of the}} water remains flat, indicating that the parts of the water have no tendency to recede from the axis of relative motion, despite proximity to the pail. Eventually, as the cord continues to unwind, {{the surface of the water}} assumes a concave shape as it acquires the motion of the <b>bucket</b> <b>spinning</b> relative to the experimenter. This concave shape shows that the water is rotating, despite the fact that the water is at rest relative to the pail. In other words, it is not {{the relative}} motion of the pail and water that causes concavity of the water, contrary to the idea that motions can only be relative, and that there is no absolute motion. (This situation would correspond to diagram D.) Possibly the concavity of the water shows rotation relative to something else: say absolute space? Newton says: [...] "One can find out and measure the true and absolute circular motion of the water".|$|E

In 1870 the elaborate Victorian and Shaker architectural Ministry shop {{was built to}} house the community's religious leaders. To support itself, the community made brooms, <b>buckets,</b> <b>spinning</b> wheels, tubs, dry measures and shirts. It also made and sold applesauce, maple syrup, herbs, medicines and seeds.|$|R
50|$|Newton took {{space to}} be more than {{relations}} between material objects and based his position on observation and experimentation. For a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion, in which the object travels with constant velocity, and non-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates forces, it must be absolute. He used the example of water in a <b>spinning</b> <b>bucket</b> to demonstrate his argument. Water in a bucket is hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the <b>bucket</b> continues to <b>spin,</b> {{the surface of the water}} becomes concave. If the <b>bucket's</b> <b>spinning</b> is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water. Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself. For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter.|$|R
5000|$|For example, if a water <b>bucket</b> is <b>spun</b> at {{constant}} {{angular speed}} [...] about its vertical axis, {{the water will}} eventually rotate in rigid-body fashion. The particles will then move along circles, with velocity [...] equal to [...] [...] In that case, the free {{surface of the water}} will assume a parabolic shape.|$|R

This prototyping project surfaced from an expressed need of one bagoong processor from Santa, Ilocos Sur. The designed machine has a capacity of 24 liters. It has several parts: a) a perforated cylindrical bucket with paddle which carries the fish substrate, b) a one-directional motor, hp capacity, c) the casing which houses the bucket and the motor, and d) its accessories: the electrical controls and faucets. The cylindrical <b>bucket</b> <b>spins</b> at an approximate speed of 1700 rpm. Three (3) models were constructed. To document the comparative performance per model, the ANOVA was done. All three models manifested significant results. From the usual squeezing time ranging from 30 to 45 minutes, then followed by another 15 minutes for bottling with the manual method, the firs...|$|R
50|$|In this response, Clarke {{argues for}} the {{necessity}} {{of the existence of}} absolute space to account for phenomena like rotation and acceleration that cannot be accounted for on a purely relationalist account. Clarke argues that since the curvature of the water occurs in the rotating bucket {{as well as in the}} stationary <b>bucket</b> containing <b>spinning</b> water, it can only be explained by stating that the water is rotating in relation to the presence of some third thing—absolute space.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{rotating}} bucket experiment, Newton observed {{the shape of}} the surface of water in a bucket as the <b>bucket</b> was <b>spun</b> on a rope. At first the water is flat, then, as it acquires the same rotation as the bucket, it becomes parabolic. Newton took this change as evidence that one could detect rotation relative to [...] "absolute space" [...] experimentally, in this instance by looking at {{the shape of the}} surface of the water.|$|R

40|$|We {{find that}} {{circular}} kinks {{form on the}} surface of granular material when the axis of rotation is tilted more than the angle of internal friction of the material. Radius of the kinks is measured {{as a function of the}} spinning speed and the tilting angle. Stability consideration of the surface results in an explanation that the kink is a boundary between the inner unstable and outer stable regions. A simple cellular automata model also displays kinks at the stability boundary. Typeset using REVTEX 1 PACS number: 46. 10. +z, 47. 20. Ma, 47. 54. +r, 81. 05. Rm] Granular materials behave differently from any other familiar forms of matter. They possess both solid- and fluid-like nature and exhibit unusual dynamic behaviors, such as segregation, surface waves, heap formation and convection [1 – 5]. The surface of granular material in a <b>spinning</b> <b>bucket</b> is an example of such interesting phenomena.

5000|$|Chapter 2, [...] "The Universe and the Bucket", {{features}} {{space as}} its key point. The question posed by Greene is this: [...] "Is space a human abstraction, {{or is it}} a physical entity?" [...] The key thought experiment is a <b>spinning</b> <b>bucket</b> of water, designed to make one think about what creates the force felt inside the bucket when it is spinning. The ideas of Isaac Newton, Ernst Mach, and Gottfried Leibniz on this thought experiment are discussed in detail.|$|R
50|$|Mach {{suggested}} that thought experiments like the bucket argument are problematic. If {{we were to}} imagine a universe that only contains a bucket, on Newton's account, this bucket could be set to spin relative to absolute space, and the water it contained would form the characteristic concave surface. But {{in the absence of}} anything else in the universe, {{it would be difficult to}} confirm that the <b>bucket</b> was indeed <b>spinning.</b> It seems equally possible that the surface of the water in the bucket would remain flat.|$|R
40|$|The {{surface shape}} of a <b>spinning</b> <b>bucket</b> of {{granular}} material is studied using a continuum model of surface flow developed by Bouchaud et al. and Mehta et al. An experimentally observed central subcritical region is reproduced by the model. The subcritical region occurs when a metastable surface becomes unstable via a nonlinear instability mechanism. The nonlinear instability mechanism destabilizes the surface in large systems while a linear instability mechanism is relevant for smaller systems. The range of angles in which the granular surface is metastable vanishes with increasing system size. Comment: 8 pages with postscript figures, RevTex, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|This device takes {{advantage}} of the centrifugal forces that are generated when a coring bit is rotated, and a granular sample is entered into the bit while it is spinning, making it adhere to the internal wall of the bit, where it compacts itself into the wall of the bit. The bit can be specially designed to increase the effectiveness of regolith capturing while turning and penetrating the subsurface. The bit teeth can be oriented such that they direct the regolith toward the bit axis during the rotation of the bit. The bit can be designed with an internal flute that directs the regolith upward inside the bit. The use of both the teeth and flute can be implemented in the same bit. The bit can also be designed with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. In another implementation, the bit can be designed to collect regolith primarily from a specific depth. For that implementation, the bit can be designed such that when turning one way, the teeth guide the regolith outward of the bit and when turning in the opposite direction, the teeth will guide the regolith inward into the bit internal section. This mechanism can be implemented with or without an internal flute. The device is based on the use of a spinning coring bit (hollow interior) as a means of retaining granular sample, and the acquisition is done by inserting the bit into the subsurface of a regolith, soil, or powder. To demonstrate the concept, a commercial drill and a coring bit were used. The bit was turned and inserted into the soil that was contained in a <b>bucket.</b> While <b>spinning</b> the bit (at speeds of 600 to 700 RPM), the drill was lifted and the soil was retained inside the bit. To prove this point, the drill was turned horizontally, and the acquired soil was still inside the bit. The basic theory behind the process of retaining unconsolidated mass that can be acquired by the centrifugal forces of the bit is determined by noting that in order to stay inside the interior of the bit, the frictional force must be greater than the weight of the sample. The bit can be designed with an internal sleeve to serve as a container for granular samples. This tube-shaped component can be extracted upon completion of the sampling, and the bottom can be capped by placing the bit onto a corklike component. Then, upon removal of the internal tube, the top section can be sealed. The novel features of this device are: center dot A mechanism of acquiring and retaining granular samples using a coring bit without a closed door. center dot An acquisition bit that has internal structure such as a waffle pattern for compartmentalizing or helical internal flute to propel the sample inside the bit and help in acquiring and retaining granular samples. center dot A bit with an internal spiral into which the various particles wedge. center dot A design that provides a method of testing frictional properties of the granular samples and potentially segregating particles based on size and density. A controlled acceleration or deceleration may be used to drop the least-frictional particles or to eventually shear the unconsolidated material near the bit center...|$|R
