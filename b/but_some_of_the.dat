5|$|DisCo built {{a station}} at Lemington, {{in the western}} {{outskirts}} of the city, to provide electricity for a tram line which ran through their supply area, from the City Centre to Throckley. The station was sited amid the derelict buildings of the Tyne Iron Company's ironworks. They had opened in 1797 and closed in 1886. The works were largely demolished, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ironworks' buildings and chimneys still stood unused, and the power station was built amongst them. DisCo opened Lemington Power Station in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In summer, extratropical {{cyclones}} {{are generally}} weak, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems can cause significant floods overland because of torrential rainfall.

5|$|The bed of Fishing Creek {{contains}} red {{and brown}} shale in some places. Other {{parts of the}} watershed lie over gray sandstone or conglomerates. There are numerous deposits of iron ore, limestone and marble in the watershed of Fishing Creek. Most of the rock in the watershed, including the Trimmers Rock Formation and Catskill Formation, is from the Devonian Period, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northernmost tributaries have watersheds on rock from the Mississippian Period, such as the Huntley Mountain Formation and Burgoon sandstone. The creek is a freestone stream although its water is colder than that of most eastern freestone streams.|$|E

It is unclear whether medications that lower urate affect cardiovascular disease risks. This may be partly due to its association with insulin resistance and obesity, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increased risk appears to be independent.|$|E

5|$|Entering the 1922 midterm congressional {{election}} campaign, Harding and the Republicans {{had followed}} through {{on many of}} their campaign promises. <b>But</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fulfilled pledges, like cutting taxes for the well-off, did not appeal to the electorate. The economy had not returned to normalcy, with unemployment at 11percent, and organized labor angry over {{the outcome of the}} strikes. From 303 Republicans elected to the House in 1920, the new 68th Congress would see that party fall to a 221–213 majority. In the Senate, the Republicans lost eight seats, and had 51 of 96 senators in the new Congress, which Harding did not survive to meet.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the more}} seriously damaged homes were of simple construction, with walls made of mud, adobe, or brick packed 40–50cm (16–20in) thick. These {{materials}} are generally more vulnerable to {{the force of the}} earthquake, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditionally constructed homes sustained little or no damage. This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, {{and the quality of the}} materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E
5|$|On the {{question}} of images, Elizabeth's initial reaction was to allow crucifixes and candlesticks and the restoration of roods, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new bishops whom she had elevated protested. In 1560 Edmund Grindal, one of the Marian exiles now made Bishop of London, was allowed to enforce the demolition of rood lofts in London and in 1561 the Queen herself ordered the demolition of all lofts. Thereafter, the determination to prevent any further restoration was evidenced by the more thoroughgoing destruction of roods, vestments, stone altars, dooms, statues and other ornaments. The queen also appointed a new Privy Council, removing many Roman Catholic counsellors by doing so. Under Elizabeth, factionalism in the Council and conflicts at court greatly diminished. The Act of Supremacy was passed without difficulty.|$|E

5|$|Several {{accidents}} occurred which {{threatened the}} station's safety, {{such as the}} glancing collision between Kristall and Soyuz TM-17 during proximity operations in January 1994. The three most alarming incidents occurred during EO-23. The first was on 23 February 1997 during the handover period from EO-22 to EO-23, when a malfunction occurred in the backup Vika system, a chemical oxygen generator later known as solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG). The Vika malfunction led to a fire which burned for around 90 seconds (according to official sources at the TsUP; astronaut Jerry Linenger insists the fire burned for around 14 minutes), and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respirator masks initially worn were broken. Some of the fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of}} the newer modules were immovable.|$|E
5|$|Shōhō {{was quickly}} located again {{that morning and}} sunk. In turn, the Japanese spotted the oiler, , and her escorting destroyer, which were misidentified as a carrier and a light cruiser. A single dive bomber was lost during the {{consequent}} airstrike that sank the destroyer and damaged Neosho badly enough {{that she had to}} be scuttled a few days later. Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their intended target. Alerted by radar, some of the American Combat Air Patrol (CAP) was vectored to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight. The American fighters mauled the Japanese attackers who were forced to call off the attack, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surviving Japanese pilots became confused in the darkness and attempted to verify if the American carriers were their own before being driven off.|$|E
5|$|The Chacoans used clay or clay-sand {{and water}} to make mud mortar. They {{obtained}} most of the material from canyon deposits, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clays may have been collected {{from the base of}} the cliffs. Clay and clay-sand in soils or stream deposits were accessed by digging large pits, then mixing mortar in the pits and carrying the mix to the construction site in baskets. Water is scarce in Chaco Canyon and construction probably took place primarily during the late summer and early fall rainy season, when it was more readily available. Water was also collected from small reservoirs in the slick rock and deep wells in the bed of Chaco Wash.|$|E

5|$|The Limehouse Cut {{would give}} {{direct access to}} the River Thames, {{avoiding}} the tidal Bow Creek. It was expected to open in July 1770, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brickwork collapsed, and had to be repaired before the cut opened on 17 September 1770. It closed again briefly in December, when a bridge collapsed into it, and it was soon decided that it was too narrow, and so was widened to allow barges to pass each other along its complete length. This work was finished on 1 September 1777. The contract for the Hackney Cut was given to Jeremiah Ilsley on 18 January 1768, and a bricklayer called Henry Holland was asked to build two locks on the cut on 23 April 1768. A millwright from Bromley called Mr Cooper was given the job of building Bromley Lock (close to Bow tidal gates). Work progressed quickly, and the cut was opened for traffic on 7 August 1769.|$|E
5|$|The fire, {{caused by}} the {{malfunction}} of a backup solid-fuel oxygen generator (SFOG), burned for, according to various sources, between 90 seconds and 14 minutes, and produced large amounts of toxic smoke that filled the station for around 45 minutes. This forced the crew to don respirators, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respirator masks initially worn were broken. Fire extinguishers mounted {{on the walls of}} the modules were immovable. The fire occurred during a crew rotation, and as such there were six men aboard the station rather than the usual three. Access to one of the docked Soyuz lifeboats was blocked, which would have prevented escape by half of the crew. A similar incident had occurred on an earlier Mir expedition, although in that case the SFOG burned for only a few seconds.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{hypotheses}} for {{the origin}} of the Laplace resonance among Io, Europa, and Ganymede: that it is primordial and has existed {{from the beginning of the}} Solar System; or that it developed after the formation of the Solar System. A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing Io's orbit to expand (due to conservation of momentum) until it encountered the 2:1 resonance with Europa; after that the expansion continued, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angular moment was transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede. Eventually the drift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized and locked in the Laplace resonance.|$|E

5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations about how long it must spend on its lees, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E
5|$|Hassett {{missed the}} next Test with a {{strained}} muscle; {{this led to}} a bureaucratic restriction that hindered his deputy Morris. Having been injured {{on the eve of the}} Test, Hassett’s withdrawal forced the selectors to call in batsman Phil Ridings at late notice, <b>but</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> board members could not be contacted to ratify the decision. This meant that Hassett had to be replaced by a spare bowler who was already in the squad. In Hassett’s absence, Australia’s thin batting line-up collapsed on a damp pitch hostile to batsmen and lost. Returning for the Fourth Test at the MCG, Australia’s batsmen again struggled; Hassett made 15 and his team conceded a lead of 56 on the first innings. His team was set a second innings target of 260 runs to win. Hassett made 102 but found little support from the other batsmen. When he was dismissed with the score at 8/218, the West Indies appeared set to level the series. However, an unbeaten last wicket partnership of 38 runs between tailenders Doug Ring and Bill Johnston gave Australia an unlikely victory and the series 3–1. It was reported that Hassett, who had just taken a shower after being dismissed, was so mesmerised by the efforts of Ring and Johnston that the watched the final moments of the match naked from the change rooms.|$|E
