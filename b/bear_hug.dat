5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow tried to attack Tatanka before the bell, but Tatanka moved. The two fought back and forth, and Bigelow gained momentum after Tatanka missed a crossbody {{from the top}} turnbuckle. Bigelow used his weight to keep the advantage, sitting on Tatanka and later using a <b>bear</b> <b>hug</b> to wear him down. After the two hit each other with simultaneous crossbodies, Tatanka began a war dance. Bigelow kicked Tatanka {{in the back of}} the head to regain the advantage but missed a moonsault attempt from the top rope, allowing Tatanka to perform a crossbody from the corner and get the victory.|$|E

He wore Boss Man down with a <b>bear</b> <b>hug.</b> Boss Man briefly regained the advantage by suplexing Bigelow but eventually tried to run at Bigelow to crush him {{in the corner of the}} ring.

5|$|The WWF World Heavyweight Championship match came next, as Hulk Hogan {{defended his}} title against Yokozuna. Yokozuna {{controlled}} {{the beginning of}} the match until he ran at Hogan in the corner but missed an avalanche splash. Hogan tried twice to body slam Yokozuna but could not pick him up. Yokozuna performed a <b>bear</b> <b>hug</b> on Hogan and tried to pin him after executing a belly to belly suplex. Hogan kicked Yokozuna in the face three times and knocked him down to the mat. He performed a leg drop, his signature move, on Yokozuna but was unable to pin him. As Hogan prepared to attempt to body slam Yokozuna, manager Harvey Wippleman, disguised as a planted photographer, jumped up onto the edge of the ring. His camera exploded in Hogan's face, which allowed Yokozuna to knock Hogan down and perform a leg drop. Yokozuna pinned Hogan to regain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and performed a Banzai drop on Hogan after the match.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the evening was between Bret Hart and Bam Bam Bigelow to {{determine}} {{the winner of the}} tournament. Bigelow used his strength advantage to control the beginning of the match. He threw Hart out of the ring and focused on injuring Hart's back. Hart escaped from a <b>bear</b> <b>hug</b> and pushed Bigelow into the steel rail at ringside. Bigelow responded by pushing Hart's back into the ring post. Luna Vachon, Bigelow's valet, hit Hart with a chair, which enabled Bigelow to pin Hart and be declared the winner. Referee Earl Hebner came to the ring, however, and explained to Joey Marella, the referee for the match, what had happened. The match was ordered to continue, and Bigelow continued to attack Hart's back. While Bigelow was outside of the ring, Hart performed a flying crossbody by jumping over the top rope and landing on Bigelow. He attempted to perform the Sharpshooter but was unable. As Bigelow ran at Hart {{in the corner of the}} ring, Hart moved out of the way. He climbed onto Bigelow's shoulders and flipped Bigelow forward to pin him with a victory roll.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} for the WWF Championship, as Bret Hart defended the title against Razor Ramon. Ramon got the early {{advantage}} by punching Hart repeatedly but accidentally hit his knee against a turnbuckle while running at Hart. Hart applied a figure-four leglock to apply pressure to Ramon's knee. Ramon escaped the hold and threw Hart against a ring post; he capitalized on this advantage by attacking Hart's back. Ramon threw Hart with a fallaway slam and applied a <b>bear</b> <b>hug.</b> Hart escaped the hold by biting Ramon. He threw Ramon {{out of the ring}} and performed several of his signature moves, including a Russian legsweep and an elbow drop from the second rope. Hart applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, but Ramon grabbed the ropes, which forced the referee to instruct Hart to break the hold. Hart threw Ramon with a belly-to-back suplex, but Ramon responded by attempting to perform the Razor's Edge, his signature move. Hart reversed this into an unsuccessful pin attempt. With both men exhausted, Hart applied the Sharpshooter and won the match by forcing Ramon to submit.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, after a 21 at-bat hitless streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753, {{against the}} Chicago Cubs. He went 3–3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and {{a walk on}} that day. The {{struggling}} last place Giants still lost the game, 9–8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against Florida Marlins pitcher Rick VandenHurk. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12–10. It {{marked the first time}} since he had hit #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382foot(116m) home run against Clay Hensley of the San Diego Padres for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended <b>bear</b> <b>hug</b> after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{match was}} between The Boss and Rick Rude for the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship. The match started with Rude attacking The Boss until The Boss {{performed}} a back body drop {{and a big}} boot.

Page performed a tornado DDT, and both were down. Bret Hart came out, and accidentally hit The Giant with a steel chair. Page performed flying clotheslines until The Giant caught him, and attempted a chokeslam from the top turnbuckle. Page countered it into a Diamond Cutter, and pinned The Giant to win the match.|$|E
25|$|The fifth {{match was}} between The Barbarian (accompanied by Paul Jones) and Superstar Billy Graham. Before the match, Graham and The Barbarian had an arm wrestling match. As Graham {{was about to}} win, Jones {{attacked}} him with his cane, and Graham won the match by disqualification and $10,000. The wrestling match started immediately, with The Barbarian having the advantage, and attacking Graham's head. Graham avoided a diving headbutt, and applied the <b>bear</b> <b>hug.</b> As The Barbarian was about to pass out from the hold, Jones attacked Graham with the cane. Graham won the match by disqualification. After the match, The Barbarian attacked Graham until he was stopped by the referee.|$|E
25|$|Chin taunted Ebens to keep {{fighting}} after they were all thrown out. Ebens and Nitz searched the neighborhood for 20 to 30 minutes and even paid another man $20 to help look for Chin, before finding him at a McDonald's restaurant. Chin tried to escape, but was held by Nitz in a <b>bear</b> <b>hug</b> while Ebens repeatedly bludgeoned Chin {{with a baseball bat}} until Chin's head cracked open. A policeman who witnessed the beating said Ebens was swinging the bat like he was swinging “for a home run”. When rushed to Henry Ford Hospital, he was unconscious and died after four days in a coma on June 23, 1982.|$|E

2500|$|In September, 1949, made man Jimmy Fratianno {{was ordered}} by Jack Dragna {{to set up}} and kill Mickey Cohen loyalist Frank Niccoli. When first meeting Niccoli inside Fratianno's home, Dippolito shook his hand, and then quickly wrapped him in a reverse <b>bear</b> <b>hug.</b> Fratianno and Sam Bruno then placed a rope around Niccoli's neck and choked him to death. Afterwards, Dippolito took the body and buried it with a sack of lime in his large vineyard, which was a popular place to bury dead bodies for the Los Angeles Mafia. This method of killing was termed by the Mafia the [...] "Italian rope trick," [...] and a few years later this move was {{repeated}} on Louis Strauss ("Russian Louie") in April 1953, with Dippolito holding Strauss in a <b>bear</b> <b>hug,</b> while Fratianno and Frank Bompensiero strangled Strauss with a rope.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1891, {{they were}} still in the Pamirs when news reached them the Russians {{intended}} to send troops [...] "to note and report with the Chinese and Afghans". At Bozai Gumbaz in the Little Pamir on 12 August he encountered Cossack soldiers, who forced him to leave the area. This was one of the incidents which provoked the Hunza-Nagar Campaign. The troop of 20 or so soldiers planted a flag on what they anticipated was unclaimed territory, 150 miles south of the Russian border. But to the British the area was Afghan territory. Colonel Yanov, decorated with the Order of St George, approached his camp to announce that the area now belonged to the Tsar. Younghusband learnt that they had raided the Chitral territory; furthermore they had penetrated the Darkot Pass into the Yasin Valley. They were joined by eager intelligence officer Lieutenant Davison; but the British were disabused by Ivanov of British sovereignty: Younghusband remained polite, maintained protocol but hospitable to the big Russian <b>bear</b> <b>hug.</b>|$|E

2500|$|On May 19 at Judgment Day, Hogan {{lost the}} title to The Undertaker. After losing a number one {{contender}} {{match for the}} WWE Undisputed Championship to Triple H on June 6, Hogan began feuding with Kurt Angle resulting in a match between the two at the King of the Ring, which Angle won by submission. On the July 4 episode of SmackDown!, Hogan teamed with Edge to defeat Billy and Chuck and capture the WWE Tag Team Championship for the first time. They celebrated by waving the American flag as the overjoyed audience sang along to Hogan's theme song [...] "Real American". They later dropped the titles to The Un-Americans (Christian and Lance Storm), at Vengeance. In August 2002, Hogan was used in an angle with Brock Lesnar, culminating in a main event singles match, which Lesnar won by submission (the match was called after Hogan became unconscious from a <b>bear</b> <b>hug</b> hold). Lesnar became only the second WWE wrestler to defeat Hogan by submission (after Kurt Angle), {{and the first to}} defeat Hogan by having the match called.

6000|$|On the {{following}} day Alfred and Florence were married. Florence's sister and several friends from El Cajon were present, besides Madeline, Stillwell, and his men. It was Alfred's express wish that Stewart attend the ceremony. Madeline was amused when she noticed the painfully suppressed excitement of the cowboys. For them a wedding {{must have been an}} unusual and impressive event. She began to {{have a better understanding of}} the nature of it when they cast off restraint and pressed forward to kiss the bride. In all her life Madeline had never seen a bride kissed so much and so heartily, nor one so flushed and disheveled and happy. This indeed was a joyful occasion. There was nothing of the [...] "effete East" [...] about Alfred Hammond; he might have been a Westerner all his days. When Madeline managed to get through the press of cowboys to offer her congratulations Alfred gave her a <b>bear</b> <b>hug</b> and a kiss. This appeared to fascinate the cowboys. With shining eyes and faces aglow, with smiling, boyish boldness, they made a rush at Madeline. For one instant her heart leaped to her throat. They looked as if they could most shamelessly kiss and maul her. That little, ugly-faced, soft-eyed, rude, tender-hearted ruffian, Monty Price, was in the lead. He resembled a dragon actuated by sentiment. All at once Madeline's instinctive antagonism to being touched by strange hands or lips battled with a real, warm, and fun-loving desire to let the cowboys work their will with her. But she saw Stewart hanging at the back of the crowd, and something--some fierce, dark expression of pain--amazed her, while it froze her desire to be kind. Then she did not know what change must have come to her face and bearing; but she saw Monty fall back sheepishly and the other cowboys draw aside to let her lead the way into the patio.|$|E

Even on the mat, a Greco-Roman wrestler must still find several ways to turn his opponent's shoulders to the mat for a fall without legs, including techniques known as the bodylock and the gut-wrench.|$|R
