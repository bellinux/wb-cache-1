40|$|Abstract. Steel <b>bifurcated</b> <b>pipe</b> is one {{important}} part of the water diversion buildings in a hydropower station. And its hydraulic characteristics are crucial to reduce the head loss of the bifurcated section. The numerical simulation was carried out with spherical trifurcate branch pipe, shell type trifurcate branch pipe without deflecting plates and shell type trifurcate branch pipe with deflecting plates under a serious of operating conditions based on a case study. After this, the flow conditions and the head losses in the bifurcated sections were analyzed. The shell type trifurcate branch pipe with deflecting plates had the most advantageous hydraulic characteristics of the three schemes. The shell type and the deflecting plates improved the flow condition effectively. The scheme could improve the flow condition and reduce the head loss of the bifurcation section effectively. The results might provide some references to the <b>bifurcated</b> <b>pipe</b> design and operation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{hydropower}} as {{one kind}} of the most economical and environmental energy got the swift and violent development, {{it is important to}} ensure the safety of hydropower station. Combined with practical engineering of Dandong hydropower station, the simulation model of hydropower station is built by three-dimensional finite element software, the <b>bifurcated</b> <b>pipe</b> is analyzed under the static and dynamic loads which are caused by reconstruction of Yueshan railway station. The results show that the stresses and displacements increment are smaller under the loads, the natural frequency of vibration and the frequency of railway bridge are different largely, which does not produce resonance. Therefore, the hydropower meets the safety requirements under different railway bridge loads...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{the theory}} of {{hydraulic}} transients and the method of characteristics (MOC), a mathematic model of the differential surge tank with pressure-reduction orifices (PROs) and overflow weirs for transient calculation is proposed. The numerical model of hydraulic transients is established using the data of a practical hydropower station; and the probable transients are simulated. The results show that successive load rejection is critical for calculating the maximum pressure in spiral case and the maximum rotating speed of runner when the <b>bifurcated</b> <b>pipe</b> is converging under the surge tank in a diversion-type hydropower station; the pressure difference between two sides of breast wall is large during transient conditions, {{and it would be}} more serious when simultaneous load rejections happen after load acceptance; the reasonable arrangement of PROs on breast wall can effectively decrease the pressure difference...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on flows in {{three-dimensional}} curved and <b>bifurcated</b> <b>pipes.</b> Computational fluid dynamics {{is used to}} investigate fluid flow through these pipes. The occurrence of recirculation due to curvature ratio, bend angle, diameter, length, and bifurcation level is studied and the flow resistance is computed. The validity of Deanâ€™s relation for the enhancement of flow resistance in curved pipes is studied numerically...|$|R
25|$|The {{redesign}} {{had led to}} a new designation for the project, P.1040, being applied. The Air Ministry quickly {{issued its}} encouragement for Hawker's development of the project, however, according to aviation author Francis K. Mason, both the Air Ministry and the Admiralty had initially viewed the project with only academic interest. Official interest had also been cooled by the expression of doubts voiced by Rolls-Royce Limited on {{the viability of the}} <b>bifurcated</b> jet <b>pipes</b> that the design used. Like the piston-powered Fury it had been initially derived from, Hawker remained keen to promote the P.1040 to both the RAF and to the Navy. Initially, the P.1040 was intended for the interceptor role, even though a top speed of only 600mph was forecast. Shortly following the aftermath of the war, the Royal Air Force (RAF) decided to not only cancel several large orders for Hawker's piston-powered aircraft, but to also announce that the service would be taking no further interest in the P.1040 proposals.|$|R
2500|$|In December 1944 Hawker refined the {{proposed}} design substantially. The jet exhaust was moved {{from beneath the}} tail and re-designed as two short split-lateral [...] exhausts (which gained the name [...] "trouser legs"), embedded in {{the trailing edge of}} the wing root, which needed a corresponding thickening of the wing root; the air intakes were moved to the wing root leading edge, similar to the contemporary de Havilland Vampire. The shorter unusual <b>bifurcated</b> jet <b>pipe</b> reduced pressure losses in the jet pipe and had the additional advantage of freeing up space in the rear fuselage for fuel tanks, which gave the aircraft [...] a longer range than many other early jets. The absence of fuel tanks also meant a thinner wing could be adopted without the penalty of reduced range; to ease manufacture, the elliptical wingform of the Fury was discarded in favour of a straight tapered wing design. The fuselage fuel tanks, being fore and aft of the engine, also provided for a stable centre of gravity during flight. The tail plane was raised in order to clear the jet exhausts. The Sea Hawk also featured a nosewheel undercarriage arrangement, the first for a Hawker-built aircraft. The aircraft was built to accommodate four 20mm Hispano-Suiza Mk. V cannons.|$|R
