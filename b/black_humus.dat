6000|$|A second {{wall was}} exposed to view for the first time, and an open burrow was seen on its broken summit. By {{separating}} the flints this burrow was traced far down {{in the interior of}} the wall; but as some of the flints cohered firmly, the whole mass was disturbed in pulling down the wall, and the burrow could not be traced to the bottom. The foundations of a third wall, which appeared quite sound, lay at a depth of 4 feet beneath one of the floors, and of course at a considerably greater depth beneath the level of the ground. A large flint was wrenched out of the wall at about a foot from the base, and this required much force, as the mortar was sound; but behind the flint {{in the middle of the}} wall, the mortar was friable, and here there were worm-burrows. Mr. Joyce and my sons were surprised at the blackness of the mortar in this and in several other cases, and at the presence of mould in the interior of the walls. Some may have been placed there by the old builders instead of mortar; but we should remember that worms line their burrows with <b>black</b> <b>humus.</b> Moreover open spaces would almost certainly have been occasionally left between the large irregular flints; and these spaces, we may feel sure, would be filled up by the worms with their castings, as soon as they were able to penetrate the wall. Rain-water, oozing down the burrows would also carry fine dark-coloured particles into every crevice. Mr. Joyce was at first very sceptical about the amount of work which I attributed to worms; but he ends his notes with reference to the last-mentioned wall by saying, [...] "This case caused me more surprise and brought more conviction to me than any other. I should have said, and did say, that it was quite impossible such a wall could have been penetrated by earth-worms." ...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time the {{representation}} of moss litter morphogenetic structure of valley-riverside and streamside spruce forests was determined for the wetland intermountain area of Kuznetsk Alatau. In general, the litter of (green moss) -hypnum spruce forest can be characterized as medium thickness (9 – 17 cm) with high storage of organic matter (77 – 99 t/ha), which differs in neutral environmental conditions pH 6. 8 – 7. 0 and high percentage of ash 11 – 28 %. Formation litter types were identified, which depend on the content of mineral inclusions in organogenic substrate and the degree of its drainage. The differentiation of litter subhorizons was performed, visual diagnostic indicators of fermentative layers were characterized, and additional (indexes) to indicate their specificity were developed. Peat- and peaty-fermentative, humified-fermentative and (<b>black</b> mold <b>humus)</b> -fermentative layers were selected. Peat- and peaty-fermentative layers are characterized by content of platy peat macroaggregates of coarse vegetable composition, the presence of abundant fungal mycelium and soil animals are the primary decomposers – myriopoda, gastropoda mollusks. Humified-fermentative layers are identified by including the newly formed amorphous humus-like substances, nutty-granular structural parts of humus nature and soil animals’ humificators – enchytraeids and earthworms. (<b>Black</b> mold <b>humus)</b> -fermentative layers are diagnosed by indicators with similar humified-fermentative, but differ from them in clay-humus composition of nutty-granular blue-grey parts. The nomenclature and classification of moss litter were developed {{on the basis of their}} diagnostic characteristics of fermentative layers – peat, peaty, reduced peaty, (<b>black</b> mold <b>humus)</b> -peaty, reduced (<b>black</b> mold <b>humus)</b> -peaty. Using the method of discriminant analysis, we revealed that the physical-chemical properties, mainly percentage of ash and decomposition degree of plant substrate, objectively characterizes the uniqueness of moss litter types, their horizons and fermentation layers. These results confirm the feasibility of using morphogenetic structure of litter for the purposes of classification, reflecting the rate of substances turnover, parcel structure and production potential of forest peat soils. The obtained materials are important for the prediction of the transformation of Kuznetsk Alatau forest wetland depressions in connection with global and local climate fluctuations...|$|R

40|$|The role of litter tannins in {{controlling}} soil nitrogen (N) cycling {{may explain the}} competitive ability of Kalmia relative to black spruce (Picea mariana), although {{this has not been}} demonstrated experimentally. Here, the protein-precipitation capacities of purified tannins and leaf extracts from Kalmia and black spruce were compared. The resistance to degradation of tannin protein precipitates from both species were compared by monitoring carbon (C) and N dynamics in humus amended with protein, purified tannins or protein-tannin precipitates. The purity of the precipitates was verified using solid-state C- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra. The ability of mycorrhizal fungi associated with both species to grow on media amended with tannin-protein complexes as the principal N source was also compared. The protein precipitation capacity of Kalmia tannins was superior to those of <b>black</b> spruce. <b>Humus</b> amended with protein increased both mineral and microbial N, whereas humus amended with tannin-protein precipitates increased dissolved organic N. Mycorrhizal fungi associated with Kalmia showed better growth than those associated with black spruce when N was provided as tannin-protein precipitates. These data suggest that Kalmia litter increases the amount of soil N sequestered as tannin-protein complexes, which may improve the competitive ability of Kalmia relative to black spruce by favouring N uptake by mycorrhizas associated with the former...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) was {{the first}} forest tree species {{introduced}} and acclimated from North America to Europe {{at the beginning of}} the 17 th century. Although native of North America, black locust is now naturalized and widely planted throughout the world from temperate to subtropical areas. In Hungary, this species has played a role of great importance in the forest management, covering approximately 23 % of the forested area and providing about 19 % of the annual timber output of the country. Due to the increasing interest in black locust growing in many countries, this study has been compiled with the aim of giving a summary on the basis of research and improvement connected with the species over the past decades. Material and methods: Black locust forests in Hungary have been established on good as well as on medium and poor quality sites. Establishment of black locust stands producing timber of good quality is possible only on sites with adequate moisture and well-aerated and preferably light soils, rich in nutrients and <b>humus.</b> <b>Black</b> locust forests on medium and poor quality sites are utilized for the production of fuel wood, fodder, poles and props, as well as for honey production, soil protection and environmental improvement. Results and conclusion: Hungary has got much experience in black locust growing, as it has been grown for more than 250 years in the country. It is a fast growing, nitrogen fixing, site tolerant, excellent coppicing species with frequent and abundant seed production and relatively high yielding potential. It has a durable and high quality wood, which is used for many purposes. Being aware of the importance of black locust, forest research in Hungary has been engaged in resolving various problems of black locust management for a long time, and a lot of research results have already been implemented in the practice...|$|R
50|$|The lower lying {{ground to}} the south of the hill, has deeper soils with <b>black</b> <b>humus</b> and white sand grains. The flora is {{dominated}} by a tangle of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and bramble (Rubus ulmifolius) and is comparatively rich compared with many of the other islands; probably because St Helen’s has less salt spay due to its comparatively sheltered position being surrounded by other islands. The long history of human settlement has also allowed for the establishment of additional species, either by human introduction, or by grazing which has helped to develop deeper soils on the lower ground. Around the pest house there is rank grassland and scrub with flowering plants such as hemlock (Conium maculatum), hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium) and good populations of balm-leaved figwort (Scrophularia scorodonia) which is spreading in one area. Unusually for a small Scillonian island there is also grey willow (Salix cinerea), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and small reed (Calamagrostis epigejos). In the past the areas around the buildings would have been cultivated or grazed and North reported the island was uncultivated during his visit in 1850.

40|$|Janczyk-Kopikowa (1966) : The {{series of}} the organic deposits, {{developed}} {{in the vicinity of}} Golkow near Warsaw as oil shales and peats, was laid down in a grough valley and now rests on the deposits of the Middle Polish Glaciation (Riss). The organic deposits are overlain by the fluviale deposits of the North Polish Glaciation (Würm). The locality Golkow occurs beyond the extent of the continental glacier of this glaciation. Polen analysis completed by microfloristic examinations allows to determine the age of the organic series that is thought to be Eemian. The pollen diagram from Golkow does not call in question the stratigraphical position of the deposits investigated mainly due to its characteristic features such as minimum content of coniferous trees in the climatic optimum - about 5 %, high percentage of Corylus - 77. 5 % and well developed phase of hornbeam. It may be well compared with other Eemian diagrams from the area of Poland and reveals much similar features. The development of vegetation at Golkow has depended upon the prevailing climate. At first, the cool climate brings about the development of plants having small thermal requirements. Here belong thin, park-like forests with pine and birch (Pinus, Betula) accompanied by the heliophilic plants such as Hippohäe and Ephedra. Improvement of climate that becomes warm and humid provides for development of deciduous forests prevailing in the climatic optimum, of the interglacial. Decrease of temperature causes a repeated change in the type of forest. This latter changes into coniferous forest with prevailing spruce (Picea) and fir (Abies) at the beginning, and then with pine (Pinus) and birch (Betula). During the Eemian Interglacial, the development of plants at Golkow terminates with a new and long-lasting predominance of pine-birch forests. However, such a longevity may be apparent only. Apparent character of this phenomenon is proved by a fact that the pollen spectra of the warm climatic periods have found their reflex in the oil shale that increased considerably slower than the layers off feebly decomposed peat evidencing the existence of cool pine-birch forests from the decline of the Interglacial. The water basin, in which the polen grains were laid down from surrounding plants is characterized by a calm sedimentation as proved by the occurrence of the oil shale. An insignificant water flow left behind some thin sand laminae. The not too deep basin becomes shallower owing to the growing water vegetation, and marshy vegetation. The growing of the plants causes a complete shallowing of the basin and formation of peat bog in situ, as proved by the peat beds occurring in the section. [...] Gadomska (1966) : In the vicinity of Golków a series of organic deposits occurs amounting to 6. 5 - 9. 3 m in thickness, and consisting of oil shales, lacustrine silts and sands, as well as peats and peaty silts. The organic deposits fill up an old, small, but fairly deep lake basin, probably of finger-lake origin. It may be seen to-day as a slight lowering of the relief, filled up with soaked ground, stretching from north to south. On the basis of palaeobotanical examinations the organic deposits considered are of Eemian Interglacial age (Z. Janczyk-Kopikowa, 1063). The lower part of the organic series consists of a compact oil shale horizon, the maximum thickness of which may attain up to 8 m. The oil shales contain particularly in their upper part, numerous intercalations of arenaceous silts, dark grey or black in colour, or of sands mainly of lacustrine provenance. At the top of the oil shales are found peats, up to 2. 5 m in thickness, covered by <b>black,</b> <b>humus</b> silts with numerous plant remains. The Eemian Interglacial deposits are covered by a series of fluviatile sands belonging partly to the Baltic Glaciation (bottom part of the series), partly to the Holocene (top part of the series). The thickness of the sands is 0. 5 - 3. 7 m. Higher up, there are found the Holocene and present-day deposits developed as clayey alluvion, or arenaceous slide rocks, or arenaceous-silty soil...|$|E
40|$|Prior to December of 1991, Ukraine was a {{republic}} of the Soviet Union, where agricultural production and development was controlled and administered through a centrally planned economy. Ukraine {{has since become}} independent and has expressed an interest and desire to move toward a market-oriented economy. Historically, {{they have had a}} comparative advantage in agricultural production due to land endowments of chernozemic (<b>black</b> <b>humus)</b> soils, a temperate climate, and adequate rainfall. Such conditions are typically well suited to the production of various commodities. However, although yields of these commodities were high in Ukraine [...] as compared to other Former Soviet Union (FSU) republics [...] productivity was well below the standards achieved in the Western world. Since improved production opportunities exist in Ukraine, several countries have taken a keen interest in the growth possibilities in this republic. Should Ukraine remove distortions and create a market environment to stimulate production and trade, then there is the potential for Ukraine to become an active participant in the world trade of agricultural commodities. The model employed in determining whether Ukraine has approached a free market environment, was a comparison of financial and economic prices - where financial prices are the actual prices producers receive for the sale of agricultural outputs and economic prices are the prices producers receive in a free market. A free market is one without distortions. In economic terms, distortions refer to taxes or subsidies that artificially decrease or increase the price of a commodity. If Ukraine operated in a free market environment, financial prices would equal economic prices. However, where distortions exist, through subsidies and taxation, then the price that producers actually receive, the financial price, will not equal the economic price. Two hypotheses will be tested to validate indicate if Ukraine is making the transition to an open market economy. They are as follows: Hypothesis One: that Ukraine has a comparative advantage in the production of oilseeds relative to cereal production; and Hypothesis Two: that Ukraine has a comparative advantage in the production of pulse crops relative to cereal production. Following this, three ratio calculations are used to measure the government's efficiency to create an environment for an open agricultural economy. These ratios include: the Nominal Protection Coefficient, Effective Rate of Protection, and Producer Subsidy Equivalent which are used to calculate the efficiency of government policy and evaluate the direct benefit to producers of protectionist government. The results of the analysis revealed the following. In 1989, financial and economic prices diverged significantly from one another. This result is to be expected, since in 1989, agriculture operated under a command economy. By 1993, however, these numbers converged such that financial prices did not equal economic prices. In addition, in 1993, although cereals, oilseeds, and pulse crops were profitable, economic budgets indicated a comparative advantage in the production of pulse crops and winter wheat. For this reason, hypothesis two could not be rejected. Failure to reject the hypothesis indicates market distortions inhibit the production of the commodity with a comparative advantage. Though oilseed production provided positive returns in 1993, it did not retain a comparative advantage over most cereals and thus, hypothesis one needed to be rejected. Rejecting the hypothesis indicates market distortions are not evident or do not inhibit the production of the commodity with a comparative advantage. The financial and economic analysis also revealed that winter and spring wheat were both financially and economically feasible to produce in 1993. Due to the subsidization of cereals and net taxation of oilseeds and pulse crops, production patterns appeared to be altered by, producers to their financial benefit. In addition, the analysis revealed that in 1993, Ukraine had a greater social benefit to produce wheat and pulse crops other commodities reviewed. When the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) subsidy was removed from winter and spring wheat in 1989 and 1993, the profitability of wheat production became more evident. The net margin per hectare for both commodities increased significantly by 1993. This result indicated that wheat crops were the most profitable commodities to produce. The collective farms were maximizing profit, within a certain level of risk. Through market distortions, such as connecting the accessibility of inputs to state output orders, collective farms tended to choose production patterns within these constraints. Thus, producers did not choose a cropping pattern based solely on productivity or profitability, but they also considered the probability of stability (risk level). The ratio efficiency analysis for 1993 indicated that the government discouraged the production of oilseeds and pulse crops, even though there was a positive net margin without the distortions of taxes and subsidies. A variety of taxes and subsidies tended to discourage the production of profitable commodities in a risk neutral environment. The result, therefore, was to alter the production pattern in an open market, risk neutral environment. Finally, a qualitative overview of macro and micro business environment factors supported the notion that political, legal, financial, and economic conditions were unstable and although progress is being made {{in the development of a}} market economy, market transparency has not apparently occurred to support an economy which exemplifies the characteristics of a properly functioning open, risk neutral economy...|$|E
