50|$|Grosmannia clavigera is {{a species}} of sac fungus that causes <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> in <b>wood.</b> It spreads to {{lodgepole}} pine, ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, and whitebark pine trees from the body and a special structure in the heads of mountain pine beetles. The <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> fungus has evolved a relationship with mountain pine beetles {{that allow them to}} travel from tree to tree on a special structure in the beetle’s heads and stops the tree from producing resin to pitch out or kill the beetle, encouraging the pine beetle infestation occurring all along the Rocky Mountains from Mexico into Canada. The beetles are able to mine and lay eggs while avoiding the tree’s defenses. The 33 Mb genome of this fungus was sequenced in 2009.|$|R
40|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopk. [Coleoptera: Scolytidae]) epidemic poses significant {{challenges to the}} pulp and paper industry. In this report, we summarize {{the current state of}} knowledge associated with the categories of attack stage (green, red, grey). Early-attacked lodgepole pine sapwood is <b>blue</b> <b>stained</b> and contains a high level of extractives. Grey stage wood exhibits low moisture content. As potentially the largest recipient of <b>blue</b> <b>stained</b> and dry <b>wood,</b> the pulp and paper industry must develop cost-effective utilization strategies to overcome the detrimental effects of these fibre sources. It is recognized that lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia) killed by <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> vectored by the {{mountain pine}} beetle will provide a significant volume of foreseeable fibre supplies. The long-term effects of dry (grey stage) lodgepole pine are of concern. We have identified the critical knowledge gaps and research needs.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Biological <b>stain</b> (<b>blue</b> <b>stain)</b> reduces <b>wood</b> {{value and}} {{prevents}} {{its use in}} many structural applications. Increasing environmental concerns have restricted the chemicals available for controlling this damage. As a result, biological control has received more interest. The application of these systems to wood has been limited due to their inability to reliably produce effective stain control under mill conditions. Many of these problems stem from a poor understanding of how these organisms function as bioprotectants. In this thesis, a technique was identified to extract proteins from ponderosa pine sapwood samples colonized by bioprotectants and/or sapstain fungi. These extracts {{could be used to}} study the effects of the bioprotectants on various target stain fungi. The effects of extraction media and sample incubation period on protein recovery and enzyme activity in extracts were evaluated. Protein recovery and activity in extracts were evaluated. Protein recovery and enzyme activity were affected by the extraction time, the medium conditions of the bioprotectants and the sample incubation conditions. The greatest protein recovery occurred, under the conditions of this study, when wood samples were incubated for thirty days and extracted for twelve hours using 50 mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5. 0 with 0. 05...|$|R
40|$|Bark beetles (Coleoptera, Scolytinae) have a {{widespread}} association with fungi, especially with ophiostomatoid fungi (Ascomycota) that cause <b>blue</b> <b>staining</b> of <b>wood,</b> {{and in some}} cases, serious tree diseases. In Fennoscandia, most studies of these fungi have focused on economically important bark beetle species and {{this is likely to}} have led to a biased view of the fungal biodiversity in the region. Recently, the associations between fungi and bark beetles in Fennoscandia {{have been shown to be}} more diverse than previously thought. Furthermore, they form complex and dynamic associations that are only now beginning to emerge. This review examines the current knowledge of the rather poorly known interactions between bark beetles, fungi and their conifer host trees in Fennoscandia. The diversity of ophiostomatoid species is discussed and the possible factors that influence the assemblages of fungal associates are considered for all species that are known to occur in the region. For many ophiostomatoid species found in Fennoscandia, little or nothing is known regarding their pathogenicity, particularly if they were to be transferred to new environments. We, therefore, draw attention to the possible threats of timber trade and climate change-induced invasions of new habitats by bark beetles and the fungi that can be moved along with them.

40|$|Aureobasidium pullulans is {{generally}} {{believed to be}} the main causal organism of the disfigurement of wood in service and coatings applied to wood. The disfigurement is referred to as <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> in service. As such it represents a major problem to the paint industry and to the use of timber as a decorative product in service. Fifty two test strains and environmental isolates of <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> fungi were collated to study the morphology, physiology and phylogeny ofA. pullulans. Sequencing of the rDNA 5. 8 S gene and flanking ITS regions was successful in unequivocally discriminating between the two morphologically similar <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> fungi: A. pullulans and H. dematioides. The phylogenetic tree based on the rDNA sequence data confirmed that A. pullulans is a single species and {{there is no evidence of}} any subspecies from this region of DNA. RAPD analysis was used to investigate intraspecific genetic variability, but the technique was not successful in being able to differe,uiate accurately between these two fungi. However, different banding patterns were observed, suggesting there was a degree of genetic variability. The sequencing data highlighted many cases of misidentification of H. dematioides as A. pullulans from environmental isolations. The difficulty in correctly distinguishing morphologically between A. pullulans and H. dematioides b!'ought into question the conclusion that A. pullulans was the most commonly isolated and thus the main causal organism of <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> in service. The actual frequency of occurrence of <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> fungi in <b>stained</b> <b>wood</b> was investigated using PCR-DGGE analysis of environmental DNA samples. The use ofPCR-DGGE gave an insight into the actual fungi present at the time of sampling and gave a molecular snapshot of the <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> community present on the stained timber samples. The PCR-DGGE analysis showed conclusively that H. dematioides was detected more frequently than A. pullulans. The results also show that PCR-DGGE, with a suitable primer set, is able to differentiate and partially quantify A. pullulans and H. dematioides in environmental samples. Quantitative analysis of A. pullulans was attempted from a new perspective using direct RNA analysis, in the form ofqPCR, to assess the active biomass ofA. pullulans in <b>stained</b> <b>wood.</b> The results showed the relatively constant levels ofmRNA of the two target genes over the eight week time period of the experiment and demonstrated the effectiveness of the RNA extraction procedure in harvesting extremely small amounts of viable RNA from wood. A method ofcontroIling <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> fungi was investigated by attempting to reduce the number ofA. pullulans spores adhering to four different wood coatings, namely; a solvent based paint, a water based paint, a solvent based <b>wood</b> <b>stain</b> and a water based <b>wood</b> <b>stain.</b> These coatings were tested both before and after artificial weathering. The inhibition ofspore adhesion follows the tenet of prevention rather than cure and is particularly significant given the current environmental pressures on the coatings industry regarding the use ofbiocides to control these fungi. The main aim of the adhesion study was to examine ifzosteric acid could prevent the adhesion ofA. pullulans spores to wood coatings. Zosteric acid was shown to significantly reduce the adhesive capability ofA. pullulans spores on the four different wood coatings and weathering was shown to significantly increase the adhesion ofspores to the coatings. There is potential for utilising the reduction in spore adhesion observed with zosteric acid by its incorporation into paint formulations. Such an approach has great attraction as zosteric acid is a naturally occurring, non-toxic chemical in contrast to the current use of controlled biocides.

However, some Ophiostoma strains cultures present a marked filamentous morphology in liquid culture medium, affecting the efficiency in the production of the bioactive ingredient. The hypothesis of this work presumed the possibility to control the morphology of Ophiostoma cultures, through the modification of growth conditions in liquid medium. The effect of inoculum size, growth temperature and agitation rate on the morphology of PcF 2 A 29 Ophiostoma piceae and FlF 1 A 55 Ophiostoma floccosum albino strains in liquid culture medium, was studied.

40|$|The {{mountain}} pine beetle (MPB) (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) epidemic has ravaged lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) forests throughout British Columbia (BC). The research {{focused on the}} effects of three stages of MPB trees, green, red, and grey attack from southern interior BC on the MPB-induced variables of log moisture content (MC), <b>blue</b> <b>stain,</b> and checking and how these relate to log quality from an end product perspective. The objectives were to determine if: 1) the percentage of <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> calculated from the log end surface at diameter breast height (DBH) correlates to the percentage of <b>blue</b> <b>stained</b> boards 2) the quantity and size of checks present in a disk removed at DBH correlates to the percentage of checked boards 3) the sapwood moisture content from a cross sectional disc at DBH correlates to the percentage of MPB-induced degrades (checking, wood borers, and decay fungi). Three sections of each MPB log (bottom, middle, and top), were examined for the MPB-induced degrades <b>blue</b> <b>stain,</b> checking, and the losses due to wood borers and decay fungi. The results support the findings of previous MPB research where reduced moisture content, <b>blue</b> <b>stain,</b> and checking significantly reduce log quality. However, this study is unique since it relates these findings to the effects that they have on the board products. The percentage of <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> from a disc cut at DBH is correlated to the percentage of <b>blue</b> <b>stained</b> boards from that tree for green, red, and grey attack. As <b>blue</b> <b>stain</b> increases in the disc cut at DBH by attack stage, the amount of <b>blue</b> <b>stained</b> boards also increases by attack stage. When the check depth is > 3 cm and the check depth to width ratio in a disk cut at DBH is > 4, there is a positive correlation to the percentage of checked boards for that tree. If the check depth to width ratio is less, these shallow checks are removed by the canter chipping heads during primary breakdown.
