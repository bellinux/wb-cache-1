60|$|At these sports {{there are}} usually from four to six bulls sacrificed. The {{audience}} occupies seats around the ring in which the exhibition is given, each seat but the foremost rising higher {{than the one in}} front, so that every one can get a full view of the sport. When all is ready a bull is turned into the ring. Three or four men come in, mounted on the merest skeletons of horses blind or blind-folded and so weak that they could not make a sudden turn with their riders without danger of falling down. The men are armed with spears having a point as sharp as a needle. Other men enter the arena on foot, armed with red flags and explosives {{about the size of a}} musket cartridge. To each of these explosives is fastened a <b>barbed</b> <b>needle</b> which serves the purpose of attaching them to the bull by running the needle into the skin. Before the animal is turned loose a lot of these explosives are attached to him. The pain from the pricking of the skin by the needles is exasperating; but when the explosions of the cartridges commence the animal becomes frantic. As he makes a lunge towards one horseman, another runs a spear into him. He turns towards his last tormentor when a man on foot holds out a red flag; the bull rushes for this and is allowed to take it on his horns. The flag drops and covers the eyes of the animal so that he is at a loss what to do; it is jerked from him and the torment is renewed. When the animal is worked into an uncontrollable frenzy, the horsemen withdraw, and the matadores --literally murderers--enter, armed with knives having blades twelve or eighteen inches long, and sharp. The trick is to dodge an attack from the animal and stab him to the heart as he passes. If these efforts fail the bull is finally lassoed, held fast and killed by driving a knife blade into the spinal column just back of the horns. He is then dragged out by horses or mules, another is let into the ring, and the same performance is renewed.|$|E

50|$|Needle felting is a {{technique}} used to add decoration to a knitted or felted piece, where raw roving is applied using a very sharp <b>barbed</b> felting <b>needle</b> by repeatedly piercing the roving and background together. Once washed in hot water, the appliqued decoration is fused with the background. Felted knitting can be cut with scissors without concern about fraying.|$|R
25|$|These carpets {{are more}} technologically advanced. Needle felts are {{produced}} by intermingling and felting individual synthetic fibers using <b>barbed</b> and forked <b>needles</b> forming an extremely durable carpet. These carpets are normally found in commercial settings such as hotels and restaurants where there is frequent traffic.|$|R
40|$|More than 500 {{species of}} marine snails {{comprise}} the genus Conus, {{and all are}} venomous predators. The venom of a typical cone snail contains small post-translationally modified peptides, {{many of which are}} directed towards voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and receptors with exquisite specificity (Olivera, 1997). A complex mixture of peptide toxins is produced in a long tubular venom duct containing secretory cells. Venom is ultimately discharged into prey by injection through a highly modified radular tooth, resembling a <b>barbed</b> hypodermic <b>needle,</b> which is gripped near the tip of an extensible proboscis. Mechanisms for transferring toxins from the venom duct into the proboscis for injection are not well understood, but in at least one species, C. californicus, peptides appear to be packaged into the radular teeth themselves (Marshall et al., 2002). In the fish-hunting species C. catus, and presumably in other species as well, the radular tooth is explosively propelled in a ballistic fashion into the prey prior to venom expulsion through the tooth (Schulz et al., 2004). Venoms of both C. striatus and C. catus induce an immediate tetanic paralysis of the harpooned fish, thereby enabling prey capture (Kohn, 1956). Isolation of venom peptides from Conus snails {{in the vast majority of}} cases has employed crude venom obtained from dissected venom ducts (duct venom, DV), with material being pooled from multiple animals. The use of DV enables peptide characterization based on conventional analytical and sequencing methods that require fairly large amounts of material. However, it is not clear how peptides in DV are related to those actually injected during prey capture. In severa...|$|R

50|$|A {{model of}} the machine is {{exhibited}} at the London Science Museum. The machine is made of wood and uses a <b>barbed</b> <b>needle</b> which passes downward through the cloth to grab the thread and pull it up to form a loop to be locked by the next loop. The first American lockstitch sewing machine was invented by Walter Hunt in 1832. His machine used an eye-pointed needle (with the eye and the point on the same end) carrying the upper thread and a falling shuttle carrying the lower thread. The curved needle moved through the fabric horizontally, leaving the loop as it withdrew. The shuttle passed through the loop, interlocking the thread. The feed let the machine down, requiring the machine to be stopped frequently and reset up. Hunt eventually lost interest in his machine and sold individual machines without bothering to patent his invention, and only patenting it at a late date of 1854. In 1842, John Greenough patented the first sewing machine in the United States. The British partners Newton and Archibold introduced the eye-pointed needle {{and the use of}} two pressing surfaces to keep the pieces of fabric in position, in 1841.|$|E

40|$|Is less {{progesterone}} {{needed in}} the rat to maintain deciduomata than early preg-nancy? We thought that the question could be resolved by studying both phenomena concurrently in the same animal. The following results indicate that under these circumstances progesterone requirements are approximately the same for both tissues. Holtzman rats were mated at pro-oestrus. On the next morning, if vaginal smears contained sperm (= day 1 of pregnancy), the right uterus was severed at the utero=m- tubal junction thus creating a sterile cornu. On day 5 (between 14. 00 and 15. 00 h), the sterile horn was traumatized along its entire antimesometrial border with a <b>barbed</b> <b>needle.</b> The rats were hypophysectomized on day 6, between 09. 00 and 10. 00 h, by a previously described method (Greenwald & Johnson, 1968) and various hor-monal regimens involving subcutaneous injections were initiated (Table 1). Pro-gesterone was given daily on days 6 - 9 at 10. 00 h as a single injection in 0 =. ml sesame oil. Prolactin (NIH-S- 9) was injected twice daily at 10. 00 and 17. 00 h (in 0 - 1 ml saline) on days 6 - 9. A single injection of oestradiol cyclopentylpropionate (OECP...|$|E
40|$|I make, I feel, and I listen. Jewelry {{is a very}} {{intimate}} type of sculpture, an attraction to an object {{to be placed on}} the skin. I think of my pieces like thoughts or conversations with the materials. My thoughts lately are immersed in my fascination of felting wool. By choosing materials I am drawn to, my work is not bound to one material to convey my design. Through these materials small wearable sculptures are created that I hope engages the wearer as much as they engaged me during the creation. Color, texture, material, process becomes the inspiration for my jewelry. The colors in the raw unprocessed wool bundles are like stripped taffy candy, and transform into streaks and bursts of color that comes out through working the material. Wool is a very alluring material, the tactile sensation on the skin is pleasant and comforting. Maybe it is familiarity or the warmth of wool that attracts me, or the lush colors and textures. The wool is compacted and felted with a <b>barbed</b> <b>needle,</b> the structure is reinforced and strengthened as the process is repeated. Felted wool has given me a completely new language in which to create my work. Every step of the process of felting is enjoyable and meditative to me. My work is created purely instinctively, relying on my own aesthetics to guide my way through the making. Through these choices, a piece evolves on its own without restriction. I find this to be a very expressive way of working for me. Beyond these thoughts I do not place any boundaries or rules on my work. I hope the work engages you. I hope you are engaged...|$|E
