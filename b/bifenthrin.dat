25|$|Pesticides - Biopesticides such as {{chitosan}} {{have been}} tested for protection against the mountain pine beetle, and pesticides such as carbaryl, permethrin, and <b>bifenthrin</b> are used for smaller area applications.|$|E
2500|$|If control {{measures}} are required, spray with <b>bifenthrin</b> on a dry, mild day in late February {{to control the}} overwintering generation. Some insecticides can be applied early, preventing gall formation and insect colonization.|$|E
2500|$|Aggressively searching out, removing, and {{destroying}} the brood in infested trees {{is the best}} way to slow the spread of mountain pine beetles; however, it may not protect specific trees. Spraying trees to prevent attack is the most effective way to protect a small number of high-value trees from mountain pine beetles. Carbaryl, permethrin and <b>bifenthrin</b> are registered in the United States for use in the prevention of pine beetle infestations. Carbaryl is considered by the EPA to likely be carcinogenic to humans. [...] It is moderately toxic to wild birds and partially to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Permethrin is easily metabolized in mammalian livers, so is less dangerous to humans. Birds are also practically not affected by permethrin. [...] Negative effects can be seen in aquatic ecosystems, as well as it being very toxic to beneficial insects. <b>Bifenthrin</b> is moderately dangerous to mammals, including humans; it is slightly more toxic to birds and aquatic ecosystems than permethrin, as well as extremely toxic to beneficial insects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> {{is hardly}} soluble in water, so nearly all <b>bifenthrin</b> {{will stay in}} the sediment, {{but it is very}} harmful for the aquatic life. Even in small concentrations, fish and other aquatic animals are {{affected}} by <b>bifenthrin.</b> [...] One {{of the reasons for the}} high sensitivity of fish is fish have a slow metabolism. <b>Bifenthrin</b> will stay longer in the system of the fish. Another reason for the high sensitivity of fish is the effect of <b>bifenthrin</b> as ATPase-inhibitor. The gills need ATP to control the osmotic balance of oxygen. If the fish is no longer capable of taking up oxygen because ATP can no longer be used, the fish will die.In cold water, <b>bifenthrin</b> is even more dangerous. pH and calcium concentration are also factors that influence the toxicity.Vertebrates are less sensitive to the effects of <b>bifenthrin</b> as ATPase-inhibitor.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on the half life of <b>bifenthrin</b> in soil, water, and air under different conditions, such as aerobic or anaerobic, and at different temperatures and pH. It is more likely to remain in the soil and not so much in water (it is hydrophobic), nor in the air (it is unlikely to volatize because of its physical properties). Because of the water-insolubility of <b>bifenthrin,</b> it will not rapidly cause contamination of ground water. However, some contamination might occur by soil-bound <b>bifenthrin</b> to surface water through runoff. For an overview of the environmental degradation of <b>bifenthrin,</b> see figure below. The main path of degradation results in 4’-hydroxy <b>bifenthrin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In bees, {{the lethal}} {{concentration}} (LC50) of <b>bifenthrin</b> is about 17 mg/l. [...] At sublethal concentrations, <b>bifenthrin</b> reduces the fecundity of bees, decreases {{the rate at}} which bee larvae develop into adults, and increases their immature periods.|$|E
50|$|An {{acute and}} chronic {{reference}} dose (RfD) for <b>bifenthrin</b> has been established, based on animal studies. The reference dose resembles the estimated quantity {{of a chemical}} which a person could be exposed to every day (or a one-time exposure for the acute RfD) without any appreciable risk of adverse health effects. The acute reference dose (RfD) for <b>bifenthrin</b> is 0.328 mg/kg bodyweight/day.The chronic reference dose (RfD) for <b>bifenthrin</b> is 0.013 mg/kg bodyweight/day.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> {{is not at}} all {{toxic to}} plants. Though it does not have a large {{toxicological}} risk towards mammals or birds, <b>bifenthrin</b> is able to accumulate in food, so it might be dangerous to mammals or birds in some scenarios.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> was {{included}} in a biocide ban proposed by the Swedish Chemicals Agency, because of its carcinogenic effect. This {{was approved by the}} European Parliament in 2009.Pesticides containing <b>bifenthrin</b> were withdrawn from use in the European Union. [...] They have since been reinstated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> {{will open}} the sodium channel for a shorter period than other pyrethroids. The {{mechanism}} in mammals and invertebrates is not different, but the effect on mammals is much less due to higher body temperature, higher body volume, and lower affinity of <b>bifenthrin</b> to sodium channels.|$|E
50|$|Like other pyrethroids, <b>bifenthrin</b> is chiral; it has {{different}} enantiomers which can have different effects. <b>Bifenthrin</b> {{is found in}} two enantiomers: 1S-cis-bifenthrin and 1R-cis-bifenthrin. 1S-cis-Bifenthrin is 3-4 times more toxic to humans than 1R-cis-bifenthrin, while the latter is more than 300 times more effective as a pesticide.|$|E
50|$|Exposure to <b>bifenthrin</b> can be {{achieved}} either by skin contact or ingestion. Skin contact is not toxic, apart from a slight tingling sensation on the specific location of contact. Ingestion is toxic, although only slightly. Commercially available <b>bifenthrin</b> (Ortho Home Defense Max, for example), however, can induce toxic effects in those concentrations, because the added chemicals which improve the sustainability either potentiate <b>bifenthrin</b> or are toxic on their own. Symptoms of excessive exposure are nausea, headaches, hypersensitivity for touch and sound, and irritation of the skin and the eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Pyrethroids {{are much}} less toxic in mammals {{than they are in}} insects and fish, because mammals have the ability to rapidly break the ester bond in <b>bifenthrin</b> and break the {{substance}} into its inactive acid and alcohol components: [...] In humans and rats, <b>bifenthrin</b> is degraded by the cytochrome p450-family.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> {{and other}} {{synthetic}} pyrethroids {{are being used}} in agriculture in increasing amounts {{because of the high}} efficiency of these substances in killing insects, the low toxicity for mammals, and good biodegradability. However, because of its success, they are being used more often (also indoors) and high exposure of <b>bifenthrin</b> to humans can occur.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> is a {{pyrethroid}} insecticide {{used primarily}} against the red imported fire ant by influencing its nervous system. It {{has a high}} toxicity to aquatic organisms. Although it is listed as a restricted use chemical in the United States, it is allowed to be sold for daily use, provided the product sold has a low concentration of <b>bifenthrin.</b> The chemical was discovered and developed by FMC Corporation. Products containing <b>bifenthrin</b> include Transport, Talstar, Maxxthor, Capture, Brigade, Bifenthrine, Ortho Home Defense Max, Bifen XTS, Bifen IT, Bifen L/P, Torant, Zipak, Scotts LawnPro Step 3, Wisdom TC Flowable, FMC 54800, Allectus, Ortho Max Pro and OMS3024 and mega wash from green planet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> is an {{effective}} pesticide to use against malaria and filaria vector mosquitoes. It is still effective when a resistance to other pyrethroids is found. Mosquito nets and indoor walls can be treated with <b>bifenthrin</b> to keep more mosquitoes away.Bifenthrin is {{an effective}}ly used insecticide, but the risk is high of it working only for a short time. Mosquitoes can develop a resistance to it, as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> {{is poorly}} {{soluble in water}} and often remains in soil. Its {{residual}} half-life in soil is between 7 days and 8 months, depending on the soil type, with a low mobility in most soil types. <b>Bifenthrin</b> has the longest known residual time in soil of insecticides currently on the market.It is a white, waxy solid with a faint sweet smell. It is chemically synthesized in various forms, including powder, granules and pellets. However, it is not naturally occurring.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> - A {{synthetic}} pyrethroid commercialised {{as an alternative}} to permethrin, for the protection of woollen products from Tineola bisselliella and other species.|$|E
50|$|On a large scale, <b>bifenthrin</b> {{is often}} used against red {{imported}} fire ants. It is also effective against aphids, worms, ants, gnats, moths, beetles, earwigs, grasshoppers, mites, midges, spiders, ticks, yellow jackets, maggots, thrips, caterpillars, flies, fleas, and termites. It is mostly used in orchards, nurseries, and homes. In the agricultural sector, it is used in great amounts on certain crops, such as corn. About 70% of all hops and raspberries cultured in the United States are treated with <b>bifenthrin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Pyrethroid {{insecticides}} {{can be used}} {{to control}} carpet beetles. Products containing active ingredients such as permethrin, <b>bifenthrin,</b> deltamethrin, tralomethrin are components of the Pyrethroid insecticide.|$|E
50|$|The EPA has {{classified}} <b>bifenthrin</b> {{as a class}} C carcinogen, {{a possible}} human carcinogen based on a test with mice, which showed increased development of certain tumors.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> {{is used by}} {{the textile}} {{industry}} to protect woollen products from insect attack. It was introduced as an alternative to permethrin-based agents, due to greater efficacy against keratinophagous insects, better wash-fastness, and lower aquatic toxicity.|$|E
50|$|The {{two types}} of {{pyrethroids}} are the ones with an α-cyanogroup and the ones without an α-cyanogroup. The neurotoxicity of <b>bifenthrin</b> {{is based on the}} affinity with voltage-gated sodium channels (both in insects, as well as in mammals). The pyrethroids with an α-cyanogroup block the closing of the sodium-channel permanently, causing the membrane to be permanently depolarized. The resting potential will not be restored, and no further action potential can be generated. The pyrethroids without an α-cyanogroup, to which <b>bifenthrin</b> belongs, are only able to bind to the sodium channel transiently. This will result in after potentials and eventual continuous firing of axons. The resting potential is not affected by these pyrethroids.|$|E
50|$|The EPA {{monitors}} and regulates {{the use of}} pesticides in the United States. <b>Bifenthrin</b> is classified as a restricted-use pesticide, meaning it is allowed to be legally sold only by certified pesticide applicators. For everyday use, it is allowed to be sold in lower concentrations.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. EPA {{classified}} <b>bifenthrin</b> as a Category C, possible human carcinogen. This {{rating is}} based on an increased rate of urinary bladder tumors in mice, adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the liver in male mice, and bronchioalveolar adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the lung in some female mice.|$|E
50|$|Products such as Capture LFR (containing the {{pyrethroid}} <b>Bifenthrin)</b> and SmartChoice (containing a pyrethroid and an organophosphate) {{have been}} increasingly used to complement Bt crops that farmers find alone {{to be unable}} to prevent insect-driven injury. Multiple studies have found the practice to be either ineffective or to accelerate the development of resistant strains.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> {{has been}} {{approved}} for use against the Rasberry crazy ant in the Houston, Texas, area, under a special [...] "crisis exemption" [...] from the Texas Department of Agriculture and the EPA. The chemical is only approved for use in Texas counties experiencing [...] "confirmed infestations" [...] of the newly imported, invasive ant species.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, a {{water-based}} <b>bifenthrin</b> preservative {{has been}} developed to improve the insect resistance of timber. As this preservative is applied by spray, it only penetrates the outer 2 mm of the timber cross-section. Concerns have been raised as to whether this thin-envelope system will provide protection against insects in the longer term, particularly when exposed to sunlight for extended periods.|$|E
50|$|Aggressively searching out, removing, and {{destroying}} the brood in infested trees {{is the best}} way to slow the spread of mountain pine beetles; however, it may not protect specific trees. Spraying trees to prevent attack is the most effective way to protect a small number of high-value trees from mountain pine beetles. Carbaryl, permethrin and <b>bifenthrin</b> are registered in the United States for use in the prevention of pine beetle infestations. Carbaryl is considered by the EPA to likely be carcinogenic to humans. It is moderately toxic to wild birds and partially to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Permethrin is easily metabolized in mammalian livers, so is less dangerous to humans. Birds are also practically not affected by permethrin. Negative effects can be seen in aquatic ecosystems, as well as it being very toxic to beneficial insects. <b>Bifenthrin</b> is moderately dangerous to mammals, including humans; it is slightly more toxic to birds and aquatic ecosystems than permethrin, as well as extremely toxic to beneficial insects.|$|E
50|$|This {{class of}} timber {{treatments}} use white spirit, or light oils such as kerosene, as the solvent carrier to deliver preservative compounds into timber. Synthetic pyrethroids are typically {{used as an}} insecticide, such as permethrin, <b>bifenthrin</b> or deltamethrin. In Australia and New Zealand, the most common formulations use Permethrin as an insecticide, and Propaconazole and Tebuconazole as fungicides. While still using a chemical preservative, this formulation contains no heavy-metal compounds.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{approach}}, {{which is}} the best approach at an effective management practice would be to eradicate or severely damage the Mountain and Cherry Leafhopper population because the leafhoppers are the number one vectors for this pathogen. To do this, pesticides (i.e. acephate, <b>bifenthrin,</b> cyfluthrin) [...] could be applied or biological control (predators of the leafhopper) could be used. There should be a pre-season application of control measures as well as a post-season application. This is to maximize the effort at controlling both types of leafhoppers (Cherry and Mountain), thus cutting down the starting inoculum at both stages in the life cycle.|$|E
5000|$|The {{well-established}} {{resistance of}} bed bugs to DDT and pyrethroids {{has created a}} need for different and newer chemical approaches to the extermination of bed bugs. In 2008 a study was conducted on bed bug resistance {{to a variety of}} both old and new insecticides, with the following results, listed in order from most- to least-effective: λ-cyhalothrin, <b>bifenthrin,</b> carbaryl, imidacloprid, fipronil, permethrin, diazinon, spinosyn, dichlorvos, chlorfenapyr, and DDT. [...] Note that the first of these, λ-cyhalothrin, is itself a pyrethroid-based insecticide— in the past it has been used principally for the treatment of cotton crops and so bed bugs have not developed a genetic resistance to it.|$|E
40|$|<b>Bifenthrin</b> is one {{the most}} {{widespread}} pollutants and has caused potential effect on aquatic life and human health, yet {{little is known about}} microbial degradation in contaminated regions. A novel yeast strain ZS- 02, isolated from activated sludge and identified as Candida pelliculosa based on morphology, API test and 18 S rDNA gene analysis, was found highly effective in degrading <b>bifenthrin</b> over a wide range of temperatures (20 - 40 °C) and pH (5 - 9). On the basis of response surface methodology (RSM), the optimal degradation conditions were determined to be 32. 3 °C and pH 7. 2. Under these conditions, the yeast completely metabolized <b>bifenthrin</b> (50 mg · L(- 1)) within 8 days. This strain utilized <b>bifenthrin</b> as the sole carbon source for growth as well as co-metabolized it in the presence of glucose, and tolerated concentrations as high as 600 mg · L(- 1) with a q(max), K(s) and K(i) of 1. 7015 day(- 1), 86. 2259 mg · L(- 1) and 187. 2340 mg · L(- 1), respectively. The yeast first degraded <b>bifenthrin</b> by hydrolysis of the carboxylester linkage to produce cyclopropanecarboxylic acid and 2 -methyl- 3 -biphenylyl methanol. Subsequently, 2 -methyl- 3 -biphenylyl methanol was further transformed by biphenyl cleavage to form 4 -trifluoromethoxy phenol, 2 -chloro- 6 -fluoro benzylalcohol, and 3, 5 -dimethoxy phenol, resulting in its detoxification. Eventually, no persistent accumulative product was detected by gas chromatopraphy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. This is the first report of a novel pathway of degradation of <b>bifenthrin</b> by hydrolysis of ester linkage and cleavage of biphenyl in a microorganism. Furthermore, strain ZS- 02 degraded a variety of pyrethroids including <b>bifenthrin,</b> cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, cypermethrin, and fenpropathrin. In different contaminated soils introduced with strain ZS- 02, 65 - 75 % of the 50 mg · kg(- 1) <b>bifenthrin</b> was eliminated within 10 days, suggesting the yeast could be a promising candidate for remediation of environments affected by <b>bifenthrin.</b> Finally, this is the first described yeast capable of degrading <b>bifenthrin...</b>|$|E
