50|$|As {{a result}} of their {{intricately}} entangled above-ground root systems, mangrove communities protect shorelines during storm events by absorbing wave energy and reducing the velocity of water passing through the root barrier. In addition, mangroves protect intertidal sediment along coastlines from eroding away in harsh weather year round. As new cities are developed, mangrove forests around the world have felt a great impact not only on their ecosystems health, but also their wave-attenuating capacity. Wave energy may be reduced by 75 per cent in the wave's passage through 200 meters of mangrove forests, a very substantial amount once the mangrove has been removed. Mangrove covered shorelines are less likely to erode, or will erode significantly more slowly, than unvegetated shorelines during periods of high wave energy. Other factors mangroves have an influence on, include coastal profile, water depth and <b>bottom</b> <b>configuration.</b> The mangrove population has felt both direct and indirect effects due to coastal engineering and human development, resulting in a devastating decline in population. This decline has led to a negative chain of effects in other ecosystems that are dependent on mangrove forest for survival. In just the last decade, at least 35 percent of the world's mangroves have been destroyed, exceeding the rate of the disappearance of tropical rainforests. Mangroves provide a number of essentials for many different ecosystems, including food and shelter for a diverse animal community, living both below and above sea level. Maintaining a healthy mangrove forest sustains natural protection and is less expensive than seawalls and similar erosion control structures, which can increase erosion in front of the structure and at adjacent properties due to coastal currents. Unless ecosystems have the space to adjust their location or elevation in the intertidal zone to the sea-level rise, they will be stressed by changed inundation periods. The Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) has risen 4 to 8 inches over the past century, almost twice the average rate of 80 years prior. It appears that as the sea-level is slowly rising, mangroves are a better alternative to protecting coastlines from eroding than other man made structures, such as seawalls.|$|E

Such problem has been recently investigated by [11] {{in the case of}} ‘quasi-equilibrium ’ whereby <b>bottom</b> <b>configuration</b> is assumed to adapt instantaneously to changes of the flow field during the tidal cycle. However, the latter assumption rarely applies to tidal systems; in this study time derivative of bed elevation is retained in sediment continuity equation.

40|$|An {{idealized}} {{model is}} proposed {{to explain the}} appearance of the long bed waves that have been recently observed in shallow tidal seas. The model assumes that these bedforms grow due to tide-topography interaction. The water motion is described by means of the depth averaged shallow water equations and the bottom evolution is governed by conservation of sediment mass. The sediment transport formulation includes a critical bottom stress below which no sediment moves. Also, anisotropic sediment transport, due to local bottom slopes in the longitudinal and transverse directions, is taken into account. A linear stability analysis of the flat <b>bottom</b> <b>configuration</b> reveals that different bottom patterns can emerge. In accordance with previous analyses, for strong tidal currents, the fastest growing modes are sand banks. However, if the tidal currents are elliptical and the maximum bottom stress is just above its threshold value for the initiation of sediment motion, the model shows the presence of further growing modes which resemble the long bed waves observed in the field...|$|E

Assuming ideal fluid flow, the problem is formulated using a boundary integral method and discretised to produce a nonlinear system of algebraic equations. The Jacobian of this system is dense due to integrals being evaluated over the entire free surface. To overcome the computational difficulty and large memory requirements, a Jacobian-free Newton Krylov (JFNK) method is utilised. Using a block-banded approximation of the Jacobian from the linearised system as a preconditioner for the JFNK scheme, we find significant reductions in computational time and memory required for generating numerical solutions.
