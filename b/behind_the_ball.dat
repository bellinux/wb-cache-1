5|$|The offside {{rule was}} {{introduced}} to Sheffield Rules in 1863. Their version only required {{one member of the}} opposition between a player and the opposing goal to remain on side. Despite this the rule was only used sporadically in actual play. The FA version, which required a player to remain <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at all times, was introduced during the 1865–66 season but was disliked {{due to the lack of}} goal scoring opportunities it caused. The one man offside was finally used a regular basis from 1867 until the adoption of FA rules in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of extra time Cardiff made their first {{substitution}} of the match, goalscorer Mason was replaced by Filip Kiss. Liverpool had the first chance to score in extra time, but Suárez's header was cleared off the line by Andrew Taylor. Cardiff appeared to be playing for a penalty shoot-out, as they were positioning {{the majority of their}} team <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and in front of their goal. Cardiff captain Hudson was replaced in the 98th minute by Anthony Gerrard after suffering from cramp. Liverpool had another chance in the 101st minute, when a pass by Gerrard was cleared for a corner kick by Taylor. The resulting corner was met by Carroll, but his header was wide of the Cardiff goal. Immediately after the attack Carroll was replaced by Dirk Kuyt. Just {{before the end of the}} first half of extra time Liverpool had another chance. Bellamy went past two men down the left hand side of the pitch before exchanging passes with Kuyt, however his subsequent shot went wide.|$|E
5|$|Five {{minutes before}} half-time, Juventus were awarded a free-kick. Boniek, who had beaten three Liverpool players with a run, was brought down outside the Liverpool penalty area by Wark, who {{received}} a yellow card for the foul. The resulting free-kick came to nothing, and at half-time the score was 0–0. Almost immediately after the restart, Liverpool suffered another injury. Paul Walsh stretched to reach a pass from Neal, aggravated a stomach strain {{and was replaced by}} Craig Johnston. Juventus were gaining an ascendancy in the match, and in the 56th minute they were awarded a penalty kick. Boniek again went on a run through the centre of the Liverpool defence and was brought down by Gillespie. Liverpool believed that the foul was outside the area, but the Swiss referee, from some 25 yards (22.86 m.) <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> awarded the penalty. Michel Platini scored the subsequent penalty to give Juventus a 1–0 lead.|$|E

5|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} {{by taking a}} single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over bowled by Pollard, Hassett fell for 13 on the second ball, which lifted suddenly after bouncing. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball {{in the same place}} as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded off the pitch and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett. The crowd, sensing the importance of the two quick wickets, in particular that of Bradman, who had been so productive at Headingley, erupted. This left Australia struggling at 3/68, but a rapid counterattack by the middle and lower order took them to 9/457 at stumps and eventually 458 on the fourth morning.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} morning, play resumed under {{hot and humid}} conditions. There had been rain on the pitch at 07:00, and Bradman resumed {{proceedings}} by taking a single from a Bedser no ball. In same over, one ball reared from the pitch and moved into Bradman, hitting him in the groin, causing a delay as he recovered from the pain and recomposed himself before play resumed. In the second over of the day, Pollard got the second ball to lift. Caught out by the unexpected bounce, Hassett was unable {{to get out of}} the way and edged the ball to Crapp in the slips for 13. Miller came to the crease and drove his first ball for three runs, bringing Bradman on strike for the fourth ball of the over. Pollard then pitched a ball in the same place as he did to Hassett, but this time it skidded low off the pitch, deviated back in and knocked out Bradman's off stump for 33. According to O'Reilly, Bradman backed away from the ball as it cut off the pitch with a noticeable flinch. O'Reilly attributed Bradman's unwillingness to get <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to the blow inflicted on him by Bedser in the previous over and the rearing ball that dismissed Hassett.|$|E

25|$|Hughes batted with an {{orthodox}} upright, side-on stance. He gripped the bat {{high on the}} handle and played his strokes with a controlled backlift and a full follow through.

25|$|In one's own {{half the}} aim of a throw-in may be to retain {{possession}} {{in order to build}} up the next attack. The throw may or may not go toward the opponents' goal; the most unmarked player may be a full-back who is <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Such a throw followed by a quickly taken 'switch' pass can be an effective tactic. Under pressure however, the ball is often thrown up the line, toward the opponents' goal line to gain as much ground as possible.|$|E
25|$|United's chances {{continued}} to flow thick and fast. Michael Carrick rounded the goalkeeper {{only to be}} tackled on the line by Distin, whilst Patrice Evra had a shot turned onto the post by David James before things went {{from bad to worse}} for the Manchester side. With 12 minutes to play, Portsmouth counter-attacked down the right hand side, forcing a two-on-two situation. The ball was squared to Milan Baroš, who was felled by Kuszczak in the box. The referee had no hesitation in sending Kuszczak off, despite both Rooney and Anderson having gotten back <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> before the foul. Nevertheless, referee Atkinson's decision meant that United had no recognised goalkeeper available for the remaining time. Wayne Rooney offered his services, but that would have left United without a recognised centre-forward, so Rio Ferdinand was given the responsibility of attempting to save the penalty. However, although he dived the right way, Ferdinand was unable to get a hand to the ball, and Sulley Muntari gave Portsmouth the lead. United fought hard to get their deserved equaliser, but even Ronaldo's free kick was off-target, and United were knocked out of the FA Cup.|$|E

25|$|The tackle is {{complete}} when the ball-carrier {{is brought to}} the ground; this is judged {{to be the case}} as soon as a knee touches the ground while being held by the opposition. The tackler is designated as any player that also goes to ground when making the tackle. If no player goes to ground when tackling a player, then there is no tackler. The tackler has to immediately let the tackled player go and get to their feet before attempting to compete for the ball. If they do not get to their feet, they must roll away from the tackled player. The player that is tackled must immediately play the ball by pushing, passing or placing it in any direction. If a player is involved in the tackle, but does not go to ground, they must also release the tackled player, allowing them the chance to play the ball. Only players on their feet, and supporting their own weight, may pick up the ball and any players on the ground must not prevent them from gaining possession. Except for the tackler (player who went to ground when making the tackle) and the tackled player, all other players must enter the tackle area from <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> The tackle must not be dangerous. Dangerous tackles are ones that make contact with their opponent around their neck or head, with a locked elbow and extended arm ("stiff arm"), without using their arms ("shoulder charge"), when they are in the air, when they don't have the ball, or ones that drive or drop a players head or neck into the ground while their feet are in the air ("spear tackle"). Using a foot to trip a player is also illegal.|$|E
500|$|Morris {{was seen}} as an elegant and {{aggressive}} player, and is regarded alongside Clem Hill, Neil Harvey and Allan Border as one of Australia's greatest left-handed batsmen. Adept at playing against both pace and spin bowling, he was known for the variety of his shots {{on both sides of the}} wicket. Despite standing only fivefeetnineinches(1.75m), opponents spoke of his imposing appearance and his apparent air of complete composure at the crease. He had the ability to decide on his stroke early in the ball's flight and employed an unusual defensive technique, shuffling across the stumps to get <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> This created a perception that he was vulnerable to leg before wicket decisions and was vulnerable to losing his leg stump. Deft placement allowed him to pierce the gaps between fielders, and he was especially noted for his cover driving, square cutting and on-driving. Most of all, he was known for his back foot play, especially his pulling and hooking. According to cricket writer Ray Robinson, [...] "no other post-war batsman has rivalled his smashing counter-attacks on bowling swift enough to give the toughest team the tremors…A menacing bouncer colliding with Morris' bat was like a rocky fist against an iron jaw." [...] While many batsmen tended to evade deliveries aimed at the head, Morris was known for standing and hooking. In one interstate match, Miller, one of the world's leading pacemen, bowled an entire eight-ball over of bouncers. Morris hooked the five balls that he faced in the over for 4, 4, 4, 4 and 3.|$|E

[...] As a player and captain he set a wonderful example for his men to pattern after. [...] He was a powerful player, possessing such determination and fortitude that he would go through a stone wall if he had to. [...] He was their great all-around athlete; good in football, baseball and track. ...hen I grew to know him, I soon realized how his great, quiet, modest, though wonderful personality, made everybody idolize him. [...] Modesty was his most noticeable characteristic. [...] He was always the last to talk of his own athletic achievements." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{chosen a}} club and stroke {{to produce the}} desired distance, the player {{addresses}} the ball by taking their stance {{to the side of}} it and (except when the ball lies in a hazard) grounding the club <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> The golfer then takes their backswing, rotating the club, their arms and their upper body away from the ball, and then begins their swing, bringing the clubhead back down and around to hit the ball. A proper golf swing is a complex combination of motions, and slight variations in posture or positioning can make a great deal of difference in how well the ball is hit and how straight it travels. The general goal of a player making a full swing is to propel the clubhead as fast as possible while maintaining a single [...] "plane" [...] of motion of the club and clubhead, to send the clubhead into the ball along the desired path of travel and with the clubhead also pointing that direction.|$|E
