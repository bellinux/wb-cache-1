50|$|The Golden Bee is a Baby Bee {{that has}} a larger (8cc), stunt vented fuel tank and has been {{anodized}} gold. The larger tank allowed the planes to fly longer while the stunt vents allowed the airplanes to fly inverted without fuel running out or the engine cutting out.

40|$|The present {{invention}} is a sorbent-based atmosphere revitalization (SBAR) system using treatment beds each {{having a}} bed housing, {{primary and secondary}} moisture adsorbent layers, and a primary carbon dioxide adsorbent layer. Each bed includes a redirecting plenum between moisture adsorbent layers, inlet and outlet ports connected to inlet and outlet valves, respectively, and <b>bypass</b> <b>ports</b> connected to the redirecting plenums. The SBAR system also includes at least one bypass valve connected to the <b>bypass</b> <b>ports.</b> An inlet channel connects inlet valves to an atmosphere source. An outlet channel connects the bypass valve and outlet valves to the atmosphere source. A vacuum channel connects inlet valves, the bypass valve and outlet valves to a vacuum source. In use, one bed treats air from the atmosphere source while another bed undergoes regeneration. During regeneration, the inlet, bypass, and outlet valves sequentially open to the vacuum source, removing accumulated moisture and carbon dioxide...|$|R

5000|$|Air was {{provided}} {{from the air}} filter intake to the intake manifold by a Holley-designed, aluminum, twin-venturi, mechanically actuated throttle body, which was bolted atop the intake manifold. Each venturi was progressively bored and had a diameter of 50mm. To this unit were mounted the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor and Idle Air Control (IAC) valve (initially {{referred to as the}} [...] "AIS Motor"). A steel cable connected the accelerator pedal inside the vehicle to a mechanical linkage {{at the side of the}} throttle body, which acted to open the air intake butterfly valves inside the venturis. During idle these butterfly valves were closed, so a <b>bypass</b> <b>port</b> and the IAC valve were used to control the intake of air.|$|E

50|$|I-99/US 220 {{continues}} northeast {{between a}} mountain {{to the east}} in an agricultural valley to the west, coming to an interchange with the southern terminus of PA 865 near Bellwood. Near Tipton, the freeway has a trumpet interchange with US 220 Bus. that provides access to DelGrosso's Amusement Park. The highway continues to Tyrone, where it crosses the Little Juniata River before an interchange with PA 453. Past Tyrone, I-99/US 220 passes through forested areas and reaches a diamond interchange that serves PA 350 and the northern terminus of US 220 Bus. near Bald Eagle. From here, the freeway continues into Centre County and runs through rural areas before turning north to <b>bypass</b> <b>Port</b> Matilda to the west. I-99/US 220 has an interchange with the southern terminus of US 220 Alternate (US 220 Alt.) before the two routes merge into the US 322 freeway and head east concurrent with US 322. The freeway heads northeast away from Port Matilda and continues through more forests. I-99/US 220/US 322 curves southeast and reaches an interchange with Gray's Woods Boulevard near Gray's Woods. A short distance later, US 322 Bus. splits off at a northbound exit and southbound entrance to head into State College. Immediately after this interchange, a southbound exit and northbound entrance serves Valley Vista Drive and provides access to US 322 Bus. from southbound I-99/US 220/westbound US 322. The freeway continues east into more developed areas with some woods and comes to a diamond interchange at Waddle Road that serves Toftrees. The highway passes {{to the north of}} the Pennsylvania State University campus before I-99/US 220 split from the US 322 freeway at an interchange that also has access to the university by way of East Park Avenue.|$|E
40|$|The {{derivation}} and {{solution of}} the two and three dimensional dynamic equations for a small pipeline inspection&# 13; gauge (Pig) through a liquid pipeline is the main aim of this work. These equations {{can be used for}} synthesis of speed&# 13; controller of a pig by using a <b>bypass</b> <b>port</b> in Pig. Momentum and energy equations are employed to study the&# 13; influence of flow field on the Pigâ€™s trajectory. The pig is assumed to be a small rigid body with a bypass hole in its&# 13; body. The variation of the diameter of the <b>bypass</b> <b>port,</b> which is controlled by a valve, is considered in this&# 13; formulation. The path of the pig or geometry of the pipeline is assumed to be 2 D and 3 D curve. 2 D and 3 D&# 13; simulations of the pig motion are performed individually and a case has been solved and discussed for each of them. &# 13; The simulation results show that the derived equations are valid and effective for online estimating of the position,&# 13; velocity and forces acting on the pig at any time of its motion...|$|E
40|$|Jaime Zacharias Phacodynamics Laboratory, Pasteur Ophthalmic Clinic, Santiago, Chile Purpose: Ultrasound {{activation}} of phacoemulsification (phaco) tips can create considerable thermal energy that {{may increase the}} risk of tissue damage during cataract surgery. The {{purpose of this study was}} to define the thermal profiles of three phaco tip designs in simulated surgical conditions. Methods: In this laboratory investigation, sleeved phaco tips (mini-flared KelmanÂ® tip with aspiration <b>bypass</b> <b>port</b> and IntrepidÂ® Balanced Tip with aspiration <b>bypass</b> <b>port,</b> and MST A 1 bent-mini phaco tip (without aspiration bypass) were tested using an ultrasonic phaco device operated in torsional mode at power levels of 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % amplitude. An automated fixture applied a 30 g load to simulate compression against the incision site, leading to friction between the silicone sleeve and the titanium tip. Temperature was recorded by high rate infrared imaging under conditions of free flow and occlusion, which was simulated by clamping the aspiration line. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Results: Baseline temperatures of ~ 26 Â°C were observed for all tips. During ultrasonic operation at 50 %, 75 %, and 100 % amplitude, temperatures were lower for the mini-flared and balanced tips versus the bent-mini tip, both when load was applied and during occlusion. The bent-mini tip reached temperatures as high as 70 Â°C during occlusion with load when operated at 100 % amplitude, whereas the mini-flared tip remained < 50 Â°C, and the balanced tip remained < 36 Â°C in all test conditions. For the mini-flared and balanced tips, temperature increases during operation were not markedly different from free flow and no-load conditions when occlusion or frictional events were simulated. Conclusion: In all experiments for each tip design, increasing ultrasound power was associated with greater increases in tip temperature. Tip temperatures increased with applied load, but marked temperature increases during occlusion were observed only with the bent-mini tip. The balanced tip produced minimal thermal peaks in all tests. Keywords: aspiration bypass, balanced tip, cataract, occlusion, temperature, thermal imagin...|$|E
