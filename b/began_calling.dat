5|$|Specter {{voted in}} favor of the Senate's version of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on February 10, 2009; he was one of only three Republicans to break ranks with the party and support the bill, which was favored by President Barack Obama and was {{unanimously}} supported by the Democratic senators. As a result of his support, many in the Republican mainstream <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> for his removal from office.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or, if of Scottish descent, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. This process was quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the heralds in Britain could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 {{the synagogue}} began {{granting}} women some pulpit honors, giving the Sisterhood President gelila, and in 1966 granting married couples hagbaha and gelila (the honors of lifting and re-wrapping the Torah {{after it has}} been read). In the 1970s, women became more involved in the synagogue's political and religious activities: in 1972, the first woman was elected to the board of trustees, and in 1975, the congregation <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> women to the Torah and counting women in the minyan, the latter just two years after the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly voted nine to four in favor of this innovation.|$|E
5|$|On 24 March the French army retreated through Brussels. Dumouriez <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> in his {{detachments}} such as Harville's corps. At {{this point}} Dumouriez opened {{negotiations with the}} Austrians. He offered to evacuate Belgium if his armies were allowed an unmolested retreat. The terms were accepted and the French armies withdrew to camps behind the border. The Army of Holland was allowed to march through enemy lines and took position near Lille. The Army of the Ardennes was posted at Maulde, the Army of the North at Bruille-Saint-Amand, and the Army of Belgium at Condé-sur-l'Escaut and Valenciennes. Geertruidenberg was evacuated on 2 April and Breda on 3 April.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opinion in}} Texas was divided. Editorials in the United States began advocating {{complete}} independence for Texas. After several men staged a minor revolt against customs duties in Anahuac in June, local leaders <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> {{for a public}} meeting {{to determine whether a}} majority of settlers favored independence, a return to federalism, or the status quo.

Although some leaders worried that Mexican officials would see this type of gathering as a step toward revolution, by the end of August most communities had agreed to send delegates to the Consultation, scheduled for October 15. In the interim, many communities formed militias to protect themselves from a potential attack by military forces.|$|E
5|$|The PHL {{lasted only}} two seasons. Over {{the next two}} decades, other leagues and clubs {{occasionally}} issued challenges, but none were accepted by the Cup's trustees. Since 1926, no non-NHL team has played for the Cup, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL. In addition, with no major professional hockey league left to challenge it, the NHL <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> its league champions the world champions, notwithstanding {{the lack of any}} interleague championship. In doing so, the NHL copied a policy that had been adopted by the then still-fledgling National Football League from its start in 1920 (and which the National Basketball Association would also assert upon its founding in 1946).|$|E

5|$|When Metcalfe and Noble left to {{form their}} own group in September 1963, the {{remaining}} members asked Barrett and guitarist Bob Klose to join. Waters switched to the bass and by January 1964, the group {{became known as the}} Abdabs, or the Screaming Abdabs. During late 1964, the band used the names Leonard's Lodgers, Spectrum Five, and eventually, the Tea Set. Sometime during late 1965, the Tea Set <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> itself the Pink Floyd Sound, later the Pink Floyd Blues Band and by early 1966, Pink Floyd.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the Diệm regime {{began to}} lose its tight control over the country as civil unrest spread {{as a result of}} the Buddhist crisis. Large scale demonstrations by the Buddhist {{majority}} erupted in response to the government shootings of nine Buddhists in Huế who were protesting against a ban on the flying of the Buddhist flag during Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> for his removal from power. Thảo was part of the many plots that engulfed Saigon, destabilising the regime. Aiming for a 15 July coup, Tuyến consulted with Thảo regarding his plans, but Tuyến was too closely associated with Nhu to recruit the necessary military aid and he was subsequently exiled by Nhu.|$|E
5|$|In April 2008, {{following}} the successful discovery of HMAS Sydney, several parties <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> for a dedicated search for Centaur. By {{the end of}} 2008, the Australian Federal and Queensland State governments had formed a joint committee and contributed A$2 million each towards a search, and tenders to supply equipment (including the search vessel, side-scan sonar systems, and a remotely operated inspection submersible) were opened in February 2009, and awarded during the year. The search, conducted from the Defence Maritime Services vessel Seahorse Spirit and overseen by shipwreck hunter David Mearns, commenced during the weekend of 12–13 December 2009. The initial search area off Cape Moreton covered , with the search team given 35 days to locate and film the wreck before funding was exhausted.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Kim Deal {{was eager}} to {{continue}} recording and performing. At first, she envisioned her next album as a solo record, on which she would play all of the instrument parts. When she was recording initial demos for the project, she asked Kelley to play on some of them, to distract her from her drug difficulties. Since Kelley was now also involved, Deal {{decided not to go}} solo, but formed a new group. She recruited Macpherson to play drums, musician Luis Lerma, bass, and Nate Farley, guitar. Later, Kelley dropped out of the project for rehabilitation and moved to Saint Paul, Minnesota. For fun, Deal <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> herself Tammy Ampersand, and the group, Tammy and the Amps. This later became simply the Amps.|$|E
5|$|Patricia Jones {{never made}} it to her house that evening, {{according}} to her husband. Walter Jones filed a missing persons report with police the next day and <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> people he thought might have seen his wife. He got a lead when he spoke to friends of Patricia's who carpooled to work with her. The friends told Jones that Patricia had reported receiving a phone call that day from an unnamed woman who wanted to meet with her. She had asked the carpool driver to drop her off at a street corner in Independence, which he had done. The occupants of the carpool had seen a woman waiting for Jones in another car at the shop but did not recognize her. They nevertheless provided a description of the unknown woman to Jones.|$|E
5|$|The Judge Dredd {{comic strip}} is mostly set in Mega-City One in the 22nd century, {{on the east}} coast of the former United States. When President Robert L. Booth started the Third World War in 2070 (see Atomic Wars), the Judges – until then no more than a police force with {{extraordinary}} powers – deposed Booth, overthrew the Constitution and seized control of all institutions of government. Disillusioned with the elected politicians who had caused so much destruction to their country, much of the American public supported this move at the time. For the next four decades America was a dictatorship. (Mega-City One and the other American mega-cities became sovereign city-states early during this period, and the US ceased to exist.) Although the Judges were initially popular, the citizens soon grew to resent their new leaders as much as they had the old, until activists <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> for a return to democratic government.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} witnesses, {{including}} Hannah Cox, {{testified to the}} events of the evening of 26 May and of the following morning. The first witnesses to attract significant cross-examination by William Reader, Thornton's barrister, were the two factory workers, William Lavell and Joseph Bird, who had matched Thornton's shoes to the footprints in the harrowed field. Under cross-examination, both admitted that it had rained heavily between the time the footprints were made and the time they attempted to match the prints. Constable Dales told the jury that Thornton admitted having sex with Ashford before he was searched: that is, before his bloodstained clothing came to light. Mr Freer, a Birmingham surgeon who conducted the post-mortem, testified as to its results, and stated that except for the vaginal lacerations, there were no signs of violence on Ashford's person, and that those cuts could have been caused by consensual sexual relations. Freer's testimony concluded the prosecution case, and as the defendant declined to exercise his right to himself make a statement to the court, the defence <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{conspiracy}} failed during World War I, the movement being suppressed {{at the time}} and several of its key leaders hanged or incarcerated, several prominent Ghadarites also managed to flee India to Japan and Thailand. The concept of a revolutionary movement for independence also found a revival amongst later generation Indian leaders, most notably Subhas Chandra Bose who, towards the mid-1930s, <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> for a more radical approach towards colonial domination. During World War II, several of these leaders were instrumental in seeking Axis support to revive such a concept. Bose himself, {{from the very beginning of}} World War II, actively evaluated the concept of revolutionary movement against the Raj, interacting with Japan and subsequently escaping to Germany to raise an Indian armed force, the Indische Legion, to fight in India against Britain. He later returned to Southeast Asia to take charge of the Indian National Army which was formed following the labour of exiled nationalists, efforts from within Japan to revive a similar concept, and the direction and leadership of people like Mohan Singh, Giani Pritam Singh, and Rash Behari Bose. The most famous of these saw the formation of the Indian Independence League, the Indian National Army and ultimately the Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind in Southeast Asia.|$|E
5|$|Beginning about 6:45, {{many members}} of the public <b>began</b> <b>calling</b> NBC network and {{affiliate}} switchboards. Some demanded the game be shown to its conclusion; others wanted to know if Heidi would start on time. These calls jammed the switchboards, and even blew repeated fuses in them, preventing the executives from getting through to each other to resolve the situation. NBC protocol required an operations order from Connal, to countermand the midweek written orders, but Cline received no call from the increasingly desperate Connal, who was frustrated by the switchboard issues. Without such an order, and not knowing of Goodman's approval, Cline made the decision that Heidi would start on time. The television audience saw Smith return Turner's kickoff out of the end zone to the Oakland 22-yard line with 1:01 remaining. Burbank BOC played the closing football theme and gave the word cue, to the outraged shock of Ellis and Connal, and the connection was irretrievably broken. Although the western United States continued to view the game, the eastern half of the nation instead saw a little girl on a Swiss mountain and was unaware that Oakland was in the course of scoring two touchdowns to win the game.|$|E
