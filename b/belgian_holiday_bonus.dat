5000|$|Aside from Will, Grace {{also has}} a close {{relationship}} with her assistant, Karen Walker, a rich, alcoholic socialite who does virtually no work. Karen is nevertheless useful to Grace, as she pays for her employer's health insurance, gives Grace <b>holiday</b> <b>bonuses,</b> and occasionally uses her society connections to help Grace get work. Otherwise, Karen spends her [...] "work" [...] hours drinking and belittling Grace. Karen routinely criticizes Grace's choices in fashion (usually by disdainfully asking, [...] "Honey, what's this all about?") and men. Nonetheless, Grace and Karen become close friends over the years. Grace eventually learns to look past Karen's faults, and Karen occasionally does stop ridiculing her to reveal a softer, more caring side. In one episode, Grace stands up to Milo (played by Andy García) who refuses to go on a second date with Karen, who was going through a divorce with her husband Stan and was very vulnerable at the time. In another instance, Karen turns down Grace's proposal for a business loan to protect Grace, who didn't really have a strong business plan.|$|R

5000|$|During the Second World War Belgium was {{occupied}} by Germany. While the facist group known as the Black Brigade were collaborators with the Germans, they were opposed by the underground Witte Brigade. Important activities of the Witte Brigade were distributing anti-German propaganda, the creation of lists of collaborators and organizing patriotic demonstrations on key <b>Belgian</b> <b>holidays,</b> such as 21 July (National Day) and 11 November (Anniversary of the German surrender in the First World War).

5000|$|While small {{businesses}} employ {{over half the}} workforce in the US [...] and have been established as a main driving force behind job creation, {{the quality of the}} jobs these businesses create has been called into question. Small businesses generally employ individuals from the Secondary labour market. As a result, in the U.S., wages are 49% higher for employees of large firms. Additionally, many {{small businesses}} struggle or are unable to provide employees with benefits they would be given at larger firms. Research from the U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that employees of large firms are 17% more likely to receive benefits including salary, paid leave, paid <b>holidays,</b> <b>bonuses,</b> insurance, and retirement plans. Both lower wages and fewer benefits combine to create a job turnover rate among U.S. small businesses that is three times higher than large firms. Employees of small businesses also must adapt to the higher failure rate of small firms, which means that {{they are more likely to}} lose their job due to the firm going under. In the U.S. 69% of small businesses last at least two years, but this percentage drops to 51% for firms reaching five years in operation. The U.S. Small Business Administration counts companies with as much as $35.5 million in sales and 1,500 employees as [...] "small businesses", depending on the industry. Outside government, companies with less than $7 million in sales and fewer than five hundred employees are widely considered small businesses.|$|R
