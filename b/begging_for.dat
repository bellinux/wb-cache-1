5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent repetitive squawking when <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E

5|$|The Mascarene {{martin is}} a {{relatively}} quiet bird, {{but it has a}} warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; some calls given by perched birds end in a glissando. Other vocalisations may be used during mating or displays of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering sound when <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent.|$|E

He follows them to the railway station and tries to gain the {{attention}} of Viji, but she is unable to recognise him.

Cheenu continues his futile attempts to gain her attention, and the train eventually leaves with Viji not recognising him.

5|$|Bhikshatana is {{considered}} a gentler form of Shiva's fierce aspect Bhairava and a gentle phase between Bhairava's two gruesome forms, one of which decapitates the god Brahma and the other of which murders the god Vishnu's gatekeeper. Bhikshatana is the form of Bhairava that Shiva assumes to atone for his sin of severing Brahma's fifth head. He wanders the universe {{in the form of}} a naked Kapali mendicant, <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> alms with Brahma's kapala (skullcap) as his begging bowl, until his sin is expiated upon reaching the holy city of Varanasi.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile magpies begin {{foraging}} {{on their}} own three weeks after leaving the nest, and mostly feeding themselves by six months old. Some birds continue <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> food until eight or nine months of age, but are usually ignored. Birds reach adult size by their first year. The age at which young birds disperse varies across the country, and depends on the aggressiveness of the dominant adult of the corresponding sex; males are usually evicted at a younger age. Many leave at around a year old, but the age of departure may range from eight months to four years.|$|E
5|$|Coffin did {{not enjoy}} being {{in the public eye}} and {{considered}} his job soliciting financial aid as <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> money, which he thought to be demeaning. He stated in his autobiography that he gladly gave up the position once a new leader for the organization was selected. Coffin became concerned about giving money freely to all blacks, some of whom he was believed {{would never be able to}} care for themselves unless adequate education and farms were provided. He also believed the Society should give their limited resources only to those who were best able to benefit from them. The Society continued to operate until 1870, the same year that black men were guaranteed the right to vote under the Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Monmouth {{fled from}} the field of battle, but was {{captured}} in a ditch on 8 July (either at Ringwood in the New Forest, or at Horton in Dorset). Parliament had passed an Act of Attainder, on 13 June sentencing Monmouth to death as a traitor, Therefore, no trial was needed before his execution. Despite <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> mercy and claims of conversion to Roman Catholicism, he was beheaded at Tower Hill by Jack Ketch on 15 July 1685. It is said that it took multiple blows of the axe to sever his head. Though some sources say it took eight blows, the official Tower of London website says it took five blows, while Charles Spencer, in his book Blenheim, claims it was seven. His dukedoms of Monmouth and Buccleuch were forfeited, but the subsidiary titles of the dukedom of Monmouth were restored to the Duke of Buccleuch.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{fortress}} had been captured, Murad placed his own garrison of Janissaries and ordered {{his men to}} repair the walls. Perlati and his soldiers came to Skanderbeg, <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> mercy. Skanderbeg pardoned his soldiers for the surrender and even thanked them for holding out {{for as long as}} they did. Skanderbeg continued to shadow the Ottoman army as it headed back home in the hopes of dealing some serious damage, but his forces were not strong enough to risk provoking them. In October of the same year, Murad managed to inflict a serious a defeat on John Hunyadi's forces in Kosovo. Skanderbeg had planned to join Hunyadi's offensive with 20,000 men, but he was not able to get there in time due to Đurađ Branković blocking the roads to Kosovo.|$|E
5|$|Orkos– Also {{known as}} The Giver in Rise of the Warrior, {{he was the}} keeper of oaths sworn to the gods and {{is the son of}} Ares and Alecto. In Rise of the Warrior, he {{followed}} the redeemed warrior through his journey and imprisoned him in the Prison of the Damned due to the warrior breaking his father's oath. Later in Ascension, Orkos helped Kratos by enabling him to see through illusions. He also provided Kratos with his Oath Stone, allowing Kratos to be in two places at once. Orkos revealed to Kratos Ares' and the Furies' plan to overthrow Olympus, and that Ares chose Kratos to help him do so. After Kratos defeated the Furies, Orkos told him that in order to be free from Ares' bond, Kratos would have to kill Orkos. After <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> an honorable death, Kratos reluctantly killed him, freeing them both from Ares. The character was voiced by Troy Baker in Ascension.|$|E

5|$|The female incubates for 12–14 {{days before}} the altricial chicks are hatched naked and blind. Fledging takes another 10–19 (average 13.6) days, with both parents feeding the young and {{removing}} faecal sacs. The nest is often ill-concealed {{compared with those of}} other species, and many breeding attempts fail due to predation. The young are fed by the parents for up to three weeks after leaving the nest, and will follow the adults <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> food. If the female starts another nest, the male alone will feed the fledged young. Second broods are common, with the female reusing the same nest if the brood was successful, and three broods may be raised in the south of the common blackbird's range.|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations {{of the two}} martins {{are quite}} different. Mascarene martin has a warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight or when perched; some calls given by perched birds end in a glissando. Other vocalisations may be used during mating or {{displays}} of aggression. There is a chip contact call, and the young birds produce a fast twittering sound when <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> food. Birds wintering in mainland Africa are usually silent. The song of Brazza's martin consists {{of a series of}} short notes increasing in frequency which are followed by a complex buzz and sometimes completed by a number of clicks. The song becomes increasingly loud, although the final clicks are quite soft. The song {{is similar to that of}} the banded martin, and does not resemble that of the Mascarene martin, suggesting unresolved taxonomic problems.|$|E
5|$|Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm is a Buddhist {{temple in}} Ho Chi Minh City, {{the largest city}} in Vietnam. It was founded in 1965 and is the spiritual birthplace of the khất sĩ {{tradition}} of Vietnamese Buddhism that attempts to recreate the original tradition of the Buddhist sangha by walking barefoot and <b>begging</b> <b>for</b> alms. The temple is located at 7 Nguyễn Trung Trực Street, in Bình Thạnh District.
