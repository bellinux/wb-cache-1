[...] and [...] "No I'm not an angel, but at least I'm trying". In [...] "No Angel", Beyoncé {{declares}} that her partner is [...] "no angel either", remarking {{that he is not}} perfect. However, despite his imperfections, the protagonist admits she still loves him. Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "nderneath the pretty face is something complicated / I come with a side of trouble / But I know that's why you're staying" [...] in the song aimed to inform her [...] "roguish" [...] male lover. The lines of the chorus are sung by Beyoncé with pronouncing one word at a time in longer intervals. A short interlude about [...] "mov things to the bedroom" [...] is interpolated in the song. Beyoncé forgoes lyrical subtlety during that part, singing explicit lines such as [...] "Tell me do you wanna ride?" [...] and [...] "First <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> legs go back on your head, and whatever you want, yeah baby, I'm bad". Fuse's Mark Sundstrom interpreted the song's message as talking about the singer's husband Jay-Z and added [...] "She loves him more because she knows him entirely, accepting he's not perfect or without a past". Complex editor Claire Lobenfeld considered its lyrical content to be about how a [...] "couple's respective internal messiness can bring them closer together".|$|E
500|$|In {{the face}} of the rock, south from the town, is the famous stone, known by the name of the mistress-stone; it resembles a door exactly; and is in the very front of this rock, which is twenty or thirty fathom [...] {{perpendicular}} in height, the figure of it being discernible about the distance of a mile; upon the lintel of this door, every bachelor-wooer is by an ancient custom obliged in honour to give a specimen of his affection for the love of his mistress, and it is thus; he is to stand on his left foot, having the one half of his sole over the rock, and then he draws the right foot further out to the left, and in this posture bowing, he puts both his fists further out to the right foot; and then after he has performed this, he has acquired no small reputation, being always after it accounted worthy of the finest mistress in the world: they firmly believe that this achievement is always attended with the desired success.This being the custom of the place, one of the inhabitants very gravely desired me to let him know the time limited by me for trying of this piece of gallantry before I design’d to leave the place, that he might attend me; I told him this performance would have a quite contrary effect upon me, by robbing me <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life and mistress at the same moment.|$|E

2500|$|On October 6, 2004, Kiedis {{published}} a memoir titled Scar Tissue, which he co-wrote with author Larry Sloman. [...] The book was {{originally intended to}} be a collection of stories of his childhood drug use, but evolved into a complete autobiography. He further explained: [...] "One would just kind of assume that with all the [...] consumption that my memory would be a bit shoddy. [...] But it's actually pretty lucid, and better than <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> parents', or any of my friends'. My friends tried to recount these same stories, and they were like, 'Wow, I don't ... were we there?'" [...] The book was an international bestseller.|$|E
2500|$|During the South Carolina Democratic Debate in Myrtle Beach, Edwards {{sought to}} {{distinguish}} himself from Senators Obama and Clinton, and criticized {{them for their}} attacks and [...] "big city" [...] politics. As soon {{as he began to}} question how the attacks helped, he was widely cheered by the audience for in what many people thought was what distinguished Edwards from negative campaigning. Saying [...] "This kind of squabbling, how many children are going to get healthcare? How many {{people are going to get}} an education from this? How many kids are going to be able to go to college because of this? We have got to understand and I respect <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> fellow candidates, but we have got to understand that this is not about us personally, it is about what we are trying to do for this country and what we believe in", Edwards began to get applause from several members of the audience.|$|E

5000|$|The album art, {{conceived}} by Nascimento, was drawn by a California-based comics artist Ramiro Montanez. [...] Nascimento describes the album cover: [...] "It’s metaphorical {{in the sense}} that it depicts <b>both</b> aspects <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life; light and darkness. The rough ocean represents the turmoil I’ve experienced while the sky and clouds represent the better parts <b>of</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|R
2500|$|Kenneth R. Miller, {{a biology}} {{professor}} from Brown University and noted author and commentator {{opposed to the}} intelligent design and creationist movements, was the first witness. He testified as an expert witness that [...] "Intelligent design is not a testable theory and as such is not generally accepted by the scientific community." [...] He said {{that the idea of}} intelligent design was not subject to falsification, and demonstrated that many claims made by intelligent-design advocates against evolution were invalid. Asked what the harm was in reading the statement, Miller gave a two-fold response. 1) [...] "t falsely undermines the scientific status of evolutionary theory and gives students a false understanding of what theory actually means." [...] And 2) [...] "As a person of faith who was blessed with two daughters, who raised <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> daughters in the church, and had they been given an education in which they were explicitly or implicitly forced to choose between God and science, I would have been furious, because I want my children to keep their religious faith." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brian Viglione was {{introduced}} to the drums by his father on Christmas Day at age five with his interest quickly deepening at age nine when rock music became a primary focus and passion. A pivotal moment occurred in 1990 when Viglione's father brought him to see The Elvin Jones Jazz Machine and Viglione witnessed his first up-close exposure to the drummer who would become his principal inspiration on the instrument. [...] "I spent every possible hour jamming with my friends up in our attic from the time I was in the fourth grade through when I graduated high school. You could hardly tear us all away from playing!" [...] At sixteen years old, Viglione began playing gigs in clubs with bands around New England before moving from New Hampshire to Boston in 1999. There, he played with several Boston punk bands on both drums and bass guitar. [...] "I knew it was 'now or never' when I moved from my small town to pursue my dream. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> parents understood how dedicated I was to making it come true and I was very lucky to have their encouragement through all of the craziness and uncertainty of those times." [...] Viglione played bass for a year in a and was exposed to music that played a large and influential role in his playing. [...] "I was listening to a lot of Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Black Flag, Swans, Miles Davis, Diamanda Galas, The Gun Club, Einstürzende Neubauten, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane records. Very cathartic music that taught me a lot about the beauty of how to balance using space and aggression in music." ...|$|E
