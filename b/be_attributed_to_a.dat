5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lack of technology, and to {{the daunting task of}} reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Cindy can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{deepening}} low-pressure area that tracked from the Great Lakes as a related cold front traveled southeastward and became stationary over the Atlantic, extending from northern Florida to Bermuda. On July 5, the front spawned a separate cut-off cold-core low {{off the coast}} of the Carolinas. This complex scenario resulted in the formation of a tropical depression later during the day, which slowly meandered north-northeastward. Tropical cyclones of this origin typically remain at a small size and evolve slowly, and Cindy complied to this pattern.|$|E
5|$|Health {{indicators}} in Ratanakiri are {{the worst}} in Cambodia. Life expectancy is 39 years for men and 43 years for women. Malaria, tuberculosis, intestinal parasites, cholera, diarrhea, and vaccine-preventable diseases are endemic. Ratanakiri has very high rates of maternal and child mortality; in Ratanakiri and neighboring Mondulkiri (whose figures were combined {{in the most recent}} survey), over 10% of children die before the age of five. Ratanakiri also has the country's highest rates of severe malnutrition. Ratanakiri residents' poor health can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> variety of factors, including poverty, remoteness of villages, poor quality medical services, and language and cultural barriers that prevent Khmer Loeu from obtaining medical care. The province has one referral hospital, 10 health centers, and 17 health posts. Medical equipment and supplies are minimal, and most health facilities are staffed by nurses or midwives, who are often poorly trained and irregularly paid.|$|E

5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, an affront to the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} Alvin can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} wave that crossed Dakar, Africa on May9. The wave remained poorly organized {{as it moved}} across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea through mid-May. On May20, the disturbance crossed Central America and emerged into the eastern Pacific Ocean, where convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—gradually began to increase over the well-defined center; {{this led to the}} formation of a tropical depression by 0000UTC on May27, approximately 345mi (555km) south of the southern tip of Baja California. Following designation, the depression was slow to organize as a result of moderate easterly shear; by 0000UTC on May29, however, the system had gained enough organization to be considered a tropical storm. After attaining its peak intensity with winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1003mb (hPa; 29.62inHg), increasingly stable air and higher wind shear caused Alvin to begin a weakening trend. At 0600UTC on May30, it weakened to a tropical depression, and by 0000UTC on June1, Alvin degenerated into a non-convective remnant low. The remnant low continued generally westward until dissipation six days later.|$|E

25|$|Congenital {{scoliosis}} can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> malformation of {{the spine}} during weeks three to six in utero due to a failure of formation, a failure of segmentation, {{or a combination of}} stimuli.

25|$|Weaknesses: This model cannot {{explain the}} {{transport}} kinetics of large protein cargo, such as collagen. Additionally, tubular connections are not prevalent in plant cells.

If the membranes are continuous, that suggests the existence of mechanisms that preserve the unique biochemical gradients observed throughout the Golgi apparatus.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} tobacco {{smoke in the}} form of the Narghile can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> variety of factors. French anthropologist Kamel Chaoucachi has isolated the three main elements of the narghile’s appeal, which include “passing of the smoking hose, conversation of the actors, and the nature of time within the created situation.” These factors highlight the social benefits of smoking the Narghile and the general increase in trendiness of the experience.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} sheaves {{had become a}} {{mainstream}} part of mathematics, with use by no means restricted to algebraic topology. It was later discovered that the logic in categories of sheaves is intuitionistic logic (this observation is now {{often referred to as}} Kripkendash&Joyal semantics, but probably should <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of authors). This shows that some of the facets of sheaf theory can also be traced back as far as Leibniz.|$|E
25|$|In a {{case-control study}} done {{following}} 5,286 Californians over a 28-year {{period in which}} variables were controlled for (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level), participants who went to church on a frequent basis (defined as attending a religious service once a week or more) were 36% less likely to die during that period. However, this can be partly <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> better lifestyle since religious people tend to drink and smoke less and eat a healthier diet.|$|E

25|$|Some {{economic}} {{experts have}} argued that the development gap between China and other emerging economies such as Brazil, Argentina and India can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large extent to China's early focus on ambitious infrastructure projects: while China invested roughly 9% of its GDP on infrastructure in the 1990s and 2000s, most emerging economies invested only 2% to 5% of their GDP. This considerable spending gap allowed the Chinese economy to grow at near optimal conditions while many South American economies suffered from various development bottlenecks (poor transportation networks, aging power grids, mediocre schools...).|$|E
25|$|The behavioral-based {{approach}} to detecting rootkits attempts to infer {{the presence of}} a rootkit by looking for rootkit-like behavior. For example, by profiling a system, differences in the timing and frequency of API calls or in overall CPU utilization can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rootkit. The method is complex and is hampered by a high incidence of false positives. Defective rootkits can sometimes introduce very obvious changes to a system: the Alureon rootkit crashed Windows systems after a security update exposed a design flaw in its code. Logs from a packet analyzer, firewall, or intrusion prevention system may present evidence of rootkit behaviour in a networked environment.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{susceptibility}} to decompression sickness has components which can <b>be</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> specific cause, and components which {{appear to be}} random. The random component makes successive decompressions a poor test of susceptibility. Obesity and high serum lipid levels have been implicated by some studies as risk factors, and risk seems to increase with age. Another study has also shown that older subjects tended to bubble more than younger subjects for reasons not yet known, but no trends between weight, body fat, or gender and bubbles were identified, {{and the question of}} why some {{people are more likely to}} form bubbles than others remains unclear.|$|E
