5|$|Since a {{partially}} filled <b>ballonet</b> would cause longitudinal instability, {{due to the}} mass of air rolling fore or aft {{in the direction of}} pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the <b>ballonet</b> into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the <b>ballonet</b> without affecting the stability of the airship.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} <b>ballonet</b> be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the <b>ballonet</b> would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the <b>ballonet</b> to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|To {{control the}} {{movement}} of the hydrogen and air within the envelope, the Patrie was equipped with five valves, some of which operated automatically, and others which could also be operated manually by the pilot via cords. The valves on the gas-bag released hydrogen automatically when the pressure exceeded two inches of water (inAq) (500Pa, 0.723psi); whereas the <b>ballonet</b> valves opened when the air pressure exceeded 0.78inAq (195Pa, 0.282psi), thus ensuring that air was driven out of the <b>ballonet</b> before there was any loss of hydrogen from the gas-bag. The automatic operation of the valves was a factor in the duration of its final (unmanned) flight (see Final flight section below). The pressure in the <b>ballonet</b> was maintained by an engine-driven fan, for which an electrical back-up was provided so that the pressures could be maintained {{in the event of an}} engine failure or when the engine had to be switched off for maintenance purposes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ballonets</b> may {{typically}} {{be used in}} non-rigid or semi-rigid airships, commonly {{with multiple}} <b>ballonets</b> located both fore and aft to maintain balance and to control the pitch of the airship.|$|R
50|$|Skyships are {{equipped}} {{with a pair of}} <b>ballonets,</b> one forward and one aft comprising a maximum of 27% of the envelope's gross volume. <b>Ballonets</b> are air-filled compartments within an airship that compensate for the expansion and contraction of the helium, thereby maintaining envelope pressure. They can be filled, or partially filled, with air. Emptying of air is done through four valves under the envelope. The valves open automatically as the ship climbs; air is released, the <b>ballonets</b> collapse and the helium expands. During descent, air from the propeller ducts, and/or electric fans is used to inflate the <b>ballonets,</b> and keep the envelope from collapsing. The <b>ballonets</b> can be independently filled by using shut-off dampers in the air supply trunking. Through differential inflation a measure of pitch trim can be obtained.|$|R
50|$|The {{envelope}} {{itself is}} the structure, including textiles that contains the buoyant gas. Internally two <b>ballonets</b> placed in the front part and in the rear part of the hull contains air. surrounding one or more gas-bags or <b>ballonets</b> within it.|$|R
25|$|The Lebaudy République (later {{known as}} La République) was a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{built for the}} French army in Moisson, France, by sugar manufacturers Lebaudy Frères. She was a sister ship of the Patrie, the main {{differences between the two}} being in the dimensions of the gasbag (or 'envelope') and the <b>ballonet.</b> Although she was operationally successful, the République crashed in 1909 due to a mechanical failure, killing all four crew members.|$|E
500|$|The main {{structural}} {{components of}} the Patrie, like those of its predecessor, were the envelope (or [...] "gas-bag"), a nickel-steel frame or keel, and a gondola suspended from the frame on steel cables. Contained within the envelope was a <b>ballonet,</b> the function of which was to ensure that sufficient gas pressure was maintained in the envelope at all times, irrespective {{of the degree of}} expansion or contraction of the lifting gas. Attached to both the gas-bag and the gondola were active and passive control surfaces to provide lateral and vertical stability and to give the pilot directional control over the airship.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{structural}} {{components of}} the République, {{like those of the}} Patrie, were the gasbag, a nickel-steel frame or keel, and a gondola suspended from the frame on steel cables. Contained within the envelope was a <b>ballonet,</b> the function of which was to ensure that sufficient gas pressure was maintained in the envelope at all times, irrespective of the degree of expansion or contraction of the lifting gas. These components were essentially the same as for the Patrie, the only differences initially being in the dimensions of the envelope and the <b>ballonet,</b> which are given in the Specifications section below. The modular structure enabled the envelope volume to be varied without affecting [...] the keel or the gondola. For a more detailed description, see Lebaudy Patrie.|$|E
40|$|An airship model {{made by the}} Goodyear Rubber Company {{was filled}} with water and {{suspended}} from a beam. The deformations of the envelope were studied under the following conditions: 1) both <b>ballonets</b> empty; 2) forward <b>ballonets</b> filled with air; 3) rear <b>ballonets</b> filled with air; and 4) both <b>ballonets</b> filled with air. Photographs were taken to record the deflections under each of these conditions, and a study was made to determine the minimum head of water necessary to maintain the longitudinal axis of the envelope under these conditions. It was concluded that any pressure sufficient to keep the airship full may be used. It appears that a pressure of one inch of water would provide a suitable factor of safety, and therefore it is the pressure that is recommended...|$|R
5000|$|A {{non-rigid airship}} relies entirely on {{internal}} gas pressure {{to retain its}} shape during flight. Unlike the rigid design, the nonrigid airship's gas envelope has no compartments. However, it typically has smaller internal bags or [...] "ballonets" [...] containing air. At sea level, the <b>ballonets</b> are filled with air. As altitude is increased, the lifting gas expands and air from the <b>ballonets</b> is expelled through valves to maintain the hull shape. To return to sea level, the process is reversed. Air is forced back into the <b>ballonets</b> by both scooping air from the engine exhaust and using auxiliary blowers.|$|R
40|$|Strings of <b>ballonets,</b> {{modelling}} rows of orbitals, are {{assembled to}} molecule models by crossing them properly. The <b>ballonets</b> {{at the ends}} of the strings of 2, 3, 4 or 5 spheres represent bonding orbitals of hydrogen with other elements like C, N or O (the proton being inside the sphere), as well as nonbonding orbitals. The <b>ballonets</b> between them are modelling bonding orbitals among elements other than hydrogen - except the double bond in diborane, the atomic cores laying at the junction of two or more spheres. Advantages of elastic sphere models range from self-adjusting bond angles to resistance when closing cycles like cyclopropane or modeling double bonds. Examples comprise alkanes, including platonic hydrocarbons, ethene, acetylene, and some inorganic molecules...|$|R
2500|$|Having made 20 flights, it {{was then}} {{deflated}} and some modifications were made, [...] including the removal of one <b>ballonet</b> and modifications to the control surfaces. Flights were resumed on 14 November, when a flight over central Paris was made. [...] Further flights over Paris, including {{a visit to the}} military flying field at Issy-les-Moulineaux were made in November, including one carrying Charles Rolls and Frank Hedges Butler as passengers.|$|E
2500|$|The airship was {{designed}} by the prominent balloon manufacturer Édouard Surcouf and Henry Kapférer. [...] It was powered by a 70hp 4-cylinder Argus engine driving a single propeller {{at the front of}} the nacelle via a 5:1 reduction gearbox. The engine also drove a pump to maintain pressure in the internal <b>ballonet.</b> [...] The nacelle was a square-section wire-braced wooden structure which had been used in the unsuccessful design of 1902, and carried a pair of rudders at the rear and a pair of biplane elevators. [...] The most novel feature of the design were the tail surfaces, which consisted of elongated tubes inflated with hydrogen. These were the result of research carried out by Charles Renard.|$|E
50|$|Since a {{partially}} filled <b>ballonet</b> would cause longitudinal instability, {{due to the}} mass of air rolling fore or aft {{in the direction of}} pitch, two cloth partitions were used to divide the <b>ballonet</b> into three separate compartments; small holes in the partitions allowed the air to permeate gradually throughout the <b>ballonet</b> without affecting the stability of the airship.|$|E

25|$|The Morning Post was {{designed}} by Henri Julliot to the same principles as the earlier Lebaudy République and Lebaudy Patrie but was larger and faster. The envelope was made of panels of waterproof canvas with two valves at the bottom to allow the hydrogen to be released, either automatically or by hand. An additional manual valve {{on the top of}} the envelope could be used to completely deflate the envelope. Two long quick-release panels were also built into the envelope for emergency deflation. The gas bag had three <b>ballonets,</b> one at the front, one in the centre and one at the rear: the front and rear <b>ballonets</b> could be used to fly the airship up or down. Two centrigual fans were used to inflate the <b>ballonets.</b> Small fixed vertical and horizontal stabilisers were mountes at the rear of the enveleope.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Steerable ducted fans on a Skyship 600 provide thrust, limited {{direction}} control, {{and also}} serve to inflate the <b>ballonets</b> to maintain the necessary overpressure ...|$|R
50|$|A <b>ballonet</b> is an air bag {{inside the}} outer {{envelope}} of an airship which, when inflated, reduces the volume {{available for the}} lifting gas, making it more dense. Because air is also denser than the lifting gas, inflating the <b>ballonet</b> reduces the overall lift while deflating it increases lift. In this way, the <b>ballonet</b> {{can be used to}} adjust the lift as required.|$|E
50|$|The image {{illustrates}} {{the principle of}} a balloon within a balloon. The outer balloon represents the airship's outer envelope or gasbag, while the red inner balloon represents the <b>ballonet.</b> In an airship the <b>ballonet</b> would be much smaller relative {{to the size of}} the gasbag, for example in the French airship Lebaudy Patrie the volume of the <b>ballonet</b> was approximately one-fifth that of the envelope.|$|E
50|$|For {{operation}} in extreme conditions, a <b>ballonet</b> may be fitted.|$|E
50|$|As in non-rigid airships, the hull's {{aerodynamic}} {{shape is}} maintained by an overpressure {{of the gas}} inside and light framework at the nose and tail. Changes in volume of the lifting gas is balanced using <b>ballonets</b> (air filled bags). <b>Ballonets</b> also may serve to provide pitch control. For small types the lifting gas is sometimes held in the hull itself, while larger types tend to use separate gas cells which mitigates {{the consequences of a}} single gas cell failure and helps reduce the amount of overpressure needed.|$|R
50|$|The Goodyear blimps were non-rigid (meaning {{their shape}} is not {{maintained}} by a rigid internal structure) dirigibles (directable/steerable airships). Inside their exterior envelope, the Goodyear blimps are fitted with air-filled <b>ballonets.</b> As the blimp ascends or descends, the internal <b>ballonets</b> expand or contract {{to compensate for}} density changes and to maintain uniform pressure in the envelope. The latest craft, a Zeppelin NT is a departure from this tradition, {{as it is a}} Semi-rigid airship that makes use of a structural truss inside the envelope to provide some of its structural strength.|$|R
5000|$|Similar {{to other}} SS class types, the SSZs had an {{envelope}} of [...] capacity containing two <b>ballonets</b> of [...] each; {{and like the}} SSPs, the fuel was contained in aluminium tanks slung on the axis of the envelope.|$|R
50|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} <b>ballonet</b> be sufficient to maintain the airships overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of 1 mi, at which height the <b>ballonet</b> would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the <b>ballonet</b> to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ballonet</b> air valves were {{originally}} a butterfly type, actuated by springs. If pressure {{rose in the}} <b>ballonet,</b> a spring would pressure the spindle of the butterfly valve to turn, relieving the pressure. In more recent implementations, the valves are actuated electrically either by a linear actuator (driven open/closed) or a linear solenoid (spring return), the latter being the favoured fail-to-safe arrangement.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The air-filled red balloon acts as {{a simple}} <b>ballonet</b> inside the outer balloon, which is filled with lifting gas.|$|E
50|$|The hull is {{internally}} {{divided by}} diaphragms into {{a total of}} six main compartments with additional sub-divisions; these divisions can be sealed in the event of emergencies, such as battle damage being sustained, allowing {{for the majority of the}} airship's helium, and thereby lift capacity, to be retained. <b>Ballonets</b> are housed within these compartments in order to regulate gas pressure; these are inflated on the ground to increase density and reduce lift. Air and helium are not allowed to mix in the <b>ballonets,</b> thus enabling each to be furnished with valves and fans in order to increase and decrease air volume independently; this approach is claimed by HAV to be unique to the airship.|$|R
5000|$|The {{envelope}} {{contains the}} lighter-than-air helium {{which gives the}} airship its buoyancy. Inside historical Zeppelins, the gas cells were separate entities from the hull; however, on the Zeppelin NT, the envelope serves both as the aircraft's hull and as the gas cell. It is made of a three-layered laminate: one gas-tight layer of Tedlar (PVF), one polyester fabric layer to provide stability and one polyurethane layer suitable for thermic welding that acts to connect the separate laminate panels. To preserve its outer form, a slight overpressure of about [...] is maintained within the hull. As in blimps, the interior pressure is kept constant at all flight altitudes by using <b>ballonets.</b> The <b>ballonets</b> have a total volume of [...]|$|R
5000|$|... {{the only}} flying manned {{semi-rigid}} airship is the Zeppelin NT. It comprises a single gas cell kept at a slight over-pressure, <b>ballonets</b> to maintain constant volume, and a triangular keel structure internal {{to the cell}} - three of these will be American-based airships.|$|R
50|$|Designed in 1919, the J-type {{were to be}} {{improvements}} {{upon the}} D-type. Improvements included a smaller envelope (174,800 cu ft), more powerful engines, a new, simple boat style control car capable of water landings and a single <b>ballonet</b> to reduce weight as tried in the H-1. Two airships, designated J-1 and J-2, were ordered. J-1 first flew 31 August 1922 at Wingfoot Lake. The J-1 was operated at Hampton Roads until airship operations there were terminated in 1924. From May 1924 the J-1 served at Lakehurst, and {{was at that time}} the Navy's only active blimp. Due to the single <b>ballonet,</b> the J-1 proved difficult to handle. J-1 was retired in August 1924. J-2 was cancelled due to the failure of the single <b>ballonet</b> J-1, with the car being stored at the Naval Aircraft Factory.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ballonet</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1783 by Jean Baptiste Meusnier, then a Lieutenant in the French Army. However his own airship project was unsuccessful.|$|E

5000|$|A 9,000-foot (2.7 km) {{artificial}} causeway {{connected the}} islands of Elugelab, Teiter, Bogairikk, and Bogon. Atop this causeway was an aluminium-sheathed plywood tube (named a [...] "Krause-Ogle box") filled with helium <b>ballonets.</b> This allowed gamma and neutron radiation to pass uninhibited to an unmanned detection station housed in a bunker on Bogon.|$|R
2500|$|The {{envelope}} contained two <b>ballonets</b> of [...] each {{instead of}} just one as used on the prototype.
