5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row <b>B)</b> <b>includes</b> at least two, but is damaged. In row A, {{there are three}} ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending {{from the tip of}} the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though it would come from {{the opposite side of the}} mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, the prism sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in Gondwanatherium and possibly Ferugliotherium.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first series}} of commercially {{successful}} descarga jam sessions were recorded mostly between 1956 and 1958 at the Panart studios in Havana. The Panart descarga sessions were released in three volumes {{under the title}} Cuban Jam Session; they would sell over a million copies. Volumes I (1956, yellow cover) and II (1957, blue cover) where recorded {{under the direction of}} Julio Gutiérrez with Peruchín on piano. The sessions where recorded by engineer Fernando Blanco in Havana and then sent for editing to New York. According to the original liner notes of Volume I, the studio doors where opened at 10:30 PM and the recordings took place throughout the night. The jams in Volume I revolve around canción, mambo, chachachá and conga themes; the longest track, [...] "Opus for Dancing", lasts 10 minutes. Volume II kicks off with [...] "Descarga caliente", a 17-minute montuno jam recorded in 1952 and thus considered the first recorded descarga, while side <b>B</b> <b>includes</b> three jams recorded later: rumba, chachachá and batá (Santería-based). Volume III (1958, red cover) was directed by tresero Niño Rivera and it comprises three montuno tracks combined with swing, guajira and chachachá, plus a guaguancó-comparsa. The only musicians to participate in all three sessions where Alejandro [...] "El Negro" [...] Vivar (trumpet), Emilio Peñalver (tenor saxophone) and Salvador [...] "Bol" [...] Vivar (double bass). Another session entitled Cuban Jam Session with Fajardo took place under the direction of flautist José Fajardo in 1957, but only four tracks could be recorded. The album was finished in Miami in 1964. It was the first descarga album in the charanga format and it features jazz-inspired mambos, chachachás, guajiras and montunos.|$|E
