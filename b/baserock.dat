40|$|This {{project was}} {{proposed}} by a startup company from downtown San Luis Obispo called <b>BaseRock.</b> <b>BaseRock</b> sells a backpack containing subwoofers {{to allow the}} user to feel low frequencies of music. It is intended for concerts or personal use, listening to songs on an MP 3. The main way the <b>BaseRock</b> backpack communicates with MP 3 s is via the headphone jack. With {{the introduction of the}} Apple iPhone 7 in September of 2016, <b>BaseRock</b> realized it was at a disadvantage. Millions of iPhone 7 owners and potential customers around the globe would no longer possess a headphone jack. <b>BaseRock</b> needs a Bluetooth-to-headphone jack adapter for its product to be competitive in the post iPhone 7 market. The module described by this report is able to pair to both an MP 3 and to Bluetooth headphones. The device takes music data from the phone/MP 3, passes it to the backpack subwoofers, and also to user headphones. Design challenges include compact size, internal power, and simultaneous signal outputs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mt Lozenska is {{situated}} close to Sofia city. Its string of peaks and the ridges connecting them rest on limestone and dolomite limestone <b>baserock,</b> with shallow, dry and eroded hummus-carbonate soils. The {{diversity of the}} secondary grassland communities on carbonate terrains has been studied comparatively with some close in nature communities from East Serbia. The Hyperico rochelii-Stipetum epilosae assoc. nov. {{has been described as}} distributed on limited areas in the most xerothermic habitats of the mountain. A part of the studied communities is considered a transitional successive phase and has not been classified. The high conservation value of the habitats is mentioned too. Key words: calcareous grasslands, Hyperico rochelii-Stipetum epilosae, Saturejon montana...|$|E
50|$|The volcanoes of {{the western}} Wrangell Mountains are less than 5 million years old with the {{youngest}} lava flows are probably as young as 50,000 years ago. The Canadian portion of the field is dominated by scattered remnants of upper Cenozoic subaerial lavas and pyroclastic rocks. Over large areas extrusive rocks lie in flat undisturbed piles on a Cenozoic surface of moderate relief. Locally, however, strata {{of the same age}} have been affected by a late pulse of tectonism, during which they were faulted, contorted into tight symmetrical folds, or overridden by pre-Cenozoic <b>baserocks</b> along southwesterly dipping thrust faults. Considerable recent uplift, accompanied by rapid erosion, has reduced once vast areas of upper Cenozoic volcanic rocks to small isolated remnants. Although no centers younger than late Miocene are known in Canada, the eruption of rhyolite pumice, White River Ash, from Mount Churchill near the head of Klutlan Glacier blanketed large areas of northwestern Canada with tephra some 2,000 years ago.|$|R
40|$|The {{electric}} prospecting {{was conducted}} through the vertical sounding, {{based on the}} electricresistivity methods which consist of three-electrode, four-electrode and Schiumberger methods. The results are summarized as follows. 1) The results of vertical sounding are unable to discriminate of the geology composed of <b>baserock</b> and detrital material layer in the shattered zone type landslide area. 2) The relationship between the ground water level and the resistivity value are not recog-nized obviously. 3) Landslide surface is detected by internal strain-meter in several depth and also electric dis-continuity layer is divided into several layers composed of different resistivity values. Accor-dingly, {{it seems that the}} discussion of the relationship between discontinuity of electric resistivityand landslide surface is meaningless. 4) The influence of rainfalls is not clearly shown to the resistivity values of grounding elec-trode...|$|E
40|$|The high {{acceleration}} {{value in}} Bali area due to two sources zone: the Flores Backarc Thrusting and inter-intraplate subduction source zones. The thrust zone {{is evident in}} two segments: the Flores thrust zone is {{the west and the}} Wetar thrust zone in the east. Both dip opposite to the sense of subduction of Indian Ocean – Australian plat e at the Jawa Trench and Timor Trough. The earthquake effects in Bali due to earthquake event are: ground shaking, liquefaction, ground failure and tsunami. The assessment was based on historical data as well as from deterministic hazard analysis considering maximum magnitude that could be generated from potential faults and subduction source zone. The assessment was also based on previous seismic hazard analysis available in the literature. The assessment provides peak ground acceleration (PGA) at <b>baserock</b> of values in the range of 0. 25 – 0. 4 g...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{important}} to identify unstable rock blocks and take countermeasures to prevent sudden rock fall disasters. However, identifying such blocks visually is extremely difficult, so an identification method using peculiar features of unstable blocks must be developed. The method reported here uses a vibrometer, which is inexpensive and easy to operate. In order to assess the feasibility of the method, a field experiment was carried out on rock cliffs in three regions of Japan where unstable blocks are likely to exist. Vibrometers were {{set up on the}} cliffs to capture two types of vibration waves in three dimensions, i. e., micro-tremor and reactive vibration. The former type naturally exists all the time, while the latter is generated only by applying stimulation waves. At least one of the vibrometers was installed on stable <b>baserock</b> to compare the results with the wave patterns of unstable rock blocks. In addition to conventional items (amplitude, frequency spectrum, vibration particle trace), trace accumulation length, that is the accumulation of the trace length of a vibrating particle for ten seconds, was introduced to analyze the patterns for both types of wave. As a result, unstable rock blocks were found to generate higher amplitudes of vibration waves than stable rock blocks, and different patterns of frequency spectrum, direction of vibration particle trace, and trace accumulation length. Hence, vibrators were shown to be useful for identifying unstable rock blocks. In particular, by using trace accumulation length as an indicator, the stability of a block can be evaluated without generating stimulative waves, providing a direction for developing a cost-effective simple method for identifying unstable blocks in future...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} for generating broadband (0 - 10 Hz) ground motion time histories for moderate and larger crustal earthquakes. Our hybrid technique combines a stochastic approach at high frequencies with a deterministic approach at low frequencies. The broadband response is obtained by summing the separate {{responses in the}} time domain using matched filters centered at 1 Hz. We use a kinematic description of fault rupture, incorporating spatial heterogeneity in slip, rupture velocity and rise time by discretizing an extended finite-fault {{into a number of}} smaller subfaults. The stochastic approach sums the response for each subfault assuming a random phase, an omega-squared source spectrum and generic ray-path Green's functions. Gross impedance effects are incorporated using quarter wavelength theory to bring the response to a reference <b>baserock</b> velocity level. The deterministic approach sums the response for many point sources distributed across each subfault. Wave propagation at frequencies below 1 Hz is modeled using a 3 D viscoelastic finite difference algorithm with the minimum shear wave velocity set between 600 and 1000 m/s, depending on the scope and complexity of the velocity structure. To account for site-specific geologic conditions, short- and mid-period empirical amplification factors provided by Borcherdt [1] are used to develop frequency-dependent non-linear site response functions. The amplification functions are applied to the stochastic and deterministic responses separately since these may have different (computational) reference site velocities. We note that although the amplification factors are strictly defined for response spectra, we have applied them to the Fourier amplitude spectra of our simulated time histories. This process appears to be justified because the amplification functions vary slowly with frequency and the method produces favorable comparisons with observations. We demonstrate the applicability of the technique by modeling the broadband stron...|$|E
