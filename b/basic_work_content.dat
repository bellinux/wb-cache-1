However, {{these works are}} different forms of expression of various ideas and accordingly, comprise different contents. In some cases, the <b>works</b> <b>contents</b> are inconsistent with religious and national values and norms or society custom and laws. There are conflicts between protecting copyright as an intellectual property right and other moral, religious and legal priorities in the society. For resolving this conflict and answering the question whether <b>work</b> <b>content</b> will affect copyright protection, countries have adopted different approaches. From the perspective of the <b>work</b> <b>content,</b> this article through a comparative study of approaches and judicial verdicts of the USA, the UK and Canada, infers two general views: the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> does not have any impacts on copyright protection and the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> have impacts on copyright protection. In addition, some supporters of second view believe in content impact on existence of copyright in a work and other supporters believe that content has impacts on some enforcements of copyright...|$|R

40|$|We {{treat the}} problem of optimally allocating {{resources}} of limited availability under un-certainty to the various activities of a project to minimize a certain economic objective composed of resource cost and tardiness cost. Traditional project scheduling methods as-sume that the uncertainty resides in {{the duration of the}} activities. Our research assumes that the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> (or “effort”) of an activity is the source of uncertainty and the dura-tion {{is the result of the}} amount of resource allocated to the activity, which then becomes the decision variable. The functional relationship between the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> (w), the resource allocation (x), and the duration of the activity (y) is arbitrary, though we assume that the relationship obeys the “power law. ” In other words, y = f(w, x γ), where the exponent γ is some constant. As preliminary, we first treat the problem assuming that the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> is known de-terministically. We develop two new models, a nonlinear programming model, which can be used when resource availabilities are continuous, and an integer program that handles the case when resource availabilities are discrete. When the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> is known only in probability, we first treat the special case when the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> is exponentially dis...|$|R

40|$|A transparent, {{reliable}} early {{estimation of}} <b>work</b> <b>contents</b> {{is crucial for}} capacity planning in shipyards. Yet most of the shipyards rely on practical experience of specialized production planners, for the early capacity estimation, which are prone to errors, as a bill of material is not available {{in the early stages}} of production planning in the one-of-a-kind production. This is due to a yet unfinished construction of the ship. This paper will discuss a method for creating a computer-supported, transparent, more reliable way for the estimation of <b>work</b> <b>content,</b> at an early planning stage of a one-of-a-kind production, using a generated bill of material. The bill of material is generated automatically using parametrized templates and contains steel and outfitting parts. Therefore a tool has been developed that generates steel and outfitting parts from parametrized templates. From the bill-of-material, the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> in hours is estimated by linking the parts in the bill-of-material to a process. The operation time can then be calculated by dividing the <b>work</b> <b>content</b> by the capacity of the work system.

40|$|The {{activities}} {{of a project}} are in general characterized by a <b>work</b> <b>content</b> in terms of resource-time units, e. g. person-days. Even though most project scheduling models assume a time-invariant resource usage, normally {{it is possible to}} vary the resource usage during the execution of an activity. Typically, a lower and an upper bound on this resource usage and a minimum time lag between consecutive changes of this resource usage are prescribed. The project scheduling problem studied in this paper consists in determining a feasible resource-usage profile for each activity such that the project duration is minimized subject to precedence and resource-capacity constraints. While the known solution methods interpret the prescribed <b>work</b> <b>content</b> as a lower bound, we assume that each activity's <b>work</b> <b>content</b> must be processed exactly. We propose a priority-rule scheduling method that iteratively determines a feasible resource-usage profile for each activity. We present a consistency test for constructing such profiles more efficiently. Our computational results demonstrate that the new method solves more instances to feasibility than two benchmark procedures, and is suited for project instances with up to 200 activities.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{investigating}} {{computer use}} at work {{from a more}} holistic <b>work</b> <b>content</b> perspective by also studying non-computer <b>work</b> <b>content,</b> {{in contrast to the}} previous approach in occupational health research that focused almost solely on computer <b>work</b> <b>content.</b> It was argued here that non-computer <b>work</b> <b>content</b> has also become significant to the overall work situation for computer users. This is due to changes in computer use that have occurred over the past two decades, that is, from a small number of persons performing fulltime computer work (e. g., process operator work or terminal work) to the dramatically increasing number of employees who work with computers, but whose main work does not involve fulltime computer use. Instead, many employees today use a computer as an aid for performing their main work task. Therefore, when the computer is used as an aid, the question of for what kind of work is it used becomes more central, along with the question of how it is used. Computer <b>work</b> <b>content</b> appears also to have become more complex than traditional terminal work, yet methods for describing this content have not changed. One of the present purposes, therefore, was to create and test new methods in an attempt to capture this new computer <b>work</b> <b>content</b> (Paper II-IV). The papers collected in this thesis examined how psychosocial aspects and computer attitudes are related to both types of <b>work</b> <b>content</b> (computer <b>work</b> <b>content</b> and non-computer <b>work</b> <b>content).</b> In Paper II to IV where the employee's main work task was not primarily fulltime computer work, the main work task and the non-computer <b>work</b> <b>content</b> was identical. Paper I investigated and compared the psychosocial work aspects of two groups of process operators with fulltime computer work, but with different kinds of process-generated work tasks. Although the grid operators? work tasks mainly involved monitoring, which has previously been identified as problematic for operators, they assessed their work environment as being as favorable as did production operators who dealt with a flow of real-time tasks. The results were suggested to be due to the off-line tasks performed by the grid operators. Thus, the impact of a certain kind of computer work (monitoring) on psychosocial aspects appears to be reduced by other non-computer work tasks. Paper II investigated computer attitudes from a workplace (i. e., kind of workplace) and <b>work</b> <b>content</b> (i. e., how the computer is used ? the computer <b>work</b> <b>content,</b> and for what ? the non-computer <b>work</b> <b>content)</b> perspective, among employees who performed computer-aided work. This approach is in contrast to the predominant computer attitude research that investigated primarily individual aspects. The results showed that the employees working in a low-tech organization and who in addition had a departmental main work task of low-technical character had less positive computer attitudes than did employees working in either a high-tech organization or department, or both. This result remained significant also after the effect of extent of computer use, which was positively correlated with computer attitudes, was controlled for. Neither gender, age nor education was related to computer attitudes. Thus, these results indicate that both workplace and <b>work</b> <b>content</b> aspects are important to investigate more thoroughly when studying employees? computer attitudes. Another purpose in {{this study was to investigate}} whether the computer was used in several different ways. The result showed multifunctional computer use. The presences of multifunctional computer use imply that the computer <b>work</b> <b>content</b> was more complex than a single type of computer work task. Further, this multifunctional computer use took different shapes depending on, how many different types of computer work categories were used, which types, and how the work time was distributed between them. These results support previous suggestion that there is a need of new methods to describe and thereby also to be able to understand the computer use at work of today. Paper III investigated how psychosocial work aspects were related to computer work (?degree of variation? and ?extent?) among employees who performed computer-aided work, and whether these relationships differed depending on the technical character of the main work task for which the computer was used. The results showed that employees with less computer work experienced more variation and stimulation at work, and less machine dependency, than did those with more computer work. These differences were not found to interact with employees? main work task. Paper IV investigated whether a high or low extent of computer work and whether computer <b>work</b> <b>content</b> with high or low cognitive demands were related to psychosocial aspects. The results showed that social workers with a high extent of computer work reported less skill discretion than did those with less computer work. The present thesis constituted an attempt to address computer use using a holistic approach by looking at issues such as: labor market differences, where the computer is used (kind of workplace), for what it is used as an aid (main work task), how it is used (multifunctional use and the shape of this use) as well as the extent of computer use (the time distribution between computer work and non-computer work). The complex interactions between these aspects, illustrated in this thesis, ought to be addressed future research on computer use at work. Although the papers did not give answers to all issues addressed, they do reveal several aspects of computer use that may be investigated in future research on computer use at work and, thus, constitute one step on the way toward a better understanding of the phenomenon...|$|R
