Camlink types of two cameras (model VC- 200) from Vison ST Co. and 12  mm lenses (ml-m 1214 mp) from Computa Co. {{were used in}} this test. The resolution for each camera was 640 by 480 pixels and aperture number for lenses was 1.4. An electronic board from Vison St Co. was used to synchronize the two cameras. The charge-coupled device (CCD) camera was mounted on a stand with a macro <b>adjustable</b> <b>holder.</b> The distance between lenses and object was adjusted to produce a clear image. The field of view was 180 [*]×[*] 130  mm and the pixel dimension was calculated to be 0.281  mm/pixel by 0.270  mm/pixel.|$|R
40|$|How to {{represent}} a graph in memory is a fundamental data structuring question. In the usual representations of an n-vertex graph, {{the names of the}} vertices (i. e. integers from 1 to n) betray nothing about the graph itself. Indeed, the names (or labels) on the n vertices are just log n <b>bit</b> place <b>holders</b> to allow data on the edges to encode the structure of the graph. In our scenario, there is no such waste. By assigning O(log n) bit labels to the vertices, we completely encode the structure of the graph, so that given the labels of two vertices we can test if they are adjacent in time linear {{in the size of the}} labels. Furthermore, given an arbitrary original labeling of the vertices, we can find structure coding labels (as above) that are no more than a small constant factor larger than the original labels. These notions are intimately related to vertex induced universal graphs of polynomial size. For example, we can label planar graphs with structure coding labels of size ! 4 log n, which implies the existence of a graph with n 4 vertices that contains all n-vertex planar graphs as vertex induced subgraphs...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{industry}} {{expectations in}} terms of milling operations often demand the milling of the flexible details by using slender ball-end tools. This is a difficult task because of possible vibration occurrence. Due to existence of certain conditions (small depths of cutting, regeneration phenomena), cutting process may become unstable and self-excited chatter vibration may appear. Frequency of the chatter vibration is close to dominant natural frequency of the workpiece or the tool. One of the methods of chatter vibration avoidance is matching the spindle speed to the optimum phase shift between subsequent cutting edges passes (i. e. the Liao-Young condition). However, the set of optimum spindle speeds {{from the point of}} view of vibration reduction may be not optimum one from other points of view. For example milling efficiency or machine tool capabilities cannot be assured. This article presents the idea of a workpiece <b>holder</b> with <b>adjustable</b> stiffness and discusses a new variant of its realization. In the holder, milling process is performed at constant spindle speed and feed speed. In order to avoid vibration the holder stiffness is modified. Stiffness changes modify natural frequencies of the workpiece and thus it is possible to modify dynamic properties of the workpiece in such a way that arbitrary chosen, constant spindle speed will be optimum, due to the Liao-Young condition performance. Calculation of the optimum stiffness is performed before milling, based on the workpieces modal identification results and the finite element model simulations...|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} the design aspects {{for the construction}} of a microfluidic device for comprehensive spatial two-dimensional liquid chromatography. In spatial two-dimensional liquid chromatography each peak is characterized by its coordinates in the plane. After completing the first-dimension separation all fractions are analyzed in parallel second-dimension separations. Hence, spatial two-dimensional liquid chromatography potentially provides much higher peak-production rates than a coupled column multi-dimensional liquid chromatography approach in which the second-dimension analyses are performed sequentially. A chip for spatial two-dimensional liquid chromatography has been manufactured from cyclic olefin copolymer and features a first-dimension separation channel and 21 parallel second-dimension separation channels oriented perpendicularly to the former. Compartmentalization of first- and second-dimension developments by physical barriers allowed for a preferential flow path with a minimal dispersion into the second-dimension separation channels. To generate a homogenous flow across all the parallel second-dimension channels, a radially interconnected flow distributor containing two zones of diamond-shaped pillars was integrated on-chip. A methacrylate ester based monolithic stationary phase with optimized macroporous structure was created in situ in the confines of the microfluidic chip. In addition, the use of a photomask was explored to localize monolith formation in the parallel second-dimension channels. Finally, to connect the spatial chip to the liquid chromatography instrument, connector ports were integrated allowing the use of Viper fittings. As an alternative, a chip <b>holder</b> with <b>adjustable</b> clasp locks was designed that allows the clamping force to be adjusted...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a wireless node that randomly receives data from different sensor units. The arriving data must be compressed, stored, and transmitted over a wireless link, where both the compression and transmission operations consume power. Specifically, the controller must choose {{from one of}} multiple compression options every timeslot. Each option requires a different amount of power and has different compression ratio properties. Further, the wireless link has potentially timevarying channels, and transmission rates depend on current channel states and transmission power allocations. We design a dynamic algorithm for joint compression and transmission, and prove that it comes arbitrarily close to minimizing average power expenditure, with an explicit tradeoff in average delay. Our approach uses stochastic network optimization together with a concept of place <b>holder</b> <b>bits</b> to provide efficient energy-delay performance. The algorithm is simple to implement and does not require knowledge of probability distributions for packet arrivals or channel states. Extensions that treat distortion constraints are also considered. Categories and Subject Descriptors: [...] . [ [...] . ]: [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Ethereum {{contracts}} can {{be designed}} to function as fully decentralized applications called DAPPs. Many DAPPs have already been fielded, including an online marketplace, a role playing game, a prediction market, and an Internet service provider. Unfortunately, DAPPs can be hacked, and the assets they control can be stolen. A recent attack on an Ethereum decentralized application called The DAO demonstrated that smart contract bugs are more than an academic concern. Ether worth {{tens of millions of}} US dollars was extracted by an attacker from The DAO, sending the value of its tokens and the overall exchange price of ether tumbling. We present a market-based technique for insuring the ether holdings of a DAPP using futures contracts indexed by the trade price of ether for DAPP tokens. Under fairly general circumstances, our technique is capable of recovering the majority of ether lost from theft with high probability even when all of the ether holdings are stolen; and the only cost to DAPP token <b>holders</b> is an <b>adjustable</b> ether withdrawal fee. If the probability of a margin call in $d$ days is $p$ for a futures contract with 20 times leverage, then our approach will allow for the recovery of half the stolen ether with probability $p$ and a withdrawal fee of 5 %. A higher withdrawal fee of 25 % allows for more than 80 % of the ether to be recovered with probability $p$...|$|R
