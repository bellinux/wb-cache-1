25|$|Brain herniation, {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>brain</b> <b>hernia,</b> is a potentially deadly side effect of very high intracranial pressure that occurs when a part of the brain is squeezed across structures within the skull.|$|E
5000|$|The plot {{follows the}} story of Bird, a 27 year old Japanese man. The book starts with him {{wondering}} about a hypothetical trip to Africa, which is a recurrent theme in his mind throughout the story. Soon after day-dreaming about his trip and a brawl with a few local delinquents from the region, Bird receives {{a call from the}} doctor of the hospital regarding his newborn child, urging him to talk in person. After meeting with the doctor, he discovers that his son has been born with a <b>brain</b> <b>hernia,</b> although the fact is still obscure to his wife.|$|E
5000|$|The narrator {{had worked}} as a {{companion}} to a composer, D, then aged 28, who had (apparently) gone mad {{after the death of his}} infant son. D says that when he goes outside, he is visited by the spirit of his son, who swoops down out of the sky: [...] "a fat baby in a white cotton nightgown, big as a kangaroo". [...] D talks to Aghwee but refuses to interact with the people around him, saying that he is no longer living in the present time. The narrator is told by D's estranged wife that D had killed their son, starving him because he was born with a <b>brain</b> <b>hernia</b> (which later turned out to be a benign tumour). 'Aghwee' was the only word the child had spoken. The wife accuses D of fleeing reality. She gives the narrator a key which turns out to unlock a box of D's compositions, which D burns and buries. D takes the narrator to various places where D had previously enjoyed himself, as well as sending him to inform D's former girlfriend that he will no longer see her.|$|E
30|$|The largest CNV {{detected}} in this cohort was a deletion within chromosome band 18 q 21.1 q 23. The deletion, arr 18 q 22.1 q 23 (61, 576, 686 – 76, 114, 624) ×  1, encompassed a minimum size of 14.53  Mb and involved 38 genes from CDH 7 to PARD 6 G (Additional file 1 : Figure S 13). Deletions of 18 q were {{deemed to be}} a particularly heterogeneous genomic disorder as no recurrent breakpoints were identified [30]. With remarkable genomic heterogeneity, the phenotypes of patients with 18 q deletion were highly variable. Thus, it was not feasible to derive this condition based on a collection of clinical characteristics, and genomic analysis would be indispensable for the diagnosis. Clinically, our patient had developmental delay, hypotonia, hearing loss, delayed myelination of the <b>brain,</b> umbilical <b>hernia</b> and ear canal stenosis which were deemed to be core features of distal 18 q deletion [31]. In addition, congenital cardiac anomalies were also one of clinical characteristics of 18 q deletion that were present in up to 54  % patients [31 – 33]. For our patient, the echocardiogram was normal. Particularly, constitutional hemizygosity of 18 q {{has been reported to}} confer increased risk of autism. Forty-three percent of patients with 18 q deletion were categorised to be at risk of autism and the likelihood was significantly increased when TCF 4, NETO 1 and FBXO 15 were included in the region of hemizygosity [34]. In our patient, NETO 1 and FBXO 15 were included in the deletion. Nevertheless, no shared region of deletion has been identified among the autistic patients with 18 q deletion. Hence, the genetic determinants of autism in this group of patients were yet to be elucidated.|$|R
40|$|AIm: This work aims to {{summarize}} the experience in emergency microsurgery for patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) that coexisted with <b>brain</b> <b>hernia.</b> mATERIAL and mETHods: A total of 26 patients with aneurysmal SAH complicated by <b>brain</b> <b>hernia</b> were subjected to emergency aneurysm clamping + decompressive craniectomy. 10 patients were diagnosed with aneurysmal SAH coexisted with <b>brain</b> <b>hernia</b> before operation. REsuLTs: Four patients had a carotid aneurysm, 15 had a middle artery aneurysm, and 7 had an anterior communicating aneurysm. The surgical procedure was performed smoothly for all patients. The patients were followed up for 3 months to 6 months. According to Glasgow outcome scaling, five patients recovered well, six suffered from moderate disability, five were subjected to severe disability, five were in plant survival, and 5 died.

40|$|Head {{trauma is}} common among {{children}} visiting {{the emergency department}} {{and in most cases}} is minor. 1 However, so-called “minor ” head trauma can be associated with dangerous complications. For example, 6 % to 30 % of children less than 2 years of age with head trauma present with a skull fracture. 2 – 7 The risk of an intracranial hematoma is about 12 times higher among patients with a skull fracture than among other patients. 8 – 11 Skull fracture may also be complicated by leptomeningeal cyst, 12 growing fracture 13 or displaced fracture. 14 Even though growing fracture is uncommon (2 % of all fractures), its detection is important because of the risk of <b>brain</b> <b>hernia</b> if left undiscovered. 13, 15 – 17 Rapid identification can lead to successful repair with a rather simple neurosurgical intervention. 18 Controversies exist regarding the proper use of radiology for minor head trauma in children. Whereas some national guidelines suggest a wide spectrum of criteria to perform a radiologic evalu-ation, others are strict. 19 – 22 Large, well-conducted studies have identified predictive criteria of clini-cally important traumatic brain injury to help stratify children according to their risk. 23, 24 How-ever, these studies did not suggest a definitive approach to management for a substantial propor-tion of children included in the guideline. For example, the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) rule suggested Derivation and validation of a clinical decision rule to identify young children with skull fracture following isolated head traum...|$|E
