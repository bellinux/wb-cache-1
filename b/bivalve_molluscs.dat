5|$|Production of <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> by {{mariculture}} in 2010 was 12,913,199 tons, up from 8,320,724 tons in 2000. Culture of clams, cockles and ark shells {{more than}} doubled over this time period from 2,354,730 to 4,885,179 tons. Culture of mussels {{over the same period}} grew from 1,307,243 to 1,812,371 tons, of oysters from 3,610,867 to 4,488,544 tons and of scallops from 1,047,884 to 1,727,105 tons.|$|E
5|$|The many {{inhabitants}} of the tidal flats include lugworms, polychaete worms, sand hoppers and other amphipod crustaceans, and gastropod molluscs. These molluscs feed on the algae growing {{on the surface of}} the mud, and include the tiny Hydrobia, an important food for waders because of its abundance at densities of more than 130,000m−2. <b>Bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> include the edible common cockle, although it is not harvested here.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting {{commonly}} inhabits shallow sandy substrates in bays, estuaries and surf zones {{where it}} preys on polychaete worms, small crustaceans and <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs.</b> Reproduction in {{the species is}} variable over its range, generally spawning twice between September and April. Young fish inhabit shallow sand flats, both along the coast and well into {{the upper reaches of}} estuaries.|$|E

5|$|The diet of {{tilefish}} larvae is unknown, but it {{is believed}} to be zooplankton. Juvenile and adults are omnivorous with a preference for small benthic invertebrates, with a staple being crabs and lobster. Great northern tilefish also consume <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs,</b> salps, squid, Atlantic dogfish, mackrel, hagfish, and herring. Human trash is also eaten, including potato peels and meat bones. They also eat other tilefish in a display of cannibalistism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> {{are used}} as bioindicators to monitor the health of aquatic environments in both fresh water and the marine environments. Their {{population}} status or structure, physiology, behaviour or the level of contamination with elements or compounds can indicate the state of contamination status of the ecosystem. They are particularly useful since they are sessile {{so that they are}} representative of the environment where they are sampled or placed. Potamopyrgus antipodarum is used by some water treatment plants to test for estrogen-mimicking pollutants from industrial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi lives {{predominantly}} on muddy bottoms, {{where it}} is a predator of <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs.</b> In its native environment, it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. It is an important predator of the quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, in Narragansett Bay, and of the barnacle Balanus improvisus in Delaware Bay. In the Adriatic Sea, {{it has been observed}} to feed on the striped venus clam, Chamelea gallina, and the introduced Asian date mussel, Musculista senhousia.|$|E

5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too securely fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|S. ciliata is a benthic {{carnivore}} {{that feeds}} predominantly on polychaetes and various crustaceans. Like {{other species of}} Sillago, the diet of the species {{is related to the}} size and age of the individual, with three distinct size classes identified in a study conducted in Botany Bay, NSW. The smallest fish of 0–10cm take large amount of amphipods and few polychaetes, while fish between 11 and 20cm consume mostly neried polychaetes and few amphipods. The largest fish over 21cm take large amounts of <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> and shrimps of the genus Callianassa.|$|E
5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> {{have a tendency to}} accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans who eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of pollutants in their environment.|$|E

5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier. The figures included 5,554,348 (3,152,826) tons of clams, cockles and ark shells, 1,901,314 (1,568,417) tons of mussels, 4,592,529 (3,858,911) tons of oysters and 2,567,981 (1,713,453) tons of scallops. China increased its consumption 400-fold during the period 1970 to 1997.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction of populations of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them for resources.|$|E
25|$|Mussel is {{the common}} name used for members of several {{families}} of <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs,</b> from saltwater and freshwater habitats. These groups have in common a shell whose outline is elongated and asymmetrical compared with other edible clams, which are often more or less rounded or oval.|$|E

25|$|Oyster is {{the common}} name {{for a number of}} {{different}} families of salt-water <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> that live in marine or brackish habitats. In some species the valves are highly calcified, and many are somewhat irregular in shape. Many, but not all, oysters are in the superfamily Ostreoidea.|$|E
25|$|All fish in {{this family}} are egg-layers and most do not guard their eggs; however, a few species build nests and/or guard the eggs. The bitterlings of {{subfamily}} Acheilognathinae are notable for depositing their eggs in <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs,</b> where the young develop until able to fend for themselves.|$|E
25|$|It was Huxley who {{coined the}} terms the new {{synthesis}} and evolutionary synthesis; he also invented the term cline in 1938 to refer to species whose members fall {{into a series of}} sub-species with continuous change in characters over a geographical area. The classic example of a cline is the circle of subspecies of the gull Larus round the Arctic zone. This cline {{is an example of a}} ring species.Some of Huxley's last contributions to the evolutionary synthesis were on the subject of ecological genetics. He noted how surprisingly widespread polymorphism is in nature, with visible morphism much more prevalent in some groups than others. The immense diversity of colour and pattern in small <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs,</b> brittlestars, sea-anemones, tubicular polychaetes and various grasshoppers is perhaps maintained by making recognition by predators more difficult.|$|E

25|$|The yellowfin whiting is a benthic predator, {{using its}} well {{developed}} eyesight and a downward pointing jaws {{that can be}} protruded to 'suck up' and capture its prey from the seafloor. Studies on the mouth morphology {{of a range of}} sillaginids concluded that the mouth morphology of most species has little influence on the type of prey caught, with differences in diet more likely due to variations in the foraging behavior. Studies conducted in southwest Western Australia found the species predominantly takes polychaetes as its main prey item, although crustaceans, particularly amphipods and penaeids also make up a large portion of its diet. Items taken infrequently or in lesser amounts include small teleost fish, <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs,</b> marine plant material and other crustaceans such as tanaids, decapods and cumaceans. Modeling with the stable isotopes 13C and 15N indicate that seagrass and epiphytic algae were the primary initial sources of energy and nutrition that flow into the fish via detritivores which the species preys on, with salt marsh plants and macroalgae contributing in some settings.|$|E
500|$|Adamussium is a {{monotypic}} genus [...] of <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> in {{the large}} family of scallops, the Pectinidae. The Antarctic scallop (Adamussium colbecki) is [...] the only species in the genus though its exact relationship to {{other members of the}} family is unclear. It is found in the ice-cold seas surrounding Antarctica, sometimes at great depths.|$|E
500|$|Starfish are {{widespread}} in the oceans, but [...] are only occasionally used as food. There may be good reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains saponins, which have an unpleasant taste, and others contain tetrodotoxins which are poisonous. Some species that prey on <b>bivalve</b> <b>molluscs</b> can transmit paralytic shellfish poisoning. Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the Indonesian archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but {{on the island of}} [...] "Huamobel" [...] the people cut them up, squeeze out the [...] "black blood" [...] and cook them with sour tamarind leaves; after resting the pieces for a day or two, they remove the outer skin and cook them in coconut milk. Starfish are sometimes eaten in China, Japan and in Micronesia.|$|E
