40|$|Introduction One of {{the first}} steps often {{required}} in applying machine recognition to unconstrained handwriting is the identification and extraction of each line of text from among other lines. The purpose of text line extraction is to prepare data {{to meet the requirements}} of succeeding processing steps such as size normalization, word segmentation, or feature extraction. These steps typically require the data to be no more than a single row of characters. The goal of text line extraction is to assign correctly each stroke or component to its appropriate text line so that each isolated line may be passed in turn to the following analysis stage. The task is made difficult by the fact that data frequently contain undulations and shifts in the <b>baseline,</b> <b>baseline</b> skew, baseline-skew variability, character-size variability, sparse data, skipped lines and inter-line distance variability.

30|$|The {{targeted}} hemoglobin {{goal was}} defined at each subject, depending upon their post-spleen ligation hemoglobin levels. The {{aim was to}} achieve a 30 % reduction on the animal’s hemoglobin, from their <b>baseline.</b> <b>Baseline</b> hemoglobin {{was defined as the}} post-spleen ligation hemoglobin once stability of the intravascular hemoglobin was achieved. The rationale behind the achievement and maintenance of such reduction was to reproduce the same proportional decay in hemoglobin as the “anemia threshold” previously described in the TRICC Trial [10]. Acute normovolemic anemia was achieved by sequential blood extractions from the indwelling arterial catheter, with simultaneous isovolemic saline infusions to ensure normovolemia. Extracted blood was stored into a Leukotrap ® RC System (Baintree MA, 02184, USA) and maintained at room temperature. The cardiovascular response to anemia was monitored using cardiac index, blood pressure and systemic vascular resistances to ensure that the shift on intravascular volume was not leading to intravascular depletion. Regular arterial blood gas sampling was used to ensure stable and normal lactate levels; cardiac monitoring was recorded continuously and in real time while blood gases were performed every hour.|$|E
