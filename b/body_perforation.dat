40|$|Children have {{a natural}} {{tendency}} to explore objects with their mouths&# 59; this can result in the swallowing of foreign objects. Most ingested foreign bodies pass uneventfully through the gastrointestinal tract.

Perforation of the gastrointestinal tract {{may be associated with}} considerable morbidity and mortality. The most common sites of intestinal foreign <b>body</b> <b>perforation</b> are the ileocecal and rectosigmoid regions. Foreign <b>body</b> <b>perforation</b> of the duodenum is relatively uncommon.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Gastrointestinal {{perforation}} due to {{a foreign}} body is not unknown. The foreign body often mimics another cause of acute abdomen and requires emergency surgical intervention. The majority of patients do not recall ingesting the foreign <b>body.</b> <b>Perforations</b> {{have been reported to}} occur in a pathologically abnormal colon. Case presentation We report an interesting case of a 47 -year-old Caucasian man who had a perforation of the sigmoid colon caused by an ingested chicken bone mimicking acute appendicitis. Our patient presented with right iliac fossa pain and local tenderness. When a laparotomy was performed, a chicken bone was found protruding through the sigmoid colon, which was found to lie in the right iliac fossa, thus mimicking acute appendicitis. Our case is different from previously reported cases in that perforation occurred in a non-pathological colon. Conclusion Our case emphasises the fact that the operating surgeon has to be aware of various differential diagnostic possibilities which mimic acute appendicitis. This has implications on the training of junior surgeons who are often involved in performing these procedures, and may do so out of hours. Care needs to be taken while obtaining consent for the necessary operation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{management}} of chronic abdominal pain after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGP) {{is complex and}} challenging. Foreign body intestinal perforation including that caused by fish bones has previously {{been reported in the}} literature and if clinically unrecognized, can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Fish bone perforation as a cause of chronic abdominal pain after LRYGP has rarely been reported. Summary: The unusual case of a 54  year old female presenting with recurrent episodes of postprandial pain 2 years after LRYGP is reported. Previous radiological and endoscopic investigations did not reveal any abnormality and after the most recent clinical presentation, a laparoscopic exploration was performed. A protruding fish bone at the biliary-digestive junction was discovered intra-operatively and successfully extracted. Dense adhesions between the involved intestinal loops were lysed in an attempt to improve intestinal transit and subsequently relieve post-prandial pain. Conclusion: This case highlights the possibility of a missed fish bone perforation causing chronic postprandial abdominal pain and discomfort in a patient with a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass anatomy. Foreign <b>body</b> <b>perforation</b> is a rare cause of abdominal pain after gastric bypass that should be considered when evaluating chronic abdominal pain symptoms after LRYGP...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Percutaneous {{vertebral}} <b>body</b> <b>perforation</b> is a {{new technique}} for treating painful VCFs. Herein, we compare the therapeutic effect of vertebral perforation and conventional vertebroplasty for treating VCFs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eight patients with single painful VCFs were assigned to undergo vertebral perforation (perforation group) or vertebroplasty (PVP group). Clinical outcomes were assessed by using the VAS. The associations of analgesic effect and clinical factors were also analyzed by multivariate regression. Plain radiographs were used to quantify the progression of vertebral body compression after surgery and to evaluate cement leakage and new vertebral fractures. The median follow-up time was 10 months. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups. No factors correlated with analgesic effects in the PVP group. The analgesic effect of vertebral perforation was, however, related to the preoperative severity of vertebral compression and was low in patients with severe deformity (P. 05). Among patients with preoperative vertebral percentage of compression below 30 %, {{there were no significant}} differences between the 2 groups in analgesic effect at any postoperative intervals. Progression of vertebral compression after surgery occurred in 22. 2 % and 16. 0 % of treated vertebrae in the perforation and PVP groups, respectively (P. 38).

40|$|Introduction: Meckel’s {{diverticulum}} is {{the most}} common congenital abnormality of the gastrointestinal tract. The perforation of a Meckel’s diverticulum by a foreign body is a very rare complication. Case presentation: A 61 -year-old male presented to the Emergency Department with complaints with abdominal pain and fever, and abdominal rebound tenderness on physical examination. An intestinal perforation by a foreign body was diagnosed by CT scan. The patient was submitted to a diagnostic laparoscopy and a perforation of a Meckel’s diverticulum by a foreign body was identified. The foreign body was removed and a stapled diverticulectomy was performed. Discussion: Meckel’s diverticulum is asymptomatic in most of the affected individuals, with a 4. 2 – 16. 9 % probability of symptomatic presentations. The clinical presentation ranges from intestinal obstruction, to bleeding, inflammation and perforation. While children with Meckel’s diverticulum present more often with gastrointestinal bleeding, intestinal obstruction {{is the most}} common presentation in adults. Foreign <b>body</b> <b>perforation</b> of a Meckel’s diverticulum is an extremely rare event. There is general agreement that a symptomatic Meckel’s diverticulum should be resected. Laparoscopy is a safe diagnostic and therapeutic tool that can decrease diagnostic time and theoretically avoids the morbidity and mortality of a delayed diagnosis. Conclusion: The perforation of a Meckel diverticulum by a foreign body is an extremely rare event and may have a bad prognosis in case of a delayed diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{identify}} the computed tomography findings suggestive of intestinal perforation by an ingested foreign body. Materials and Methods: This was a retrospective study of four cases of surgically proven intestinal perforation {{by a foreign}} body, comparing the computed tomography findings with those described in the literature. Results: None of the patients reported having ingested a foreign body, all were over 60 years of age, {{three of the four}} patients used a dental prosthesis, and all of the foreign bodies were elongated and sharp. In all four patients, there were findings indicative of acute abdomen. None of the foreign bodies were identified on conventional X-rays. The computed tomography findings suggestive of perforation were thickening of the intestinal walls (in all four cases), increased density of mesenteric fat (in all four cases), identification of the foreign body passing through the intestinal wall (in three cases), and gas in the peritoneal cavity (in one case). Conclusion: In cases of foreign <b>body</b> ingestion, intestinal <b>perforation</b> is more common when the foreign body is elongated and sharp. Although patients typically do not report having ingested such foreign bodies, the scenario should be suspected in elderly individuals who use dental prostheses. A computed tomography scan can detect foreign <b>bodies,</b> locate <b>perforations,</b> and guide treatment. The findings that suggest perforation are thickening of the intestinal walls, increased mesenteric fat density, and, less frequently, gas in the peritoneal cavity, often restricted to the point of perforation...|$|R

CT abdomen/pelvis reported a metallic streak artefact related to the bilateral hip arthroplasties in the RIF, no evidence of perforation and faecal loading’. She was initially managed conserv-atively. The persistence and intensity of her pain were disproportionate to the CT fi ndings, and imaging review highlighted that the previously reported metallic streak could be a foreign body (fi gure 1). Ultrasound confi rmed a linear density within the caecum extending through the wall with localised free fl uid and gas. At laparotomy a 5 cm chicken bone was found protruding through the cae-cal wall; it was removed via enterotomy (fi gure 2). The patient made a full recovery. Diagnosis of foreign <b>body</b> bowel <b>perforation</b> requires {{a high degree of}} suspicion. Most foreign bodies pass through the gastrointestinal tract without consequence; however fi sh bones, chicken bones, toothpicks and cocktail sticks have been known to cause perforation. 1 – 3 Most people do not remember ingesting the object. 1 Presenting features can include: peritonitis, obstruction, per rectal bleeding, abscess or enteric fi stula formation. 1 – 3 Risk factors include extremes of age, dentures, alcoholism, mental illness and underly-ing bowel pathology such as diverticular disease or intes-tinal strictures. 1 Perforation occurs most often at points of narrowing or angulation and the presence of adhesions may have contributed in this case...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Gastrointestinal {{perforation}} {{related to}} foreign body ingestion is uncommon. Surgical interventions aiming at {{removal of the}} offending agent and restoration of bowel continuity are sought when perforations occur. Presentation of case A 68 year old male presented with epigastric abdominal pain and anorexia for 2 days. On examination, he was febrile and had localized epigastric tenderness. Laboratory investigations revealed marked leucocytosis with no other abnormalities. Computed tomography revealed {{the presence of a}} foreign body penetrating through the full thickness of the gastric wall with its tip lying adjacent to the pancreatic head. Endoscopic trial to extract the foreign body was successfully carried out. The gastric defect was sealed by applying an endoscopic metallic clip. Discussion: Gastric perforations secondary to foreign body ingestion usually follow an elusive clinical course and are rarely diagnosed early in its course. Early diagnosis allows for the utilization of minimally invasive management. Unfortunately, Most reported cases were diagnosed after intra-abdominal processes, such as abscesses, have ensued. Conclusion: This case illustrates the importance of early diagnosis of foreign <b>body</b> related gastrointestinal <b>perforations</b> and emphasizes the role of therapeutic endoscopy...|$|R
40|$|This {{communication}} {{is based on}} a retrospective survey of 245 intraocular foreign bodies (IOFB) seen at the Birmingham and Midland Eye Hospital between I 96 I and I 970 inclusive. Because the numbers have been swollen by patients referred from other regions after failed extraction, the results are not strictly comparable with those of other authors, as there tends to be a higher rate of complications: however, it is of interest to review the changing scene of IOFB in an industrial city, and to compare the present findings with those of the comprehensive survey from Birmingham carried out by Roper-Hall (I 954) covering the 20 years from 1932 to I 951. Material Case records are derived from the files of the Birmingham and Midland Eye Hospital and are taken from those perforating injuries and IOFBs listed in the computerized diagnostic index, and, as a double check, from the operating theatre records. Corneal and scleral foreign bodies are excluded unless a penetration had occurred, and orbital foreign <b>bodies</b> after double <b>perforation</b> are also ex-cluded. Several patients were able to attend a special follow-up clinic (Table X) when investi-gations included applanation tonometry, gonioscopy, examination of the fundus periphery with th...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{case reports}} {{presented}} here were compiled {{to demonstrate the}} potential for improved diagnosis and monitoring of disease progress of intraocular lesions using ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM) at 7. 1 Tesla. METHODS: High-resolution ex vivo ocular magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired on an ultrahigh-field MR system (7. 1 Tesla, ClinScan, Bruker BioScan, Germany) using a 2 -channel coil with 4 coil elements and T 2 -weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences of human eyes enucleated because of different intraocular lesions. Imaging parameters were: 40 × 40 mm field of view, 512 × 512 matrix, and 700 µm slice thickness. The results were correlated with in vivo ultrasound and histology of the enucleated eyes. RESULTS: Imaging was performed in enucleated eyes with choroidal melanoma, malignant melanoma of iris and ciliary <b>body</b> with scleral <b>perforation,</b> ciliary <b>body</b> melanoma, intraocular metastasis of esophageal cancer, subretinal bleeding {{in the presence of}} perforated corneal ulcer, hemorrhagic choroidal detachment, and premature retinopathy with phthisis and ossification of bulbar structures. MR imaging allowed differentiation between solid and cystic tumor components. In case of hemorrhage, fluid-fluid levels were identified. Melanin and calcifications caused significant hypointensity. Microstructural features of eye lesions identified by MRM were confirmed by histology. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the potential of MRM for the visualization and differential diagnosis of intraocular lesions. At present, the narrow bore of the magnet still limits the use of this technology in humans in vivo. Further advances in ultrahigh-field MR imaging will permit visualization of tumor extent and evaluation of nonclassified intraocular structures in the near future...|$|R
