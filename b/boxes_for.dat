5|$|Habitat {{enhancements}} used {{to increase}} the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, and artificial islands created {{for a number of}} different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest <b>boxes</b> <b>for</b> roseate terns, which normally nest in the shelter of tallish vegetation, and using artificial eelgrass mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful in {{scientific}} studies on animal physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest <b>boxes</b> <b>for</b> experiments. Kestrel metabolic rate {{has been found}} to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25⁰ C. Kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions to counteract heat loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{packaging}} {{has undergone}} many changes since its inception. Unlike McDonald's, the company {{never used the}} clamshell style box made of Styrofoam, so when the environmental concerns over Styrofoam {{came to a head}} in the late 1980s, the company was able to tout its use of paperboard <b>boxes</b> <b>for</b> its sandwiches. To cut back on the amount of paper that the company used, the paperboard box was fully eliminated in 1991 and was replaced with waxed paper. For a short time in 2002, the company used a gold-toned, aluminum foil wrapping for the sandwich as part of the 45th anniversary of the sandwich. The packaging was changed again in 2012 when the company moved to half wrapped sandwich packaged in a paper board box.|$|E
40|$|Installation <b>box</b> <b>for</b> vehicle {{terminal}} PCB (Printed Circuit Board) was took as research object, which is {{encountered in the}} process of project developing. Vehicle terminal PCB in actual development process was set as an example, point cloud data were acquired by three coordinate measuring method; Imageware software was used to reconstruct the {{vehicle terminal}} PCB model, basic size parameters of vehicle terminal PCB can be got and then design parameters of installation <b>box</b> <b>for</b> vehicle terminal PCB can be determined. Design of the installation <b>box</b> <b>for</b> vehicle terminal PCB was completed based on Solidworks software, then 3 D modeling and 2 D drawing of installation <b>box</b> <b>for</b> vehicle terminal PCB was gained. Up Plus 2 rapid prototype machine was used to manufacture installation <b>box</b> <b>for</b> vehicle terminal PCB rapidly based on 3 D printing technology, then prototype of installation <b>box</b> <b>for</b> vehicle terminal PCB was obtained.

5|$|Various {{causes for}} the {{dramatic}} decreases in population have been proposed, including predation, in particular by Eurasian sparrowhawks; electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones; and diseases. A shortage of nesting sites caused {{by changes in}} urban building design is probably a factor, and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest <b>boxes</b> <b>for</b> sparrows. A primary cause of the decline {{seems to be an}} insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows. Declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops, the heavy use of pesticides, the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas, and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol, which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite.|$|E
5|$|The first crews {{arrived at}} Subic Bay on 11 June and a {{squadron}} office was established. On 12 June 1965, the squadron {{came under the}} operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard. The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the waterline down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and ammunition ready <b>boxes</b> <b>for</b> the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound-powered telephone circuits. Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol on-station time. Modifications {{were made to the}} bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed below the horizon for close-range firing. Four additional M-2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the gunwales of each cutter.|$|E

25|$|As {{the pilots}} {{prepared}} to insert the first {{troops of the}} Delta company, 13th Sikh Light Infantry, the operation was delayed by twenty minutes.
