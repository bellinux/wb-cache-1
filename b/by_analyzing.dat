5|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to estimate the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33–36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined <b>by</b> <b>analyzing</b> the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion <b>by</b> <b>analyzing</b> lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar.

40|$|We {{treat the}} problem of {{evaluating}} the performance of estimators for estimating a deterministic parameter vector x, with the meansquared error (MSE) as the performance measure. Since the MSE depends on the unknown vector x, direct comparison between estimators is a difficult problem.

Using a saddle-point framework we reduce these abstract concepts to a concrete convex optimization problem, which can then <b>by</b> <b>analyzed</b> <b>by</b> utilizing the machinery of convex optimization.
