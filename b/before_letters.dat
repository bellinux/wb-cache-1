2500|$|Shortly <b>before</b> <b>Letters</b> in the Wind, Loevy {{directed}} a miniseries, Policeman (2000), {{based on a}} script by Galia Oz and Ofer Mashiach. In 1997, Loevy approached Moti Kirschenbaum with plans to direct a miniseries about a murder {{that took place in}} a fictional television station, Channel 66. Kirschenbaum approved of the project, but the following year Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to replace Kirschenbaum with Uri Porat. Porat had previously served as Director-General of the Israel Broadcasting Authority from 1984 to 1989, and was Director-General when Loevy produced Bread. Porat, however, was also closely aligned with the rightwing of the Israeli political spectrum, and had even referred to one of Hanoch Levin's anti-militaristic early plays as [...] "theatrash". The problem with Loevy's project, he claimed, was the plot and budgetary constraints.|$|E
60|$|Averil had again {{left her}} bed, and resumed her {{place on the}} sofa <b>before</b> <b>letters</b> arrived. There was Leonard's from Cocksmoor Parsonage, the first real letter she had had from him since his term of {{servitude}} had begun. It was a grave and thankful letter, very short, doing little more than mention every one's kindness, and express a hope of soon meeting her and Ella, however and wherever Henry should think best. Brief as it was, it made her more thoroughly realize his liberty, and feel that the yearning towards him in her heart was growing more and more ardent, {{in spite of her}} strivings not to let it awaken.|$|E
6000|$|Do have a specially. Make a {{collection}} of works on few subjects, well chosen. And what subjects shall they be? That depends on taste. Probably it is well to avoid the latest fashion. For example, the illustrated French books {{of the eighteenth century}} are, at this moment, en hausse. There is a [...] "boom" [...] in them. Fifty years ago Brunet, the author of the great [...] "Manuel," [...] sneered at them. But, in his, [...] "Library Companion," [...] Dr. Dibdin, admitted their merit. The illustrations by Gravelot, Moreau, Marillier, and the rest, are certainly delicate, graceful, full of character, stamped with style. But only the proofs <b>before</b> <b>letters</b> are very much valued, and for these wild prices are given by competitive millionaires. You cannot compete with them.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} all the code points were {{different}} was {{less of a problem}} for inter-operating with ASCII than the fact that sorting EBCDIC put lowercase <b>letters</b> <b>before</b> uppercase <b>letters</b> and <b>letters</b> <b>before</b> numbers, exactly the opposite of ASCII.|$|R
2500|$|When a [...] {{is placed}} <b>before</b> the <b>letter</b> [...] (...) , it {{represents}} a long [...] (very similar to the initial sound in the English word [...] "apple"). For example: [...] The [...] is not usually written in such cases. When a fathah placed <b>before</b> the <b>letter</b> ⟨ﻱ⟩ (yā’), it creates an [...] (as in [...] "lie"); and when placed <b>before</b> the <b>letter</b> ⟨و⟩ (wāw), it creates an [...] (as in [...] "cow") ...|$|R

50|$|Many major college wrestling {{programs}} {{wanted to}} sign Harris after his dominant {{senior year of}} high school. The day <b>before</b> <b>letters</b> of intent could be signed he announced he would wrestle for Oklahoma. His high school coach, National Wrestling Hall of Fame inductee Jerry Lane, contacted Oregon State wrestling coach Dale Thomas, a two-time national coach of the year and National Wrestling Hall of Fame member himself. Thomas met with Harris that day and convinced Harris that staying in the state would give him an opportunity at a national championship and set him up for success once his college days were over.|$|E
50|$|Chartered Engineers are {{entitled}} to use the suffix, CEng, after names {{as a means of}} emphasising their status with the Engineering Council. They can also make use of a logo, which is intended primarily for use in correspondence and on business cards. This is restricted to use by Engineering Council registrants only, through approval by the patent office for its registration as a certification mark. This is written after honours, decorations and academic/university, but <b>before</b> <b>letters</b> denoting membership of professional engineering institutions. When a Chartered Engineer has more than one institution membership conferring designatory letters, the institution through which the holder is registered as a Chartered Engineer appears immediately after CEng, with other memberships following in order of the institution's foundation dates.|$|E
50|$|The de jure end of {{sovereignty}} {{came during the}} upheaval of the French Revolution. In January 1790 {{attempts were made to}} secure the continued existence of the principality separate from the French crown but these came to no avail. An envoy, Louis Perret, was despatched to Paris but he did not arrive <b>before</b> <b>letters</b> patent had been issued in the name of King Louis XVI that decreed Bidache {{to be a part of}} the new Basses Pyrenées départment. In 1793 troops loyal to the new French Republic occupied Bidache and ousted the last prince, Antoine VII. With de facto independence at an end the château was briefly converted into a hospital before being burned down in 1796. The ruins are currently being restored.|$|E

5000|$|Suddhoo is {{very fond}} of his son, who lives at Peshawar, some 400 miles away. The young man {{contracts}} pleurisy. The seal-cutter, who understands the telegraph as Suddhoo cannot, has a friend in Peshawar who sends him the details <b>before</b> <b>letters</b> arrive. Suddhoo is worried at his son's health and invites the narrator to discuss it - specifically the prohibition on jadoo, or magic, by the Raj. The narrator reassures him that white magic is permitted, and that the officials of the Raj practise it themselves - Kipling adds, with more humour, [...] "(If the Financial Statement the Budget {{of the government of}} India isn't magic, I don't know what is.)" [...] Suddhoo admits that he has paid much money for the 'clean sorcery' of the seal-cutter, who gets accurate reports [...] "more quickly than the lightning can fly".|$|E
5000|$|The H. A. Blyth sale (March 11 to 13, 1901, 346 lots, : 10s.) of {{mezzotint}} portraits {{was even}} more remarkable, and as a collection it was the choicest sold {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century, the engravings being mostly in the first state. The record prices were numerous, and, in many cases, far surpassed the prices which Sir Joshua Reynolds received for the original pictures; e.g. the exceptionally fine example of the first state of the [...] "Duchess of Rutland", after Reynolds, by V. Green, realized 1,000 gns., whereas the artist received only for the painting itself. Even this unprecedented price for a mezzotint portrait was exceeded on the 30 April 1901, when an example of the first published state of [...] "Mrs Carnac", after Reynolds, by J. R. Smith, sold for 1,160 gns. At the Louis Huth sale (1905) 83 lots brought nearly Reynolds's [...] "Lady Bampfylde" [...] by T.
