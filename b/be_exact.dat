Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to <b>be</b> <b>exact.</b> We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{founding}} of the Kingdom of Belgium, in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely Dutch-speaking (Brabantian dialect to <b>be</b> <b>exact),</b> to being a multilingual city with French (specifically Belgian French) as the majority language and lingua franca. This language shift, the Francization of Brussels, is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} useful but {{computationally}} complex algorithms, {{there has been}} substantial research on creating and analyzing algorithms that approximate a solution. The knapsack problem, though NP-Hard, {{is one of a}} collection of algorithms that can still be approximated to any specified degree. This means that the problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme. To <b>be</b> <b>exact,</b> the knapsack problem has a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).|$|E

25|$|The {{tube length}} determines whether the tube {{acoustic}} pressure or velocity {{is the dominant}} influence on {{the frequency of the}} tube. Simple models of organ pipe resonance is based on open-open pipe resonance (λ=) but corrections must be made to take into account that one end of the pipe radiates into the surrounding medium and the other radiates through a slit with a jet flow. Boelkes and Hoffmann have made measurements of end correction for open-open tubes and derived the relation δ=0.33D. This cannot <b>be</b> <b>exact</b> since the driving end is not open.|$|E
500|$|The {{transfer}} function of an mm'-type {{is the same}} as an m-type with m set to the product mm. [...] To choose values of m and m for best impedance match requires the designer to choose two frequencies at which the match is to <b>be</b> <b>exact,</b> at other frequencies there will be some deviation. [...] There is thus some leeway in the choice but Zobel suggests the values m=0.7230 and m=0.4134 which give a deviation of the impedance of less than 2% over the useful part of the band. [...] Since mm=0.3, this section will also have a much faster cut-off than an m-type of m=0.6 which is an alternative for impedance matching.|$|E
500|$|According to Mark Wilson of About.com, Amanda Tapping was {{enthusiastic}} {{about creating a}} radically different character after eleven years playing Samantha Carter in Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, and expended tremendous effort to separate Helen from Carter as successfully as possible. Tapping was able to successfully portray a woman who's experienced {{a century and a}} half of isolation, strangeness, and relentless compassion. Rick Bentley from McClatchy Newspapers commented Tapping's role as Dr. Magnus was a way for the actor to make a name of herself outside the Stargate universe as Carter. Magnus is also described as a [...] "non-glib, female Jack Harkness;" [...] Jack Harkness being the main character from the British science fiction show Torchwood. Hilary Rothing of UGO said that [...] "Dr. Helen Magnus is intelligent, alluring and has one of those tasty British accents – Victorian era to <b>be</b> <b>exact.</b> That's because she's a 157 years old. But seriously, she doesn't look a day over 35." [...] She also added that Tapping is [...] "right at home" [...] taking the lead for the show. Alex Walker of Den of Geek believed Magnus was [...] "typical for an English character in an American TV show, with a liking for tea and a cut-glass elocution betraying no hint of a regional accent". Helen Magnus has been listed number ten in TV Squad's [...] "Ten Most mysterious characters on television".|$|E

500|$|The film's {{ethereal}} aspects {{and double}} exposures were {{performed in the}} camera because {{the ability to create}} the effects in lab did not yet exist. Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film, each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had to <b>be</b> <b>exact</b> otherwise the shot would be ruined. Lombardi notes that the cinematographer, Walter Pritchard, was the man who had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said {{he was one of the}} company's oldest men. Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end up in the hospital from the production. In The Parade's Gone By, Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done. Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer was so nervous that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at the right spot before shots. This production may have been the last unbilled movie credit of Lon Chaney. The discovery of Lon Chaney's role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head. Chaney wrote [...] "This is me just below the X sign. Here I am a Russian Prince." [...] on the back of the still. The image still in particular leaves no question that it comes from The Restless Spirit because it also appears on the cover of The Universal Weekly for October 23, 1913. The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a wildman, which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film.|$|E
