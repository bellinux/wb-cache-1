25|$|The Overseas Passenger Terminal (OPT), known officially as the Sydney Cove Passenger Terminal, is {{a public}} cruise ship and ocean liner {{transport}} infrastructure building located in Circular Quay, Sydney, Australia. Whilst commercial shipping operations on and around the site date from 1792, the current primary structure and waterfront promenade date from 1958, with subsequent on-going alterations and land reclamation throughout {{the latter part of}} the 20th century. The current design retains the <b>black</b> <b>steel</b> portal frame trusses of the original 1958 structure, with major additions completed in 1988 in the Post-War International Style through the collaboration of Sydney architects Lawrence Nield and Peter Tonkin.|$|E

The time is 1973, 1978, and 1983, and the scene is a Chicago basement apartment where the characters meet to socialize over cards and drinks. Racial themes relating to the disparity of life at the steel mill are presented, and dreams about possibilities represented by the upscale Pill Hill neighborhood in Chicago are examined. [...] The conflicts are painful as the characters deal with leaving the comfortable life of the mill {{to embark on a}} road of uncertainty while pursuing professional aspirations.|$|E

2500|$|The primary design {{concept for}} the 1988 {{alterations}} {{project was to}} express the original structure freely, with the strong row of <b>black</b> <b>steel</b> portal frames visible along the waterfront. As {{a result of this}} structural expression, the building can be broadly categorized as belonging to the Post-War International Style (Also known as Late 20th Century International Style) of architecture. The terminal's structural system has been identified within the State Heritage Register as [...] "representative of the utilitarian approach to terminal design at the time, with its 'functionalist' character influenced by international trends." [...] These trends of the 1980s are more specifically known as part of the 'high-tech' architecture movement, a term also applied to the work of international architects such as Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano, whose works also dot the modern Sydney skyline. Architecture such as this emphasised a focus on the [...] "poetics of structure, transparency and technology" [...] and {{has its roots in the}} era of Victorian Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom, most prominently being the Crystal Palace (1851) designed by Joseph Paxton.|$|E
2500|$|The National Museum of Arts of the 21st Century (MAXXI for short), in Rome, was {{designed}} and built between 1998 and 2010. The main theme of its architecture {{is the sense of}} movement; [...] Everything in the structure seems to be moving and flowing. The facade belongs to her earlier period, with smooth curving white walls and an austere black and white colour scheme. The building is perched on groups of five very thin pylons, and one gallery with a glass face precariously overhangs the plaza in front of the museum, creating shade. Rowan Moore of The Guardian of London described its form as [...] "bending oblong tubes, overlapping, intersecting and piling over each other. The imagery is of flow and movement and it resembles a demented piece of transport architecture. Inside, <b>black</b> <b>steel</b> stairs and bridges, their undersides glowing with white light, fly across a void. They take you off to the galleries, which are themselves works of frozen motion. The design is intended to generate what Hadid called [...] "confluence, interference and turbulence", ...|$|E
2500|$|Peepshow {{received}} widespread {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. Q wrote in its 5-star review: [...] "Peepshow {{takes place in}} some distorted fairground of the mind where weird and wonderful shapes loom." [...] Reviewer Mark Cooper hailed [...] "Martin McCarrick's accordion that pokes its way into Peek A Boo [...] a carny piece of musical imagination". He noted that [...] "the rest of the record bursts with similar acts of imagination", saying: [...] "full honours go to the aforementioned McCarrick for all manner of shrewd decorations and drummer Budgie for endlessly inventive rhythm work that manages to pinpoint the tension inherent in each song without ever lapsing into an obvious beat". Melody Maker highly praised its first single, [...] "Peek-a-Boo", and called it [...] "quite the most astounding British record" [...] of 1988, and [...] "a brightly unexpected mixture of <b>black</b> <b>steel</b> and pop disturbance." [...] The paper also praised the band for the ballad [...] "The Last Beat of My Heart". Chris Roberts said: [...] "The infinite pinnacle is their one joint effort, the bravura hymn [...] "The Last Beat of My Heart"". As Martin McCarrick's accordion and Budgie's directly intelligent rhythms underlie its pathos, this elegy is translated by Sioux with capital beatitude. It's the Banshees' most courageous arabesque in some time." [...] Record Mirror also particularly enjoyed that song when reviewing the album: [...] "The highlight is the restrained 'The Last Beat of My Heart', where Siouxsie's voice explores new ground as she caresses a haunting melody." [...] Reviewer Kevin Murphy concluded by saying: [...] "Brimming with confidence , Peepshow is the Banshees' finest hour." [...] NME noted a change of approach in the musical direction: [...] "Peepshow is the best Banshees record since A Kiss in the Dreamhouse because it's the Banshees deciding to be a pop band rather than a rock group".|$|E

D'Aguilar wore a breastplate of gold-inlaid <b>black</b> <b>steel</b> and a helmet, while Peter had but his tunic of bull's hide and iron-lined cap, though his straight cut-and-thrust sword was heavier and mayhap half an inch longer than that of his foe.|$|E

Then {{he entered}} the cave and set a plain <b>black</b> <b>steel</b> helm upon his black locks, and a black chain byrnie about his breast. He took the great axe-head also and fitted to it the half of another axe that lay among the weapons. Then he drew out a purse of money and a store of golden rings, and set them in a bag of otter skin, and buckled it about him. But the other goods he wrapped up in skins and hid behind some stones which were {{at the bottom of}} the cave--purposing to come another time and fetch them.|$|E
60|$|Picking his way daintily {{through that}} shambles in the waist came {{a tall man}} with a deeply tanned face that was shaded by a Spanish headpiece. He was armed in back-and-breast of <b>black</b> <b>steel</b> beautifully damascened with golden arabesques. Over this, like a stole, he wore a sling of scarlet silk, from each end of which hung a silver-mounted pistol. Up the broad {{companion}} to the quarter-deck he came, toying with easy assurance, until he stood before the Spanish Admiral. Then he bowed stiff and formally. A crisp, metallic voice, speaking perfect Spanish, reached those two spectators on the poop, and increased the admiring wonder in which Lord Julian had observed the man's approach.|$|E
