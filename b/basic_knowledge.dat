5|$|Belgrano was {{appointed}} as {{captain of the}} urban militias in 1797 by viceroy Pedro de Melo, who was instructed by Spain to prepare defences against a possible British or Portuguese attack. Belgrano by then worked in the Consulate, and was no longer interested in pursuing a military career. Viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte requested that he create a militia to counter a possible British attack, {{but he did not}} take interest in it. His first intervention in a military conflict took place when the British, under William Carr Beresford, arrived with 1,600 men and took Buenos Aires, starting the British invasions of the Río de la Plata. Belgrano moved to the fortress as soon as he heard the warning, and gathered many men to launch resistance. But without the required knowledge, his men marched in disorder and Belgrano was ordered to disband after a single British cannon shot. Belgrano would write later in his autobiography that he regretted not having by then even the most <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> of militia work.|$|E

25|$|Practitioners {{were often}} {{members of the}} Christian clergy, though some nonclerical {{practitioners}} are recorded. In some instances, mere apprentices or those ordained to lower orders dabbled in the practice. They were connected by {{a belief in the}} manipulation of spiritual beings – especially demons – and magical practices. These practitioners were almost always literate and well educated. Most possessed <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> of exorcism and had access to texts of astrology and of demonology. Clerical training was informal and university-based education rare. Most were trained under apprenticeships and were expected to have a <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> of Latin, ritual and doctrine.

We specify MAC protocols called CANlike protocols because they are inspired by the MAC protocol of the network CAN which is a wired network. The presentation made in this paper, after a reminder of <b>basic</b> <b>knowledges</b> (wireless network physical layer, different topologies, CAN wired network, MAC protocol characteristics) shows how to integrate these <b>basic</b> <b>knowledges</b> in order to specify the CANlike protocols for several topologies (mono-hop topology and three different multi-hop topologies(chains)).

In contrast to the last decades, the number of Armenian schools teaching English have grown gradually. English is still far behind Russian in terms of knowledge among Armenians. According to a 2012 poll, 40% of Armenians have <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> of English with only 4% having advanced proficiency of English, 16% intermediate and 20% beginner level.

25|$|True {{scale of}} the problem became evident during the {{following}} years. The Frankish view of the Filioque was emphasized again in the Libri Carolini, composed around 791-793.

Frankish theologians reaffirmed the notion that the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, and rejected as inadequate the teaching that the Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son.

25|$|The Amish do {{not usually}} educate their {{children}} past the eighth grade, {{believing that the}} <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> offered {{up to that point}} is sufficient to prepare one for the Amish lifestyle. Almost no Amish go to high school and college. In many communities, the Amish operate their own schools, which are typically one-room schoolhouses with teachers (usually young, unmarried women) from the Amish community. On May 19, 1972, Jonas Yoder and Wallace Miller of the Old Order Amish, and Adin Yutzy of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church, were each fined $5 for refusing to send their children, aged 14 and 15, to high school. In Wisconsin v. Yoder, the Wisconsin Supreme Court overturned the conviction, and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed this, finding the benefits of universal education were not sufficient justification to overcome scrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.|$|E
25|$|A schema is a cognitively {{organized}} {{network of}} associations that {{is readily available}} to help guide an individual’s perception. Gender schema acts as a guide or standard for consistent behavior in a given scenario. Labels such as “girls are weak and boys are strong,” classifies what stereotypically acceptable actions for the gender groups are. Therefore, the theory proposes the idea that once the child has developed <b>basic</b> <b>knowledge</b> on gender behaviors they will begin to construct gender schemas. This is acquired first through the basic understanding of gender-specific roles. In order words, the child learns {{the contents of the}} society, things that are related to their own and the opposite sex, and incorporates it into their gender schemas. The child then learns to apply the appropriate attributes respectively to the right gender by selectively using this knowledge to conceptualize their own actions. Hence, categorizing how they should perform in various situations by molding their capabilities to match the schematic labels.|$|E
