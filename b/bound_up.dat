5|$|A {{comparative}} study of the amino acid composition of eleven Portuguese wild edible mushroom species showed Boletus edulis to have the highest total amino acid content, about 2.3g per 100g of dried mushroom. This total includes {{a full complement of}} 20 essential and nonessential amino acids. Analysis of the free amino acids (that is, those not <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> in protein) revealed glutamine and alanine to be the principal amino acids (each about 25% of total compounds); a separate analysis concluded that lysine is another predominant compound.|$|E
5|$|Henry's {{ability to}} govern was intimately <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> with the Church, which formed {{the key to}} the {{administration}} of both England and Normandy, and this relationship changed considerably {{over the course of his}} reign. William the Conqueror had reformed the English Church with the support of his Archbishop of Canterbury, Lanfranc, who became a close colleague and advisor to the King. Under William Rufus this arrangement had collapsed, the King and Archbishop Anselm had become estranged and Anselm had gone into exile. Henry also believed in Church reform, but on taking power in England he became embroiled in the investiture controversy.|$|E
5|$|Three centuries {{after the}} death of the Buddha (c. 150 BCE) saw the growth of a large body of {{literature}} called the Abhidharma in several contending Buddhist schools. In the Abdhidharmic analysis of mind, the ordinary thought is defined as prapañca ('conceptual proliferation'). According to this theory, perceptual experience is <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> in multiple conceptualizations (expectations, judgments and desires). This proliferation of conceptualizations form our illusory superimposition of concepts like self and other upon an ever changing stream of aggregate phenomena.|$|E

5|$|After the tender, 80 {{employees}} {{were transferred to}} the subsidiary, including the director, chartered engineer Arne Fosen. To the press {{he said that the}} increased efficiency in the organization was related to a small administration, and being able to use uniform trains. Previously both locomotive-hauled trains, as well as Class 70 and Class 69 trains had been used. Following the PSO, NSB Anbud would operate nine Class 69g trains, which are somewhat smaller than the locomotive-hauled and Class 70 trains. These would be owned by NSB, but rented by the subsidiary. The ministry would pay for a NOK 40 million overhaul of the stock. Representatives from the labor union said they feared for the flexibility of NSB, since 80 {{employees were}} now <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> in serving only a single line. Margareth Nordby replaced Fosen as director in August.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were {{hierarchical}} societies, each {{based on}} ties of allegiance between powerful lords and their immediate followers. At {{the top of}} the social structure was the king, who stood above many of the normal processes of Anglo-Saxon life and whose household had special privileges and protection. Beneath the king were thegns, nobles, the more powerful of which maintained their own courts and were termed ealdormen. The relationship between kings and their nobles was <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> with military symbolism and the ritual exchange of weapons and armour. Freemen, called churls, formed the next level of society, often holding land in their own right or controlling businesses in the towns. Geburs, peasants who worked land belonging to a thegn, formed a lower class still. The very lowest class were slaves, who could be bought and sold and who held only minimal rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{contains a}} range of interesting compounds in small quantities, including some based on hydrogen, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). There is carbon monoxide, water vapour and atomic oxygen as well. Hydrogen is in relatively short supply in the Venusian atmosphere. A large amount of the planet's hydrogen is theorised to have been lost to space, with the remainder being mostly <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The loss of significant amounts of hydrogen is proven by a very high D–H ratio measured in the Venusian atmosphere. The ratio is about 0.015–0.025, which is 100–150 {{times higher than the}} terrestrial value of 1.6. According to some measurements, in the upper atmosphere of Venus D/H ratio is 1.5 higher than in the bulk atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Broke himself led {{a charge}} against {{a number of}} the Americans who had managed to rally on the forecastle. Three American sailors, {{probably}} from the rigging, descended and attacked him. Taken by surprise, he killed the first, but the second hit him with a musket which stunned him, whilst the third sliced open his skull with his sabre, knocking him to the deck. Before the sailor could finish Broke off, the American was bayoneted by a British Marine named John Hill. Shannons crew rallied to the defence of their captain and carried the forecastle, killing the remaining Americans. Broke sat, dizzied and weak, on a carronade slide, and his head was <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> by William Mindham, who used his own neckerchief. One of Shannons lieutenants, Provo Wallis, believed that Broke's three assailants were probably British deserters. The desperate and violent attempt on Broke's life made by these men may have been motivated {{by the fact that they}} faced the death penalty under the Royal Navy's Articles of War as deserters. Meanwhile, Shannons First Lieutenant, Mr George T. L. Watt, had attempted to hoist the British colours over Chesapeakes, but this was misinterpreted aboard Shannon, and he was hit in the forehead by grapeshot and killed as he did so.|$|E

25|$|The {{category}} of mood {{is used to}} express modality, which includes such properties as uncertainty, evidentiality, and obligation. Commonly encountered moods include the indicative, subjunctive, and conditional. Mood can be <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> with tense, aspect, or both, in particular verb forms. Hence certain languages are sometimes analysed as having a single tense–aspect–mood (TAM) system, without separate manifestation of the three categories.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no doubt}} that these great tombs, far more {{impressive}} than would be required of mere repositories for bones, were the centres of ritual activity in the early Neolithic: they were shrines as well as mausoleums. For some reason, the success of farming and the veneration of ancestral and more recent bones had become <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> together {{in the minds of the}} people.|$|E
25|$|As {{has already}} been mentioned, {{indications}} of tense are often <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> with indications of other verbal categories, such as aspect and mood. The conjugation patterns of verbs often also reflect agreement with categories pertaining to the subject, such as person, number and gender. It is consequently not always possible to identify elements that mark any specific category, such as tense, separately from the others.|$|E

25|$|In coevolution, {{where the}} {{existence}} of one species is tightly <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> with the life of another species, new or 'improved' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of corresponding features in the other species. These relationships are intrinsically dynamic, and may continue on a trajectory for millions of years, as {{has occurred in the}} relationship between flowering plants and pollinating insects.|$|E
25|$|In early Rome {{agriculture}} and military activity were closely <b>bound</b> <b>up,</b> {{in the sense}} that the Roman farmer was also a soldier. … In the case of the October Horse, for example, we should not be trying to decide whether it is a military, or an agricultural festival; but see it rather as one of the ways in which the convergence of farming and warfare (or more accurately of farmers and fighters) might be expressed.|$|E
25|$|Some dietary supplements, {{sold for}} the {{purposes}} of promoting weight-loss or providing energy, contain synephrine as one of several constituents. Usually, the synephrine is present as a natural component of Citrus aurantium ("bitter orange"), <b>bound</b> <b>up</b> in the plant matrix, but could also be of synthetic origin, or a purified phytochemical (i.e. extracted from a plant source and purified to chemical homogeneity). The concentration range found by Santana and co-workers in five different supplements purchased in the US was about 5–14mg/g.|$|E
