Blood samples were collected to estimate hematocrit; red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC), and platelet counts; bleeding time and <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>time.</b> Results: When compared with the control group, our data indicated significantly higher total WBC in groups C and D (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001, respectively); lower RBC in group D (P< 0. 05); lower platelet counts in all the experimental groups (P< 0. 001); and higher <b>blood</b> <b>clotting</b> <b>time</b> in groups C and D (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001, respectively).
