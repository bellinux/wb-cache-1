McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the {{boundaries}} of the Clause were further defined when Senator William S. Kenyon was allowed to accept an appointment by President Warren G. Harding as circuit judge for the Eighth Circuit. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty concluded that no disqualifying event had occurred because the increase in emoluments to that office had occurred in a term prior to the one Kenyon was serving {{at the time of the}} nomination. (Daugherty's opinion would later be reaffirmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> when Representative Bill Richardson was nominated as U.N. Ambassador.) No rollback was attempted when Senator Hugo Black was appointed to the Supreme Court, and in Ex parte Levitt, the court rejected, for lack of legal standing, an attempt to prevent Black from taking his seat based on Ineligibility Clause objections. The movant in the Black case, Albert Levitt, only had an interest in the case as a United States Citizen and a member of the Supreme Court bar, which the Court found to be insufficient.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1993 Aspin began to tell the White House that the five-year Defense budget, {{reflecting}} {{the results of the}} bottom-up review, would exceed the more than $1 trillion projected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration.</b> In December 1993 he put the anticipated shortfall at no less than $50 billion, the consequence of inaccurate inflation estimates, a military pay raise, and failure to account for other Pentagon costs, including peacekeeping operations. The size of the force needed to meet the two regional wars scenario contributed to the projected budget shortfall. Furthermore, Aspin was on record as favoring the use of U.S. troops in regional conflicts, as opposed to other decisionmakers, including General Colin Powell, chairman of the JCS. Aspin's departure from office early in 1994 left further decisions on the Defense budget to his successor. The final FY 1994 budget amounted to a little under $252 billion in total obligational authority.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 10 a.m. on June 25, 1996, {{members of}} a {{terrorist}} group detonated a truck bomb outside building 131 (also known as Khobar Towers) of the King Abdul Aziz Air Base. Inside the building were almost exclusively members of the US Air Force who were there to patrol the southern Iraqi no-fly zone enacted after the Gulf War. In the attack, 19 US military personnel and a Saudi local were killed and 372 were wounded, making this the most deadly terrorist attack on Americans abroad since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. Louis Freeh said in his book My FBI that he felt the deepest about the Khobar Towers investigation, {{and it was not}} until his last day in office, June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia returned a 46-count indictment against 14 defendants charged with the Khobar Towers attack.

500|$|Two {{initiatives}} begun <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> under Browner's tenure {{were part}} of its [...] "reinventing government" [...] program and sought to realize the notion of environmental contracts {{as a way of}} expanding the EPA's flexible public-private partnerships, as an alternative to traditional regulation. Project XL in 1995 was designed to find common sense, cost effective solutions to environmental issues at individual facilities, while the Common Sense Initiative in 1994 was targeted at efforts involving entire industry sectors, rather than dealing with issues on a crisis-by-crisis, pollutant-by-pollutant basis. [...] Project XL had mixed results, with some success stories but an uncertain legal basis regarding enforcement and less active participation than envisioned. [...] The more ambitious Common Sense Initiative, which somewhat resembled the environmental covenants appearing in some European countries and also incorporated the viewpoints of environmental justice, showed limitations in some areas but successes in the printing and metal finishing and plating industries before being concluded in 1998.|$|E

500|$|To {{stop the}} ethnic {{cleansing}} and genocide of Albanians by anti-guerilla military {{units in the}} former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's province of Kosovo, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region. NATO announced that its forces had suffered zero combat deaths, and two deaths from an Apache helicopter crash. Opinions in the popular press criticized pre-war genocide statements <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> as greatly exaggerated. In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide did not take place, but recognized [...] "a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments". The term [...] "ethnic cleansing" [...] {{was used as an}} alternative to [...] "genocide" [...] to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is no difference. Slobodan Milošević, the president of Yugoslavia {{at the time of the}} atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes. Milošević died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "During {{the time}} {{for which he was}} elected" [...] has not been controversial. Justice Joseph Story has expounded in his Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States that the disqualifying event expires at the {{conclusion}} of the elected term in which it occurred. This view is commonly accepted. Moreover, Department of Justice memoranda, outlining official opinions by United States Attorney General, hold that [...] "the Ineligibility Clause covers only increases during the term that a Member of Congress is [...] currently serving". This principle was applied, for example, to the question of whether President Clinton could appoint Representative Bill Richardson as Ambassador to the United Nations despite a salary increase prior to his current term, and whether President Harding could appoint Senator William Kenyon as a Judge despite the Congressional increase of judicial salaries during his previous term. Opinions issued <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> Office of Legal Counsel often presupposed the application of the clause, and conceded that [...] "he tradition of interpreting the Clause has been 'formalistic' rather than 'functional". Another clarification came in 1969, when newly re-elected Representative Melvin Laird was President-elect Nixon's choice for Secretary of Defense and Congress was expected to raise the pay of Cabinet members in the new term. Attorney General Ramsey Clark gave an official opinion, which Laird followed, that Laird could be sworn in and serve in the new term from January 3 to January 20 (when Nixon would take office) without running afoul of the Clause, as long as he joined the cabinet before the pay raise went into effect.|$|E

[...] Both the George H. W. Bush administration and Clinton administration were reluctant to implement the policy, fearing Balkan entanglement. [...] In April 1993, Biden spent a week in the Balkans and held a tense three-hour meeting with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević. [...] Biden related that he told Milošević, [...] "I think you're a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one." [...] Biden wrote an amendment in 1992 to compel the Bush administration to arm the Bosnians, but deferred in 1994 to a somewhat softer stance preferred <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration,</b> before signing on the following year to a stronger measure sponsored by Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman. The engagement led to a successful NATO peacekeeping effort. [...] Biden has called his role in affecting Balkans policy in the mid-1990s his [...] "proudest moment in public life" [...] that related to foreign policy. [...] In 1999, during the Kosovo War, Biden supported the NATO bombing campaign against Serbia and Montenegro, and co-sponsored with his friend John McCain the McCain-Biden Kosovo Resolution, which called on President Clinton to use all necessary force, including ground troops, to confront Milosevic over Serbian actions in Kosovo.

40|$|Unlike {{the vast}} {{majority}} of privatization studies that examine efforts {{at the state and local}} levels, this dissertation focuses on national privatization policy <b>by</b> examining <b>the</b> actions of <b>the</b> Reagan and <b>Clinton</b> <b>administrations.</b> <b>The</b> paper begins with a review of the political and academic movements toward privatization that have occurred during the last thirty years.

The Reagan administration seemed unaware of the political ramifications of its primary privatization effort, the attempted sale of numerous United States public lands, apparently believing that its anti-government ideology alone would bring political success. ^ <b>By</b> contrast, <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> chose not to turn the privatization question into one of “big versus small” government, and instead sold the privatization-friendly Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act as a politically neutral management reform, thereby achieving what it wanted on the legislation.
