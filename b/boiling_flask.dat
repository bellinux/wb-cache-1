Using paper chromatography, Miller identified five amino acids present in {{the solution}}: glycine, α-alanine and β-alanine were positively identified, while aspartic acid and α-aminobutyric acid (AABA) were less certain, due to the spots being faint.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} way of {{preventing}} bumping is by adding {{one or two}} boiling chips to the reaction vessel. However, these alone may not prevent bumping {{and for this reason}} it is advisable to boil liquids in a boiling tube, a <b>boiling</b> <b>flask,</b> or an Erlenmeyer flask. In addition, heating test tubes should never be pointed towards any person, just in case bumping does occur. Whenever a liquid is cooled below its boiling point and re-heated to a boil, a new boiling chip will be needed, as the pores in the old boiling chip tend to fill with solvent, rendering it ineffective.|$|E

The objective of fabricating full denture protheses is to substitute the tissue lost that {{was occupied by}} teeth or connective tissue before ward. This {{is a case of}} a 43 year old female with lost of all her upper and lower teeth. At the maxilla there is a palatine torus spreading along the midline with 25 mm length, 10 mm width and 6 mm height. She has never worn prothese before. The process of full denture protheses fabrication were carried out in several steps, starting from making anatomical impression  to get study model, making of individual stock tray, making functional impression to get working model, choosing the design, making of midline, making of bite rim, inserting the model on articulator, preparing artificial teeth arrangement, fitting the wax, countoring wax, <b>flasking,</b> <b>boiling</b> out, packing, curing, deflasking, finishing, polishing and inserting the protheses. The process of this full denture protheses fabrication used tin foil as reducer to prevent overpressure of the tissue around the thin torus area so the prothesis will be more comfortable for the patient.

As a consequence, natural resources are diminishing and thereby become a global concern and the cause of rising price. The competition to create an alternative fuel underway as well as to reduce the cost, get high profitability and less pollution to human and environment. To overcome these problems, biodiesel is introduced by the researches to substitute the fossil fuels. Biodiesel is the monoalkyl esters of fatty acids produced from renewable feedstock, such as vegetable oils, with glycerin being the primary by product. Biodiesel being studied because the of unique properties and renewable fuels. The production of biodiesel in industrial scale involved triglyceride substance that present in fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) that affect the biodiesel production quality. Thus, this research is to minimize the presence of triglyceride substances in fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) for the alternative of energy sources. In this study, the biodiesel produced in 250 mL three-neck round-bottom flask by using ethanol and palm cooking oil as medium component. Three parameters are studied like ratio of cooking oil-ethanol, rate of reaction, and catalyst activation activity. The best condition of parameters determine by the fastest completed transesterification reaction in the optimal yield produced. Three-neck round-bottom integrated with condenser to generate transesterification process in 250 mL Three-neck round-bottom containing medium chemical reaction. The <b>flasks</b> <b>boiled</b> up by rotamantle in one hour that involved the Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) as catalyst accelerator, 7404 hours for sample experimental without catalyst.

50|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Truog {{worked on a}} test to {{determine}} the amount of nitrogen in the soil which would become available in a season to plant life. At the time this question was mostly academic. However, the farmers were putting more thought into what was in the soil and how the plants interacted with it. Emil talked with Emil Jorgensen in the University of Wisconsin-Madison extension division and got excited. They started a campaign to help farmers get up to 100 bushels per acre, called it “One hundred bushel corn adventure” in 1952. At this time Truog had perfected his 10-year-old nitrogen availability test. Truogs test more closely approximates the interaction of the bacteria and nitrogen throughout the growing season. The test was quite simple and calls for minimum equipment. A lab worker measures a quarter teaspoon of soil to be tested into a <b>boiling</b> <b>flask.</b> Permanganate and sodium carbonate is boiled. The mixture is boiled and the chemicals liberate a portion of the nitrogen. The tube of soil and chemicals can be compared to color of tubes with known concentration to {{determine the amount of}} nitrogen availability. He figured that the farmers needed around 150 pounds of nitrogen to produce 100 bushels of corn.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} of the parenchyma of the lung are currently unknown and difficult to quantify. Creating a computer model with valid property values will allow researchers to further investigate particle mixing in the lung during inhalation and exhalation. One challenge with modeling the material of the lung is the intricate geometry of the alveolar sac. Researchers are currently trying to model particle deposition within the lung using computational fluid dynamics. However, the mechanical {{properties of}} alveolar sac structure are currently undetermined. Due {{to the complexity of}} the physical structure of an alveolar sac, it has been a challenge to model fluid-structural interactions during breathing. To assist in quantifying these interactions, computer aided finite element models are a necessity. These models will allow for calculation of the deflections and deformations of the physical structures of fluid containing membranes. The focal point of the project was to determine mechanical properties of a series of materials. There is currently no process for determining these properties and this was a major accomplishment of this research. The process of finding these properties can be applied to other materials in the future, even on a micro-scale, such as real alveolar tissue materials. These properties were applied to a series of finite element models, predicting deflection. Mechanical properties were determined by using different test specimens to collect data and fit to a Mooney Rivlin model. The results were then applied to a series of finite element models, one for each test specimen and one for a spherical <b>boiling</b> <b>flask.</b> The <b>boiling</b> <b>flask</b> tests showed promising outcome for future research, with a determined material model nearly 40 % increase in accuracy from prior research. The tests were able to be replicated for a second surrogate material, showing that the process works for more than just a single material and allowing the process to be used with a new material in the future...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to improve {{characterization}} of hyperelastic materials in biaxial tension through improved design and validation of an existing test fixture and specimen geometry. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis of the material properties to variations in selected test parameters was conducted to better understand material response. Misalignment and binding in the original tensile test fixture resulted in non-equibiaxial loading and inaccurate stress-strain data. Analysis and modification were required to improve accuracy and repeatability. Vector analysis of the link system and the Minimum Constraint Design method were used to achieve this aim. Based on a proposed set of criteria, a FE analysis was conducted on several biaxial specimen geometries to determine the best shape and scale for obtaining stress and strain data. A stress decay factor (SDF) is proposed to predict internal stresses from measurable data. A test method has been designed around the use of the SDF and was ultimately applied to a cruciform specimen geometry. In addition to the ideal equibiaxial case, numerical simulations have been perturbed in two ways. The first variation involved a specimen gripped clamps offset by up to half the width of the clamp. The second variation involved non-equibiaxial load ratios ranging from 0. 85 to 1. 15. The goal was to quantify the change in stress-strain response to slight deviations from ideal loading conditions. Binding has been eliminated from the test fixture and a 1 : 1 load ratio has been achieved. The new specimen experiences less stress decay while achieving greater experimental strain. A high sensitivity to non-equibiaxial load ratios and low sensitivity to clamp offset are seen in the test parameter analysis. Finally, results from the SDF correction material characterization method is compared with results from an inflated <b>boiling</b> <b>flask</b> geometry...|$|E
40|$|The hydroacoustic nuclear {{explosion}} monitoring regime, like it's {{counterpart in}} seismic monitoring, requires ground truth calibration. Model predictions of traveltimes, blockages, reflections, diffractions, and waveform envelopes {{need to be}} verified with ground truth experiments, particularly in the high latitudes where models often fail. Although pressure detonated explosives are a simple, reliable, and flexible method to generate an impulsive hydroacoustic calibration source at a desired depth; safety procedures, specialized training, and local regulations often preclude their use. This leaves few alternatives since airgun and other seismic marine sources are designed for use only at shallow depths and hence do not effectively couple into the SOFAR channel, a necessary requirement for long range propagation. Imploding spheres could be an effective source at mid-ocean depths and below but development of a method to reliably break such spheres has been elusive. We designed and tested a prototype system to initiate catastrophic glass sphere failure at a prescribed depth. The system firmly holds a glass sphere in contact with a piston-ram assembly. The end cap on the cylinder confining the piston and opposing the ram has a rupture disk sealed to it. The rupture disk is calibrated to fail within 5 % of the calibrated failure pressure, 1000 psi in our tests. Failure of the rupture disk results in a sudden inrush of high pressure water into the air-filled piston chamber, driving the piston [...] and attached ram [...] towards the glass sphere. The spherecracker was first tested on Benthos Corp. flotation spheres. The spherecracker mechanism successfully punched {{a hole in the}} Benthos sphere at the nominal pressure of 1000 psi or at about 700 meters depth in each of four tests. Despite the violent inrush of high pressure water the spheres did not otherwise fail. We concluded that the Benthos spheres were too thick-walled to be used as an imploding source at nominal SOFAR channel depths (500 meters- 1200 meters in mid-latitudes). A much thinner walled sphere, a special order modification of a standard 22 liter laboratory <b>boiling</b> <b>flask</b> made by the Kontes Glass Company, was also tested and found to fail in the desired manner, i. e. catastrophically. A test off the coast of California successfully initiated implosion of a Kontes sphere at 685 meters depth. The recorded signal showed a peak pressure slightly larger than that from 1 lb of high explosive detonated at the same depth. The signal spectra showed relatively broad band higher frequency energy with little signal below about 50 Hz and a broad peak in the amplitude spectra between about 200 and 800 Hz, similar to that from an explosive source detonated at the same depth. Although additional testing and development is needed, an imploding sphere source for hydroacoustic calibrations appears viable. Since the source spectra frequencies are generally higher than the frequency band used for nuclear explosion monitoring, low frequency signals (1 - 50 Hz) will be absent from the implosion source spectra. Calibration will have to be accomplished with frequencies above 50 Hz unless larger spheres, multiple spheres, or shallower implosion depths are used...|$|E
