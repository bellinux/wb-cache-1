5|$|After {{a quarrel}} with Barkis, and realizing {{he was only}} after her {{supposed}} wealth, Victoria follows the procession of dead to the church. Emily notices Victoria and realizes that she is denying Victoria her chance at happiness {{the same way it}} was stolen from her.

Barkis interrupts them, and Emily recognizes him as her former fiance, who is revealed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> murdered her for her dowry. Barkis tries to kidnap Victoria at sword point, but Victor stops him and the two men duel; the dead townspeople are unable to interfere with the affairs of the living. Emily intercedes to save Victor, and Barkis mockingly proposes a toast to Emily, unknowingly drinking the cup of poison.

25|$|As {{early as}} the day he cast Petersen, Friedkin thought about killing off Chance {{towards the end of}} the film, but {{according}} to editor Bud Smith, Vukovich was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was killed. The climactic scene in which Chance is killed was not very well received by MGM executives, who found it to be too negative. To satisfy the studio heads, he shot a second ending, in which Chance survives the shotgun blast and, presumably as an internal punishment, he and Vukovich are transferred to a remote Secret Service station in Alaska, and watch their boss, Thomas Bateman, being interviewed on television. Friedkin previewed the alternate ending and kept the original.|$|E

500|$|In his concert {{review for}} The Village Voice, Don Heckman {{described}} [...] "Bangla Desh" [...] as [...] "a song which expresses {{far better than}} words {{what kind of man}} Harrison is". Heckman went on to compare Harrison's philanthropy with the activities of two of his former bandmates, saying: [...] "I have no quarrel with John Lennon's endless clattering around inside his psyche, or Paul McCartney's search for sweetness and light, but at the moment I have to have stronger feelings about George Harrison's active efforts {{to do something about the}} misery in the world around him. How surprising that the most introspective of the Beatles should <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who,</b> in the long run, takes the most effective actions." ...|$|E
500|$|In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, {{also known}} as [...] "Ma-Ma", executes three rogue drug dealers by having them skinned alive, infused with Slo-Mo (an {{addictive}} new drug which reduces the user's perception of time to 1% of normal) and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay, whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> carried out the drug dealers' executions. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.|$|E
500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{introduced}} an ongoing storyline of Katherine Mayfair exploring her sexuality. Actress Dana Delany, who previously played a lesbian {{character in the}} Showtime series The L Word, said she felt the subplot was an excellent idea: [...] "A lot of the ladies on the set have said, 'Why has this not happened before?' I think everybody wanted to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> got to do it." [...] In an interview with E! Online, actress Marcia Cross jokingly said of the kiss scene, [...] "I'm a little jealous that I'm not involved. What is going on?" [...] Delany {{said she did not}} know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in Desperate Housewives, but that series creator Marc Cherry [...] "is interested in playing the complexity of that". The pairing between Robin and Katherine was the first lesbian relationship in Desperate Housewives.|$|E

500|$|Carla is {{the eldest}} of the four daughters. As is common for the oldest sibling, she is {{somewhat}} seen as the mediator between the four sisters in the novel. [...] "As the therapist in the family Carla likes to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> understands everything" [...] and [...] "has a tendency to lace all her compliments with calls to self-improvement". [...] However to her sisters, this creates a somewhat dominating character at times reminiscent of their mother. Her criticism goes farther when she writes an autobiographical paper calling her mother mildly anal-retentive. [...] In Carla’s first and perhaps most prominent story in the novel, [...] "Trespass", as she is walking home from school in New York, a man exposes himself to her and attempts to lure her into his car. Alvarez uses Carla's character to display the language difficulties faced with only having [...] "classroom English", and how communication barriers affect immigrants.|$|E
500|$|The 1840 Democratic National Convention {{opened at}} Baltimore's Music Hall on May 4, 1840. A subdued affair, it was greatly overshadowed {{by a huge}} [...] "Whig Young Men" [...] {{gathering}} {{that took place in}} Baltimore at the same time, featuring speeches by Senators Clay and Webster. President Van Buren was nominated for a second term, but the convention made no endorsement for vice president. The incumbent, Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky was controversial because he lived with an African American woman, and the influential former president, Andrew Jackson, insisted that Johnson be dumped from the ticket. Johnson, who had fought under Harrison during the War of 1812, was popular in the western states as an Indian fighter (he was alleged to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> killed Tecumseh), and Van Buren stalled. The lack of an endorsement left the matter up to state parties, and Johnson's rivals soon withdrew, leaving him as the de facto [...] vice presidential candidate.|$|E
500|$|The staff {{struggled}} {{throughout the}} writing process to decide which Winchester would be kidnapped and possessed, and were forced to revise the script multiple times to reflect the latest choice. Because of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's recurring role on Grey's Anatomy, however, the writers realized {{that he would not}} be available long enough to be a main focus of the episode. They thus decided late into production for John to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> is captured. With this finalized, Kripke found it rather easy to write the episode; he already knew that the key elements of the episode would be the exorcism of the demon possessing Meg, the death of the real Meg, and the apparent rescue of John Winchester. Kripke felt that it had to be John who was possessed by Azazel, as it united and completed the two main storylines of the seasonfinding their father and tracking down the demonand it did so by finding both characters in one body. He found it a [...] "happy accident" [...] to be able to present the brothers with the opportunity to finally kill the demon, but at the cost of their father's life.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by Falk and Yacoub, co-produced by Tuinfort and Ilya, with vocal production being done by Ilya, Kotecha and Yacoub. [...] "One Last Time" [...] is a dance-pop and EDM-light song, with a total length of three minutes and seventeen seconds (3:17). Its instrumentations consist in [...] "pummeling drums and a three-note synth line". [...] "One Last Time" [...] is written in the key of A-flat major, with a moderately fast tempo of 125 beats per minute. Grande's vocals range from F#3 to C6. Lyrically, the song is about asking a former lover to spend one last time with you, although he has already moved on and is with someone new. As noted by Jason Lipshut of Billboard, [...] "the downbeat admission of 'I know/that you got everything/But I got nothing here without you' is the pained sound of a narrator racked with guilt, the chorus sets aside that humiliation and scoops up a sense of hope," [...] with the singer pleading, [...] "One last time/I need to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> takes you home/One more time/I promise after that, I'll let you go". Rob Copsey of The Official Charts Company noted that the song [...] " [...] reminded him of Swedish's recording artist, Loreen's 2012 Eurovision winning song [...] "Euphoria".|$|E
500|$|Homer Jay Simpson, {{voiced by}} Dan Castellaneta, is {{the protagonist of}} the show {{and the father of}} the Simpson family. He embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, thoughtless and a {{borderline}} alcoholic. He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the situation calls for it, and an integrity reflecting his own values, including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his family. His voice started out as an impression of Walter Matthau but eventually evolved into a more robust voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions. Homer has since {{become one of the most}} influential fictional characters and has been described by the UK newspaper The Sunday Times as the greatest comedic creation of modern time. He has inspired an entire line of merchandise, and his catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", has been included in the Oxford English Dictionary. During the production of the episode Insane Clown Poppy the writers toyed with the idea of giving Homer a long lost legitimate biological daughter, but when the shows showrunner and writer Mike Scully, as well as Matt Groening rejected the idea, the writers changed the story so the clown Krusty would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> finds he has a lost daughter.|$|E
500|$|Before [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] was broadcast, {{a promotional}} {{commercial}} aired on television that featured, among other things, {{the announcement that}} [...] "one of Springfield's most beloved will die" [...] and a snippet of {{a scene from the}} episode with the character Lenny, sitting in the speedway spectator stand, being hit by a car tire, giving the impression that he would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> would die. Many viewers of the commercial, including Speedway Motorsports, Inc. owned Lowe's Motor Speedway president Jerry Gappens, expressed their concern as it appeared the episode was parodying an actual incident that happened during a speedway race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in May 1999, in Charlotte, North Carolina, when flying debris in a crash killed three spectators. Gappens said that doing a parody of that was [...] "a real insensitive thing to do, pretty irresponsible. Obviously what might appear funny in L.A. or New York isn't funny here in Charlotte." [...] Lowe's Motor Speedway announced to WSOC-TV's Channel 9 Eyewitness News on February7,2000 that they were thinking of placing a complaint to the Fox Broadcasting Company. WCCB, the then-Fox affiliate in Charlotte, refused to continue showing the commercial for the episode. As a result, Fox distributed a new commercial to the affiliate on February 9 that did not contain the scene with Lenny.|$|E
