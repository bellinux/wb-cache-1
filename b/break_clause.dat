50|$|In 2015, the Labour Party elected Jeremy Corbyn as its leader. He favours {{bringing}} the railways back into public ownership. At his first party conference as leader, Corbyn proposed taking each franchise back into public ownership {{as they came}} to the natural end of their contracts (i.e. without exercising <b>break</b> <b>clauses),</b> leading to a third of the railway being publicly owned by the end of Parliament in 2025. This was included in the Labour Party's manifesto for the 2017 UK general election.|$|R
40|$|Many {{businesses}} in the UK occupy premises on fixed term leases, which usually run for several years. During this time property requirements can change. This research critically examines the three main mechanisms by which tenants can bring their leases to an end; breaks, assignment and subletting. We examine the legal rules governing these devices and undertake an analysis of lease data and surveys. <b>Break</b> <b>clauses</b> are providing a useful exit mechanism for many tenants, but they cannot give the more general flexibility of assignment and subletting. However, change is necessary to ensure that these latter provisions provide real flexibility for tenants. ...|$|R

5000|$|In April 2006 it was {{announced}} that Allders had secured an extension to their lease through to 2008. The land and store that Allders leased had regular <b>break</b> <b>clauses</b> to the benefit of the [...] "virtual freehold leaseholder" [...] held by Minerva plc subsidiary companies for 250 years. The freehold interest was held by the Whitgift Foundation. Development plans by Minerva for a 1.08 million sq.ft shopping centre were complicated by uncertainty over its tenancy, and competition from the new 1.615 million sq.ft Westfield development at White City, and the 1300000 sq ft shopping development at Bluewater to the east of London.|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} SAT preprocessing {{technique is}} {{the construction of}} symmetry <b>breaking</b> formulas: auxiliary <b>clauses</b> that guide a SAT solver away from needless exploration of symmetric subproblems. However, during the past decade, state-of-the-art SAT solvers rarely incorporated symmetry breaking. This suggests that {{the reduction of the}} search space does not outweigh the overhead incurred by detecting symmetry and constructing symmetry breaking formulas. We investigate three methods to construct more effective symmetry breaking formulas. The first method simply improves the encoding of symmetry breaking formulas. The second detects special symmetry subgroups, for which complete symmetry breaking formulas exist. The third infers binary symmetry <b>breaking</b> <b>clauses</b> for a symmetry group as a whole rather than longer clauses for individual symmetries. We implement these methods in a symmetry breaking preprocessor, and verify their effectiveness on both hand-picked problems as well as the 2014 SAT competition benchmark set. Our experiments indicate that our symmetry breaking preprocessor improves the current state-of-the-art in static symmetry breaking for SAT and has a sufficiently low overhead to improve the performance of modern SAT solvers on hard combinatorial instances. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|As OTC instruments, {{interest}} rate swaps (IRSs) can be customised {{in a number of}} ways and can be structured to meet the specific needs of the counterparties. For example; payment dates could be irregular, the notional of the swap could be amortized over time, reset dates (or fixing dates) of the floating rate could be irregular, mandatory <b>break</b> <b>clauses</b> may be inserted into the contract, etc. A common form of customisation is often present in new issue swaps where the fixed leg cashflows are designed to replicate those cashflows received as the coupons on a purchased bond. The interbank market, however, only has a few standardised types. Each currency has its own standard market conventions regarding the frequency of payments, the day count conventions and the end-of-month rule.|$|R

2500|$|The Hayward-Hughes inquiry, which {{reported}} in June 1982, found that Militant {{was guilty of}} <b>breaking</b> <b>Clause</b> II, section 3 of the Labour Party constitution.

[...] In the words of the authors: [...] "It is clear that the Militant Tendency is a well organised caucus centrally controlled operation within the Labour Party and it is equally clear that supporters of the Tendency are in control of the Labour Party Young Socialists at National and Regional level." [...] Crick though, pointed out that numerous other groups within Labour left and right, had also broken the strictly worded constitution, such as Labour Solidarity, the Labour Co-ordinating Committee and the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, but that [...] "dislike of Militant" [...] had developed [...] "because it has breached the constitution so blatantly and, perhaps more importantly, so effectively".|$|R

40|$|Accounting standard-setters have {{proposed}} {{that the right to}} use assets (including land and buildings) acquired under operating lease contracts should be recognized on the balance sheet of lessee companies. In recent years, several empirical research studies have investigated the potential impact of the proposed changes in accounting for leases. The current paper reviews this work and presents some new evidence, for a property audience. It summarizes evidence that operating leases represent a major source of finance for many companies generally, and more specifically for companies in the retail sector. Recognition of operating leases on the lessee's balance sheet would {{have a significant impact on}} performance measures, especially gearing. If markets are informationally 'efficient' such changes should have little impact. However, research evidence on efficiency with respect to lease accounting information is mixed. What's more, company managers do not believe that the market is efficient so are likely to behave as if the markets are 'inefficient'.   Possible reactions include reduced use of leasing, shorter lease contract terms, more <b>break</b> <b>clauses,</b> or increased use of contingent rental agreements. It seems likely that lessors will be under pressure to bear greater risks. This paper was presented at the RICS Cutting Edge 2001 Conference, Oxford...|$|R
