The earlier {{form of the}} pomfret's name was , a word which probably ultimately comes from Portuguese pampo, referring to various fish such as the <b>blue</b> <b>butterfish</b> (Stromateus fiatola). This fish {{is also known as}} 'Vavval' (வௌவால் [...] ) in Tamil, 'Maanji' (ಮಾಂಜಿ) in Tulu and 'Paplet' in Hindi, Marathi and Nawayathi.|$|E
40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} {{of carbon}} and nitrogen {{were used to}} test the hypothesis that stomach content analysis has systematically overlooked the consumption of gelatinous zooplankton by pelagic mesopredators and apex predators. The results strongly supported a major role of gelatinous plankton in the diet of bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus), spearfish (Tetrapturus belone) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). Loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the oceanic stage and ocean sunfish (Mola mola) also primarily relied on gelatinous zooplankton. In contrast, stable isotope ratios ruled out any relevant consumption of gelatinous plankton by bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix), blue shark (Prionace glauca), leerfish (Lichia amia), bonito (Sarda sarda), striped dolphin (Stenella caerueloalba) and loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the neritic stage, all of which primarily relied on fish and squid. Fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) were confirmed as crustacean consumers. The ratios of stable isotopes in albacore (Thunnus alalunga), amberjack (Seriola dumerili), <b>blue</b> <b>butterfish</b> (Stromaeus fiatola), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), dolphinfish (Coryphaena hyppurus), horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus), mackerel (Scomber scombrus) and pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) were consistent with mixed diets revealed by stomach content analysis, including nekton and crustaceans, but the consumption of gelatinous plankton could not be ruled out completely. In conclusion, the jellyvorous guild in the Mediterranean integrates two specialists (ocean sunfish and loggerhead sea turtles in the oceanic stage) and several opportunists (bluefin tuna, little tunny, spearfish, swordfish and, perhaps, <b>blue</b> <b>butterfish),</b> most of them with shrinking populations due to overfishing...|$|E
40|$|This study {{combined}} {{the analysis of}} fatty acids and stable isotopes of nitrogen and carbon {{to test the hypothesis}} that the pelagic food web of the south Catalan Sea has a wasp-waist structure supported by sardines Sardina pilchardus. If this hypo-thesis were correct, most predators would be expected to have stable isotope ratios and fatty acid profiles consistent with those derived from a sardine-based diet. However, this was true only for mackerel Scomber scomber, <b>blue</b> <b>butterfish</b> Stromateus fiatola, all seabirds and oceanic loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta. The values of the DHA/EPA index of neritic loggerhead turtles and striped dolphins Stenella caeru leo alba were also consistent with a sardine/squid diet, but their trophic positions were too high. On the other hand, the DHA/EPA index of most predatory fishes indicated that anchovies Engraulis encrasicolus and/or horse mackerel Trachurus trachurus were their main prey. Nevertheless, some amounts of low trophic level invertebrates were likely to be consumed by some predatory fishes, because their trophic positions where lower than expected from a fish-based diet only. The heterogeneous distribution of phytoplankton groups above and below the thermocline during the warm season is hypothesized to be the primary reason for this food web structure, although the strong reliance of some seabirds on sardines is the likely consequence of a massive consumption of discards from fishing boats. In short, there is little evidence for a wasp-waist structure based on sardine, which may explain why the populations of predators fluctuate less than the population of sardines. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
