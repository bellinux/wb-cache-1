This indicated good profits, as the film cost about $13 million to produce and TriStar Pictures paid a much smaller amount to acquire U.S. distribution rights. With <b>box</b> <b>office</b> <b>takings</b> of over $68 million, The Call is WWE Studios' most commercially successful film to date, the previous top-grossing productions being See No Evil, which stars professional wrestler Kane (Glenn Jacobs) ($19 million) and 12 Rounds, which stars professional wrestler John Cena ($17 million).|$|E

25|$|Scarface {{was given}} an X rating in North America three times for extreme violence, {{frequent}} strong language, and hard drug usage. The restrictive rating was more associated with pornography at the time, and it both limited the number of cinemas willing to screen such a film and restricted promotional advertising, which would potentially adversely affect any <b>box</b> <b>office</b> <b>takings.</b> An early scene was singled out {{as the cause of}} the X rating, where Montana's associate Angel is dismembered with a chainsaw off screen. De Palma made edits to the scene and resubmitted it to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), but was again given an X rating. He made further edits and resubmitted it from three to five times before refusing to further edit the film, telling Universal to either release it in its current form or fire and replace him with someone who would edit it. Universal opted to appeal the MPAA's decision. Studio president Robert Rehme attended the hearing which was presided over by his friend MPAA President Jack Valenti. Among those speaking on behalf of the film during the appeal were film critic Roger Ebert, the head of Florida's Broward County organized crime division, and the head of a major theater chain named Alan Friedberg. MPAA member Richard Heffner later admitted that he could have fought harder to retain the X rating, but he believed that Valenti did not support the decision, as {{he did not want to}} alienate the big film studios. The decision was overwhelmingly in favor of releasing the film with a less restrictive R rating.|$|E

500|$|His health {{had always}} been poor, but a stage {{accident}} in 1916 weakened Formby's lungs, [...] and he suffered increasingly {{for the next few}} years, reducing his ability to perform. Tuberculosis and influenza—the latter contracted in the pandemic of 1918—weakened his constitution further, and he died of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1921 at the age of 45. Formby's act, and one of his costumes and canes, inspired Charlie Chaplin in the formation of his character the Tramp. Formby's son also used parts of his father's act when starting his stage career and, once established, also changed his name to George Formby; Formby Jnr {{went on to become the}} top British male star in <b>box</b> <b>office</b> <b>takings</b> between 1937 and 1943.|$|E

500|$|As {{the company}} was {{particularly}} short of money following an abortive season in Berlin, a big success was urgently needed. At first the production seemed merely to be a modest success. It soon benefited from an outraged review by Jules Janin, the critic of the Journal des Débats; he condemned the piece for profanity and irreverence (ostensibly to Roman mythology but in reality to Napoleon and his government, generally seen as the targets of its satire). Offenbach and his librettist Hector Crémieux seized on this free publicity, and joined in a lively public debate in the columns of the Parisian daily newspaper Le Figaro. Janin's indignation made the public agog to see the work, and the <b>box</b> <b>office</b> <b>takings</b> were prodigious. Among {{those who wanted to}} see the satire of the emperor was the emperor himself, who commanded a performance in April 1860.
