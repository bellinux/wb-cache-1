25|$|Beta {{hemolysis}} (β-hemolysis), {{sometimes called}} complete hemolysis, {{is a complete}} lysis of red cells in the media around and under the colonies: the area appears lightened (yellow) and transparent. Streptolysin, an exotoxin, is the enzyme produced by the bacteria which causes the complete lysis of red blood cells. There {{are two types of}} streptolysin: Streptolysin O (SLO) and streptolysin S (SLS). Streptolysin O is an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin, secreted by most Group A streptococcus (GAS), and interacts with cholesterol in the membrane of eukaryotic cells (mainly red and white blood cells, macrophages, and platelets), and usually results in β-hemolysis under the surface of <b>blood</b> <b>agar.</b> Streptolysin S is an oxygen-stable cytotoxin also produced by most GAS strains which results in clearing on the surface of <b>blood</b> <b>agar.</b> SLS affects immune cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, and is thought to prevent the host immune system from clearing infection. Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus (GAS), displays beta hemolysis.|$|E

25|$|<b>Blood</b> <b>agar</b> plates (BAPs) contain {{mammalian}} blood (usually sheep or horse), typically at {{a concentration}} of 5–10%. BAPs are enriched, differential media used to isolate fastidious organisms and detect hemolytic activity. β-Hemolytic activity will show lysis and complete digestion of red blood cell contents surrounding a colony. Examples include Streptococcus haemolyticus. α-Hemolysis will only cause partial lysis of the red blood cells (the cell membrane is left intact) and will appear green or brown, due to the conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. An example {{of this would be}} Streptococcus viridans. γ-Hemolysis (or nonhemolytic) is the term referring to a lack of hemolytic activity. BAPs also contain meat extract, tryptone, sodium chloride, and agar.|$|E
500|$|S. iniae is beta-hemolytic when {{incubated}} in [...] conditions, {{although it}} may be misidentified as alpha-hemolytic because, in some strains, zones of beta-hemolysis (complete destruction of red blood cells in the <b>blood</b> <b>agar</b> culture medium) are surrounded by large zones of alpha-hemolysis (incomplete destruction of red blood cells with a greenish discoloration due to breakdown of hemoglobin). The bacterium is catalase-negative and LAP-positive (like all streptococci), PYR-test and CAMP-test-positive, does not hydrolyze sodium hippurate, and does not grow in bile esculin agar. It does not express any of the known Lancefield antigens.|$|E
2500|$|Species of Streptococcus are {{classified}} {{based on their}} hemolytic properties. Alpha-hemolytic species cause oxidization of iron in hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells, giving it a greenish color on <b>blood</b> <b>agar.</b> Beta-hemolytic species cause complete rupture of red blood cells.

Both Tween 80 and the bilayer composition enhanced G. vaginalis production of human blood hemolysis, permitting detection of this organism even {{in the presence of}} heavy growth of other vaginal flora. The use of HB or HBT medium thus permitted the demonstration that G. vaginalis was present in vaginal fluid from a large percentage (up to 68 %) of normal women.

Aim : To compare the results antibiotic susceptibility test on media Haemophilus Test Media (HTM), sheep <b>blood</b> derived chocolate <b>agar</b> (ACD), human <b>blood</b> chocolate <b>agar</b> (ACM), and human <b>blood</b> derived chocolate <b>agar</b> with modifications of intensive erythrocytes washing (ACMC). Methods : This study design was true-experimental designs post test only. Antibiotic susceptibility test {{was carried out by}} disc diffusion method (CLSI 2011) on media HTM, ACD, ACM and the ACMC against 11 strains of H. influenzae. Compatibility of the test results with HTM medium was measured using Kappa acceptance of K> 0. 80. Result : on ACD media, compatibility (Kappa) > 0. 80 achieved by only 40 % antibiotic tested (chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole). On ACM, Kappa values> 0. 80 only achieved on 60 % antibiotic tested(chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, and tetracycline). On ACMC Kappa value> 0. 80 only achieved on 80 % antibiotic tested (ceftriaxone, chloramphenicol, cotrimoxazole, and tetracycline).
