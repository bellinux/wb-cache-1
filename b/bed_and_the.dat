5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E
5|$|Below the dam {{the river}} flows west, passing the mostly dry Lower Klamath Lake <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{hydroelectric}} John C. Boyle Dam. The Klamath River then enters California, where {{it passes through}} three more hydroelectric plants and turns south {{near the town of}} Hornbrook towards Mount Shasta. However, the river soon swings west to receive the Shasta River and the Scott River, entering a long canyon through the Klamath Mountains.|$|E
5|$|In Madison Park, Seattle, {{a family}} are {{gathered}} around the television. The mother leaves to go to <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere in the room grows tense. The older of two sisters, Connie Bangs (Michelle Joyner) takes her sister Sara—who is clearly much younger than she is—to her bedroom and locks her in, warning her not to let her father inside. Connie {{runs out of the}} house, fighting off her father, and is later found wandering the streets confused. She is taken to clinical social worker Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher), and admits that her father has been sexually abusing her for years.|$|E

5|$|Black Creek is {{situated}} within the Northern Anthracite Coal Field. Rock formations in the watershed include the Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Llwellyn Formation. Coal {{beds in the}} watershed include the Lower Red Ash bed, the Upper Red Ash bed, the Lower Ross bed, the Upper Ross <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Baltimore Bed. Ridges of mine waste also occur in the creek's drainage basin. Mining {{was done in the}} watershed as early as the winter of 1836-1837, but it stopped in 1955. The creek and the surrounding areas were the subject of a joint study by several federal and state organizations in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|During that era, {{hospital}} {{nurses and}} midwives were {{trained on the}} job. Schwester Selma trained and supervised all the nurses, operating-room nurses, and midwives in the hospital, teaching the former {{how to make a}} hospital <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> latter how to diaper newborns and swaddle infants. Sometimes she also substituted for the midwives, who did not live on the premises. For many years, Schwester Selma was Dr. Wallach's right-hand assistant in the areas of uterine curettages, tracheotomies, and ritual circumcisions, accompanied him on house calls, and stood in for him as hospital director when he was away. From 1916 to 1930 she was also in charge of supplies and building maintenance, and making sure the kashrut in the kitchen met Dr. Wallach's strict standards.|$|E

5|$|Examples of Burges's painted {{furniture}} {{can be seen}} {{in major}} museums including the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the National Museum Wales and the Manchester Art Gallery. The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford, holds a particularly fine collection, begun with a large number of purchases from the estate of Charles and Lavinia Handley-Read, including the Narcissus washstand, Burges's <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Crocker Dressing Table. The most recent acquisition by the Bedford Museum is the Zodiac settle (1869–70), painted by Henry Stacy Marks. The Museum paid £850,000 for the settle, comprising a £480,000 grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, £190,000 from the Trustees of the Cecil Higgins Art Gallery and £180,000 from the Art Fund after the British government imposed an export ban on the work.|$|E

The next morning, Toby's boots are filled with switches, indicating—according to Klaus's story—that he has been visited by the Krampus due to his naughtiness. Celia {{suspects}} Kathy, who is not Toby's mother, but Julian rebukes her. At dinner, Toby {{tells of the}} wonderful day he has had with Klaus. Toby heads to bed, and Kathy speculates that Toby was sleepwalking the night before, becoming agitated when Julian and Celia are unconvinced. That night, both Toby and Celia are out of <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> figure of the Krampus is seen. The next day, scratches are found on Toby's body, and Celia leaves with the child.|$|E

25|$|At {{the closed}} stations, barbed wire fences were {{installed}} {{to prevent any}} would-be escapees from East Berlin from accessing the track <b>bed,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> electrically live third rail served as an additional and potentially lethal deterrent. An alarm was triggered if anyone breached one of the barriers. As for the entrances, the signage was removed, walkways were walled up and stairways were sealed with concrete slabs. Police stations were built into the windowed platform service booths, from which the whole platform area could be monitored.|$|E

Patients were treated between meals and those who wished {{to go for a}} walk could do so. At 8:30 PM, the patients went to <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> captain made another inspection tour.

25|$|The {{restoration}} of Queiq River is directed towards {{the revival of}} the flow of the river, demolishing both the artificial cover of the stream <b>bed</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reinforcement of the stream banks along the river in the city centre. The flow of the river was blocked during the 1960s by the Turks, turning the river into a tiny sewage channel, something that led the authorities to cover the stream during the 1970s. In 2006 the flow of pure water was restored through the efforts of the Syrian government, granting a new life to the Quweiq River.|$|E
