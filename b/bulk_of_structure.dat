40|$|A {{review is}} given {{of what kind}} {{technological}} aspects were used for realizing the defect engineering in semiconductor layers or crystals. The possibilities to change the free carrier capture are presented. The effect of Fermi level pinning at the surface levels allow to avoid the influence of barriers on the photoconductivity {{as well as to}} increase a role of recombination in the inter-crystalline region. The isovalent doping or the creation of the clusters allows transforming the defect distribution in the crystal bulk. The detector structure using the high electric field can introduce the recombination in at the contacts therefore allow diminishing a role of carrier capture in the <b>bulk</b> <b>of</b> <b>structure.</b> The cluster generation allows to increase the capture rate in the definite volume by a proton irradiation. The experience of different technologies for Si, GaAs, PbS, CdSe are presented...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntramolecular excimerization of Py- 3 -Py and {{fluorescence}} {{polarization of}} DPH {{were used to}} evaluate effects of ethanol on the rate and range of the lateral mobility {{and the range of}} the rotational mobility <b>of</b> <b>bulk</b> bilayer <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> the Sp 2 / 0 -PMV. In a concentration-vepenvent manner, ethanol increased the rate and range of the lateral mobility and the range of the rotational mobility <b>of</b> <b>bulk</b> bilayer <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> Sp 2 / 0 -PMV. Selective quenching of DPH by trinitrophenyl groups was utilized to examine the range of transbilayer asymmetric rotational mobility of the Sp 2 / 0 -PMV. The anisotropy (r), limiting anisotropy (r∞) and orher parameter (S) of DPH in the inner monolayer were 0. 022, 0. 029 and 0. 063, respectively, greater than calculated for the outer monolayer of the Sp 2 / 0 -PMV. Selective quenching of DPH by trinitrophenyl groups was also used to examine the transbilayer asymmetric effects of ethanol on the range of the rotational mobility of the Sp 2 / 0 -PMV. Ethanol had a greater increasing effect on the range of the rotational mobility of the outer monolayer as compared to the inner monolayer of the Sp 2 / 0 -PMV. It has been proven that ethanol exhibits a selective rather than nonselective fluidizing effect within the transbilayer domains of the Sp 2 / 0 -PMV...|$|R

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{hydrogenated}} amorphous carbons (a-C:H) produced by continuous or pulsed discharges of acetylene (C(2) H(2)) in an unbalanced magnetron setup was investigated. At 5 × 10 (- 3) Torr, only smooth films are obtained, whereas at 5 × 10 (- 1) Torr using a pulsed discharge some microtextured films are formed if the duty cycle is low.

The local {{environment}} of vanadium in V/Al/O amorphous oxide catalyst {{has been studied}} under propane ammoxidation reaction conditions. In situ valence-to-core X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the V K-edge showed that acrylonitrile production starts when vanadium in the <b>bulk</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> the oxide material changes its formal oxidation state from + 4. 8 to + 3. 8 +/- 0. 1. Exposure of the catalyst to pure NH 3 at 500 degrees C leads to further reduction of vanadium. Valence-to-core XES has also proved that the level <b>of</b> <b>bulk</b> nitridation <b>of</b> vanadium in the active catalyst was rather small. XPS analysis performed ex situ after the catalytic tests confirmed the presence of significant amounts of N 3 -, NHx, and -NN- species on the catalyst surface. {{it can be concluded}} that activation of V/Al/O catalyst on-stream is mainly associated with reduction of vanadium in the <b>bulk</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> the material and nitridation of vanadium atoms on the surface.
