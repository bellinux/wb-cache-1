40|$|This {{internship}} {{report is}} submitted in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Business Administration, 2011. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 53). Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. {{is one of the}} world‟s most successful fast moving consumer goods manufacturing companies with local manufacturing facilities, reporting to regional business groups for innovation and business results. Unilever Bangladesh Limited has five departments to carry out all the organizational functions. I was appointed in Brand Activation Departments Headed by the Brand Activation Manager as an intern. This internship report is on “Hair Care Survey on Parlors & Salons in Dhaka”. The report comprises the survey of 60 ladies parlors and 34 men‟s salons in the Dhaka metropolitan city. The survey includes both qualitative and quantitative issues. The findings differed slightly between the two groups of gender. Women are more concerned about voluminous hair and prevention of split ends than men but both the gender are concerned about nourishment of hair, hair fall problems, dandruffs etc. Both men and women are becoming increasingly aware {{of the quality of the}} hair care products used in parlors and salons. According to the survey, majority of the parlors are using cheap Chinese, Thai or Indian herbal shampoos and conditioners. Caring conditioner is a prominent brand used in parlors owing to its cost effectiveness. Among the local brands, Sunsilk is the most commonly used brand in Grade B and Grade C parlors and Pantene is used in Grade A parlors especially for premium customers as Pantene is considered as high end product by customers. In men‟s salons, Pantene and Head & Shoulder dominate while conditioners are rarely used. Men‟s salon mostly prefers 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. One of the major necessities is to build and maintain a good relationship with parlors and salons and initiatives like beauty seminars, <b>beauty</b> <b>talk</b> shows on television or radios or other promotional campaign can be arranged that will lead to a win-win situation for both the company and the parlors and salons. An important concern of parlors and salons is the unavailability of 5 liters gallon shampoos in the market, limited sales on credit and direct delivery opportunities which should be considered if profit is to be boosted from this sector. This report includes valuable insights gained from the survey and suggestions to overcome some of the problems faced by parlors and salons regarding hair care products and how a good relationship can be built with parlors and salons to ensure attractive yield from this sector.

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century Taormina gained further {{prominence}} {{as the place}} where Wilhelm von Gloeden worked {{most of his life}} as a photographer of predominantly male nudes. There is some speculation about Taormina being an early gentlemen's destination. Also credited for making Taormina popular was Otto Geleng, best known in his hometown of Berlin for his fine paintings, which he composed and painted in Italy but exhibited in Germany. What distinguishes Geleng, however, is his choice to depict the more southern regions where he captured the spectacular views and light of Sicily. He often painted the area's Greek colonial ruins, including Taormina. Taormina's first important tourist was Johann Wolfgang Goethe, who dedicated exalting pages to the city in his book entitled Italian Journey, but perhaps it was Geleng’s views that made its <b>beauty</b> <b>talked</b> about throughout Europe and turned the site into a tourist center. The artist arrived in Sicily at the age of 20 in search of new subjects for his paintings. On his way through Taormina he was so enamoured by the landscape that he decided to stop for part of the winter. Geleng began to paint everything that Taormina offered: ruins, sea, mountains, none of which were familiar to the rest of Europe. When his paintings were later exhibited in Berlin and Paris, many critics accused Geleng of having an ‘unbridled imagination’. At that, Geleng challenged them all to go to Taormina with him, promising that he would pay everyone's expenses if he were not telling the truth.|$|R

There she sat like an incarnate spirit of <b>beauty,</b> hardly <b>talking</b> at all, and when she did, very low, but all the while looking at me. There was a white flower in her black hair, and I tried to keep my eyes on it and count the petals, but it was of no use. At last, whether it was her gaze, or the perfume in her hair, or what I do not know, but I almost felt as though I was being mesmerized. At last she roused herself.|$|R

While Yennefer takes a bath, Geralt is amazed by her beauty, but also realizes that it is probably a spell, as most girls who become sorceresses are ugly or malformed by nature.

50|$|Padmini, {{also known}} as Padmavati, was a legendary 13th-14th century Indian queen (Rani). The {{earliest}} source to mention her is Padmavat, an epic poem written by Malik Muhammad Jayasi in 1540 CE. The text, which features elements of fantasy, describes her story as follows: Padmavati was an exceptionally beautiful princess of the Singhal kingdom (Sri Lanka). Ratan Sen, the Rajput ruler of Chittor, heard about her <b>beauty</b> from a <b>talking</b> parrot named Hiraman. After an adventurous quest, he married her and brought her to Chittor. Alauddin Khilji, the Sultan of Delhi also heard about her beauty, and attacked Chittor to obtain her. Meanwhile, Ratan Sen {{was killed in a}} combat with Devpal, the king of Kumbhalner who was also enamoured with Padmavati's beauty. Before Alauddin Khilji could capture Chittor, Padmavati and her companions committed Jauhar (self-immolation) to protect their honour.|$|R
50|$|Jeremy Jones (Benson) is a shy, bespectacled Jewish fifteen-year-old {{living in}} a New York City {{apartment}} with his parents, who are busy with their own pursuits and leave him mostly on his own. He attends a private high school {{that focuses on the}} performing arts, where he is a serious student of cello who aspires to musical greatness. He has an after-school job as a dog walker. His other interests include reading poetry, playing chess and basketball, and following horse racing, where he can consistently pick winners, though he never places a bet himself. At school, he enters an empty classroom looking for chalk, sees a girl (O'Connor) inside practicing ballet, and is instantly smitten with her <b>beauty.</b> They <b>talk</b> briefly, but he is flustered and completely forgets to ask her name. He later finds out she is a new student named Susan Rollins, and that she is older than him and in a higher grade. Jeremy follows her from a distance for a few days, but is too shy to approach her, so his more confident friend Ralph takes matters into his own hands and explains the situation to her, and she sends the message back to Jeremy that he should call her. However, Jeremy decides not to call after seeing her walking with a handsome older boy. Shortly afterwards, Susan attends a school recital where Jeremy plays the cello as a featured soloist. She is impressed by his playing and congratulates him afterwards, motivating him to finally call her and ask her out.|$|R
60|$|Yet all {{the same}} there is an {{excellent}} reason why one should shun beauty in a prospective wife, at anyrate obvious beauty--the kind of <b>beauty</b> people <b>talk</b> about, and which gets into the photographers' windows. The common beautiful woman has a style of her own, a favourite aspect. After all, she cannot be perfect. She comes upon you, dazzles you, marries you; {{there is a time}} of ecstasy. People envy you, continue to envy you. After a time you envy yourself--yourself of the day before yesterday. For the imperfection, the inevitable imperfection--in one case I remember it was a smile--becomes visible to you, becomes your especial privilege. That is the real reason. No beauty is a beauty to her husband. But with the plain woman--the thoroughly plain woman--it is different. At first--I will not mince matters--her ugliness is an impenetrable repulse. Face it. After a time little things begin to appear through the violent discords: little scraps of melody--a shy tenderness in her smile that peeps out at you and vanishes, a something that is winning, looking out of her eyes. You find a waviness of her hair that you never saw at the beginning, a certain surprising, pleasing, enduring want of clumsiness in part of her ear. And it is yours. You can see she strikes the beholder with something of a shock; and while the beauty of the beauty is common for all the world to rejoice in, you will find in your dear, plain wife beauty enough and to spare; exquisite--for it is all your own, your treasure-trove, your safely-hidden treasure....|$|R
2500|$|Táhrih exerted a {{powerful}} charm and charisma {{on those who}} met her, and she was generally praised for her beauty. Contemporaries and modern historians comment on Táhirih’s rare physical beauty. A courtier described her as [...] "moonfaced", [...] "with hair like musk" [...] whilst one of her fathers pupils wondered how a woman of her beauty could be so intelligent. [...] Historian Nabíl-i-A`zam reports the [...] "highest terms of [...] beauty", George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, wrote, [...] "beauty and the female sex also lent their consecration to the new creed and the heroism… the lovely but ill-fated poetess of Qazvín". British Professor Edward Granville Browne who spoke to {{a great number of}} her contemporaries, wrote that she was renowned for her [...] "marvellous beauty". The Shah's Austrian physician, Jakob Eduard Polak, also cited her beauty. `Abdu'l-Bahá and Bahiyyih Khánum noted her <b>beauty</b> in several <b>talks</b> and writings. Táhirih's education with her father lead her to become a devoutly religious and she upheld these beliefs {{for the rest of her}} life. It also made her hungry for knowledge and she busied herself with reading and writing religious and other forms of literature. Her formal education ended when she was about thirteen or fourteen, when she was summoned by her father to consent to a betrothal arranged by her uncle and father.|$|R
2500|$|In mid-2000 Shocker, Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. {{teamed up}} in Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) {{to form a}} group called Los Guapos (The Hansome Ones"). The Los Guapos concept {{presented}} all three wrestlers as vain, selffocused bordering on narcissistic metrosexual wrestlers who were almost more concerned with their looks, bleached hair etc. than anything else. The group {{took part in a}} large number of vignettes with them visiting <b>beauty</b> spas and <b>talking</b> about their looks, which played for comedic value, especially considering none of the wrestlers were considered [...] "classically beautiful", in fact Scorpio, Jr's father was nicknamed El Rey Feo ("The Ugly King") and the son took after his father. In mid-2001 both Scorpio Jr. and Salvaje wanted to bring in their long time friend and partner Emilio Charles Jr. to the group, which Shocker opposed on the ground that Charles Jr. was simply [...] "too ugly". Even after attempts at a [...] "make over" [...] Shocker still opposed the inclusion. in the fall Los Guapos turned on Shocker, and the three Nuevo Guapos attacked Shocker during and after several matches. In the end Shocker and Emilio Charles Jr. agreed to a Lucha de Apuesta or [...] "bet match" [...] where both wrestlers would put their hair on the line against the outcome of the match. The Luchas de Apuestas match is the ultimate [...] "storyline settler" [...] in Lucha Libre and would also determine which side would be the true Los Guapos.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{looks at}} how 11 women aged 18 - 25 talk about femininity and the feminine body. The analysis {{is based on}} interview data collected in 2000, in Palmerston North and Napier, New Zealand. A discursive approach was used in analyzing the texts. The main assumption was that the meanings the women give to events and people when talking about femininity {{are likely to be}} related to their constructions of their bodies. Four main areas were looked at: the first was how the women talk of their bodies in relation to their evaluative sense of self; the second was how the women talk about the standards of beauty that are presented to them in the media; the third being how the women talk about themselves as consumers of fashion and beauty products; and the last was how the women talked about their understanding of femininity. Women generally constructed their physical appearance as relating closely to their sense of self, particularly their self-esteem. Beauty standards, especially those portrayed in the media were constructed as standards of physical attractiveness that are impossible to live up to. As a result of this, the women talked about depression and anxiety. In order to attempt to live up to these standards of <b>beauty,</b> women also <b>talked</b> of the ways they altered their appearance, particularly in regards to weight-loss, as well as the use of fashion and cosmetics. The concept of femininity was difficult for the women to talk about, as many had never given the idea much thought. Stereotypic notions of femininity as passive and self sacrificing were usually used, along side new ways of thinking about the concept, which often involved adopting valued masculine traits, such as independence and describing them as now relating to being a woman...|$|R
60|$|If men sneer, as our habit is, at the artifices {{of an old}} beauty, at her paint, perfumes, ringlets; {{at those}} innumerable, and to us unknown, stratagems with which {{she is said to}} remedy the ravages of time and {{reconstruct}} the charms whereof years have bereft her; the ladies, it is to be presumed, are not on their side altogether ignorant that men are vain as well as they, and that the toilets of old bucks are to the full as elaborate as their own. How is it that old Blushington keeps that constant little rose-tint on his cheeks; and where does old Blondel get the preparation which makes his silver hair pass for golden? Have you ever seen Lord Hotspur get off his horse when he thinks nobody is looking? Taken out of his stirrups, his shiny boots can hardly totter up the steps of Hotspur House. He is a dashing young nobleman still as you see the back of him in Rotten Row; when you behold him on foot, what an old, old fellow! Did you ever form to yourself any idea of Dick Lacy (Dick has been Dick these sixty years) in a natural state, and without his stays? All these men are objects whom the observer of human life and manners may contemplate with as much profit as the most elderly Belgravian Venus, or inveterate Mayfair Jezebel. An old reprobate daddy-longlegs, who has never said his prayers (except perhaps in public) these fifty years: an old buck who still clings to as many of the habits of youth as his feeble grasp of health can hold by: who has given up the bottle, but sits with young fellows over it, and tells naughty stories upon toast-and-water--who has given up <b>beauty,</b> but still <b>talks</b> about it as wickedly as the youngest roue in company--such an old fellow, I say, if any parson in Pimlico or St. James's were to order the beadles to bring him into the middle aisle, and there set him in an armchair, and make a text of him, and preach about him to the congregation, could be turned to a wholesome use for once in his life, and might be surprised to find that some good thoughts came out of him. But we are wandering from our text, the honest Major, who sits all this while with his feet cooling in the bath: Morgan takes them out of that place of purification, and dries them daintily, and proceeds to set the old gentleman on his legs, with waistband and wig, starched cravat, and spotless boots and gloves.|$|R
