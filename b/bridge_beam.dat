40|$|The use of {{lightweight}} aggregates in pretensioned {{prestressed concrete}} beams {{is becoming more}} advantageous as our design criteria dictate longer span concrete <b>bridges.</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>beams</b> of greater lengths have been restricted from travel on many of our highways because {{the weight of the}} combined beams and transporting vehicle was excessive, making hauls of any distance prohibitive. This, along with the fact that new safety requirements necessitate the use of longer spans in grade separation structures over major highways, prompted the State of Iowa to investigate the use of lightweight aggregate <b>bridge</b> <b>beams.</b> The objective of this project is the collection of field deflection measurements for five pretensioned prestressed lightweight aggregate concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>beams</b> fabricated by conventional plant processes; also the comparison of the actual cambers and deflections of the beams with that predicted from the design assumptions...|$|R

The bridge would have a single main cable and a split <b>bridge</b> <b>beam.</b> The cable would run down {{the centre of the}} bridge, with the lanes on each side of an open area with cross-sections. While this method is more expensive, it allows for a more aerodynamic bridge. The bridge would have two pylons, with the road lanes crossing {{on the outside of the}} pylons. Each pylon would be 320 m tall. The pylons would be round with a diameter of between 20 and 40 m. The northern pylon would be anchored in bedrock, while the southern pylon would be anchored in a caisson in bedrock, located 25 m below mean sea level. The distance between the middle of the lanes would be 41 m at the pylons, and 15 m at the middle of the bridge. The main cable would be 315 m above the sea at the pylons and 90 m above the sea at the middle. The bridge allows a clearance below of 70 m, 500 m wide.|$|E

The finite element program ANSYS was used to study the structural response of using various ingredients of fibre volume fraction in the reinforced FRP Douglas fir timber <b>bridge</b> <b>beams.</b> The beams were theoretically loaded under static loading condition. These beams had dimensions of 130 × 330 × 4500 mm. The material reinforcement used was made from unidirectional fibre glass material made by Vector Ply Corporation mixed with Epoxy West System of 105 resign and 206 hardener. The material properties used in the ANSYS program were obtained from material testing. The influence of having various fibre volume fractions of the FRP plates on the strength and the stiffness of the timber <b>bridge</b> <b>beams</b> was evaluated. Discussions emanating from the computational investigation will provide interesting findings and will confirm the use of FRP as an effective and viable solution for strengthening and stiffening beams, without adding any appreciable weight to the structures.

40|$|In {{the design}} of new {{composite}} steel and concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>beams,</b> the shear connectors are assumed to transmit all of the longitudinal shear forces at the interface between the concrete slab and the steel beam. However, in practice, the forces on the shear connectors are modified by friction resistances at the interface. The effect of friction on the fatigue endurance of shear connectors is first illustrated through a specially developed finite-element analysis procedure. Then a simple mathematical assessment model is proposed that allows for the beneficial effect of friction on the fatigue endurance of shear connectors in composite steel and concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>beams.</b> This procedure can extend the design life of the shear connectors in existing composite <b>bridge</b> <b>beams,</b> {{as it can be}} used to estimate their remaining endurance and their remaining strength and, if necessary, to determine the effect of remedial work on increasing the endurance of the shear connectorsDeric J.

30|$|The cost of repairs of {{existing}} prestressed concrete I-beams {{has been reported}} to range from 35 to 69  % of the cost of a superstructure replacement and is expected to extend the service life of a structure, along with replacing the deck joint (Needham and Douglas 2000). <b>Bridge</b> <b>beam</b> ends are specifically prone to corrosion and premature deterioration, typically due to bridge deck joint leakage (Ahlborn et al. 2002). As such, one way to enhance the current condition of bridges is to provide coatings or treatments to the existing and newly constructed bridge beams ends. The objective of this work was to evaluate existing methodologies and materials that have been proven to extend the life of new and existing concrete and steel bridge beams. The first part of the paper discusses protection systems of concrete bridge element, while {{the second part of the}} paper focuses on steel beam end treatments.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{testing is}} a well-known method for damage identification of various concrete structures including bridges. This article presents a method to assess damage in reinforced concrete (RC) <b>bridge</b> <b>beams</b> subjected to incremental cyclic loading. The specifications in the standard NDIS- 2421 were used to classify the damage in RC <b>bridge</b> <b>beams.</b> Earlier researchers classified the damage occurring in <b>bridge</b> <b>beams</b> by using crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) and AE released and proposed a standard (NDIS- 2421 : the Japanese Society for NonDestructive Inspection). In general, multiple cracks take place in RC beams under bending; therefore, utilisation of CMOD for crack detection may not be appropriate. In the present study, the damage in RC beams is classified by using the AE released, deflection, strains in steel and concrete, because the measurement of the strains in steel and concrete is easy and the codes of practice are specified for different limit states (IS- 456 : 2000). The observations made in the present experimental study have some important practical applications in assessing the state of damage of concrete structural members...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} Cerema in France {{has set up}} {{an experimental}} project about a prestressed concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>beam</b> recovered during the demolition of a bridge. Before testing, an accurate diagnosis of the beam has been achieved. Three series of tests were carried out in 2014 : bending tests before reinforcement, after a first phase of reinforcement bonded composite materials, and finally after a second and final phase of reinforcement bonded composite materials. This final test was gradually led to a complete break of the beam. Traditional instrumentations were installed on the beam: 187 measuring points were monitored at a frequency of 10 Hz by twenty five PEGASE WiFi connected sensors. Innovative instrumentations were also used and compared with the traditional ones. This experience on a precast, prestressed concrete <b>bridge</b> <b>beam</b> reinforced with FRP allows us to deliver some first lessons. The real break of the beam was held to a force of about 61 tonnes, corresponding to a bending at mid-span to about 20 cm. Thereafter, the effort has been decreasing. The complete shearing by delamination of the bonded composite reinforcements (which have thus accompanied the beam to maximum effort of loading), was held to a force of about 59 tonnes, corresponding to a bending to about 27 cm. The complete break in bending in a controlled section (cracking up in the upper table) was obtained for an imposed displacement of more than 40 cm. </p...|$|E

Statistical analysis was carried out using the strength properties for determination of mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variations, confidence limits and Chi-Square goodness of fits. Structural analysis and design of a timber <b>bridge</b> <b>beam</b> using the determined data from the Nigerian Apa timber, in accordance with BS 5268 were carried out under the Ultimate Limit State of loading.

By {{contrast to a}} vehicle-bridge oscillation coupled model based on one-freedom-degree Mass-Spring-Mass vehicle model (OFDMSMVD), the {{mathematical model}} of vehicle-bridge coupled vibrations based on TFDVM can more accurately reflect the dynamic behaviors of vehicle-bridge coupled vibrations. The maximum middle-span deflections of bridges under speed-varied cases are not linearly proportional to the entrance speeds of moving loads, and they happen {{at a number of}} entrance speed points of moving loads.
