5|$|Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a CIA case {{officer in}} Iraq, {{tracking}} a terrorist called Al-Saleem (Alon Abutbul). He meets Nizar, {{a member of}} the terrorist organization who is prepared to offer information in return for asylum in North America. Despite his boss, Ed Hoffman's (Russell Crowe) objections, Ferris agrees to shelter Nizar. Nizar is used as a pawn to draw out the rest of his cell; when he is captured, Ferris is forced to shoot him to prevent him from exposing Ferris' identity. However, furious at Hoffman's refusal to act on the information Nizar provided, Ferris and his associate <b>Bassam</b> (Oscar Isaac) go to search a safe house in Balad, Iraq, of which Nizar had told them. There, Ferris observes men burning records and attempts to bluff his way in, but is exposed. In the ensuing shootout and chase, Ferris and Bassam's vehicle is hit by an RPG. Ferris and some salvaged discs are rescued by helicopter but <b>Bassam</b> is killed in the explosion.|$|E

40|$|Full text of {{this book}} is not {{available}} in the UHRAThe room is set up like a conference hall somewhere in the Arab world, or perhaps like the legislative assembly of a small modern state. There are desks with push-button microphones and headsets. Behind, there is a screen, as if someone planned to give a Powerpoint presentation. But {{the names on the}} desks are the familiar characters from "Hamlet". The setting of Sulayman Al <b>Bassam's</b> powerful, disturbing version of the "Hamlet" story is a modern Middle-Eastern state whose old king has just died, to be replaced by his brother, a ruthless, westernised dictator who has married the old king's wife to legitimise his rule, and calls his regime a "new democracy"...|$|R
5|$|In September 2005, an Israeli-declared AIDS expert {{claimed that}} Arafat bore all the {{symptoms}} of AIDS based on obtained medical records. But others, including Patrice Mangin of the University of Lausanne and The New York Times disagreed with this claim, insisting that Arafat's record indicated that it was highly unlikely {{that the cause of}} his death was AIDS. Arafat's personal doctor Ashraf al-Kurdi and aide <b>Bassam</b> Abu Sharif maintained that Arafat was poisoned, possibly by thallium. A senior Israeli physician concluded that Arafat died from food poisoning. Both those claims were rejected by Haaretz and The New York Times. Then-Palestinian foreign minister Nabil Shaath had also ruled out poisoning after talks with Arafat's French doctors.|$|E
5|$|Key issues include {{how much}} footage was shot; {{that it was}} blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that the {{cameraman}} stopped filming at that point. Despite the presence of camera crews from (at least) France 2, Associated Press and Reuters, there is no footage of the c.17minutes Jamal and Muhammad waited for an ambulance or of them being loaded into one. There is no film {{of the death of}} the first ambulance driver, <b>Bassam</b> al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up.|$|E

5000|$|Abbas was {{a celebrated}} man {{of letters and}} a {{prolific}} writer during his lifetime. He republished Ibn <b>Bassam's</b> 12th-century biographical dictionary of the Arabian Peninsula's intellectuals, editing it into eight [...] "mammoth" [...] volumes. Abbas' analysis of Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati's poetry and the significance of Bayati's references to Sisyphus and Prometheus was criticized as Shmuel Moreh; Abbas saw the references as being philosophical allegory, while Moreh tied them to {{the fall of the}} Iraqi Communist Party. Abbas contributed significantly to the history of Arabic literature and writers, and was responsible for collecting and compiling the work of Abd al-Hamid al-Katib in 1988, uncovering archived letters between the Umayyad secretary and the empire's last caliph which shed light on {{the inner workings of the}} dynasty in its last days. He was also one of the few writers to critically analyze the Kharijites, a now extinct sect of Islam. Though reserved in revealing his own beliefs, Abbas adhered to Sunni Islam and leaned toward the Zahiri school of Islamic jurisprudence. He was responsible for reviving the works of Ibn Hazm, one of the main philosophers of the school and of Islam in general, editing and republishing many of them and even uncovering previously unpublished works on Ibn Hazm's legal theory from various archives; Abbas' 1983 edition of Ibn Hazm's book on legal theory Ihkam is considered a key moment in Arab intellectual history and the modernist revival of Zahirite legal method.|$|R
50|$|Ibn Hamdis {{elected to}} leave again. After a perilous sea-journey, {{in which his}} boat was shipwrecked, causing his beloved slave-girl, Jawhara, to drown (to her he devoted some of his finest elegies), the poet settled once again in North Africa. He found new patrons at the Zirid court of Mahdiya, in modern-day Tunis. There he eulogized the Zirids Tamim ibn al-Mu'izz (1062-1108), Yahya ibn Tamim (1108-1131), Ali ibn Yahya (1115-1121) and the latter's son al-Hasan ibn Ali (1121-1152). He also praised the Hammadid al-Mansur ibn al-Nasir at Bijaya (modern-day Algeria) {{although}} his exact movements between the two courts are not clear. According to Hajji Khalifa's Kashf al-ẓunūn ʾan asāmī al-kutub wa-al-funūn, Ibn Hamdis died in 527 AH (1132/33 AD), aged seventy-seven, in Majorca (to the amir of the island he dedicated two panegyrics), although the many poems on old age penned by Ibn Hamdis suggest that the poet was over eighty years old. He may have been buried close to his old friend of the Seville brigade Ibn al-Labbana (d.1113), and to his compatriot, Abu al-Arab. The Sicilian scholar Ibn Zafar (d. ca. 1169) states that Ibn Hamdis compiled his dīwān by his own hand. Two manuscript copies of the dīwān are extant and were both used by ʾIḥsān ʿAbbās to establish his edition (Beirut 1960). The first copy is kept at the Vatican Library, Rome (447). The second is preserved in the Asiatic Museum in Saint Petersburg (294). Other scattered poems by Ibn Hamdis are found in Ibn <b>Bassam's</b> Dhakhīra fī Maḥāsin ʾAhl al-Jazīra. Some of these poems are taken directly from the dīwān, others are unique, while others still are variant readings which differ from the dīwān.|$|R

25|$|At the grassroots, women {{played an}} active role in the {{independence}} struggle across French West Africa. One dramatic example occurred in 1949, when protests by local women in Grand <b>Bassam</b> and Abidjan caused the administration to back down from the detention of RDA leaders, and help spread support for the party at a time in which it was facing severe repression.|$|E
25|$|The Syrian {{ambassador}} to Cyprus, Lamia al-Hariri, defected {{to the opposition}} bringing {{the total number of}} ambassadors to defect publicly to 3.

25|$|Assinie's {{survival}} was precarious, however; the French were not firmly established in Ivory Coast until the mid-19th century. In 1843–4, French admiral Bouët-Willaumez signed treaties with {{the kings of}} the Grand <b>Bassam</b> and Assinie regions, making their territories a French protectorate. French explorers, missionaries, trading companies, and soldiers gradually extended the area under French control inland from the lagoon region. Pacification was not accomplished until 1915.|$|E

25|$|<b>Bassam</b> al-Asker (age 17 at 1986 trial) {{was granted}} parole in 1991. He {{was thought to}} have died on February 21, 2004, but {{according}} to the Lebanese Daily Star, he had instead fled the country. He spent 14 years in Iraq, training Palestinian militiamen to fight the US army alongside Iraqi rebels, before travelling to the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in Lebanon, where he resided as of 2007.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{short time}} of the conquest of Toledo Sisnando fell into disfavour with Constance of Burgundy, Alfonso's second wife, and her French court, {{including}} Bernard de Sedirac, the archbishop elect of Toledo. Ibn <b>Bassam</b> records that Sisnando sought to convince Alfonso to spare the mosque of Toledo, though he did not. This, however, is false, as it was not King Alfonso, but Queen Constance and the new Archbishop Bernard who reconsecrated the mosque as a Christian church.|$|E
25|$|The first {{posts in}} Ivory Coast {{included}} one at Assinie and another at Grand <b>Bassam,</b> {{which became the}} colony's first capital. The treaties provided for French sovereignty within the posts, and for trading privileges in exchange for fees or coutumes paid annually to the local chiefs {{for the use of}} the land. The arrangement was not entirely satisfactory to the French, because trade was limited and misunderstandings over treaty obligations often arose. Nevertheless, the French government maintained the treaties, hoping to expand trade.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 and the {{subsequent}} annexation by Germany of the French province of Alsace-Lorraine caused the French government to abandon its colonial ambitions and withdraw its military garrisons from its French West African trading posts, leaving them {{in the care of}} resident merchants. The trading post at Grand <b>Bassam</b> in Ivory Coast was left in the care of a shipper from Marseille, Arthur Verdier, who in 1878 was named Resident of the Establishment of Ivory Coast.|$|E
25|$|H. Patrick Glenn {{states that}} sharia is {{structured}} around {{the concept of}} mutual obligations of a collective, and it considers individual human rights as potentially disruptive and unnecessary to its revealed code of mutual obligations. In giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty, the Islamic law justifies the formal inequality of individuals (women, non-Islamic people). <b>Bassam</b> Tibi states that sharia framework and human rights are incompatible. Abdel al-Hakeem Carney, in contrast, states that sharia is misunderstood from a failure to distinguish sharia from siyasah (politics).|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} hours of 4 July 2006, during a joint {{operation}} conducted by the IDF and the Israel Security Authorities, the three Tanzim militants whom murdered Eliyahu Asheri and whom were hiding in the a Palestinian Police headquarters building in Ramallah, were apprehended after a three-hour standoff. The three men were <b>Bassam</b> Shafik Atiya Ahtiya, Khamze Salah Taktuk, and I'iam Fuab Naaef Kamamju. All three were reported {{to be members of}} the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and had been serving in the security forces of the Palestinian Authority.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, sheikh Abi Saab, MOREP president, {{arranged}} {{an international}} action {{to remove the}} war residues including antipersonnel mines {{in the north of}} Lebanon. Lady Diana, Princess of Wales was working on such humanitarian activity by supporting the International Campaign to Ban Landmines. In the program was her invitation to Lebanon to promote the removal of these persistent antipersonnel landmines. She died prior to that on August 31, 1997. MOREP then launched a local campaign in 2002 to remove these antipersonnel landmines by the authorities during that period, acting with both supporting Lawyers Abdallah Zakhia and <b>Bassam</b> Sleiman.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the Israeli's caught two PLF {{cells that}} Abbas had {{recruited}} and trained {{after they had}} murdered an Israeli teenager. <b>Bassam</b> al-Ashker, {{one of the four}} Achille Lauro hijackers, had risen to be Abbas' top deputy in the PLF and was in charge of one of the cell's training, planning, and logistics. Cell members were arrested in the areas of Ramall and Jenin. One of them confessed that the PLF had trained them to use automatic weapons, rocket-propelled grenades, and bomb building at the Al-Quds military camp outside Baghdad. By the time the Israelis had captured the cell they had kidnapped and murdered Israeli teenager Yuri Gushchin, set off a bomb at an Israeli checkpoint (injuring five), planted failed bombs, and shot at Israeli vehicles. The cell was prevented from a planned mass killing at Ben Gurion airport and attacking targets within Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The group was also charged with smuggling weapons in the diplomatically protected car of Palestinian Authority official Abdel-Razak al-Yehiyeh.|$|E
500|$|Some {{time after}} the attack, Carlos's accomplices {{revealed}} that the operation was commanded by Wadie Haddad, {{a founder of the}} Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. They also claimed that the idea and funding came from an Arab president, widely thought to be Muammar al-Gaddafi of Libya, itself an OPEC member. Fellow militants <b>Bassam</b> Abu Sharif and Klein claimed that Carlos received and kept a ransom between US$20million and US$50million from [...] "an Arab president". Carlos claimed that Saudi Arabia paid ransom on behalf of Iran, but that the money was [...] "diverted en route and lost by the Revolution". He was finally captured in 1994 and is serving life sentences for at least 16 other murders.|$|E
500|$|The raw footage stops {{suddenly}} at {{this point}} and begins again with unidentified people being loaded into an ambulance. (At that point in his report, Enderlin said: [...] "A Palestinian policeman and an ambulance driver have also lost their lives {{in the course of this}} battle.") <b>Bassam</b> al-Bilbeisi, an ambulance driver on his way to the scene, was reported to have been shot and killed, leaving a widow and 11 children. Abu Rahma said Muhammad lay bleeding for at least 17minutes before an ambulance picked up father and son together. He said he did not film them being picked up because he was worried about having only one battery. Abu Rahma remained at the junction for 30–40 minutes until he felt it was safe to leave, then drove to his studio in Gaza City to send the footage to Enderlin. The 59seconds of footage were first broadcast on France2's nightly news at 8:00pm local time (GMT+2), after which France2 distributed several minutes of raw footage around the world without charge.|$|E
