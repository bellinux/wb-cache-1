40|$|Torque tension {{testing of}} a newly {{designed}} Reusable Solid Rocket Motor nozzle <b>bolted</b> <b>assembly</b> was successfully completed. Test {{results showed that the}} 3 -sigma preload variation was as expected at the required input torque level and the preload relaxation were within the engineering limits. A shim installation technique was demonstrated as a simple process to fill a shear lip gap between nozzle housings in the joint region. A new automated torque system was successfully demonstrated in this test. This torque control tool was found to be very precise and accurate. The <b>bolted</b> <b>assembly</b> performance was further evaluated using the Nozzle Structural Test Bed. Both current socket head cap screw and proposed multiphase alloy bolt configurations were tested. Results indicated that joint skip and bolt bending were significantly reduced with the new multiphase alloy bolt design. This paper summarizes all the test results completed to date...|$|E

30|$|Another issue {{concerns}} the modeling {{of the bolt}} itself. In practice, some of {{the parameters of the}} <b>bolted</b> <b>assembly</b> are not precisely determined, as the preload of the nut or the friction coefficient. Such types of problems have been analyzed by dedicated techniques for the bolt computation [37, 38], including multiresolution [39]. The use of the proposed non-intrusive techniques allows to extend these studies to the case of 2 D– 3 D structural analyses in a straightforward manner. In addition, the use of model reduction techniques for the global model itself, as proposed in [40] should lead to a very significant reduction of the computational time.|$|E

50|$|The roller-locked <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> {{consists}} of a bolt head, two rollers, a striker sleeve, bolt body, and a large return spring, {{which is responsible for}} pushing the <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> into battery (the locked position) and returning it there when it is unlocked and pushed backwards by the recoil of firing or by the charging handle. As the striker sleeve is movable back and forth within the <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly,</b> the return spring is also responsible for pushing the striker sleeve forward during locking (described below). The <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> locks with the barrel's breech (the end the cartridge is loaded into) via a prong type barrel extension behind the breech. As it is recoil-operated and fired from an open bolt, the weapon must be manually charged with the side-mounted charging handle.|$|R

40|$|International audienceFinite {{elements}} {{have been}} used recently to solve the optical flow conservation principle invoked to determine displacement fields by digital image correlation. Inspired by these recent advances, and by the computational effort that has been accomplished during the past 10 years for the simulation of discontinuities by the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM), an extended correlation technique is introduced for capturing shear-band like discontinuities from images of real mechanical tests. Because of the specific information at hand (i. e., gray level images), this extended finite element approach is included in a non-linear multi-grid solver. The performances of the proposed approach are discussed on two examples, namely the analysis of a <b>bolted</b> <b>assembly</b> {{and the formation of}} Piobert-Lüders bands...|$|E

The influence of tightening torque and clearance {{will be considered}} {{for the analysis of}} the global mechanical behaviour of the link. An experimental approach was carried out in order to analyze the sequence of damage mechanisms using acoustic emission (A. E.) and measurement of fields by digital image correlation (D. I. C.) techniques simultaneously. The A. E. technique allows the monitoring of the evolution of acoustic activities by taking into account the number of counts, duration, maximum amplitude and energy of the events. The treatment of these four parameters by planar localization allows precise determination of the fracture. The D. I.

40|$|Abstract. According to the {{existence}} problems of study on the mechanism of contact stiffness of <b>bolted</b> <b>assembly</b> structure formed by tightening sequence, a TK model of single bolt structure is established; then the frequency characteristics of combined surface under different TS was analyzed by using ANSYS; the optimal TS is obtained based on the frequency and the interface stiffness mapping. At last, a group of experiments was done to verify the above conclusions. The {{results show that the}} interface stiffness is verify under different TS, and so does the first rank natural frequency of the structure; the nonlinear response of the structure is significantly affected by TS that tighten at the same time is the optimal method compared with other TS. A small error of modal frequency between simulating and testing proves that the modeling method can effectively analyze impacts of the TS on the dynamic properties of the interface...|$|E

40|$|The {{galvanic}} corrosion of a bolt joint combining carbon steel end plate and {{low alloy steel}} bolt was investigated electrochemically in a 1 [*]M HCl solution. The corrosion parameters of the joint components were used for numerical simulation using Comsol Multiphysics software to analyze the {{galvanic corrosion}} behavior at the contact zone between the head bolt and the end plate. In this research work we evaluate the variation of the corrosion rate in the steel end plate considered as the anode, {{in order to determine}} the lifetime of the <b>bolted</b> <b>assembly</b> used in steel structures. Three materials (20 MnCr 5, 42 CrMo 4, and 32 CrMoV 13) and three bolts (M 12, M 16, and M 20) were tested in two thicknesses of electrolyte 1 [*]M HCl (e = 1 [*]mm, e = 20 [*]mm). It is found that the corrosion rate of the anode part (end plate) is higher for 32 CrMoV 13 materials and it increases if both diameter of the bolt and thickness of the electrolyte increase (Cr(M 20) > Cr(M 16) > Cr(M 12) and Cr(e = 20 [*]mm) > Cr(e = 1 [*]mm)). This corrosion rate is higher in the contact area between the bolt head and the end plate, and it decreases if we move away from this contact area...|$|E

40|$|In {{structural}} fire engineering, {{the importance of}} <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> is often overlooked. Connection design uses the temperature-dependent bolt strength-reduction factors prescribed in Eurocode 3, despite the existence of two distinct failure modes under tension; necking of the bolt shank, and thread-stripping. While literature exists to predict failure modes at ambient temperature, there is no method for failure mode prediction for elevated temperatures where ductility is critical to avoid collapse. Galvanised M 20 structural <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> and <b>bolt</b> material from a single batch have been tested under tension at a range of temperatures and strain-rates typical of those experienced in fire. Turned-down bolt test data produced stress-strain curves characteristic of different microstructures at ambient temperature, despite a tempered-martensitic microstructure being specified in the standards. The failure modes of <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{were found to be}} dependent on the as-received microstructure at ambient temperature. At elevated temperatures, however, only thread-stripping was observed...|$|R

40|$|In {{structural}} fire engineering, {{the importance of}} <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> is often overlooked. Connection design uses the temperature-dependent bolt strength-reduction factors prescribed in Eurocode 3, despite the existence of two distinct failure modes under tension; bolt breakage, and thread-stripping. This thesis investigates the factors which influence failure modes at ambient and elevated temperatures {{and a range of}} strain-rates through microstructural characterisation, tensile testing and finite element modelling. Microstructural characterisation carried out on M 20 galvanised <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> consisting of Grade 8. 8 bolts and Property Class 10 nuts from a range of manufacturers has highlighted that, despite a specified tempered-martensite microstructure, microstructural variations existed between different manufacturers and within a single batch. These microstructural variations not only affected the flow behaviour of the bolt material but determined the failure modes of <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> at ambient temperatures. Tensile testing of turned-down bolts allowed the temperature and strain-rate dependent flow behaviour of bolt material to be investigated, eliminating the effect of thread deformation. The flow curves obtained were input to a finite element model to represent true bolt material behaviour, which was validated against force-displacement curves obtained from uniaxial tensile testing of <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies</b> from the same batch. Both experimental and finite element modelling work have highlighted the importance of using a tight thread tolerance class combination and a suitably tall nut to ensure ductile bolt breakage failures and avoid thread-stripping. ...|$|R

40|$|High {{strength}} preloadable bolts are {{key components}} influencing strength, stiffness and ductility of beam-to-column joints. In Europe the HV and HR systems are themost commonly used types of pre-loadable <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies.</b> EN 1993 - 1 - 8 provides design rules for bolted connections, without distinguishing {{the type of}} high strength preloadable bolt system. However, HV and HR are characterized by both different force-displacement responses and failure modes, which may significantly influence the performance of bolted joints under monotonic and cyclic actions, especially for seismic applications. The rational selection of the most suitable bolt type per specific structural demand may avoid premature reduction of joint strength for higher levels of joint rotation, or provide further rotational capacity. In order to investigate these features, experimental monotonic and both variable and constant amplitude cyclic inelastic tests were carried out on both HV and HR <b>bolt</b> <b>assemblies,</b> varying the shank diameters. The monotonic tests enabled to identify the failure modes and the relevant force-displacement monotonic response and ductility per type of <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly.</b> The variable amplitude cyclic tests allowed quantifying the strength degradation induced by cyclic actions, while the constant amplitude low-cycle fatigue tests enabled to investigate the fatigue capacity at different threshold of plastic strain and to determine the strain-number of cycles (i. e. ε-N) curves. The influence {{of the type of}} <b>bolt</b> <b>assembly</b> on the response of T-stub connections is also discussed on the basis of analytical models...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOne of the {{principal}} failures of <b>bolting</b> <b>assemblies</b> is the fretting. The combination of vibration and service load can introduce the damage of fretting fatigue on the contact surfaces of the assembly which lead at a nucleation of crack and then the structure fracture. Contact pressure or clamping force and displacement at the interface or relative slip are two important factors which control the fretting wear and the fretting fatigue. This paper describes the effect of clamping force (tightening torque) on the fretting fatigue behaviour of <b>bolted</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Both fretting fatigue experiments and simulation with FEM were carried out. With the increase of contact force, the sites of cracks initiation changed {{from the edge of}} the central hole to the free edge of the contact zone and the fretting fatigue life increase dramatically.
