50|$|This {{species is}} a common bycatch {{associated}} to many demersal fisheries, including the black spot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo). It is caught by artisanal longline and gillnet fisheries near the Strait of Gibraltar and along the Portuguese continental coast and the Azores.In the western Mediterranean, <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> are mostly caught as bycatch in bottom trawl fisheries targeted at deep-sea crustaceans. However, {{in areas such as}} the Catalan coast, the <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> is the most commercially viable scorpionfish species, with important economic value.|$|E

50|$|As {{with other}} species of scorpionfish, the spines of the <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> contain toxic venom and have {{reportedly}} caused injuries to humans. However, {{there has been little}} research on the venom produced by this species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish,</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus, is {{a marine}} bony {{fish from the}} family Sebastidae, also known as bluemouth rockfish, and bluemouth seaperch. This Atlantic species is a typical sit-and-wait {{predator}} with a highly cryptic coloration.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> is {{the most}} {{commercial}} scorpionfish species in the Mediterranean. Although {{there has been little}} commercial interest in this species, partially due to its low level of accessibility, it is currently growing as new resources need to be found by fishing fleets due to the depletion of traditional resources.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> is a bathydemersal scorpionfish, {{found in}} soft bottom {{areas of the}} {{continental}} shelf and upper slope.

50|$|<b>Blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> have intraovarian gestation. Fertilization is internal, as free {{spermatozoa}} {{were found}} primarily in resting ovaries from July through early December with peak occurrence in September through November in the Western Atlantic. There was a delay of 1-3 months before fertilization, as oocyte development {{did not begin}} until December. Occurrence during January through April of early-celled embryos, the most advanced stage observed, and postovulatory follicles indicated that oocyte development was rapid. Has females can store sperm within their ovaries {{that allows them to}} spawn multiple batches of embryos enclosed within a gelatinous matrix secreted into the ovarian cavity. This species has a zygoparous form of oviparity, which occupies an intermediate position between oviparity and viviparity. Larvae and juveniles are pelagic.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> is {{a robust}} fish {{with a large}} head with the spination {{described}} for the genus and without tabs or tentacles. The profile of the nape is relatively steeply inclined. It has villiform teeth on both jaws and its large mouth is dark colored inside. The dorsal fin has 11 to 13 spines (usually 12) and 10 to 14 rays (usually 11-13), the anal fin has 3 spines and 5 rays; and the pectoral fin has between 17 and 20 rays. They have 55 to 80 vertical rows of ctenoid scales and their lateral line has tubular scales; The chest, cheek and maxilla are usually scaled but the snout and ventral part of the head are naked. They usually have 25 vertebrae. Gill rakers are well developed: 7 to 9 on the upper arch, 16 to 21 on the lower arch. Their colour is variable, back and sides are red and the belly is pink, with 5 to 6 dark bands below anterior, middle and posterior dorsal spines: below the soft dorsal rays and {{at the base of}} the caudal fin; Y-shaped dark bar between soft dorsal and anal fin; usually a dark blotch on the posterior part of the spinous dorsal fin.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gain {{preliminary}} knowledge about the threat to marine ecosystems due to leakage of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and other pollutants from rusting bombshells on the seabed, a case {{study was conducted in}} a dumping area in the southern Adriatic Sea (depth 200 – 300 m). Following electroacoustic and magnetometric surveys of the CWA dumping area, an integrated ecotoxicological approach was used. This approach was based on analysis of CWA residues and their metabolites, including arsenic, in sediment and organisms, as well as multimarker methodology including the Health Assessment Index, histological lesion analysis and enzyme assays. Two sentinel species were selected, the <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> [Helicolenus dactylopterus (Delaroche, 1809) ] and the European conger (Conger conger L., 1758). Sediment analysis revealed the presence of CWA degradation products, including 1 - 4 -thioxane and 1 - 4 -dithiane. Tissues of fish from the CWA dumping site showed higher levels of arsenic than those from the reference site. Neither CWAs nor their metabolites were detected in fish tissues. Arsenic levels recorded in <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> were well above those reported for other fish species from the southern Adriatic, much higher than the FDA limit for food (2. 6 mg kg 1) and close to the LD 50 calculated for mammals (20 mg kg 1 body weight). The presence of pollutants in the CWA dumping site was also confirmed by pathological lesions in both species and EROD activity, two to three times higher than in fish from the reference site (16. 45 ± 8. 08 and 8. 05 ± 5. 87 pmol min 1 mg protein 1 in <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> and 269 ± 24. 92 and 78. 71 pmol min 1 mg protein 1 in European conger, respectively). Cholinesterase activity seemed unaffected in muscle of both species, whereas in brain they were one-third of those recorded in fish from the reference site (14. 22 ± 10. 05 and 72. 87 nmol min 1 mg protein 1, respectively). This suggests that acetylcholinesterase is sensitive to CWAs. In conclusion, the agreement of all the chemical and biological parameters investigated suggests that the integrated ecotoxicological approach used is appropriate to reveal the presence and biological effects of CWAs in the marine ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the environmental threat to benthic species from chemical weapons dumped in the southern Adriatic Sea. An ecotoxicological approach using chemical analysis and biological responses was applied, in two sentinel species: the <b>Blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus and European conger Conger conger. Specimen were collected in a stretch of sea, where had been dumped war materials and from a reference site free of ordnance. Residues of yperite, Hg and As were measured in fish fillets. Skin, liver, kidney and spleen were examined for histopathological and macroscopical lesions. Liver detoxifying capacities (EROD and UDPGT) and genotoxicity (comet assay) were also investigated. As and Hg levels were three-four times higher than those from the reference site in both species (pb 0. 001). Both species captured in dumping site showed clear signs of chronic illness according to the health assessment index (HAI). Deep ulcers and nodules were observed on skin and external organs. Histological lesions such as periportal and bile duct fibrosis, pericholangitis, steatosis, granuloma and elevated splenic MMCs were detected in liver and spleen. Significantly higher EROD activities were also found in both species from dumping site (pb 0. 01). Comet assay revealed genotoxicty in gills of C. conger from dumping site, indicating uptake of chemical warfare agents through fish gills. European conger was found to be a more sensitive bioindicator of this type of contamination than the <b>Blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mercury (Hg) is {{a global}} threat for marine ecosystems, {{especially}} within the Mediterranean Sea. The concern is higher for deep-sea organisms, as the Hg concentration in their tissues is commonly high. To assess the influence of food supply at two trophic levels, total Hg concentrations and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios were determined in 7 species (4 teleosts, 2 sharks, and 1 crustacean) sampled on {{the upper part of}} the continental slope of the Gulf of Lions (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea), at depths between 284 and 816 m. Mean Hg concentrations ranged from 1. 30 ± 0. 61 to 7. 13 ± 7. 09 μg g− 1 dry mass, with maximum values observed for small-spotted catshark Scyliorhinus canicula. For all species except blue whiting Micromesistius poutassou, Hg concentrations were above the health safety limits for human consumption defined by the European Commission, with a variable proportion of the individuals exceeding limits (from 23 % for the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus to 82 % for the <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus). Measured concentrations increased with increasing trophic levels. Carbon isotopic ratios measured for these organisms demonstrated that settling phytoplanktonic organic matter is not only the main source fueling trophic webs but also the carrier of Hg to this habitat. Inter- and intraspecific variations of Hg concentrations revealed the importance of feeding patterns in Hg bioaccumulation. In addition, biological parameters, such as growth rate or bathymetric range explain the observed contamination trends...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{shows the}} {{multidisciplinary}} approach {{used to assess}} the eco- toxicity of chemical munitions lying on the seabed in the Southern Adriatic Sea where aerial bombs charged with mustard agent and organoarsenic chemical warfare agents (CWAs) have been dumped. Sampling activities and laboratory analyses have been carried out on two sentinel species, the <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish,</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus, and the European conger, Conger conger, collected in a CWA dumping site 35 nm from the coast of Apulia, Italy, and from a reference site. Fish were analyzed through an ecotoxicological approach, integrating chemical analysis and biological responses. Degradation products of the blister agents bis-(2 -chloroethyl) sulphide, commonly known as mustard agent or yperite (also called sulfur or sulfur mustard) were found in sediment samples collected nearby aerial bombs. Although no evidence of these compounds was detected in tissues of either fish, levels of heavy metals (arsenic and mercury), potentially released by rusted chemical weapons, were significantly higher in sediment and fish from the CWA site compared to the reference site. Severe external and internal lesions were observed in fish captured in the CWA site, with congers displaying small to large skin ulcers along the body. Health assessment index (HAI) values, as well as spleen melano-macrophages centres and CYP 1 A ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity were higher in fish from the CWA site, indicating a chronic state of illness and environment degradation. The working procedures and analyses performed during these surveys could be suitable for future biomonitoring studies in other CWA dumping sites...|$|E

Species {{distribution}} modelling of {{the marine}} environment has been extensively used to assess species–environment relationships to predict fish spatial distributions accurately. In this study we explored the application of two distinct modelling techniques, maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) and generalized linear models (GLMs) for predicting the potential distribution in the Azores economic exclusive zone (EEZ) of four economically important demersal fish species: <b>blackbelly</b> <b>rosefish,</b> Helicolenus dactylopterus dactylopterus, forkbeard, Phycis phycis, wreckfish, Polyprion americanus and offshore rockfish, Pontinus kuhlii. Models were constructed based on 13 years of fish presence/absence data derived from bottom longline surveys performed {{in the study area}} combined with high resolution (300 m) topographic and biogeochemical habitat seafloor variables. The most important predictors were depth and slope followed by sediment type, oxygen saturation and salinity, with relative contributions being similar among species. GLMs provided ‘outstanding’ model predictions (AUC> 0. 9) for two of the four fish species while MaxEnt provided ‘excellent’ model predictions (AUC= 0. 8 – 0. 9) for three of four species. The level of agreement between observed and predicted presence/absence sites for both modelling techniques was ‘moderate’ (K= 0. 4 – 0. 6) for three of the four species with P. americanus models presenting the lowest level of agreement (K< 0. 1). For the scope of this study, both modelling approaches presented here were determined to produce viable presence/absence maps which represent a snap–shot of the potential distributions of the investigated species. This information provides a better description of demersal fish spatial ecology and can be of a great deal of interest for future fisheries management and conservation planning...|$|E
