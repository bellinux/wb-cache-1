50|$|The {{experimental}} AA20 4-14-4 locomotive was {{the only}} one ever to have seven coupled driving axles. It used lateral motion devices (on the first and seventh axles) as well as <b>blind</b> <b>drivers</b> (on the third, fourth and fifth axles) but these measures were not enough to allow it to negotiate curves without damaging the track, derailing, or both.|$|R

50|$|Synoeketetic Staphylinids live {{in close}} contact with their host ants but are not {{integrated}} into the colony. These species may be further categorized as neutral, mimetic, loricate, and symphiloid synoeketes. Neutral synoeketes ignore and are ignored by their host, but feed on refuse. There are few Staphylinid neutral synoeketes, but some are found in the genus Athetini, which live in the debris and fungal chambers of leaf cutter ants (Atta). Mimetic synoeketes are myrmecoid, resembling their host ant morphologically. Many mimetic species are guests of Driver ants, which are <b>blind.</b> <b>Driver</b> ants however have strong senses of touch, suggesting mimics fool their hosts tactilely. It is also possible that mimicry may reduce predation from more visual animals, such as birds. Loricate, or “tear-drop shaped”, synoeketes are “defensive forms”. They typically exhibit long tapering bodies with broad thoraxes and smooth bodies, which prevent aggressing ants from gripping them. Symphiloids strongly resemble “true guests,” but are not fully integrated into the colony. They are often mimics, and in some species have developed trichomes. Syneoketes generally live on or inside of ant nests, where they feed on refuse and may steal food from their hosts. There is some overlap between synoeketes and other categories, especially in loricate species and synecthrans, and symphiloids and symphiles, where the behavior of “true guests” may be difficult to determine.|$|E

50|$|The 2-10-0's main {{advantage}} {{was that}} {{five out of}} six of its axles were powered, meaning almost all the weight was available for traction rather than being distributed over pilot and trailing wheels. The long rigid wheelbase caused problems on tightly curved track, so <b>blind</b> <b>drivers</b> were the norm, either on the central axle, and/or on the second and/or fourth axles. Often lateral motion devices were attached to the leading drive axle.|$|R
2500|$|According to Mario Motta, {{president}} of the Massachusetts Medical Society, [...] "... glare from bad lighting is a public-health hazard—especially the older you become. Glare light scattering in the eye causes loss of contrast and leads to unsafe driving conditions, much like the glare on a dirty windshield from low-angle sunlight or the high beams from an oncoming car." [...] In essence bright and/or badly shielded lights around roads can partially <b>blind</b> <b>drivers</b> or pedestrians and contribute to accidents.|$|R
40|$|This senior project aims {{to provide}} blind persons {{with the ability}} to {{effectively}} experience driving. This report includes the project background, literature review, designs, methodologies, results, and conclusions with project management, human factors engineering, and electronic manufacturing focuses. Other universities and professionals have accepted the <b>Blind</b> <b>Driver</b> Challenge presented by the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) or studied systems to improve vehicle feedback. The Virginia Tech vehicle, named 2 ̆ 2 Odin 2 ̆ 2, includes tactile and audio interfaces in order to relay information to a <b>blind</b> <b>driver</b> about vehicle heading and speed. The QFD results reveal that the amount of available information from the feedback systems ranks {{the most important aspect of}} this project 2 ̆ 7 s designs. The QFD slso shows the importance of both speed and acceleration. The final feedback designs of the vibrating vest, steering wheel, and audio provide commands, statuses, and speed updates. The programs packaged with the SICK LIDAR sensor as well as LabVIEW will serve to accomplish the necessary programming. This project contains two expensive items that push its total cost fairly high, the dune buggy and the laser scanner. Considering the over 1000 feet of electrical wire, electrical safety signifies a very large safety concern. Innovative sensor and tactile feedback technology provide the backbone for this advancement for the visually impaired...|$|E

50|$|Driving {{wheels are}} {{generally}} larger than leading or trailing wheels. Since a conventional steam locomotive is directly driven, {{one of the}} few ways to 'gear' a locomotive for a particular performance goal is to size the driving wheels appropriately. Freight locomotives generally had driving wheels between 40 and 60 in in diameter; dual-purpose locomotives generally between 60 and 70 in, and passenger locomotives between 70 and 100 in or so. Some long wheelbase locomotives (four or more coupled axles) were equipped with <b>blind</b> <b>drivers.</b> These were driving wheels without the usual flanges, which allowed them to negotiate tighter curves without binding.|$|R

30|$|Color vision defects seen in 4.5 % of {{the drivers}} in our study is lower than other Nigerian studies carried out in Enugu (Effiong 1993) (8.1 %), Lagos (Erikitola 1998) (6.9 %) but higher than an Ibadan (Nwosu 1989), Nigerian study (3.3 %). Color defects was {{not found to be}} {{statistically}} significantly associated with RTA (P = 0.4) in our study. A study by (Cashell 1986) also found no significant correlation between color vision defect and RTA as the color <b>blind</b> <b>drivers</b> had learnt to adjust by memorizing the colors of traffic lights by their position. Color defects can be acquired following chronic tobacco use (Kanski 2003).|$|R
50|$|Although {{the use of}} {{flashing}} headlights does {{increase the}} visibility of any vehicle, it can also create problems. In situations when highbeam headlights are flashed, the wig-wag may create glare or may otherwise temporarily <b>blind</b> the <b>drivers</b> of oncoming vehicles.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{explanation for}} the cause of the crash has been reports of a bright white flash just before the car entered the tunnel, <b>blinding</b> the <b>driver.</b> Richard Tomlinson made this allegation at the inquiry, but the veracity of his evidence was found wanting.|$|R

The bus driver then attempted to avoid hitting the car, but ending up hitting a parked car in the process.|$|R
50|$|Stone damage can be {{dangerous}} in many ways. Stone damage can cause small cracks in the windshield that can refract or reflect normally unharmful light such that it can distract or <b>blind</b> the <b>driver.</b> Stone damage can also cause large cracks in the windshield - this usually happens during the winter period {{because of the large}} temperature differences, but can also happen if the vehicle is exposed to vibrations or bumps.|$|R
2500|$|Because wrong-side-of-road {{headlamps}} <b>blind</b> oncoming <b>drivers</b> and do {{not adequately}} light the driver's way, and blackout strips and adhesive prismatic lenses reduce the safety performance of the headlamps, some countries require all vehicles registered or used on a permanent or semi-permanent basis within the country to be equipped with headlamps designed for the correct traffic-handedness. [...] North American vehicle owners sometimes privately import and install Japanese-market (JDM) headlamps on their car in the mistaken belief that the beam performance will be better, when in fact such misapplication is quite hazardous and illegal.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid <b>blinding</b> the {{oncoming}} <b>drivers,</b> all Swedish vehicles had to have their original left-hand-traffic headlamps replaced with right-hand units. One {{of the reasons the}} Riksdag pushed ahead with Dagen H despite public unpopularity was that most vehicles in Sweden at the time used inexpensive, standardized round headlamps, but the trend towards more expensive model-specific headlamps had begun in Continental Europe and was expected to spread through most other parts of the world. Further delay in changing over from left- to right-hand traffic would have greatly increased the cost burden to vehicle owners.|$|R

40|$|Failure {{to perform}} {{appropriate}} visual checks at intersections {{may have contributed}} to the 2069 cyclist fatalities in the European Union in 2015. This study investigates whether and when car drivers perform visual checks for potentially encroaching cyclists during right-turn maneuvers at urban intersections. UDrive naturalistic data from instrumented vehicles in France, the Netherlands, Poland, and Great Britain were used. The dataset consisted of 852 right-turn maneuvers (UK: left-turn, throughout this document) across 56 drivers. In the six seconds prior to the maneuver, <b>drivers</b> checked their <b>blind</b> spot in 4 % of the cases. This frequency increased to 8 % when the maneuver was included. The prevalence of cyclist facilities was highest in the Netherlands, which is also the country where blind spot checks were performed most often. When not checking the <b>blind</b> spot, <b>drivers</b> mostly looked toward the road they were turning into. Country predicted neither the timing of sideway glances, nor whether there was any (right) sideways glance. Our findings may inform driver training to increase awareness of cyclists at urban intersections, as well as the design of other traffic safety measures...|$|R
50|$|Turn 1 is {{the main}} {{overtaking}} point at Catalunya, {{as it is a}} braking zone {{at the end of a}} long DRS straight. The inside and outside are equally difficult for overtaking; drivers who can hold the line around the outside of turn one, can get the inside line for turn two. The corners themselves make up a medium-speed chicane - drivers brake rather late for turn one (Elf) and shift down to gear two, and turn two is almost full throttle as they try to gain as much exit speed as possible. Turn 3 (Renault) is a long, flat-out (in most cars) right-hander that has a g-force of about four, and it leads to a short straight before turn 4, the Repsol curve. Another right-hander, turn four is similar to Monza's Curva Parabolica - drivers brake and take an early apex (in third gear), carrying lots of speed out of the exit. Turn 5 (Seat) comes immediately after and is a slow left-hander taken in second gear which drops rapidly downhill towards the left kink of turn 6 which is ignored by F1 cars. Turns 7 and 8 make up a medium-speed, uphill, left-right chicane. Drivers brake and shift down to gear three, and must not run too wide as turn eight has a large kerb on its apex which could potentially damage cars' suspensions. Turn 9, Campsa Corner, is a very fast, sixth-gear right-hander which is made incredibly difficult by being completely <b>blind</b> (<b>drivers</b> cannot see the apex on approach). It is initially quite steep uphill but the exit is then downhill, so it is quite easy to run wide onto the astroturf. The long back straight leads into turn 10 (La Caixa), a second-gear, left-hand hairpin, then turns 11 and 12, a left kink before a long, slow, third-gear right. The next section has been redesigned by German engineer Hermann Tilke to lower speeds onto the 1,047-metre pit straight - which in turn increases overtaking opportunities and safety. Turn 13 is a tight, third-gear right-hander and drivers have to cross the track quickly to take the racing line through the slow left-right chicane of turns 14 and 15, taken in second gear. Good traction is needed here as it determines speed down the pit straight. Turn 16 (New Holland) is a flat-out right-hander which takes cars across the start/finish line.|$|R
