40|$|Secondary {{data from}} a {{randomized}} sample of Brazilian preschool children were analyzed to evaluate the prevalence of occlusal deviations in the deciduous dentition that can adversely affect the permanent dentition, using revised criteria. Overjet and overbite used cut-off points described in the literature to exclude mild malocclusion cases. Overjet > 3 mm and overbite > 3 mm were present in 16 % and 7 % of the children, respectively. On the sagittal plane, only <b>bilateral</b> <b>deviations</b> were considered: molar relationship in distal step (9. 7 %) and mesial step (6 %) and canine relationship class 2 (11 %) and class 3 (2. 9 %). Regarding other occlusal deviations, severity criteria were not reported in the literature. Crude prevalence rates of openbite (27. 9 %), posterior crossbite (11. 3 %), and crowding in the maxillary arch (7 %) and mandibular arch (11. 3 %) were recorded. The assessment of malocclusion in the deciduous dentition {{should focus on the}} severity of occlusal deviations for the identification of cases and non-cases that are relevant to public health. Need for further consensus and improvement in the interpretation of epidemiological data on malocclusion related to this developmental stage is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a setting where every pair of players can interact (e. g. exchange goods) and this interaction yields a fixed surplus. An interaction {{can take place}} only if the players involved have a connection. This connection may be direct, {{in which case the}} two players split the surplus equally. But the interaction could also be indirect (i. e. involving more than two players in the path), and then every player essential to the connection is assumed to get an equal share of the surplus. In the model, the incentives to forming links derive from the possibilities they avail in three respects: (1) the creation of new interaction opportunities; (2) the rents that can be attained from essential intermediation; (3) the payment of rents that can be avoided by circumventing intermediaries. We focus on an equilibrium notion in which pairs of players may jointly coordinate on the (possibly simultaneous) creation and destruction of the links they control. Our main conclusion is that, so long as costs of forming links are not very small, all (non-empty and strict) equilibrium networks are stars. In such networks, a single agent is essential for all bilateral interaction and there is significant inequality in payoff distribution. We end the paper by showing that the main gist of the analysis is essentially maintained if commitment is ruled out and <b>bilateral</b> <b>deviations</b> are required to be internally consistent...|$|R
50|$|As {{a form of}} {{biological}} asymmetry, fluctuating asymmetry (FA), along with anti-symmetry and direction asymmetry, refers to small, random deviations away from perfect <b>bilateral</b> symmetry. This <b>deviation</b> from perfection is thought to reflect the genetic and environmental pressures experienced throughout development, with greater pressures resulting in higher levels of asymmetry. Examples of FA {{in the human body}} include unequal sizes (asymmetry) of bilateral features in the face and body, such as left and right eyes, ears, wrists, breasts, testicles, and thighs.|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} role of foreign aid in {{reducing}} the hypothetically negative impact of terrorism on trade using a panel of 78 developing countries with data for the period 1984 - 2008. The empirical evidence is based on interactive GMM estimations with forward orthogonal <b>deviations.</b> <b>Bilateral,</b> multilateral and total aid dynamics are employed whereas terrorism entails: domestic, transnational, unclear and total terrorism dynamics. The following findings have been established. First, while bilateral aid has no significant effect on trade, multilateral and total aids have positive impacts. Second total terrorism, domestic terrorism and transnational terrorism increase trade with increasing order of magnitude. Third, corresponding negative marginal effects on the interaction between foreign aid (bilateral and total) and terrorism display thresholds that are within range. Unexpected signs are clarified and policy implications discussed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThere are two visual {{components}} to gaze: head orientation and {{orientation of the}} eyes relative to the head. This study explores the accuracy with which subjects can discriminate head orientation when the eyes are centered in the head. Discrimination thresholds averaged 1. 9 ° of head rotation for base head orientations of 0 ° and 15 °, but discrimination was markedly poorer around a 30 ° head orientation. Results were independent of spatial frequency and size over a 4 -fold range. Neither negative contrast nor head inversion affected discrimination. Experiments dissociating the internal features from head outline revealed the presence of two main cues to discrimination: deviation of the head profile from <b>bilateral</b> symmetry, and <b>deviation</b> of nose orientation from vertical. Simulations show that model V 4 units revealed in previous experiments with Glass patterns can extract the relevant head orientation information. The data are consistent with neurological data indicating a selective loss of face recognition in prosopagnosia with spared gaze discrimination...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} results of Carlson & Jampolsky {{technique}} in 31 patients with VI nerve palsy. METHODS: We had 23 unilateral and 8 bilateral cases. The mean unilateral preoperative esotropia was 56. 8 PD ± 24 PD (30 PD to 100 PD) {{and they had a}} mean postoperative follow-up of 14 ± 17. 9 months (3 to 72). The mean <b>bilateral</b> preoperative esotropia <b>deviation</b> angle in primary position was 74. 5 PD ± 20. 7 PD (45 PD to 100 PD) and the mean postoperative follow-up was 14. 7 ± 15. 7 months (4 to 47). RESULTS: In the unilateral group, 18 patients had good results and reoperation was not necessary. Out of 5 patients who were reoperated (2 undercorrections and 3 overcorrections), 2 had to use prismatic glasses. Among the bilateral patients, 2 cases were reoperated (1 undercorrection and 1 overcorrection), and the undercorrected patient remained with esotropia (ET 13 PD), and also had to use prismatic glasses. CONCLUSIONS: Carlson & Jampolsky technique was useful to treat patients with VI nerve palsy. We had low reoperation rates and, among the 7 patients who needed a second intervention, only 3 did not achieve good results...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} the respective contributions of institutions, geography, and trade in determining cross-country income levels using recently developed instruments for institutions and trade. Our {{results indicate that}} the quality of institutions "trumps" everything else. Controlling for institutions, geography have at best weak direct effects on incomes, although it has a strong indirect effect through institutions. Similarly, controlling for institutions, trade has a negative, albeit, insignificant direct effect on income, although trade too has a positive effect on institutional quality.

40|$|AbstractPurposeDescribe {{surgical}} treatment {{and results in}} a group of patients diagnosed and operated on of fat adherence syndrome following inferior oblique surgery. Patients, material and methodsRetrospective study of 6 cases diagnosed and treated of fat adherence syndrome following inferior oblique surgery. Mean age was 24. 67 years (range, 5 – 41), 3 males, 5 unilateral and 1 <b>bilateral.</b> Mean vertical <b>deviation</b> was 16. 16 pd (range, 4 – 25). Esotropia was associated in 4 cases, diplopia in other 2, and anomalous head posture in 3. A good outcome was considered when the final deviation was less than 10 pd, with mild limitation of elevation, without anomalous head posture, and a negative duction forced test. ResultsThe final vertical deviation was 6. 83 pd (range, 0 – 14). A 2 – 4 mm inferior rectus recession was performed on 4 patients associated to an inferior oblique surgery/exploration. All patients were operated on once, except 1 case. A good outcome was achieved in 3 patients. Anomalous head posture was resolved in 2 of 3 cases. Diplopia resolved after surgery. Only one case achieved orthophoria. Mean evolution time was 34. 83 months (range, 6 – 78). ConclusionIn the treatment of the fat adherence syndrome, an inferior rectus recession is recommended, associated to inferior oblique exploration or surgery. A good favorable outcome was only achieved in half of the cases with {{surgical treatment}}. Limitation of elevation could not be completely resolved in any of the patients...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Blue sclera {{indicates}} localized or diffuse thinning of the sclera {{that permits}} visualization {{of the underlying}} bluish choroid. Typically, blue sclera is associated with underlying collagen/skeletal disorders, high urine excretion, or chromosomal disorders. It is essential to differentiate blue sclera from other ocular conditions that present with a blue tint to the sclera. Differential diagnoses include scleromalacia perforans, congenital ocular melanocytosis (naevus of Ota) or sclera thinning secondary to trauma. Case presentation. A twenty nine-year-old black female presents to clinic with a complaint of irritated, burning eyes {{for the past five}} years. Clinical examination demonstrated moderate meibomian gland disease, corneal arcus and <b>bilateral</b> blue sclera. <b>Deviation</b> From the Expected. The patient has a positive family history for Osteogenesis Imperfecta. Her younger sister has experienced several bone fractures in the past. However, she reports having no previous bone fractures/injuries and has not been worked up for the condition thus far. Discussion. Osteogenesis Imperfecta has 12 genetic classifications that display either autosomal-dominance or autosomal-recessive patterns of inheritance with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestation from mild to severe. From clinical examination of the patient it is suspected she exhibits the Type I phenotype (mildest form) : normal stature, blue sclera, corneal arcus and minimal to no bone deformity. However, the patient was advised to undergo evaluation for the condition to obtain a conclusive diagnosis and classification. Conclusion. It is essential to differentiate true, bilateral 2 ̆ 2 blue sclera 2 ̆ 2 from separate ocular manifestations of bluish tint to the sclera for appropriate management of the condition. Grants.

40|$|Upon {{entry into}} the European Union, {{countries}} become members of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), with a derogation from adopting the euro as their currency (that is, each country joining the EU commits to replace its national currency with the euro, but can choose when to request permission to do so).
