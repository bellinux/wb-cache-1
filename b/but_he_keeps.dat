25|$|As {{earlier with}} Perugino and others, Raphael {{was able to}} {{assimilate}} the influence of Florentine art, whilst keeping his own developing style. Frescos in Perugia of about 1505 show a new monumental quality in the figures which may represent the influence of Fra Bartolomeo, who Vasari says {{was a friend of}} Raphael. But the most striking influence in the work of these years is Leonardo da Vinci, who returned to the city from 1500 to 1506. Raphael's figures begin to take more dynamic and complex positions, and though as yet his painted subjects are still mostly tranquil, he made drawn studies of fighting nude men, one of the obsessions of the period in Florence. Another drawing is a portrait of a young woman that uses the three-quarter length pyramidal composition of the just-completed Mona Lisa, but still looks completely Raphaelesque. Another of Leonardo's compositional inventions, the pyramidal Holy Family, was repeated in a series of works that remain among his most famous easel paintings. There is a drawing by Raphael in the Royal Collection of Leonardo's lost Leda and the Swan, from which he adapted the contrapposto pose of his own Saint Catherine of Alexandria. He also perfects his own version of Leonardo's sfumato modelling, to give subtlety to his painting of flesh, and develops the interplay of glances between his groups, which are much less enigmatic than those of Leonardo. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> the soft clear light of Perugino in his paintings.|$|E

Harry has each of the Hallows (the Invisibility Cloak, the Resurrection Stone, and the Elder Wand) {{at some point in}} the story but never unites them. However, J. K.

[...] "The real master of Death accepts that he must die, and that there are much worse things in the world of the living."

Nina {{attempts}} many times to assassinate Kazuya, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> foiling her with his superior skills. Her rivalry with Anna is also present, although it differs from the games in the sense that Nina was favoured by their father, who ignored Anna, which led to Anna killing him as an act of revenge and resentment, something Nina never forgave Anna for. Eventually, Nina fights Anna somewhere on the island where the tournament is being held. As Anna is ambushed and devoured by a biologically enhanced dinosaur-like being, Nina flees. She is last seen among the other fighters who made it off the island before it explodes, but with Lee's death and Heihachi fleeing, she abandons her contract against Kazuya.|$|E
2500|$|The Gospel According to Mark ( [...] , to kata Markon euangelion), {{the second}} {{book of the}} New Testament, {{is one of the}} four {{canonical}} gospels and one of the three synoptic gospels. It tells of the ministry of Jesus from his baptism by John the Baptist to his death and burial and the discovery of the empty tomb– there is no genealogy of Jesus or birth narrative, nor, in the original ending at chapter 16, any post-resurrection appearances. It portrays Jesus as a heroic man of action, an exorcist, a healer, and a miracle worker. Jesus is also the Son of God, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> his identity secret, concealing it in parables so that even the disciples fail to understand. All this is in keeping with prophecy, which foretold the fate of the messiah as suffering servant. The gospel ends, in its original version, with the discovery of the empty tomb, a promise to meet again in Galilee, and an unheeded instruction to spread the good news of the resurrection.|$|E
