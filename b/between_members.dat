5|$|Harding's biographers, writing while Britton's {{allegations}} remained uncertain, differed {{on their}} truth; Russell believed them unquestioningly while Dean, having reviewed Britton's papers at UCLA, regarded them as unproven. In 2015, DNA comparisons <b>between</b> <b>members</b> of the Harding and Blaesing families conducted by ancestry.com indicated that Harding was Elizabeth's father.

This provision has been interpreted broadly: for example, several agreements amongst firms with no production in the EU have been considered to affect trade <b>between</b> <b>Member</b> States. In the Webb-Pomerene case, EU law was applied to a US cartel with no production in the EU. The ECJ has also held that [...] "trade <b>between</b> <b>Member</b> States" [...] includes [...] "trade between regions of a Member State", to prevent cartels [...] "carving up" [...] territories for their own benefit.|$|R

5|$|Like other nuthatches, {{this is a}} noisy {{species with}} a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui. The contact call <b>between</b> <b>members</b> of a pair, given most {{frequently}} in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky nit, uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill kri repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri; the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin subspecies have a higher, faster yididitititit call, and Pacific birds a more nasal beeerf.|$|E

Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E

5|$|While {{analyses}} by {{molecular phylogeny}} {{are confident that}} members of Lophotrochozoa are {{more closely related to}} each other than of non-members, the relationships <b>between</b> <b>members</b> are mostly unclear. The Lophotrochozoa are generally divided into: Lophophorata (animals that have lophophores), including Phoronida and Brachiopoda; Trochozoa (animals many of which have trochophore larvae), including molluscs, annelids, echiurans, sipunculans and nemerteans; and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, and Rotifera).|$|E
5|$|As of 2010 {{there are}} no indisputable body fossils of phoronids. There is good {{evidence}} that phoronids created trace fossils found in the Silurian, Devonian, Permian, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, and possibly in the Ordovician and Triassic. Phoronids, brachiopods and bryozoans (ectoprocts) have collectively been called lophophorates, because all use lophophores to feed. From about the 1940s to the 1990s, family trees based on embryological and morphological features placed lophophorates among or as a sister group to the deuterostomes, a super-phylum which includes chordates and echinoderms. While a minority adhere to this view, most researchers now regard phoronids {{as members of the}} protostome super-phylum Lophotrochozoa. Although analysts using molecular phylogeny are confident that members of Lophotrochozoa are more closely related to each other than of non-members, the relationships <b>between</b> <b>members</b> are mostly unclear. Some analyses regard phoronids and brachiopods as sister-groups, while others place phoronids as a sub-group within brachiopoda.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} series of Torchwood, the Torchwood website, located at torchwood.org.uk, recounted some adventures by Captain Jack through an {{alternate}} reality game {{made up of}} electronic literature {{in the form of}} fictional intercepted blogs, newspaper cutouts and confidential letters and IM conversations <b>between</b> <b>members</b> of the Torchwood Three crew. Written by James Goss, the first series' website sheds some light on Jack's backstory in the years he worked for Torchwood. For the second series in 2008, a second interactive Torchwood online game was devised, scripted by series writer Phil Ford, and as with the 2006 website contained some information on Jack's unseen adventures. The BBC America Torchwood also has a 'Captain's Blog' section which relays Jack's accounts of the events of each episode. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature for the first two series in hardback form, including the Captain's Blog section of the BBC America website.|$|E
5|$|Fearing {{that the}} guerrilla war would spread south, the South African {{government}} pressured Rhodesia {{to advance the}} process of détente with the politically moderate black governments of Zambia and Tanzania. As part of these negotiations, Smith's government agreed to release a number of black revolutionaries who had been indefinitely detained. After almost eleven years of imprisonment, Mugabe was released in November 1974. He moved in with his sister Sabina {{at her home in}} Highfield township. He was intent on joining the ZANU forces and taking part in the guerrilla war, recognising that to secure dominance of ZANU he would have to take command of ZANLA. This was complicated by internal violence within the paramilitary group, predominantly <b>between</b> <b>members</b> of the Manyika and Karange groups of Shona.|$|E

At Corowa he was part of an impromptu group organised by John Quick which drafted a resolution, passed at the Conference, calling on the colonial parliaments to hold a directly elected Constitutional Convention to be charged with drafting the Bill for the Constitution of Australia. The proposal, which {{came to be known as}} the Corowa Plan, was later accepted at the 1895 Premiers' Conference and formed the basis for the federation process over the following five years.|$|E
5|$|Kuala Lumpur {{had seen}} a number of civil {{disturbances}} over the years. A riot in 1897 was a relatively minor affair {{that began with the}} confiscation of faulty dacing (a scale used by traders), and in 1912, a more serious disturbance called the tauchang riot began during the Chinese New Year with the cutting of pigtails and ended with rioting and factional fighting lasting a number of days. The worst rioting on record in Malaysia however occurred on 13 May 1969, when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The so-called 13 May Incident refers to the violent conflicts that took place <b>between</b> <b>members</b> of the Malay and the Chinese communities. The violence was the result of Malaysian Malays being dissatisfied with their socio-political status. The riots caused the deaths of 196 people according to official figures, and led to major changes in the country's economic policy to promote and prioritise Malay economic development over that of the other ethnicities.|$|E
