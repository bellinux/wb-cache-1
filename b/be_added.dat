5|$|For example, infant {{formulas}} traditionally were {{lacking the}} MFGM because this fraction is lost during regular dairy processing. However, more {{recent advances in}} technology have facilitated the separation of MFGM from the fat globule, allowing bovine MFGM to <b>be</b> <b>added</b> in concentrated form. The MFGM fraction is now commercially available and can <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to infant formula or other nutritional products.|$|E
5|$|To make {{brominated}} polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can {{be incorporated}} into the polymer during polymerisation. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, vinyl bromide can be used in the production of polyethylene, polyvinylchloride or polypropylene. Specific highly brominated molecules can also <b>be</b> <b>added</b> that participate in the polymerisation process For example, tetrabromobisphenol A can <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to polyesters or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in printed circuit boards are normally made from such flame retardant resins, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products (FR-4 and FR-2). In some cases the bromine containing compound may <b>be</b> <b>added</b> after polymerisation. For example, decabromodiphenyl ether can <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to the final polymers.|$|E

5|$|Analog {{computers}} {{work directly}} with physical quantities, so their addition mechanisms {{depend on the}} form of the addends. A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can <b>be</b> <b>added</b> with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can <b>be</b> <b>added</b> with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers by exploiting Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E
