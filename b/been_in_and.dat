25|$|In One Day International cricket he has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> {{out of the}} side, impressing {{more with}} the bat than the ball. He hit the fastest century by a Bangladeshi batsmen (86 deliveries) in a match against India during the 2008 Asia cup., a record bettered by Shakib Al Hasan two years later.

25|$|He {{was never}} cut {{out to be}} an ODI player, never {{crossing}} 150 runs in a calendar year. He played his last ODI against the West Indies in 2006. His test career however, is a different story. Since he made his debut in 2001, he played every year until 2010 with 2006 being the most fruitful in terms of runs scored. He made over 300 runs in 12 innings, but the team failed to win more than 2 matches(4 innings). Since then he has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the side, playing the odd match or two. He played his last game in 2010 in a losing effort against the Australians.|$|E
25|$|Sami is {{regarded}} as one of the fastest bowlers in cricket and has the ability to swing the cricket ball at high pace. He has unofficially bowled the fastest delivery in cricket when he clocked at 164km/ph (101.9mph) during a One Day International match. However, it was revoked by cricket officials after it found faulty speed measurements on the speed meter. He also once bowled a ball that clocked in at 162.3km/ph (100.8mph) against India, which would be the 'fastest ball' in the history of cricket. But despite his speed, he has <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the national side for several times. However he has received support from former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram & Waqar Younis, who sees Sami's speed and wicket taking ability as an important skill for the Pakistan team.|$|E

25|$|From the touring side, Tom Graveney, Alan Moss, Fred Trueman and Willie Watson all {{returned}} to the England Test team. Graveney had already played more than 15 Tests for England, {{though he had been}} left out of the side for the final three Tests of the 1956 Ashes, but {{returned to}} make 472 runs at a batting average over 100 in the 3–0 win over West Indies in 1957. Trueman established himself as a player in that 1957 series, taking 23 wickets after having <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the team since he was first called up to play Indian cricket team in England in 1952. Both played major parts in England Test history well into the 1960s, with Trueman becoming the first player ever to take 300 Test wickets. Moss and Watson featured in a few Tests during the final years of the 1950s, but did not make major contributions.|$|E
25|$|When Ray Illingworth left Yorkshire in 1968 it {{appeared}} that the Test career of the 36-year-old off-spinner was over, but he transferred to Leicestershire and was made captain. Although he had never been captain before his experience and knowledge of the game were widely believed to have helped Yorkshire to their County Championship victories in 1966, 1967 and 1968. The selectors had long regarded Colin Cowdrey as England's natural cricket captain, but he broke an Achilles tendon early in the season and Illingworth was his surprise replacement after only a month as county captain. Illingworth had <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> out of the national side for years, but had taken 20 wickets (13.30) against India in 1967 and 13 more (22.39) against Australia in 1968. He was originally chosen over his rivals like Brian Close as he was not a threat to Cowdrey's long-term captaincy due to his age and inability to establish a regular spot in the Test team. In the Second Test against the West Indies at Lord's in 1969, England collapsed to 61–5, but the new skipper made a forceful 113 out of the last 155 runs and became a hero. He beat both the West Indies and New Zealand 2–0 and was confirmed as captain even when Cowdrey recovered.|$|E

After Madonna arrived, they recorded her vocals and the song was finished the next day. [...] Reminiscing about the session, he said: [...] "I will never forget the feeling of leaving that session after vocal producing Madonna, and thinking to myself, 'It can’t it really get any harder than this.' I've taken that mentality into every other session I've <b>been</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> it's helped me make the session and song more of a success.
