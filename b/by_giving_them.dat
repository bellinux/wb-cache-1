5|$|Nickelodeon {{originally}} aired {{the same}} episode daily {{for five days}} before showing the next one. The producers believed this telecast strategy empowered young children <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> many opportunities to master the content and problems presented to them.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Brockman's report, {{everyone}} in Springfield shows their community spirit <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a new Christmas tree and $15,000. With the donations, Homer buys a new car. Driving it home, Homer gets stuck behind the Plow King and impatiently passes it. He unknowingly drives the car onto a frozen lake. The ice cracks, causing the car to sink and blow up.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena vitilis contain the {{chlorinated}} compound strobilurinB. Strobilurins are aromatic compounds produced by some fungi {{that help them}} secure resources <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> an advantage against other competing fungi. They have been investigated for potential use as lead compounds for agricultural fungicides.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} the second to have its entire cast (Caine and Olivier) {{nominated}} for Academy Awards after Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in 1966 and the first where all of the actors in the film were nominated. (Virginia Woolf featured uncredited bit parts by actors playing the roadhouse manager and waitress.) This feat has been repeated only <b>by</b> <b>Give</b> <b>'em</b> Hell, Harry! (1975), in which James Whitmore is the sole credited actor.|$|R
5|$|In all {{first-class}} matches, he took 86wickets at 15.68 {{and held}} onto 14 catches, fielding in the slips. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no rest day in between, so Bradman ensured Miller and Lindwall remained fresh {{for the new}} ball bursts in the Tests <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a lighter workload during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4, Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Outside the Tests, Lindwall bowled 349.3 overs, only the fifth heaviest workload among the Australians in those matches.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{occupiers}} chiefly came in {{the form}} of helping Allied airmen escape, and numerous lines were set up to organise this effort; for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 Allied servicemen to Gibraltar. The Comet Line had a series of safe houses throughout Belgium. Allied airmen were given civilian clothes and were frequently moved from house to house, staying with Belgian families who supported the resistance. The resistance would aid the airmen <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> false papers and guiding them to either neutral or Allied occupied territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{initiative}} {{to construct a}} citywide wireless internet network, initiated in 2003 by city councilmember Gary Schiff, aimed to both offer city residents with wireless access for around $20 per month, and also to improve city services such as fire and police <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> greater access to information while en route or on-site anywhere in the city. Bridging the digital divide in the city was also a stated goal for the network.|$|E
25|$|The second {{match was}} again won <b>by</b> Australia, <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a 2-0 {{lead in the}} series. The final two tests were drawn, meaning that Australia won the series 2-0, and regained the Border-Gavaskar trophy.|$|R
5000|$|Asymmetrical AI - A design which {{simplifies}} the AI reinforcement/attacking process <b>by</b> simply <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> reinforcements of units {{they need in}} important locations (on a timer), rather than over-complicating the design with the build process that humans use.|$|R
6000|$|... "How?" [...] cried Mr Tippet; [...] "why, <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>'em</b> money. You {{are aware}} that I stopped their {{allowance}} because Cattley senior went and drank {{it as soon as}} he got it, and Cattley junior is able to support himself, and I was not until now aware that the poor daughter was killing herself to support her father; but as I do know it now I'll continue the allowance and increase it, and we shall give it into the daughter's hands, so that the father won't be able to mis-spend it." ...|$|R
5|$|Alexander, the {{previous}} MacDonald leader, had made land grants to the eldest and youngest sons of Lachlan MacLean, grandson of Alexander's aunt. John Garbh (the youngest son) now obtained Rùm (possibly, Alexander had quitclaimed it to him); like Hugh's gains, Clan Ranald objected to this transfer. Traditional accounts claim that John Garbh purchased a quitclaim of Clan Ranald rights from their leader, Allan, <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a galley; though the galley looked in good quality, the interior (so the legend says) was rotten, hence explaining Clan Ranald's refusal to accept John Garbh's ownership of Rùm. John Garbh subsequently seized Allan, {{and held him}} prisoner on Coll for 9 months; presumably Allan was only released once he had agreed to acknowledge the exchange.|$|E
5|$|International {{and local}} media criticized the {{military}} government for inadequate warnings prior to Giri's landfall in the country. However, the junta claims to have informed the public appropriately. Little assistance had reached thousands of survivors days after the storm's passage, fueling anger from local media sources. Government relief slowly reached the area; however, workers only cleared debris left by the storm and only encouraged residents to rebuild <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> the supplies needed to do so. Further criticism was made about the government withholding information on {{the loss of life}} and scale of damage. Requests were also made to postpone a national election for residents in Arakan State; however, no response was given and the elections were still planned to be held on November7.|$|E
5|$|Pepsiman is {{an action}} game that {{consists}} of four stages, each divided into smaller segments, and each involving the superhero Pepsiman saving {{a person who is}} in need of a drink, such as a military man {{in the middle of a}} desert, <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a can of Pepsi. The stages are all based on real locations, such as San Francisco and New York City. The game is played from a third-person perspective, with Pepsiman automatically running forwards through the stage, sometimes running through people's living rooms. The player aims to dodge obstacles, such as cars, construction cranes, and people, as well as Pepsi-branded obstacles, including a Pepsi truck. The player does this by using four different moves: running, dashing, jumping, and super-jumping. The player gains points by collecting Pepsi cans.|$|E
50|$|The Pegasus class {{ships were}} powered by two 800 {{horsepower}} (600 kW) twin turbo-charged Mercedes-Benz Diesel engines when waterborne, using water jets (designed <b>by</b> Aerojet), <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> {{a speed of}} 12 knots. When foilborne, the ships were powered by a General Electric LM2500 gas turbine and a very large water jet, <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a speed of over 48 knots.|$|R

50|$|The move didn't {{help the}} on-ice {{performance}} of the team very much. They didn't finish last overall, but with an extra eight games played from the previous season, they only managed to better their total wins <b>by</b> 4 <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> 12 wins in 36 games.|$|R
5|$|The {{new owners}} faced a chaotic situation. The team had few players under contract, {{and had made}} little effort to sign any of their draft picks, most of which had signed with the NFL. The league {{attempted}} to strengthen the Jets and the woeful Oakland Raiders {{by allowing them to}} select players from the other six teams, and <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> the first opportunity to sign players cut from NFL rosters. Ewbank, who had discovered Colts great Johnny Unitas at an open tryout, held tryouts for the Jets. Only seven of the participants were invited to training camp, and one, Marshall Starks, made the team as a second-teamer. In mid-July, it was announced that the Jets could not move into Shea Stadium until 1964.|$|E
5|$|Doctor Neo Cortex is a mad {{scientist}} who captures Coco and Aku Aku {{and wants to}} use stolen Mojo to create an army of mutants. Uka Uka, who is also absent in the Nintendo DS version, is behind Cortex's plot for world domination; after tiring of Cortex's incompetence, Uka replaces him with his cyborg niece, Nina Cortex. Aiding the Cortexes are Doctor N. Gin, who is Cortex's hysterical right-hand man, and Tiny Tiger. Dingodile, another minion of Cortex, exclusively appears in the DS and Game Boy Advance versions of Crash of the Titans as a boss character. Aiding the villains {{are a number of}} small fodder enemies that attempt to hinder Crash in his journey. Each fodder is affiliated with a certain villain in the game. The first fodders encountered are Neo Cortex's Ratnicians, which appear as bipedal, chihuahua-like animals dressed as laboratory researchers. These characters appear in the first four episodes of the game, and are replaced by other enemies as the game progresses. The later enemies include Tiny Tiger's Southern-accented Koo-alas, Doctor N. Gin's monkey wrench-wielding Doom Monkeys, Uka Uka's spear-chucking Voodoo Bunnies, and Nina Cortex's Brat Girls. Radical Entertainment sought to give these minor characters personalities <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a large number of distinctive quotations.|$|E
5|$|In October 1917, Lenin {{issued a}} decree {{limiting}} work {{for everyone in}} Russia to eight hours per day. He also issued the Decree on Popular Education that stipulated {{that the government would}} guarantee free, secular education for all children in Russia, and a decree establishing a system of state orphanages. To combat mass illiteracy, a literacy campaign was initiated; an estimated 5 million people enrolled in crash courses of basic literacy from 1920 to 1926. Embracing the equality of the sexes, laws were introduced that helped to emancipate women, <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> economic autonomy from their husbands and removing restrictions on divorce. A Bolshevik women's organisation, Zhenotdel, was established to further these aims. Militantly atheist, Lenin and the Communist Party wanted to demolish organised religion, and in January 1918 the government decreed {{the separation of church and}} state and prohibited religious instruction in schools.|$|E

5|$|L.O.G. {{transports}} {{the characters}} to his headquarters in Showdown Town and starts the contest. The prize is ownership of Spiral Mountain, while the loser must endure eternal hardship at L.O.G.'s video game factory. As Banjo and Kazooie seek {{to win by}} completing the challenges, Gruntilda uses her powers and abilities {{to try to stop}} the duo, with a cat named Piddles and an army of robots assisting her. The game ends with Gruntilda and Banjo participating in a final duel in Spiral Mountain. Banjo and Kazooie destroy all of Gruntilda's vehicles and prepare to fight back as she gets back up, but L.O.G. declares Banjo the winner. After L.O.G. sends Gruntilda off to work at his video game factory, he rewards Banjo and Kazooie <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> the deeds to Spiral Mountain and restoring their moves, while Banjo's friends reveal that they have rebuilt his house after its destruction in Banjo-Tooie. Meanwhile, Gruntilda declares that bringing her to the factory was a mistake and vows that she will make her own video game.|$|E
5|$|Stan {{tries to}} persuade Randy {{to tell the}} truth about the stolen magnet, but Randy refuses in order to avoid embarrassment. As the pair works on the warp drive, an Intergalactic Police ship {{approaches}} Earth; McGeezax cloaks his ship and drags Stan out of sight as a hostage, leaving the townspeople to divert the officers' questions. The officers say that McGeezax stole a large sum of space cash, but no one admits to seeing him, and the officers leave. Randy then provides a diversion for McGeezax while Stan, at Randy's insistence, stabs him to death with a shank. McGeezax's ship is found to contain the stolen space cash, but instead of returning it, Randy persuades everyone to divide it among themselves. Randy, in contact with all world leaders, buys other countries' silence <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a share. Four days later, the officers return to South Park. They now know that McGeezax landed here and Randy tells them of his death, but everyone denies finding any space cash.|$|E
5|$|The script {{calls for}} five actors to portray ten {{characters}}. The two main characters are Jason, a young Canadian lawyer; and Number 18, a young female prostitute {{who claims to}} be fifteen years old {{and has been a}} prostitute for six years. The drama centers on Jason's infiltration of a brothel ring that is trafficking girls into Bangkok. Jason comes to believe that Number 18 could be a key witness to a human trafficking incident and tries to gain her trust and persuade her to testify against the ring. The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect how traffickers often dehumanize their victims <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a new name or simply a number, which in some cases is branded onto the victim's body. Waldschmidt said he hoped that She Has a Name will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists.|$|E

5|$|When fit, Miller {{opened the}} Test bowling with Lindwall, and the pair bowled in short and fiery bursts {{with the new}} ball. The English cricket {{authorities}} had agreed {{to make a new}} ball available every 55 overs. The pre-existing rule stipulated that a replacement ball would be available every 200 runs, which usually took much more time to accumulate. This played directly {{into the hands of the}} Australians with their vastly stronger pace attack, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice bowlers for a fresh attack every 55 overs. With 13 wickets in the Tests, Miller was third among the Australians behind Lindwall and Johnston, who took 27 apiece. Owing to his fragility, Miller was used sparingly compared to the other four Australian frontline bowlers: Toshack and Johnson each delivered more than 170 overs despite playing in one less Test, while Lindwall bowled 224 and Johnston 306 in five matches. In all first-class matches, Miller took 56wickets at 17.58 and held onto 20 catches. There were many consecutive matches during the tour with no intervening rest day, so Bradman ensured that his leading pace duo remained fresh for the new ball bursts in the Tests <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> <b>them</b> a smaller proportion of the bowling during the tour matches. During all first-class matches, Johnston bowled 851.1 overs, Johnson 668, Lindwall 573.4 and Toshack 502, while Miller bowled only 429.4 overs. Doug Ring—who was only selected in one Test—bowled 542.4 overs, while all rounders Colin McCool and Loxton bowled 399.4 and 361.2 overs respectively. McCool did not play in any Tests, while Loxton was only entrusted with 63 overs against England. As such, in some tour matches, Miller was not asked to bowl at all, in order to keep him fresh for the Tests.|$|E
