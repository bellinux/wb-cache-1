5|$|Another {{important}} {{development was}} in the process for discovery, the scientific method, focusing on empirical evidence and the importance of mathematics, while discarding Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included Copernicus, Galileo, and Francis Bacon.

5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} {{was becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular <b>biology</b> <b>and</b> biochemistry.

5|$|Biogeography (an {{amalgamation}} of <b>biology</b> <b>and</b> geography) is {{the comparative}} study of the geographic distribution of organisms and the corresponding evolution of their traits in space and time. The Journal of Biogeography was established in 1974. Biogeography and ecology share many of their disciplinary roots. For example, the theory of island biogeography, published by the Robert MacArthur and Edward O. Wilson in 1967 {{is considered one of}} the fundamentals of ecological theory.|$|E

5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave the arena of evolutionary <b>biology</b> <b>and</b> become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
