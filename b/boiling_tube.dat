40|$|After {{emergency}} shutdown of high-temperature-gas-cooled reactor, the residual {{heat of the}} reactor core should be removed. As the natural circulation process spends too {{long period of time}} to be utilized, an active residual heat removal procedure is needed, which makes use of steam generator and start-up loop. During this procedure, the structure of steam generator may suffer cold/heat shock because of the sudden load of coolant or hot helium at the first few minutes. Transient analysis was carried out based on a one-dimensional mathematical model for steam generator and steam pipe of start-up loop to achieve safety and reliability. The results show that steam generator should be discharged and precooled; otherwise, boiling will arise and introduce a cold shock to the <b>boiling</b> <b>tubes</b> and tube sheet when coolant began to circulate prior to the helium. Additionally, in avoiding heat shock caused by the sudden load of helium, the helium circulation should be restricted to start with an extreme low flow rate; meanwhile, the coolant of steam generator (water) should have flow rate as large as possible.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} hydride generation system {{that uses a}} pyrex <b>boiling</b> <b>tube</b> as a reduction vessel to hold the acidified sample into which 2 cm 3 of 100 - 300 mg sodium tetrahydroborate (III) solution is injected such that the excess molecular hydrogen evolved carries the generated arsine directly through the atomic absorption spectrophotometer nebuliser to a nitrogen-hydrogen entrained air flame for atomic absorption measurement is described. The average absorption by arsenic atoms generated from the total arsine evolved was measured by integrating the absorbance for 16 seconds. The use of the absorption signal integration mode was found to free the technique from most kinetic interferences, while the stripping of the arsine from solution reduces the potential for chemical interferences in the solution phase. Gas flow rates affected sensitivity markedly, but the optimal flow rates for nitrogen and hydrogen were standardised on 90 cm 3 s- 1 and 30 cm 3 s- 1 respectively as a compromise between lower flow-rates giving longer arsenic residence times and higher sensitivity, and higher flow-rates giving a stiffer, less draught-sensitive flame. An optimum flame height of 6 mm above the burner produced sufficient atomization and low background absorption. Generally, sample volumes between 5 - 20 cm 3 {{could be used in}} different acidic media within the concentration range 10 % (v/v) – 50 % (v/v).

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringSteven Eckels and Mohammad HosniThis {{research}} presents {{results from}} experimental and numerical investigations of two-phase flow pattern analysis in a staggered tube bundle. Shell-side <b>boiling</b> <b>tube</b> bundles {{are used in}} a variety of industries from nuclear power plants to industrial evaporators. Fluid flow patterns in tube bundles affect pressure drop, boiling characteristics, and tube vibration. R- 134 a was the working fluid in both the experimental and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis for this research. Smooth and enhanced staggered tube bundles were studied experimentally using a 1. 167 pitch to diameter ratio. The experimental tube bundles and CFD geometry consist of 20 tubes with five tubes per pass. High speed video was recorded during the experimental bundle boiling. Bundle conditions ranged in mass fluxes from 10 - 35 kg/m[superscript] 2. s and inlet qualities from 0 - 70 % with a fixed heat flux. Classification of the flow patterns from these videos was performed using flow pattern definitions from literature. Examples of smooth and enhanced bundle boiling high speed videos are given through still images. The flow patterns are plotted and compared with an existing flow pattern map. Good agreement was found for the enhanced tube bundle while large discrepancies exist for the smooth tube bundle. The CFD simulations were performed without heat transfer with non-symmetrical boundary conditions at the side walls, simulating rectangular bundles used in this and other research. The two-phase volume of fluid method was used to construct vapor interfaces and measure vapor volume fraction. A probability density function technique was applied to the results to determine flow patterns from the simulations using statistical parameters. Flow patterns were plotted on an adiabatic flow pattern map from literature and excellent agreement is found between the two. The agreement between simulation results and experimental data from literature emphasizes the use of numerical techniques for tube bundle design...|$|E
40|$|The {{complexities}} of two-phase flow and evaporation on a tube bundle present important {{problems in the}} design of heat exchangers and the understanding of the physical phenomena taking place. The development of structured surfaces to enhance boiling heat transfer and thus reduce the size of evaporators adds another level of complexity to the modeling of such heat exchangers. Horizontal falling film evaporators have the potential to be widely used in large refrigeration systems and heat pumps, in the petrochemical industry and for sea water desalination units, but {{there is a need to}} improve the understanding of falling film evaporation mechanisms to provide accurate thermal design methods. The characterization of the effect of enhanced surfaces on the boiling phenomena occurring in falling film evaporators is thus expected to increase and optimize the performance of a tube bundle. In this work, the existing LTCM falling film facility was modified and instrumented to perform falling film evaporation measurements on single tube row and a small tube bundle. Four types of tubes were tested including: a plain tube, an enhanced condensing tube (Gewa-C+LW) and two enhanced <b>boiling</b> <b>tubes</b> (Turbo-EDE 2 and Gewa-B 4) to extend the existing database. The current investigation includes results for two refrigerants, R 134 a and R 236 fa, at a saturation temperature of Tsat = 5  °C, liquid film Reynolds numbers ranging from 0 to 3000, at heat fluxes between 20 and 60 kW/m 2 in pool boiling and falling film configurations. Measurements of the local heat transfer coefficient were obtained and utilized to improve the current prediction methods. Finally, the understanding of the physical phenomena governing the falling film evaporation of liquid refrigerants has been improved. Furthermore, a method for predicting the onset of dry patch formation has been developed and a local heat transfer prediction method for falling film evaporation based on a large experimental database has been proposed. These represent significant improvements for the design of falling film evaporators...|$|R

40|$|Efficient heat {{transfer}} technologies {{are essential for}} magnetically confined fusion reactors; this applies to both {{the current generation of}} experimental reactors as well as future power plants. A number of High Heat Flux devices have therefore been developed specifically for this application. One of the most promising candidates is the HyperVapotron, a water cooled device which relies on internal fins and boiling {{heat transfer}} to maximise the heat transfer capability. Over the past 30 years, numerous variations of the HyperVapotron have been built and tested at fusion research centres around the globe resulting in devices that can now sustain heat fluxes in the region of 20 – 30 MW/m 2 in steady state. Unfortunately, there have been few attempts to model or understand the internal heat transfer mechanisms responsible for this exceptional performance with the result that design improvements are traditionally sought experimentally which is both inefficient and costly. This thesis seeks to develop an engineering model of the HyperVapotron device using commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics software. To establish the most appropriate modelling choices, in-depth studies were performed examining the turbulence models (within the Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes framework), near wall methods, grid resolution and boiling submodels. Validation of the models is accomplished via comparison with experimental results as well as high order Implicit Large Eddy Simulation methods. It is shown that single phase cavity flows and their related heat transfer characteristics (time-averaged) can be accurately captured if the SST k-omega turbulence model is employed using a fine nearwall grid throughout the cavity (e. g. y+ < 1 throughout). Separately, multiphase solutions with tuned wall boiling models also showed reasonable agreement with experimental data for vertical <b>boiling</b> <b>tubes.</b> As more complex multiphase HyperVapotron models were constructed, it became clear that there is an intrinsic incompatibility between the fine grids required for the single phase heat transfer predictions and the coarser grids plus wall functions required by the boiling model. Ultimately, the full 3 D solution was based on the coarser grids as the fall off in accuracy in single phase heat transfer only becomes significant for HyperVapotron designs with deeper cavities. Since it is also shown here that deeper cavities are generally less efficient, these grid induced errors become less relevant if the primary objective is to find optimised performance. Comparing the CFD solutions with HyperVapotron experimental data suggests that a RANS-based, multiphase model is indeed capable of predicting performance over a wide range of geometries and boundary conditions. Whilst a definitive set of design improvements is not defined here, it is expected that the methodologies and tools developed will enable designers of future High Heat Flux devices to perform significant virtual prototyping before embarking on the more costly build and test programmes.
