40|$|Evaluation of {{the energy}} value of plant species {{consumed}} by the <b>Barbary</b> <b>Deer</b> (Cervus elaphus barbarus, Bennet 1833) {{in the area of}} El Ayoune (El Kala National Park, Algeria). - Plant species taken for food by the <b>Barbary</b> <b>Deer</b> were determined by direct observation during one year. On the basis of their chemical composition and phenological stage, the energy value of the grazed plant species has been expressed in stag-units as suggested by Brelurut et al. (1990). Results show that the more energy-giving elements are plants from the herbaceous layer and the acorns of Cork Oak (Quercus suber). From the shrubby layer, the Strawberry-tree (Arbustus unedo) comes first with an energy value comparable to that of green grass fodder, followed by Tree Heath (Erica arborea), Lentisc (Pistacia lentiscus) and Filaria (Phillyrea augustifolia) with energy values comparable to those of grass hays. The energy values of the other shrubby plant species are comparable with those of cereal straws; they do not ensure but the needs for maintenance...|$|E
50|$|African aouodad sheep (<b>Barbary</b> sheep), mule <b>deer,</b> white-tailed deer, coyotes, opossums, raccoons, bobcats, foxes, porcupines, {{numerous}} {{species of}} snakes and lizards, and over 175 {{species of birds}} including golden eagles are found within the park. Lake Theo contains bass, catfish, and rainbow trout. In the summer of 2012 black-tailed prairie dogs were reintroduced to a 200 acre area within the park.|$|R
40|$|Eight <b>Barbary</b> red <b>deer</b> (Cervus elaphus barbarus) {{developed}} {{clinical signs}} suggestive of {{malignant catarrhal fever}} (MCF) over a 28 -day period. These animals were housed outdoors with four other species of ruminants. Affected red deer had lethargy, ocular signs, and nasal discharge and were euthanatized within 48 h. Lesions included ulcers of the muzzle, lips, and oral cavity associated with infiltrates of neutrophils and lymphocytes. Serologically, six of seven red deer tested during the outbreak were positive by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to a shared MCF virus antigen. PCR using oligonucleotide primers designed for a conserved protein of alcelaphine herpesviruses 1 (AlHV- 1) and 2 (AlHV- 2) and for conserved regions of a herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene was positive for tissues from all eight clinically affected animals and negative for eight out of eight red deer without clinical signs of MCF. DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons from the diseased red deer {{indicated that they were}} infected with a novel herpesvirus closely related to AlHV- 2; immunohistochemistry using polyclonal anti-AlHV- 2 serum and in situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of virus within salivary glands adjacent to oral lesions of affected animals. A survey of other ruminants near the outbreak subsequently showed that normal Jackson's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus jacksoni) that were cohoused with the diseased red deer were infected with the same virus and were shedding the virus in nasal excretions. These findings suggest that a herpesvirus closely related to AlHV- 2 caused the MCF-like disease epizootic in <b>Barbary</b> red <b>deer</b> and that the virus may have originated from Jackson's hartebeest...|$|R
50|$|Safari Park: This is {{the main}} animal reserve at the park. Visitors drive through in their own vehicle and observe {{wildlife}} {{from all over the}} globe roaming freely. When first entering the park, mouflon, fallow <b>deer,</b> red <b>deer,</b> <b>barbary</b> sheep, bongo, sitatunga, and water buffalo can be seen. After passing through the gates, a large pride of African lions can be viewed by visitors. Tigers and Asian black bears are also present. After leaving the large carnivores behind, macaques can be seen playing and climbing in trees. African and Asian elephants are seen later on with giraffe, American bison, eland and Arabian Oryx, donkeys, waterbuck, gnu, zebra, llama, ostrich, emu, horses and ponies, Ankole cattle, yak, and camels. The safari reserves end with the large lake of pink flamingos, cranes, storks, ibises, and peacocks.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the rumen and claw health of different ruminant species - blackbuck, <b>barbary</b> sheep, sika <b>deer,</b> addax antelope - from the Nuremberg Zoo according to the feeding management. Five killed individuals of the ruminant species mentioned above, were used in this study. Parameters of microbiological fermentation of the rumen (pH, SCFA, lactate, NH 3), blood values (l-lactate, NEFA) as well as rumen tissue samples were examined. Additionally, investigations on claw health, in terms of laminitis were made. The diets were calculated based on the weight of the feedstuffs and nutrition analysis. Three species - blackbuck, barbary sheep, addax antelope - all grass- and roughage feeders, showed severe characteristics of subacute ruminal acidosis due to a diet high in fermentable carbohydrates and low in fibre. This was particularly proved by numerous microabscesses inside the rumen mucosa and mean rumen pH < 6, 5. The sika deer, classified as intermediate feeder, appeared to tolerate the diet with a high concentrate rate, since no pathological variations were present. These results demonstrate that subacute ruminal acidosis is still a serious problem in captive wild ruminants, which are often fed wrong diets with a high concentration of easily digestible carbohydrates...|$|R
