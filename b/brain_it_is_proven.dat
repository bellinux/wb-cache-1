50|$|However, some {{philosophers}} do {{not accept}} this as a rigorous refutation. For example, Victor Argonov states that epiphenomenalism is a questionable, but experimentally falsifiable theory. He argues that personal mind {{is not the only}} source of knowledge about the existence of mind in the world. A creature (even a zombie) could have knowledge about mind and the mind-body problem by virtue of some innate knowledge. The information about mind (and its problematic properties such as qualia) could have been, in principle, implicitly “written” in the material world since its creation. Epiphenomenalists can say that God created immaterial mind and a detailed “program” of material human behavior that makes it possible to speak about the mind-body problem. That version of epiphenomenalism seems highly exotic, but <b>it</b> cannot <b>be</b> excluded from consideration by pure theory. However, Argonov suggests that experiments could refute epiphenomenalism. In particular, ephiphenomenalism could be refuted if neural correlates of consciousness {{can be found in the}} human <b>brain,</b> and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>proven</b> that human speech about consciousness is caused by them.|$|R

In {{this paper}} the working {{principle}} of the human eye is studied since uses very simple detectors, cones and rods, to provide an impressive high angular resolution without using any kind of scanning technique. Usually the resolution capability of the human eyes {{has been attributed to}} the complexity of the <b>brain,</b> but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quite difficult to understand that something, specially small details, that <b>it</b> has not <b>been</b> seen by the eyes could be generated by the <b>brain.</b> Finally, <b>it</b> will <b>be</b> <b>proved</b> that with the actual technology and design philosophy of array antenna systems, the maximum achievable angular resolution of a realistic antenna array system is seriously limited and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to the one that it could have an insect with compound eyes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> clear the human eye is able to overcome this limit, and the idea is to learn how to introduce this to the design procedure of antenna array systems.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} CREB (cAMP response element binding protein) in hippocampus, PFC (prefrontal cortex) and NAc (nucleus accumbens) during three phases of morphine induced CPP (conditioned place preference) in rats, and to elucidate the role of CREB during the progress of conditioned place preference. Methods: Morphine induced CPP acquisition, extinction and drug primed reinstatement model was established, and CREB expression in each brain area was measured by Western Blot methods. Results: Eight alternating injections of morphine (10 mg/kg) induced CPP, and 8 d saline extinction training that extinguished CPP. CPP was reinstated following a priming injection of morphine (2. 5 mg/kg). During the phases of CPP acquisition and reinstatement, the level of CREB expression was significantly changed in different <b>brain</b> areas. Conclusion: <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>proved</b> that CPP model {{can be used as}} an effective tool to {{investigate the}} mechanisms underlying drug-induced reinstatement of drug seeking after extinction, and that morphine induced CPP and drug primed reinstatement may involve activation of the transcription factor CREB in several brain areas, suggesting that the CREB and its target gene regulation pathway may mediate the basic mechanism underlying opioid dependence and its drug seeking behavior...|$|R
40|$|The drug {{addiction}} may {{be regarded as}} the disease of the brain reward system. This system, closely related to the system of emotional arousal, is located predominantly in the limbic structures of the <b>brain.</b> <b>Its</b> existence <b>was</b> <b>proved</b> by demonstration of the “pleasure centers, ” that were discovered as location from which electrical self-stimulation is readily evoked. The main neurotransmitter involved in the reward is dopamine, but other monoamines and acetylcholine may also participate. The anatomical core of the reward system are dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmentum that project to the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, prefrontal cortex and other forebrain structures. Several of those structures may be specifically involved in the reward produced by different substances, when anticipating the reward. The recent discovery of CART peptides may importantly expand our knowledge about the neurochemistry of reward. Natural rewarding activities and artificial chemical rewarding stimuli act at the same locations, but while natural activities are controlled by feedback mechanisms that activate aversive centers, no such restrictions bind the responses to artificial stimuli. There are several groups of substances that activate the reward system and they may produce addiction, which in humans is a chronic, recurrent disease, characterized by absolute dominance of drug-seeking behavior. The craving induced by substances of addiction inhibits other behaviors. The adaptation of an organism to a chronic intake of drugs involves development of adaptive changes, sensitization or tolerance. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> thought that the gap between sensitization developing for the incentive value of the drug and tolerance to the reward induced by its consumption underlies the vicious circle of events leading to drug dependence. The vulnerability to addiction is dependent not only on the environment, but also on genetic factors...|$|R
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. Thesis (M. S.) : Bilkent University, Department of Neuroscience, İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, 2017. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 63 - 73). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> known that new neuron {{formation in the}} brain continues throughout {{the life of an}} organism. In the adult human <b>brain,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>proven</b> that neurogenesis in the hippocampus is higher than expected, almost 700 new neurons are formed in a day. The formation of new neurons is supported by the stem cell subpopulation in the brain. With learning and the formation of new memories, the neuron production increases. However, changes in the cognitive abilities with advancing age are thought to be caused by the functional and molecular alterations in the stem cell populations. Molecular changes in neural stem cells throughout aging were found to be deterrents of the increased risk of cancer with age, such as tumor suppressor mechanisms. However, the activation and overlap of tumor suppressing mechanisms result in senescence in stem cells that have accumulated oncogenic mutations, which causes the stem cell pool exhaustion. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> thought that cancer cells acquire stem cell-like properties in order to have the unlimited proliferation and self-renewal properties, which are characteristics of both healthy and cancer stem cells. Neural cancer stem cells have the ability to produce glial and neural cells, like normal stem cells. The cancer stem cell subpopulations are implicated in the growth of tumor tissues. Hence, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important to identify and characterize cancer stem cells and make a distinction between cancer and non-cancer stem cells. In this project, this issue was addressed by studying the marker expressions of brain tumor tissues obtained from humans, which confirmed that the cancer cells do express stem cell and progenitor cell markers, such as Sox 2 and Vimentin. The presence of mature neurons was also established by the mature neuronal marker NeuN. In order to determine whether these stem cells may be different in young and old subjects, a study was also carried out in young and old zebrafish neural stem cells in order to identify the expression differences between the groups. The presence of proliferating stem cells and differentiated cells were identified in cell culture. This analysis of neural stem cells in old and young zebrafish revealed 18 differentially-expressed genes. The results indicated a higher differentiation rate in old zebrafish stem cells, which {{may be due to the}} increased loss of neural cells in the old zebrafish brain. The development of markers that could be widely used for the diagnosis of cancer and the identification of cell types is important. For reliable diagnosis and identification of cancer cells, multiple cellular markers are used. Hence the distinction of cell types based on light scattering differences would speed up the process of diagnosis, and the elimination of marker used for the distinction of cell types would be beneficial. The final project mentioned in this thesis involves the analysis of C 6 (rat glioma) cell line for scattering properties and cell cycle arrest. A general method for definition of a scatter data interval for C 6 cells in different stages was developed and can be applied to other cell types and diseases. These studies show that the proliferation and stem cell markers’ expressions differ between cancer and healthy stem cells, and the expression of neuroprotective genes is differentially upregulated in old zebrafish neural stem cells compared to the young. This data could contribute to the knowledge on normal and cancer stem cell expression differences, as well as how age affects the expression, and supply information required for the development of a cancer stem cell identification and targeting methods. by Özge Pelin Burhan.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the mechanisms of cognitive process from the viewpoint of neurodynamic concepts. The concept of neurodynamic processes is studying the modes of localization, synchronization, stabilization metastable chaotic structures in the reticular formation neural network. The dynamic process of the neural circuitry leads to <b>brain</b> imaging work. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>proven</b> that the functional metastable structures in dissipative dynamic systems are the model representations of mental images. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> shown that each metastable state corresponds to a certain mental image. The relaxation process of the system triggers off the reflection process of the metastable structures of mental images in the static variety of cognitive space. The mechanism of brain imaging work considering the chaotic nature of the parameters of the neural network has been investigated. The concept of homogeneous process as the concatenation of the unpredictable metastable structures of the same mode has been introduced. Heterogeneous process is seen as the concatenation of the metastable structures of different modes. The research shows that the formation of unpredictable mental images and spatial temporal situations in the cognitive space can be interpreted as the formation of the elements of the metacognition in the processes of students’ thinking. The detailed research of the mechanisms of formation and development of cognitive space will enable the understanding of the development of students’ thinking in the process of their mathematical and professional preparing. The elements of the metacognition in thinking processes stimulate cognitive system of the individual to the further development, increase of abilities, improvement of mathematical and professional culture...|$|R
