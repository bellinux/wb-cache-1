5000|$|Vacuuming is {{performed}} {{in the same manner}} as with a portable machine. Sometimes, the higher vacuum power of central vacuum may require reduction (for example, when cleaning a delicate sheer fabric curtain). Excess vacuum is [...] "bled off" [...] by partially opening a <b>bleed</b> <b>port</b> or slot to let some intake air bypass the cleaning tool. The <b>bleed</b> <b>port</b> is typically located at the tool end of the vacuum hose, to allow quick adjustment during use.|$|E

In the US, the de facto standard size is 1-1/4 inch (3.175 cm) inside diameter for tools. For some accessories, it may actually be necessary to [...] "bleed off" [...] excessive suction, usually by partially opening a small <b>bleed</b> <b>port</b> on the side of the vacuum hose handle, provided for that purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Vari-lift - {{intended}} for short production runs and prototypes, in applications where the exact force is important but hard to estimate in advance, such as lifting a lid slowly in a known time. In {{this case the}} cylinder is supplied filled to maximum design pressure, but equipped with a <b>bleed</b> <b>port,</b> to allow gas to be released once installed. The intention is that the design can be over-sprung, and then the pressure reduced in stages, to optimise behaviour. If too much gas is released, a new spring must be installed, and for large quantities, {{it is better to}} order a bespoke pressure setting from the maker.|$|E
30|$|Laparoscopic port {{instruments}} {{are the most}} common device named in malpractice injury claims associated with laparoscopic procedures, representing one third of all claims [5]. The incidence is estimated to be 4.24 per 1, 000 procedures [3]. Typical port-related complications are intra-abdominal vascular injury, visceral injury, <b>port</b> site <b>bleeding,</b> <b>port</b> site herniation, port site infection, and pain. In the last few decades, there has been continuous innovation of the instrument design aimed at reducing these complications.|$|R
40|$|The nonrecoverable stall {{condition}} in high performance turbofan engines {{is characterized by}} thrust loss, rising turbine temperatures, high pressure compressor rotating stall, and loss of engine control. Stall recovery control is presently investigated {{by means of an}} engine system computer model capable of either surge or rotating stall postinstability operation. Several techniques are examined which can yield rapid recovery from stall; a composite strategy which involves reduction of engine speed to idle while simultaneously opening the 10 th- and 14 th-stage compressor <b>bleed</b> <b>ports</b> allowed recovery to speeds slightly higher than idle while combustor fuel flow continued...|$|R

And he drew the key from his pocket and opened the door in the lobby, behind which three or four servants were gathered. A crash of broken glass, a cry, a shout, an oath or two, had told them that some violent scene was occurring within, and they entered, and behold two victims bedabbled with red--the chaplain <b>bleeding</b> <b>port</b> wine, and the Honourable William Esmond, Esquire, stretched in his own gore.|$|R
50|$|A certain minimum supply {{pressure}} {{is needed to}} drive the air through the system, but it is desired to use as low a {{supply pressure}} as possible, because the energy the engine uses to compress the bleed air is not available for propulsion, and fuel consumption suffers. For this reason, air is commonly drawn from one of two (or in some cases such as the Boeing 777, three) bleed ports at different compressor stage locations. When the engine is at low pressure (low thrust or high altitude), the air is drawn from the highest pressure <b>bleed</b> <b>port.</b> As pressure is increased (more thrust or lower altitude) and reaches a predetermined crossover point, the high pressure shut-off valve (HPSOV) closes and air is selected from a lower pressure port to minimize the fuel performance loss. The reverse happens as engine pressure decreases.|$|E
40|$|In {{addition}} to fixed and variable bleed devices provided for controlling {{the position of}} a terminal shock wave in a supersonic inlet, a plurality of free piston valves are disposed around the periphery of a cowling of a supersonic engine inlet. The free piston valves are disposed in dump passageways, each of which begin at a <b>bleed</b> <b>port</b> in the cowling that is located in the throat region of the inlet, where the diameter of the centerbody is near maximum, and terminates at an opening in the cowling adjacent a free piston valve.

40|$|This work {{utilizes}} an immersed boundary (IB) {{method to}} simulate the effects of arrays of discrete bleed ports in controlling shock wave / turbulent boundary layer interactions. Both Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and hybrid large-eddy / Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (LES/RANS) turbulence closures are used with the IB technique. The approach is validated by conducting simulations of Mach 2. 5 flow over a perforated plate containing 18 individual bleed holes. Predictions of discharge coefficient {{as a function of}} bleed plenum pressure are compared with experimental data. Simulations of an impinging oblique shock / boundary layer interaction at Mach 2. 45 with and without active bleed control are also performed. The 68 -hole bleed plate is rendered as an immersed object in the computational domain. Wall pressure predictions show that, in general, the LES/RANS technique under-estimates the upstream extent of axial separation that occurs in the absence of bleed. Good agreement with Pitot-pressure surveys throughout the interaction region is obtained, however. Active suction completely removes the separation region and induces local disturbances in the wall pressure distributions that are associated with the expansion of the boundary layer fluid into the <b>bleed</b> <b>port</b> and its subsequent re-compression. Predicted Pitot-pressure distributions are in good agreement with experiment for the case with bleed. Swirl strength probability-density distributions are used to estimate the evolution of turbulence length-scales throughout the interaction, and the effects of bleed on the amplification of Reynolds stresses are highlighted. Finally, simple improvements to engineering-level bleed models are proposed based on the computational results. I...|$|E
50|$|The {{bridge was}} built of binding ashlar blocks {{brought from the}} {{quarries}} in Yagmurca, Eskikoy and Hasırcıarnavut villages, to each other with Horasan cement.The construction process was supervised firstly by Ghazi Mahmud Bey and after his death by Ishak Bey. Although today its length is 1238.55 m (4063 ft) from the first arch to the last, its original length used to be 1392 m (4566 ft) with extended wings that don’t exist today. The reason of why it was built this long was that the region used to be covered with vast swamps in that period. In addition, because the Ergene River causes flood in rainy season, the arches over the river were built high and opened seven <b>bleed</b> <b>ports</b> in them to prevent the bridge from collapse. The wings and arches of the bridge which has 13.56 m (44.48 ft) height, are embellished with several lion, elephant, bird, eagle, tulip and geometric relief motifs.|$|R
40|$|A time marching 3 -D full Navier-Stokes code, called PARC 3 D, is {{validated}} for {{an experimental}} Mach 5 inlet configuration using the data {{obtained in the}} 10 x 10 ft supersonic wind tunnel at the NASA Lewis Research Center. For the first time, a solution is obtained for this configuration with the actual geometry, the tunnel conditions, and all the bleed zones modeled in the computation. Pitot pressure profiles and static pressures at various locations in the inlet are compared with the corresponding experimental data. The effect of bleed zones, located in different places on the inlet walls, in eliminating the low energy vortical flow generated from the 3 -D shock-boundary layer interaction is simulated very well even though some approximations are used in applying the bleed boundary conditions and in the turbulence model. A further detailed study {{of the effect of}} individual <b>bleed</b> <b>ports</b> is needed to understand fully the actual mechanism of efficiently eliminating the vortical flow from the inlet. A better turbulence model would help to improve the accuracy even further in predicting the corner flow boundary layer profiles...|$|R

30|$|She was {{initially}} {{observed in the}} recovery area and, subsequently, transferred to the day surgical ward. One hour postoperatively, nursing staff noted <b>bleeding</b> from the <b>port</b> site in the right iliac fossa. On review by the registrar, a subcutaneous haematoma was noted with blood ‘oozing’ from the port site. A pressure dressing was applied. Subsequent review by the team consultant noted that the haematoma was increasing in size. Two interrupted abdominal wall sutures were placed just inferior to the <b>port</b> site, as <b>bleeding</b> from the inferior epigastric artery was suspected. A full blood count revealed a haemoglobin level of 9.9  g/dL (12.1  g/dL preoperatively). The <b>bleeding</b> from the <b>port</b> site settled, but she remained in the hospital overnight for observation. The following day, she was noted to have a 4 -cm haematoma in the right iliac fossa, with no obvious active bleeding.

25|$|The ported shroud is a {{performance}} enhancement {{that allows the}} compressor to operate at significantly lower flows. It achieves this by forcing a simulation of impeller stall to occur continuously. Allowing some air to escape at this location inhibits the onset of surge and widens the operating range. While peak efficiencies may decrease, high efficiency may be achieved over a greater range of engine speeds. Increases in compressor efficiency result in slightly cooler (more dense) intake air, which improves power. This is a passive structure that is constantly open (in contrast to compressor exhaust blow off valves, which are mechanically or electronically controlled). The ability of the compressor to provide high boost at low rpm may also be increased marginally (because near choke conditions the compressor draws air inward through the <b>bleed</b> path). <b>Ported</b> shrouds are used by many turbocharger manufacturers.|$|R
40|$|Background: Different {{complications}} {{may occur}} at laparoscopic port sites. The incidence of these {{varies with the}} size of the ports and the types of procedure performed through them. Objectives: The aim was to observe the rate and types of complications attending laparoscopic port wounds and to identify risk factors for their occurrence. Patients and Methods: This is a prospective descriptive study of all patients who had laparoscopic operations in one general surgery unit of a University Teaching Hospital in Nigeria between January 2009 and December 2012. Results: A total of 236 (155 female and 81 male) patients were included. The laparoscopic procedures include 63 cholecystectomies, 49 appendectomies, 62 diagnostic, biopsy and staging procedures, 22 adhesiolyses, six colonic surgeries, eight hernia repairs and 22 others. Port site complications occurred in 18 (2. 8 %) ports on 16 (6. 8 %) patients including port site infections in 12 (5. 1 %) and hypertrophic scars in 4 (1. 7 %) patients, while one patient each had <b>port</b> site <b>bleeding</b> and <b>port</b> site metastasis. Nine of 11 infections were superficial, while eight involved the umbilical port wound. Conclusion: Port site complications are few following laparoscopic surgeries in our setting.

40|$|Abstract: The main {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) and its causes at Liaquat University of Medical and Heath Sciences, Jamshoro. It was a prospective study carried out from February 2008 to January 2011. Data of all patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the study period and fulfilling the selection criteria was collected and entered in standardized proforma and analyzed on SPSS 10. A total of 100 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with an overwhelming majority of females (87 out of 100). The age range from 22 to 60 years, mean age being 38 years. The overall complication rate was 9 %. The complications included bleeding (4 / 100, 4 %) from cystic artery and gall bladder bed, port site infection (4 / 100, 4 %) One patient developed collection in pouch of Morrison and one patient developed stitch granuloma. There was no bile duct injury and colonic injury. The common causes of these complications were accident injury to cystic artery and gross spillage of infected bile. <b>Bleeding</b> and <b>Port</b> site infections were the commonest complications. The commonest cause of bleeding was cystic artery injury whereas the commonest cause of port site infection was gross spillage of infected bile.

50|$|In {{addition}} to tube and tubeless tires, Schrader valves of varying diameters are used on many refrigeration {{and air conditioning}} systems to allow servicing, including recharging with refrigerant; by plumbers conducting leak-down pressure tests on pipe installations; as a <b>bleeding</b> and test <b>port</b> on the fuel rail of some fuel injected engines; on bicycle air shock absorbers to allow adjustment of air pressure according to the rider's weight; and in the buoyancy compensator (BC) inflators of SCUBA systems where the ability to easily disconnect an air hose (even underwater) without the loss of tank air is critical. Schrader valves are also widely used in high-pressure hydraulic systems on aircraft.Many domestic fire extinguishers use an internal valve identical to a Schrader valve, but with a lever on top to enable quick release of the pressurized content.|$|R
40|$|Context: The rate of port site {{complications}} following conventional {{laparoscopic surgery}} is about 21 per 100, 000 cases. It {{has shown a}} proportional rise with increase {{in the size of}} the port site incision and trocar. Although rare, complications that occur at the port site include infection, <b>bleeding,</b> and <b>port</b> site hernia. Aims: To determine the morbidity associated with ports at the site of their insertion in laparoscopic surgery and to identify risk factors for complications. Settings and Design: Prospective descriptive study. Materials and Methods: In the present descriptive study, a total of 570 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgeries for various ailments between August 2009 and July 2011 at our institute were observed for port site complications prospectively and the complications were reviewed. Statistical Analysis Used: Descriptive statistical analysis was carried out in the present study. The statistical software, namely, SPSS 15. 0 was used for the analysis of the data. Results: Of the 570 patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery, 17 (3 %) had developed complications specifically related to the port site during a minimum follow-up of three months; port site infection (PSI) was the most frequent (n = 10, 1. 8 %), followed by <b>port</b> site <b>bleeding</b> (n = 4, 0. 7 %), omentum-related complications (n = 2; 0. 35 %), and port site metastasis (n = 1, 0. 175 %). Conclusions: Laparoscopic surgeries are associated with minimal port site complications. Complications are related to the increased number of ports. Umbilical port involvement is the commonest. Most complications are manageable with minimal morbidity, and can be further minimized with meticulous surgical technique during entry and exit...|$|R
30|$|No patient {{required}} laparotomy, reoperation or readmission. Patients weighed up to {{a maximum}} 175  kg (mean weight 116.7  kg). The mean operating time was 175  min (range: 105 – 360), the longest being on the largest patient who was only the second in the series. The mean postoperative stay was 2.4  days, with one patient with an inadvertent cystotomy (4  days) and the other requiring a suprapubic catheter (12  days). Excessive <b>bleeding</b> from lateral <b>port</b> sites occurred in five (22 %) patients, for which the Endo Close (USSC) was utilized to successfully obtain haemostasis. Four of these five cases were amongst the first seven patients in the series (Table  1). Three patients (11 %) required blood transfusions, again with two being in the first seven of the series. There was one inadvertent bladder perforation during the vaginal aspect of the operation that was attributable to fibrotic endometriosis. The perforation was diagnosed and repaired laparoscopically. Two patients developed vaginal vault infections postoperatively, one with Pseudomonas; both were treated as outpatients with oral antibiotic therapy.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveRobotic {{technology}} {{is a prerequisite for}} performance of totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting. During the implementation phase of totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass, surgeon-related technical difficulties might be encountered. It was the aim of this study to assess the incidence of these challenges, to find risk factors, and to describe clinical results associated with technical errors. MethodsFrom October 2001 through October 2004, 40 patients received robotically assisted totally endoscopic left internal thoracic artery grafts to the left anterior descending coronary artery system with the da Vinci telemanipulation device. All patients underwent remote access cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion through groin access, and all anastomoses were performed on the arrested heart. ResultsUndesirable technical events of various grades occurred in 20 (50 %) of 40 patients: <b>bleeding</b> from a <b>port</b> hole in 3 (8 %), left internal thoracic artery damage in 3 (8 %), epicardial lesion in 3 (8 %), remote access perfusion problems in 9 (23 %), bleeding from the anastomosis in 4 (10 %), and anastomotic stenosis in 2 (5 %). There was no hospital mortality. The following differences were noted between patients without technical difficulties (group 1) and those in whom problems occurred (group 2) : total operative time of 314 minutes (260 - 540 minutes) versus 418 minutes (270 - 690 minutes; P =. 007), ventilation time of 6 hours (0 - 26 hours) versus 14 hours (0 - 278 hours; P =. 004), intensive care unit stay of 20 hours (11 - 70 hours) versus 44 hours (16 - 336 hours; P =. 183), hospital stay of 7 days (4 - 13 days) versus 8 days (5 - 21 days; P =. 038), and cumulative freedom from angina at 36 months of 93 % versus 100 % (P =. 317). ConclusionWe conclude that technical difficulties during totally endoscopic coronary artery bypass grafting translate into markedly increased operative time, moderately prolonged postoperative ventilation time, and slightly increased hospital stay. Short-term survival and freedom from angina, however, {{do not seem to be}} compromised...|$|R
