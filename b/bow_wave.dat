5|$|In 1935, the United States Navy Naval Research Laboratory began {{studies and}} tests on low {{visibility}} camouflage for ships. Some measures were deceptive, like a false painted <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> {{to give the}} impression of high speed at all times. Measures making cruisers resemble destroyers were discontinued after causing station-keeping confusion among ships operating in formation.|$|E
5|$|When {{stars are}} moving at {{sufficiently}} high peculiar velocities, their astrospheres can generate bow shocks as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades {{it was assumed}} that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and NASA's Voyager probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a subsonic <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium. A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the termination shock and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).|$|E
5|$|While these {{guns were}} {{considered}} an improvement by the Navy over {{that of the}} South Carolinas, their placement remained problematic as even in calm water, they were extremely wet and thus difficult to man. The forward guns were moved into the superstructure after sea trials. The casemate-mounted secondary armament was one deck below the main deck and provided {{the majority of the}} complaints from shipping water from the forward positions and breaking the flow of the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> imparting extra drag on the design.|$|E

5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|The United States Navy {{implemented}} a camouflage painting program in World War II, and applied it to many ship classes, from patrol craft and auxiliaries to battleships and some s. The designs (known as Measures, each {{identified with a}} number) were not arbitrary, but were standardised in a process which involved a planning stage, then a review, and then fleet-wide implementation. Not all United States Navy measures involved dazzle patterns; some were simple or even totally unsophisticated, such as a false <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> on traditional Haze Gray, or Deck Blue replacing grey over part {{or all of the}} ship (the latter to counter the kamikaze threat). Dazzle measures were used until 1945; in February 1945 the United States Navy's Pacific Fleet decided to repaint its ships in non-dazzle measures against the kamikaze threat, while the Atlantic Fleet continued to use dazzle, ships being repainted if transferred to the Pacific.|$|E

It was found that the relative effective shapes of the near Martian, Cytherean, and terrestrial bow shocks are ellipsoidal, paraboloidal, and hyperboloidal, respectively, in response to the increasing bluntness of the obstacles that the planets present to the solar wind.

25|$|The fishery of Antarctic krill is on {{the order}} of 100,000tonnes per year. The major {{catching}} nations are South Korea, Norway, Japan and Poland. The products are used as animal food and fish bait. Krill fisheries are difficult to operate in two important respects. First, a krill net needs to have very fine meshes, producing a very high drag, which generates a <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> that deflects the krill to the sides. Second, fine meshes tend to clog very fast.|$|E
25|$|Barges {{were pulled}} by mules along the {{adjacent}} towpath, a power source employed {{even after the}} development of steam engines, since the <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> from a faster steamboat would have damaged the channel. Children were often hired to lead the mules at first; in the canal's later years grown men were employed. They had to walk 15–20 miles (24–32km) a day, pump out the barges and tend the animals. For this they were paid about $3 a month.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the German-built vessels and the 1898 series that {{included}} Brand, was criticized for having insufficient speed. Although considered as having quite good seagoing characteristics, the vessels had difficulty firing torpedoes in rough seas. In calm seas the boats were hard to spot, with little engine noise or <b>bow</b> <b>wave,</b> which increased {{the chance of a}} successful torpedo attack. The boats were also seen as not being manoeuvrable enough, as well as having an exposed bridge in a bow turret and poor ventilation. Some of the issues of the early vessels were dealt with in the last four 1.-class boats built.|$|E
40|$|Observations {{with the}} Spitzer Space Telescope and the WISE {{satellite}} have revealed a prominent arc-like structure at 50 " (≃ 0. 1 pc) from the O 9. 5 V/B 0. 5 V system σ Ori AB. We attribute this dust structure to {{the interaction of}} radiation pressure from the star with dust carried along by the IC 434 photo-evaporative flow of ionized gas from the dark cloud L 1630. We have developed a quantitative model for the interaction of a dusty ionized flow with nearby (massive) stars where radiation pressure stalls dust, piling it up at an appreciable distance (> 0. 1 pc), and force it to flow around the star. The model demonstrates that for the conditions in IC 434, the gas will decouple from the dust and will keep its original flow lines. We argue that this dust structure is the first example of a dust wave created by a massive star moving through the interstellar medium. Dust <b>waves</b> (and <b>bow</b> <b>waves)</b> stratify dust grains according to their radiation pressure opacity, which reflects the size distribution and composition of the grain material. Comparison of our model with observations implies that dust-gas coupling through Coulomb interaction {{is less important than}} previously thought, challenging our understanding of grain dynamics in hot, ionized regions of space. We describe the difference between dust (and <b>bow)</b> <b>waves</b> and classical <b>bow</b> shocks. We conclude that dust <b>waves</b> and <b>bow</b> <b>waves</b> should be common around stars showing the weak-wind phenomenon and that these structures are best observed at mid-IR to FIR wavelengths. In particular, dust <b>waves</b> and <b>bow</b> <b>waves</b> are most efficiently formed around weak-wind stars moving through a high density medium. Moreover, they provide a unique opportunity to study the direct interaction between a (massive) star and its immediate surroundings.

25|$|The Landing Craft Assault's design's sturdy hull, load capacity, low silhouette, shallow draft, little <b>bow</b> <b>wave,</b> and silenced engines {{were all}} assets that benefited the occupants.

Also, many a Tommy and GI looked favourably upon {{the luxury of}} seating in the well for the soldier passengers.

25|$|Krill {{are small}} animals, {{considered}} {{a type of}} zooplankton, and hence need to be fished with fine-meshed plankton nets. Such nets pose several problems: they tend to clog fast, and they have high drag, producing a <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> that deflects the krill to the sides. Trawling must hence be done at low speeds. Additionally, fine nets are delicate, and the first krill nets designed exploded while fishing through the krill schools. Furthermore, fine nets increase unwanted bycatch, such as fish fingerlings, which might have unforeseen side-effects on the ecosystem, even though large krill aggregations tend to be monospecific.|$|E
25|$|Normally, {{the face}} is in the water during front crawl with eyes looking at {{the lower part of}} the wall in front of the pool, with the {{waterline}} between the brow line and the hairline. Breaths are taken through the mouth by turning the head to the side of a recovering arm at the beginning of the recovery, and breathing in the triangle between the upper arm, lower arm, and the waterline. The swimmer's forward movement will cause a <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> with a trough in the water surface near the ears. After turning the head, a breath can be taken in this trough without the need to move the mouth above the average water surface. A thin film of water running down the head can be blown away just before the intake. The head is rotated back at the end of the recovery and points down and forward again when the recovered hand enters the water. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose until the next breath. Breathing out through the nose may help to prevent water from entering the nose. Swimmers with allergies exacerbated by time in the pool should not expect exhaling through the nose to completely prevent intranasal irritation.|$|E

25|$|The two craft {{were brought}} down to Langstone Harbour for {{competitive}} trials. On its trials on a misty morning, {{the noise from}} the two 120hp Chryslers in the Birmabright alloy hull scared some mothers who hurried their children away from the Isle of Wight beaches as the craft came inshore. The conclusions of the trial left no one in doubt. A platoon of Royal Marines disembarked from the Fleming craft in {{a quarter of the}} time taken by the platoon in the Thornycroft, the silhouette of the Fleming craft was less, it created less disturbance when steaming, and it beached better. But, and this was later the deciding factor, the Birmabright craft was so noisy that it meant sacrificing tactical surprise, while it was impossible to mount armour on its sides. The failings of the Thornycroft craft on the other hand could all be overcome. A second prototype from Thornycroft had a double-diagonal mahogany hull with twin engines and those features — low silhouette, quiet engines, little <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> — which appealed to the Centre's staff in their search for a craft that could make surprise landings. The craft beached satisfactorily, a quality retained in all LCA designs, but the troops took too long to disembark across this prototype's narrow ramp. Armour could easily take the place of the outer mahogany planking, the exit could be lowered, the silhouette could be cut down and the engines could be so silenced {{that they would not be}} heard at twenty-five yards. So although the Fleming boat won at the trial, it was the Thornycroft design, duly altered, that became the assault landing craft. A third prototype — ALC No 2 — was therefore built after the DNC had worked with Thornycroft on modifications to the design.|$|E

The following morning, the , commanded by Oberleutnant zur See Hans-Diedrich von Tiesenhausen, detected the faint engine noises of the British ships and moved to intercept. By {{the afternoon}} the submarine and the 1st Battle Squadron were on reciprocal courses and von Tiesenhausen ordered his boat to battle stations around 16:00. An ASDIC operator aboard {{one of the leading}} destroyers, , detected the submarine at 16:18 at an estimated range of , but the contact was disregarded as it subtended an angle between 40 and 60 degrees wide, far larger than a submarine. U-331 thus passed through the screen and was only in a position to fire her torpedoes after the leading ship, Queen Elizabeth, had passed her by and the second ship, Barham, was closing rapidly. Von Tiesenhausen ordered all four bow torpedo tubes fired at a range of [...] at 16:25. Possibly due to her closeness to Valiants <b>bow</b> <b>wave</b> and discharging the torpedoes, the boat's conning tower broached the surface and was fruitlessly engaged by one of the battleship's [...] "pom-pom"s at a range of about [...] The boat dived out of control after she broached, reaching an indicated depth of , well below her design depth of , before she stabilised without any damage.
