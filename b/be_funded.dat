5|$|Rocco Landesman, {{chairperson}} of the National Endowment for the Arts, has used Citygarden {{as an example of}} a successful foundation-funded art venture. Landesman—a former resident of St. Louis—said that such projects can help urban areas economically, but they cannot <b>be</b> <b>funded</b> solely by the federal government, thus requiring assistance from both the private sector and foundations. Michael Van Valkenburgh, principal of a Brooklyn landscape architecture firm, said he was drawn to St. Louis partly because of Citygarden's design and success. Van Valkenburgh was selected in 2010 to renovate the grounds of the Gateway Arch.|$|E
5|$|The {{alleviation}} {{of widespread}} unemployment and hunger in Poplar had to <b>be</b> <b>funded</b> from money {{raised by the}} borough itself under the Poor Law.

Trigg called for other plans and prepared estimates. At a meeting of the committee on 27 February 1839, Trigg submitted a plan designed by Major Frederick Irwin, which was estimated to cost £2,300.

5|$|A new U.S. federal {{government}} began operating in 1789, following the {{ratification of the}} United States Constitution. The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation {{had been unable to}} levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his Report on Public Credit, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would <b>be</b> <b>funded</b> by the {{federal government}}. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other schemes for the {{remainder}} of the below-standard parts of the A303 were considered in the 1990s, including improvements west of Ilminster towards Marsh and the single-carriageway section around Yeovilton. These proposals were all cancelled in 1998. The schemes were remitted to the London to South West and South Wales Multi-Modal Study (SWARMMS), and the conclusion of the report was that all of the schemes east of Ilminster should go ahead; and to avoid building a dual carriageway through the Blackdown Hills the A358 should be upgraded to the M5 at Taunton. In 2009, none were considered to be regional priorities, so no other improvements were likely to <b>be</b> <b>funded</b> in the short term.|$|E
5|$|Amir's {{mother died}} in 1931, and his father the year after, meaning that his {{education}} could no longer <b>be</b> <b>funded.</b> After his AMS studies concluded, he wanted to continue to study at a law school in Batavia.

In 1932 Amir was able to return to Batavia and begin his legal studies, taking up a part-time job as a teacher. At first, his relationship with Sundari was continued through letters, though she soon continued her studies in Lembang, a city much closer than Surakarta; this allowed the two to meet furtively– when Sundari's parents had discovered their relationship, Amir and Sundari had been forbidden from meeting.|$|E

5|$|Further {{investments}} beyond {{construction of}} the new terminal were planned since 2007 for bulk cargo terminal equipment worth €80M, cargo terminal equipment worth €11million, replacement of equipment in pre-2007 port facilities valued at €26million and re{{construction of the}} liquid cargo terminal worth €70million. These investments were originally scheduled for 20072014, but the pace of development is slower than expected, and delays of a year to two had been observed by 2010.
