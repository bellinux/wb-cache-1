40|$|Summary: The {{measurement}} of immunoglobulin concentrations in serum by a turbidimetric method using a centri-fugal analyser (Cobas Bio) is described. In the procedure described {{it is possible}} to measure the absorbance of each sample in the <b>buffer</b> <b>reagent</b> in a preliminary run without antiserum (sample blank for correction of colour, turbidi-ty, etc.) In the main run (after adding antiserum) a final measurement is made after 600 seconds reaction time and the difference between the final absorbance and the sample blank is corrected for the absorbance of the antiserum determined in the antiserum blank cuvet. The initial phase of the reaction can thus be taken into account so that high titre antisera can be used. Therefore the method covers a wide range of values with good precision.

ABSTRACT: Discharges from dairies are very rich in organic matter. 900 m 3 /d of liquid waste is discharged daily by the milk processing unit of the City Rabat / Salè. They are a formidable source of pollution because they contain microorganisms, lactose, protein, vitamins and mineral, in addition the management of these effluents concerned producers and actors of the environment. This work is primarily concerned to the biodegradation of dairy effluent by treatment with fungi. A reactor in batch culture was used in order to study the growth of fungi and removal organic matter. The inoculation is carried out by amplified fungi of the effluent and with unamplified fungi. And to improve the treatment efficiency, the biodegradation was coupled by a <b>buffer</b> <b>reagent</b> LDC 7. The results show that using amplified fungi in presence of LDC 7 reagent induces a high decrease of COD with a percentage of 85 %. In conclusion, the biodegradation of the effluent from the dairy industry using fungi coupled to LDC 7 is a very promising biotechnological process, which is simple, economical and environmentally friendly and {{can contribute to the}} treatment of liquid waste and reduce polluting factors...|$|E

Reanalysis by coulometry showed these results to be spuriously high. Turbidity resulting from precipitation of fibrinogen {{was identified as}} the source of the interference. High concentrations of heparin en-hanced the effect. We conclude that the persistence of fibrinogen in serum samples from patients treated with anticoagulants is a potential interference in Ferrozine dye-binding methods performedwithout prior deprotein-ization. Adding guanidine HCI to the acid <b>buffer</b> <b>reagent</b> is a simple way to eliminate this interference. AddItIonalKeyphrases: Ferrozine hemodialysis analytical error We have observed above-normal concentrations of serum iron (> 90 pmo 1 /L) measured by a commercial direct dye-binding method in some patients undergoing hemodialysis. This artifact did not arise from known interferences such as hemolysis, lipemia (1), iron-dex-tran therapy (2), or the presence of monoclonal immu-noglobulins (3). The use of plasma is known to affect certain iron assays (4), although the mechanism has not been elucidated. Because our patients are given large doses of heparmn during dialysis, we investigated the possibility that the spurious iron results were due to incomplete coagulation of blood samples. The increasing use of heparinized blood samples for clinical analyses has led to reports of interference from fibrinogen and heparin in routine assays (5 - 7).

40|$|Background: Clinical {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} imaging has demonstrated {{the vast majority of}} human cancers exhibit significantly increased glucose metabolism when compared with adjacent normal tissue, resulting in an acidic tumour microenvironment. Recent studies demonstrated reducing this acidity through systemic buffers significantly inhibits development and growth of metastases in mouse xenografts. Methods: We apply and extend a previously developed mathematical model of blood and tumour buffering to examine the impact of oral administration of bicarbonate buffer in mice, and the potential impact in humans. We recapitulate the experimentally observed tumour pHe effect of buffer therapy, testing a model prediction in vivo in mice. We parameterise the model to humans to determine the translational safety and efficacy, and predict patient subgroups who could have enhanced treatment response, and the most promising combination or alternative buffer therapies. Results: The model predicts a previously unseen potentially dangerous elevation in blood pHe resulting from bicarbonate therapy in mice, which is confirmed by our in vivo experiments. Simulations predict limited efficacy of bicarbonate, especially in humans with more aggressive cancers. We predict buffer therapy would be most effectual: in elderly patients or individuals with renal impairments; in combination with proton production inhibitors (such as dichloroacetate), renal glomular filtration rate inhibitors (such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), or with an alternative <b>buffer</b> <b>reagent</b> possessing an optimal pK of 7. 1 - 7. 2. Conclusion: Our mathematical model confirms bicarbonate acts as an effective agent to raise tumour pHe, but potentially induces metabolic alkalosis at the high doses necessary for tumour pHe normalisation. We predict use in elderly patients or in combination with proton production inhibitors or buffers with a pK of 7. 1 - 7. 2 is most promising. © 2012 Cancer Research UK All rights reserved...|$|E

The anodization at 5 V continued for 10 min to allow the equilibration of the barrier layer at the pore bottom. Finally, the template was obtained by a subsequent etching treatment in 5 wt.% phosphoric acid (35 °C) for 30 min. Electrodeposition was performed on LK 98 II electrochemical system (Lanlike, Tianjin, China) using the single-potential-step chronoamperometry technique. In the electrodeposition cell, the OPAA template with Al substrate, Pt plate, and saturated calomel electrode were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively.

Experimental cycle times of 20, 50, and 100 were used for samples Ag 3, Ag 4, and Ag 5, respectively. Sample Cu 1 was electrochemically deposited in a mixture of 0.2 mol/L CuSO 4 and 0.01 mol/L H 3 BO 3 aqueous solutions at − 6.0 V for 400 s. Samples Cu 2, Cu 3, and Cu 4 were electrochemically deposited in a mixture of 0.01 mol/L Cu(NO 3) 2 and 0.1 mol/L H 3 BO 3 aqueous solution at a depositing potential of − 8.5 V with deposition time of 1 s and interval time of 5 s. Experimental cycle times of 150, 200, and 300 were used for samples Cu 2, Cu 3, and Cu 4, respectively.

The ob-tained gold nanoparticles were examined by Ultraviolet–Visible Spectroscopy (UV–vis), Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS) in an aqueous system and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for particle morphologies. UV–vis spectra showed absorption maxima at 530 and 750 nm, depending on the <b>buffer</b> <b>reagents</b> and their concentration, pH, and ionic strength. The size and the surface zeta potential of the formed nanoparticles were 23 to 73 nm and 30 to 12 mV, respectively. The TEM pictures clearly indicated the formation of finely dispersed, chained, or aggregated gold nanoparticles, depending on the experimental conditions. The mechanism of gold nanoparticle formation was studied by the measurements of cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electron spin reso-nance (ESR). MES and HEPES showed a positive anodic peak at approximately þ 800 mV vs Ag/AgCl electrode, which indicated that these buffering agents have mild reducing ability. ESR results indicated the generation of nitrogen-cen-tered cationic free radicals from these Good’s Buffers {{in the presence of}} Au(III), resulting in the formation of gold nano-particles.

40|$|We {{present an}} all-thermoplastic {{integrated}} sample-to-answer centrifugal microfluidic Lab-on-Disc system (LoD) for nucleic acid analysis. The proposed CD system and engineered platform were employed {{for analysis of}} Bacillus atrophaeus subsp. globigii spores. The complete assay comprised cellular lysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, amplicon digestion, and microarray hybridization on a plastic support. The fluidic robustness and operating efficiency of the assay were ensured through analytical optimization of microfluidic tools enabling beneficial implementation of capillary valves and accurate control of all flow timing procedures. The assay reliability was further improved {{through the development of}} two novel microfluidic strategies for reagents mixing and flow delay on the CD platform. In order {{to bridge the gap between}} the proof-of-concept LoD and production prototype demonstration, low-cost thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) was selected as the material for CD fabrication and assembly, allowing the use of both, high quality hot-embossing and injection molding processes. Additionally, the low-temperature and pressure-free assembly and bonding properties of TPE material offer a pertinent solution for simple and efficient loading and storage of reagents and other on-board components. This feature was demonstrated through integration and conditioning of microbeads, magnetic discs, dried DNA <b>buffer</b> <b>reagents</b> and spotted DNA array inserts. Furthermore, all microfluidic functions and plastic parts were designed according to the current injection mold-making knowledge for industrialization purposes. Therefore, the current work highlights a seamless strategy that promotes a feasible path for the transfer from prototype toward realistic industrialization. This work aims to establish the full potential for TPE-based centrifugal system as a mainstream microfluidic diagnostic platform for clinical diagnosis, water and food safety, and other molecular diagnostic applications.
