50|$|The purplish {{honeycreeper}} (Chlorophanes purpurascens), a bird from Venezuela {{known only}} from the type specimen, {{is considered to be}} an intergeneric hybrid between the green honeycreeper and either the red-legged honeycreeper or the <b>blue</b> <b>dacnis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>dacnis</b> or {{turquoise}} honeycreeper (Dacnis cayana) {{is a small}} passerine bird. This {{member of}} the tanager family is found from Nicaragua to Panama, on Trinidad, and in South America south to Bolivia and northern Argentina. It is widespread and often common, especially in parts of its South American range.|$|E
50|$|The <b>blue</b> <b>dacnis</b> is 12.7 cm {{long and}} weighs 13 g. Despite its {{alternative}} name, {{it is not}} a honeycreeper, which are longer-billed. The adult male is turquoise blue with a black around the eyes, and on the throat and back. The wings and tail are black, edged with turquoise. The female and immature are mainly green with a blue head, paler green underparts and green-edged brown wings.|$|E
50|$|These {{are social}} birds which eat mainly insects gleaned from foliage, flowers or bromeliads. Fruit is often taken and usually {{swallowed}} whole, but nectar is rarely consumed. The <b>blue</b> <b>dacnisâ€™s</b> call {{is a thin}} tsip.|$|R
50|$|Threatened and {{vulnerable}} species include West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), pearly parakeet (Pyrrhura lepida), bearded bellbird (Procnias averano), wattled jacana (Jacana jacana) and American purple gallinule (Porphyrula martinica).Other bird species include striated heron (Butorides striata), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), great egret (Ardea alba), ringed kingfisher (Megaceryle torquata), <b>blue</b> <b>dacnis</b> (Dacnis cayana), rufescent tiger heron (Tigrisoma lineatum), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) and white-winged swallow (Tachycineta albiventer).|$|E
50|$|The purplish {{honeycreeper}} (Chlorophanes purpurascens) is {{a bird in}} the Thraupidae, or tanager family. It {{is known}} only from the type specimen, a trade-skin held in the British Museum, and {{is thought to be}} an intergeneric hybrid between the green honeycreeper (Chlorophanes spiza) and either the red-legged honeycreeper (Cyanerpes cyaneus) or the <b>blue</b> <b>dacnis</b> (Dacnis cayana), though Hellmayr, in his Catalogue of birds of the Americas and the adjacent islands, considered it a good species.|$|E
50|$|The green {{honeycreeper}} (Chlorophanes spiza) {{is a small}} bird in the tanager family. It {{is found in the}} tropical New World from southern Mexico south to Brazil, and on Trinidad. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Chlorophanes. The purplish honeycreeper (Chlorophanes purpurascens), a bird from Venezuela known only from the type specimen, is now thought to be an intergeneric hybrid between the {{green honeycreeper}} and either the red-legged honeycreeper or the <b>blue</b> <b>dacnis.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 78 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} from 30 families and 14 orders.Birds include drab-breasted bamboo tyrant (Hemitriccus diops), variable antshrike (Thamnophilus caerulescens), olivaceous woodcreeper (Sittasomus griseicapillus), <b>blue</b> <b>dacnis</b> (Dacnis cayana), blue manakin (Chiroxiphia caudata), robust woodpecker (Campephilus robustus), red-ruffed fruitcrow (Pyroderus scutatus), shrike-like laniisoma (Laniisoma elegans), saffron finch (Sicalis flaveola), wedge-tailed grass finch (Emberizoides herbicola) and yellow-faced siskin (Spinus yarrellii).The insect pachymeroceroides novabadensis, which prefers a very humid environment, was first discovered in the park.|$|E
50|$|Given the fruit's {{attractive}} {{color and}} the conspicuous display at the branch-tips, this tree appears to be distributed by birds which eat the fruit and spread the seeds. Perching birds, namely tanagers (Thraupidae), thrushes (Turdidae) and tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), are most commonly seen to feed on the fruit. Some birds, such as the silver-beaked tanager (Ramphocelus carbo), prune off the seedcoat and eat it, discarding the seed, but most swallow the entire fruit. Species such as the swallow tanager (Tersina viridis) and the pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas), but perhaps most of all the sayaca tanager (Thraupis sayaca), appear to be particularly fond of them. Indeed, the sayaca tanager will defend richly fruiting A. glandulosa trees against similar-sized birds such as the <b>blue</b> <b>dacnis</b> (Dacnis cayana) or the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus). It may be that at least locally, T. sayaca is crucial for the tree's reproduction and survival.|$|E
