5|$|In 1987, yttrium barium {{copper oxide}} {{was found to}} achieve {{high-temperature}} superconductivity. It was only the second material known to exhibit this property, {{and it was the}} first known material to achieve superconductivity above the (economically important) <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of nitrogen.]] for YBCO is 93 K and the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of nitrogen is 77 K.|$|E
5|$|The naphtha cut, as that {{fraction}} is called, {{contains many}} different hydrocarbon compounds. Therefore, {{it has an}} initial <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of about 35°C and a final <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of about 200°C. Each cut produced in the fractionating columns has a different boiling range. At some distance below the overhead, the next cut is withdrawn {{from the side of}} the column and it is usually the jet fuel cut, also known as a kerosene cut. The boiling range of that cut is from an initial <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of about 150°C to a final <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of about 270°C, and it also contains many different hydrocarbons. The next cut further down the tower is the diesel oil cut with a boiling range from about 180°C to about 315°C. The boiling ranges between any cut and the next cut overlap because the distillation separations are not perfectly sharp. After these come the heavy fuel oil cuts and finally the bottoms product, with very wide boiling ranges. All these cuts are processed further in subsequent refining processes.|$|E
5|$|With a {{freezing}} point of 1°C and <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of 106°C, the liquid range of POCl3 is rather similar to water.|$|E
50|$|The <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> of the pentane isomers {{range from}} about 9 to 36 °C. As {{is the case for}} other alkanes, the more thickly {{branched}} isomers tend to have lower <b>boiling</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thus, trans alkenes, {{which are}} less polar and more symmetrical, have lower <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> and higher melting points, and cis alkenes, which are {{generally}} more polar and less symmetrical, have higher <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> and lower melting points.|$|R
50|$|A larger {{difference}} in <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> between the substances also affects the dew and bubble curves of the graph. A larger {{difference in}} <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> creates a larger shift in mass fractions when the mixture boils {{at a given}} temperature.|$|R
5|$|Helium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, {{the first in}} the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> is the lowest among all the elements.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{observations}} proved {{that it is}} actually possible for life to exist at high temperatures and that some bacteria even prefer temperatures higher than the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of water. Dozens of such bacteria are known.|$|E
5|$|The closed-shell {{electron}} configuration of flerovium {{results in the}} metallic bonding in metallic flerovium being weaker than in the preceding and following elements; thus, flerovium {{is expected to have}} a low <b>boiling</b> <b>point,</b> and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal, similar to the predictions for copernicium, which also has a closed-shell {{electron configuration}}. The melting and boiling points of flerovium were predicted in the 1970s to be around 70°C and 150°C, significantly lower than the values for the lighter group 14 elements (those of lead are 327°C and 1749°C respectively), and continuing the trend of decreasing boiling points down the group. Although earlier studies predicted a <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of ~1000°C or 2840°C, this is now considered unlikely because of the expected weak metallic bonding in flerovium and that group trends would expect flerovium to have a low sublimation enthalpy. Recent experimental indications have suggested that the pseudo-closed shell configuration of flerovium results in very weak metallic bonding and hence that flerovium is probably a gas at room temperature with a <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of around −60°C.|$|E
40|$|A {{molecular}} similarity measure {{has been}} used to estimate the normal <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> of a set of 267 haloalkanes with 1 - 4 carbon atoms. Molecular similarity/dissimilarity was quantified in terms of Euclidean distances of molecules in the eight dimensional principal component space derived from fifty-nine topological indices. Correlation coefficients between the experimental and estimated <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> ranged from 0. 854 to 0. 943 in the K-nearest neighbor estimation of <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> using a different number of nearest neighbors (K = 1 - 10, 15, 20, 25) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} parameter, {{which can}} represent molecular structures, is desired to distinguish isomers. In {{a series of}} our studies, the normal <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> {{are found to be}} useful to distinguish isomers. In this study, a branching ratio is introduced to represent molecular structures and the relationship between the branching ratios and the normal <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> for hydrocarbons and alcohols is discussed. It is noted that the experimental normal <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> seem to be more successful to represent the molecular structure differences and therefore to distinguish isomers...|$|R
40|$|An {{empirical}} method for {{estimation of the}} <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> of organic molecules based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations with polarized continuum model (PCM) solvent corrections has been developed. The <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> are calculated as the sum of three contributions. The first term is calculated directly from the structural formula of the molecule, and is related to its effective surface area. The second {{is a measure of}} the electronic interactions between molecules, based on the DFT-PCM solvation energy, and the third is employed only for planar aromatic molecules. The method is applicable to a very diverse range of organic molecules, with normal <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> in the range of − 50 to 500 °C, and includes ten different elements (C, H, Br, Cl, F, N, O, P, S and Si). Plots of observed versus calculated <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> gave R 2 = 0. 980 for a training set of 317 molecules, and R 2 = 0. 979 for a test set of 74 molecules. The role of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in lowering the <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> of certain molecules is quantitatively discussed...|$|R
5|$|The table {{below is}} {{a summary of the}} key {{physical}} properties of the group 12 elements. Very little is known about copernicium, and none of its physical properties have been confirmed except for its <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (tentative).|$|E
5|$|Vessels {{containing}} {{liquid nitrogen}} can condense oxygen from air. The liquid {{in such a}} vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen (<b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> −183°C) as the nitrogen evaporates, and can cause violent oxidation of organic material.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the other rare-earth metals, which usually have antiferromagnetic and/or ferromagnetic properties at low temperatures, ytterbium is paramagnetic at temperatures above 1.0 kelvin. However, the alpha allotrope is diamagnetic. With a melting point of 824°C and a <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of 1196°C, ytterbium has the smallest liquid range of all the metals.|$|E

5|$|The {{melting point}} of {{zirconium}} is 1855°C (3371°F), and the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> is 4371°C (7900°F). Zirconium has an electronegativity of 1.33 on the Pauling scale.

5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure <b>boiling</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the water}} {{remaining}} in the geyser cools back to below the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again. The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser; Strokkur in Iceland erupts {{for a few seconds}} every few minutes, while Grand Geyser in the United States erupts for up to 10minutes every 8–12hours.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{relationship}} between energy calculations and <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> was studied {{on a set}} of fourteen n-alkanes. The correlation analysis clearly showed that the best relationship is not linear. The regression analysis showed that a dose-response logistic function provided a very good agreement between the <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> of alkanes and their heat of formation...|$|R

25|$|Ether {{molecules}} cannot form {{hydrogen bonds}} with each other, resulting in relatively low <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> {{compared to those}} of the analogous alcohols. The difference in the <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> of the ethers and their isomeric alcohols becomes lower as the carbon chains become longer, as the van der Waals interactions of the extended carbon chain dominates over the presence of hydrogen bonding.|$|R
5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single valence electron, it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Many {{properties}} of promethium rely on its position among lanthanides and are intermediate between those of neodymium and samarium. For example, the melting point, {{the first three}} ionization energies, and the hydration energy are greater than those of neodymium and {{lower than those of}} samarium; similarly, the estimate for the <b>boiling</b> <b>point,</b> ionic (Pm3+) radius, and standard heat of formation of monatomic gas are greater than those of samarium and less those of neodymium.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
5000|$|Fluoride {{volatility}} is {{the tendency}} of highly fluorinated molecules to vaporize at comparatively low temperatures. Heptafluorides, hexafluorides and pentafluorides have much lower <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> than the lower-valence fluorides. Most difluorides and trifluorides have high <b>boiling</b> <b>points,</b> while most tetrafluorides and monofluorides fall in between. The term [...] "fluoride volatility" [...] is jargon used particularly {{in the context of}} separation of radionuclides.|$|R

50|$|Thiols {{show little}} {{association}} by hydrogen bonding, both with water molecules and among themselves. Hence, they have lower <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> {{and are less}} soluble in water and other polar solvents than alcohols of similar molecular weight. For this reason also, thiols and corresponding thioether functional group isomers have similar solubility characteristics and <b>boiling</b> <b>points,</b> whereas the same is not true of alcohols and their corresponding isomeric ethers.|$|R
5|$|The heat {{needed for}} geyser {{formation}} comes from magma {{that needs to}} be near the surface of the earth. The fact that geysers need heat much higher than normally found near the earth's surface is the reason they are associated with volcanoes or volcanic areas. The pressures encountered at the areas where the water is heated make the <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of the water much higher than at normal atmospheric pressures.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of lead—at 327.5°C (621.5°F)—is very low {{compared}} to most metals. Its <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> of 1749°C (3180°F) is the lowest among the carbon group elements. The electrical resistivity of lead at 20°C is 192 nanoohm-meters, almost {{an order of magnitude}} higher than those of other industrial metals (copper at 15.43nΩ·m; gold 20.51nΩ·m; and aluminium at 24.15nΩ·m). Lead is a superconductor at temperatures lower than 7.19K; this is the highest critical temperature of all type-I superconductors and the third highest of the elemental superconductors.|$|E
5|$|With {{a minimum}} {{alveolar}} concentration (MAC) of 0.16%, methoxyflurane {{is an extremely}} potent anesthetic agent. It is a powerful analgesic agent at well below full anesthetic concentrations. Because of its low volatility and very high <b>boiling</b> <b>point</b> (104.8°C at 1atmosphere), methoxyflurane has a low vapor pressure at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. It is therefore quite difficult to vaporize methoxyflurane using conventional anesthetic vaporizers.|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} group {{vector space}} (GVS) method {{was developed for}} estimating the normal <b>boiling</b> <b>points</b> and melting points of alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons including their isomers.
