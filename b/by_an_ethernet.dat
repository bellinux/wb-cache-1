40|$|For the {{solutions}} of unsymmetric linear systems of equations, we have proposed an improved {{version of the}} quasi-minimal residual (IQMR) method [21] by using the Lanczos process as a major component combining elements of numerical stability and parallel algorithm design.

The algorithm is derived such that all inner products and matrix-vector multiplications of a single iteration step are independent and communication time required for inner product can be overlapped efficiently with computation time. In this paper, we use the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model to design a fully efficient, scalable and portable parallel IQMR algorithm and to provide accurate performance prediction of the algorithm {{for a wide range}} of architectures including the Cray T 3 D, the Parsytec GC/PowerPlus, and a cluster of workstations connected <b>by</b> <b>an</b> <b>Ethernet.</b> This performance model [...] ...|$|E
