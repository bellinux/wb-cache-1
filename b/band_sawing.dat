Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation, contracted by Frankford Arsenal (...) , has conducted an evaluation of the Goellner carbide billet saw. Chamberlain issued a comprehensive technical report on May, 29 1970. The report concluded that the new sawing concept was superior to the conventional <b>band</b> <b>sawing,</b> cold sawing and other billet severing methods in numerous objectives. Proclaimed advantages included faster cutting speeds, long blade life and improved quality of cutoff interfaces.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWith the {{development}} and application of expensive, difficult to cut metals and metal alloys, the minimization of waste material for final operations has, together {{with the quality of}} the <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> process, become more and more important. As the onset of chatter can have a very detrimental effect {{on the quality of the}} cut, on the quality of the resulting surface, and on process performance in general, the prompt detection of chatter is of high importance. In the paper a multisensory approach is investigated for chatter detection in the <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> process. In the experiments steel workpieces of geometrically different profiles were used. Based on an analysis of the acquired signals of the cutting forces, machine vibrations and emitted sound, a method involving a set of features for the detection of chatter in a cutting regime has been defined. The proposed method is not affected by the workpiece geometry or the process parameters. Analysis of the individual features extracted from the various process signals has been performed for chatter and chatter-free <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> regime classification. The paper presents the results obtained using a cross-validation approach, and summarizes the most informative extracted features with respect to the various process signals...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{takes the}} large <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> machine GB 42500 H as the {{research}} object, and establishes the dynamics models of its various parts. Respectively, the relative research is done from the theoretical modal analysis and the dynamic performance testing.

The paper also studies preliminarily the dynamic characteristics of the large <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> machine GB 42500 H. During the analysis, the models of the parts and the whole are established using the finite element method to optimize the structures of the parts and the whole. That has undoubtedly a very important significance for improving the dynamic performance for the new machine tool’s structure, increasing the processing accuracy, and shortening the development cycle and costs...|$|E
50|$|An IoT-enabled {{intelligent}} system of such cases {{has been demonstrated}} by the NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at University of Cincinnati on a <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> machine in IMTS 2014 in Chicago. <b>Band</b> <b>saw</b> machines are not necessarily expensive, but the <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> belt expenses are enormous since they degrade much faster. However, without sensing and intelligent analytics, it can be only determined by experience when the <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> belt will actually break. The developed prognostics system {{will be able to}} recognize and monitor the degradation of <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> belts even if the condition is changing, so that users will know in near real time when {{is the best time to}} replace <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b> This will significantly improve user experience and operator safety, and save costs on replacing <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> belts before they actually break. The developed analytical algorithms were realized on a cloud server, and was made accessible via the Internet and on mobile devices.|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} {{the results of}} the {{characterization}} of the chatter phenomenon in the <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> process are presented. In particular, the influence of the cutting speed and of the distance between the cutting blade supports on chatter characteristics was investigated. In addition to the cutting forces, and emitted sound, the machine vibrations described by the measured acceleration signals were used to characterize the chatter. Based on an analysis of these signals, a hysteresis of the chatter onset and chatter die out cutting speeds was observed. The observed cutting speed hysteresis indicates that the chatter onset in <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> is caused by a Hopf-like bifurcation, and that cutting speed is a promising parameter for chatter control. Additionally, the strong effect on chatter characteristics of the distance between the cutting blade supports was experimentally confirmed...|$|E

40|$|It is {{said that}} the {{revolution}} speeds of <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> wheels change during sawing by the load acting on the <b>band</b> <b>saw.</b> However, there are few quantitative data on such change during sawing. In this study, the revolution speeds of the <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> wheels were measured precisely with rotary encoders, {{in order to examine}} the influence of sawing condition on the change in revolution speed and the power consumption during sawing. The revolution speeds of <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> wheels decreased along with the start of sawing, and then it resumed closely to the idling revolution speed level. It increased immediately after sawing and then it came down to the idling revolution speed level before sawing. The power consumption increased rapidly simultaneous with the start of sawing and then it decreased gently. After sawing, the power consumption decreased rapidly and then resumed the level for idling. The differences between the maximum and minimum revolution speeds of <b>band</b> <b>saw</b> wheels during sawing increased with an increase in feed speed and also with an increase in depth of workpiece.

40|$|Abstract. The {{two-cylinder}} {{drive is}} one of many commonly used mechanical drive forms. Its synchronous control accuracy determines the movement accuracy of the working machinery. The paper established the mathematical model for the two-cylinder electro-hydraulic servo synchronous drive system, and revealed that the two-cylinder horizontal electro-hydraulic synchronous drive system has the cascade form of the linear system with the nonlinear system. Taking the <b>band</b> <b>sawing</b> machine and the broaching machine as the application object, the paper analyzed their compositions and synchronization CNC systems. Aiming at the dual-cylinder drive form for the broaching machine, the IPSO-PID synchronous controller of the two-cylinder system was designed. Through the digital simulation and actual testing, the results show that the IPSO-PID synchronous controller is faster in the tracking response speed and better in the synchronization performance than the conventional PID synchronization controller...|$|E
