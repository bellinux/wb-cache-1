With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory's flank. Here again, under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell back, but more slowly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> maintain their formation.|$|E
5|$|Despite U.S. {{declarations}} of neutrality and German accountability for its unrestricted submarine warfare, in 1915 the British passenger liner Lusitania was sunk, leading {{to calls for}} war. President Wilson forced the Germans to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare and after long debate Congress passes the Naval Act of 1916 that authorized a $500million construction program over three years for 10 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, 10 scout cruisers, 50 destroyers and 67 submarines. The idea was a balanced fleet, but in the event destroyers were much more important, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> handle submarines and convoys. By {{the end of the}} war 273 destroyers had been ordered; most were finished after World War I ended but many served in World War II. There were few war plans beyond the defense of the main American harbors.|$|E

As Wellington was teasing Álava, he was knocked off his horse when a bullet-sized {{canister}} shot struck his sword hilt. In pain from a badly bruised hip, the British army commander remounted and continued to direct the battle. At this time, Soult realized that Hill's column might cut off his army from the Orthez to Sault-de-Navailles road. He ordered his army to retreat, covered by Villatte, Darmagnac, Rouget and Paris. At first, the tricky withdrawal was conducted in good order, though it was closely followed by British horse artillery and infantry. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> retreat on narrow paths and across country, the retreating French units became badly mixed and unit cohesion was lost. Fearful of capture, the retreating soldiers became more and more confused and demoralized.|$|E

Ålesund had by far the most traffic, about three times that of Molde and Kristiansund. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> operate to three airports in close vicinity, they were unable to operate profitably from any of them.

By the 1830s 10% of the residents of the mostly Roman Catholic town were Jewish, but even they did not give a boost to trade. Because of this, even though the town was the centre of administration, economically and culturally it wasn't really important. Even though it had about 3,500 residents, it had only two primary schools. The cultural centres of the comitatus were Kanizsa and Keszthely.|$|E

25|$|These exorcists, or ahletan hsaya, {{are said}} to possess powers that can fend away or {{challenge}} these evil demons. These exorcists were often seen as very holy, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be to combat troublesome spirits. They attempt exorcisms by giving the nat offerings. As an interesting overlap with Buddhism, exorcisms can be performed by holding the Buddha up to the possessed person, {{in an effort to}} have the Nat flee. If the exorcist cannot banish this spirit alone, they often ask for the assistance of the nat-kadaw. Sorcerers, or weikzas also harnessed the power of these nats through many complex rituals, to gain their own supernatural powers.|$|E
25|$|The Germans in {{the wood}} also {{suffered}} greatly in the hand-to-hand fighting. III Battalion, Infantry Regiment 165 of the 7th Division and part of I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 62 of the 12th Division, were reinforced from the Switch Line by I Battalion, Infantry Regiment 91, early on 23 July. British gunners had difficulty supporting attacks on High Wood, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fire over Bazentin Ridge. The low elevation of the guns meant that shells skimmed the British trenches, the margin for error was small and numerous complaints were made that British infantry casualties were caused by the British artillery. Worn guns, defective ammunition and inaccurate information about the location of British infantry positions were blamed for short-shooting. The 51st Division pushed saps forward on 2 August, towards the Switch Line and dug a new trench near Wood Lane {{to the east of}} High Wood.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Paudash Lake is named after an Indian Chief, there is {{universal}} agreement among anthropologists and archeologists that the Ojibwa tribe of Ontario never established regular settlements in most of Haliburton. This was not simply due to the Indians' nomadic habits, but also due to the extremely long and harsh winters {{and the lack of}} major rivers bisecting the area for transportation. Another significant influence was {{the fact that}} the lakes in Haliburton were not a major food source. But this is actually irrelevant because it is common knowledge among Ojibwa themselves and among scholars of other aboriginal hunter-fisher-gatherer peoples, that they did not establish permanent settlements <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> move from one site of hunting-fishing-gathering to another and stayed only as long as needed. (It would be analogous to how modern sports fishermen try one lake and another, one spot and another.) But this has nothing to do with naming. As with the Eels Lake and Jacks Lake south of Paudash, it was the practice of early settlers - when the Indian presence still had strength - to name lakes after the apparent dominant Indian clan or extended family patriarch or chief. Jack's Lake was named after Jack Cow and Eels Lake after Eel Cow. It follows that settlers experienced the visits now and then of the Paudash family at Paudash Lake and that was how the name was established.|$|E

500|$|The {{experience}} of these crewmen in the UK {{was such that}} historian Zachary Morgan believes {{that it was a}} pivotal formative period in shaping the later mutiny. The sailors were paid on time, in cash, and received extra money <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> buy their own meals; because of the vital role these sailors played in Newcastle's local economy, they faced comparatively little racism; and the Armstrong shipyard workers unionized and even successfully went on strike during this time, delaying the completion of the new Brazilian warships. Moreover, they were able to observe their British Royal Navy counterparts—an experience that Morgan says would have been [...] "jarring" [...] because these sailors [...] "were no longer impressed, no longer lashed, [...] were accepted as citizens." ...|$|E

Parker wanted actors who could play a musical instrument and resembled the characters from the novel. He said, [...] "I would stop kids busking (performing for change) on the streets and call them in to audition... we had to choose kids who were quite talented, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> play musicians who were awful at first, but gradually improved." ...|$|E

In 2004, Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days reaching Monte Roraima by airplane, jeep, and helicopter. They spent three nights there painting and sketching, and encountering ants, mosquitoes, scorpions, frogs, and snakes. They also flew to Matawi Tepui and climbed to Angel Falls. Docter felt [...] "we couldn't use [...] Reality is so far out, if we {{put it in the}} movie you wouldn't believe it." [...] The film's creatures were also challenging to design <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fit in the surreal environment of the tepuis, but also be realistic because those mountains exist in real life. The filmmakers visited Sacramento Zoo to observe a Himalayan monal for Kevin's animation.
