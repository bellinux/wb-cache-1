25|$|Apheresis {{platelets}} {{are collected}} using a mechanical device that draws {{blood from the}} donor and centrifuges the collected blood to separate out the platelets and other components to be collected. The remaining blood is returned to the donor. The advantage to this method is that a single donation provides at least one therapeutic dose, {{as opposed to the}} multiple donations for whole-blood platelets. This means that a recipient is not exposed to as many different donors and has less risk of transfusion-transmitted disease and other complications. Sometimes a person such as a cancer patient who requires routine transfusions of platelets will receive repeated donations from a specific donor to further minimize the risk. Pathogen reduction of platelets using for example, riboflavin and UV light treatments can also be carried out to reduce the infectious load of pathogens contained in donated blood products, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of transfusion transmitted diseases. Another photochemical treatment process utilizing amotosalen and UVA light has been developed for the inactivation of viruses, bacteria, parasites, and leukocytes that can contaminate blood components intended for transfusion. In addition, apheresis platelets tend to contain fewer contaminating red blood cells because the collection method is more efficient than “soft spin” centrifugation at isolating the desired <b>blood</b> <b>component.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background. As {{neonates}} {{are among}} the most frequent recipients of <b>blood</b> <b>components,</b> they are exposed to large numbers of blood donors. This, and particularly their immune immaturity, puts them at high risk of posttransfusion complications. When preparing <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> for neonates, we try to make the components as safe as possible, decreasing the neonate’s exposition to a large number of blood donors. We wanted to know whether our attempts to reach this aim by applying filtration for all <b>blood</b> <b>components,</b> concentrated erythrocytes, fresh frozen plasma and thrombocyte concentrate was successful. The <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> were divided into small doses using the method of sterile connection and assuring the components of a single donor. Methods. Whole blood was filtered within 6 hours after withdrawal in the closed blood-bag system – in line filtration. Filtered concentrated erythrocytes and filtered fresh frozen plasma are thus obtained. Thrombocyte plasma is filtered on order. Using sterile connection, the bags for further division of <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> are then connected to the bags with the individual <b>blood</b> <b>components.</b> Results. In the past year, 62 neonates received two or more <b>blood</b> <b>components.</b> They received a total of 383 transfusions, an average of 6. 17 <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> per infant. Altogether, the neonates received the <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> of 214 <b>blood</b> donors and were exposed to 3. 45 donors on the average. The range of the number of donors, whose <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> were received by the infants, was between one and up to 24 donors, to which two infants were exposed. Conclusions.   At our department we follow the recommendations of the European Council. All <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> for neonates are filtered, and from one donor if possible. We were extremely successful in decreasing the exposition of the neonates to large numbers of blood donors. Instead of those of 383 blood donors, the infants received the <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> of only 214 blood donors. The exposition was thus decreased by 55. 9 %. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{establish}} {{the rate of}} HGV/GB virus C (GBV-C) transmission by <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> in open-heart surgery patients. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: From 55 patients receiving <b>blood</b> <b>components,</b> sera were collected before and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 26, and 32 weeks after heart surgery. Serum samples from patients and implicated blood donations were tested for HGV/GBV-C RNA by PCR. Recipients of RNA-positive <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> were also tested {{for the presence of}} E 2 antibodies (E 2 Ab) by ELISA. RESULTS: Of 55 recipients, 18 received RNA-positive <b>blood</b> <b>components.</b> Of 14 recipients of RNA-positive <b>blood</b> <b>components,</b> who were negative for RNA or E 2 Ab before transfusion, 8 became RNA positive and one developed E 2 Ab after transfusion. Three recipients of RNA-positive <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> had E 2 Ab before transfusion, and none of these became RNA positive after transfusion. One of 18 recipients was RNA positive before and after transfusion. Of 55 recipients, 37 received RNA-negative blood components: 34 were RNA negative before and after transfusion. Of 37 recipients, 3 were RNA positive before and after transfusion. CONCLUSION: Of susceptible patients, 64 percent became infected with HGV/GVC-C when transfused with RNA-positive <b>blood</b> <b>components.</b> E 2 Ab-positive patients were protected against HGV/GBV-C infectio...|$|R

MethodsOne hundred and thirteen patients were evaluated retrospectively. Several variables, including the use of <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> intraoperatively and throughout hospitalization, were categorized and evaluated by univariate analysis using Fisher's test. A level of significance of 5 % was adopted. Results with p < 0. 2 underwent multivariate analysis using multinomial logistic regression.

Unlike the intraoperative use of <b>blood</b> <b>components,</b> the accumulated transfusion of packed red blood cell, frozen fresh plasma, and platelets during the entire hospitalization was associated with greater five-year mortality after liver transplantation (p < 0. 01).

Material and Methods: This retrospective clinical audit conducted at NKP salve institute of medical sciences & research center & lata mangeshkar hospital Nagpur for a period of 3 months from April 2013 to June 2013. A retrospective analysis of <b>blood</b> and its <b>component</b> requisitions in all patients from different clinical departments was reviewed regarding diagnosis, indication for transfusion, number of units requested and the speciality prescribing it.

Total number of <b>blood</b> <b>components</b> distribution request was 1188. 632 were for whole blood, 364 were for packed red cells, 182 were for FFP and 10 for platelet concentrate.
