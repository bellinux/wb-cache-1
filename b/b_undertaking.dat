Whilst simulation techniques are commonly used to estimate future degradation and service of physical infrastrucutre according to their sensitivity to various environmental parameters (such as depth of high tide, temperature, wetting and drying cycles etc), {{there has been no}} consideration of the altered levels of vulnerability and exposure that will result from a changing climate. This knowledge deficiency also applies to life cycle modelling which provides an important evidence base for divisions affecting the protection and mainenance of different forms of sea{{port infrastructure}}s.

40|$|AbstractSeismicity {{produced}} by human activities (i. e. induced seismicity) {{has been widely}} reported over the last 40 years. To date few induced earthquakes have been recorded at CO 2 storage sites, however, the volumes of injected CO 2 {{and the number of}} operational sites are small. A review of induced seismicity from different types of fluid injection and extraction sites confirms that these events are typically ≤ 4. 5 in magnitude (M) and in many cases have no reported earthquakes. Although the size (and associated risks) of induced earthquakes at CO 2 storage sites is most likely to be small, these events could decrease seal integrity or raise public concerns, while rare larger events (>M 5) could also have ramifications for CCS beyond a single site. These risks can be reduced by careful site selection and development of site-specific risk reduction and mitigation programmes. Forecasts of induced seismicity using physical and statistical models and real-time monitoring will be key planning and decision making tools. The utility of monitoring and mitigation programmes will be maximized by establishing prior to injection, site performance and management guidelines for acceptable levels of induced seismicity, and agreed control measures. Further improvements to risk management practices, understanding induced seismicity processes and stakeholder confidence may be achieved by; a) increasing the number of publically available induced earthquake catalogues for development and testing of physical and statistical models, <b>b)</b> <b>undertaking</b> more systematic studies of individual sites populated by well constrained sub-surface geomechanical information and seismicity data complete down to small magnitudes (e. g., M- 3), c) enhancing the physical reality of numerical dynamic models, d) studying the scaling effects of seismicity associated with moving from pilot projects to full commercial implementation of CO 2 storage, e) developing standard risk management procedures and guidelines for induced seismicity at CCS sites and,f) filling induced seismicity knowledge gaps in the CCS community by collaborating with seismologists and modellers working in other industries...|$|E

40|$|AIM: This {{paper is}} a report of an {{integrative}} literature review to investigate: (a) the extent of entrepreneurial activity by nurses, midwives and health visitors in the United Kingdom and (b) the factors that influenced these activities. BACKGROUND: Internationally, social and commercial entrepreneurial activity is regarded as important for economic growth and social cohesion. METHODS: Seventeen bibliographic databases were searched using single and combined search terms: 'entrepreneur$', 'business', 'private practice', 'self-employ$', 'intrapreneur$''social enterprise$''mutuals', 'collectives', 'co-op' and 'social capital' which were related to a second layer of terms 'Nurs$', 'Midwi$', 'Visit$'. 'Entrepreneur$' Private Midwi$, Independent Midwi$, and 'nursing workforce'. In addition, hand searches of non-indexed journals and grey literature searches were completed. The following inclusion criteria were: (a) describing nurses, midwife and/or health visitor entrepreneurship (<b>b)</b> <b>undertaken</b> in the UK, and (c) reported between January 1996 and December 2005. RESULTS: Of 154 items included only three were empirical studies; the remainder were narrative accounts. While quality of these accounts cannot be verified, they provide as complete an account as possible in this under-researched area. The numbers of nurses, midwives and health visitors acting entrepreneurially were very small and mirror international evidence. A categorization of entrepreneurial activity was inductively constructed by employment status and product offered. 'Push' and 'pull' influencing factors varied between types of entrepreneurial activity. CONCLUSION: Empirical investigation into {{the extent to which}} nurses and midwives respond to calls for greater entrepreneurialism should take account of the complex interplay of contextual factors (e. g. healthcare legislation), professional and managerial experience and demographic factors...|$|R

40|$|Interactive {{management}} flight simulators {{are becoming}} increasingly common {{as a tool for}} teaching key concepts in management and related fields. Advocates of flight simulators suggest that the active engagement of students with experimentation and game play may even lead to enhanced systems thinking capabilities. Through this thesis, I undertake an experiment to test this proposition, recruiting respondents from Amazon's Mechanical Turk online workforce. Using a three-group pretest-post-test design, I randomly assign respondents to complete one of the following: a) Read a report describing the results of the simulator, including actual screenshots from the simulator, to convey the same information about the AFV market in a conventional style (the control group). <b>b)</b> <b>Undertake</b> tasks using an interactive management flight simulator about the diffusion of alternative fuel vehicles given instructions but no results (treatment one) and c) Undertake the same tasks using an interactive management flight simulator about the diffusion of alternative fuel vehicles, with the aid of the report that also explains the results expected (treatment two). The simulator was built on several key concepts of system dynamics applied to alternative fuel vehicle market: the concept of consumer acceptance, platform utility, stocks and flows and the effects of time delays in a system's behavior. The results of this experiment demonstrate that the groups which used simulator (treatment 1 and 2) developed at least similar and in some cases, better understanding of the AFV market dynamics. I conclude that simulators can be an effective way to teach complex system dynamics principles and socio-technical interactions. by Shishir Tiwari. Thesis: S.

The DCPP {{makes use of}} past experience in simulating and predicting decadal variability and forced climate change gained from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP 5) and elsewhere. It builds on recent improvements in models, in the reanalysis of climate data, in methods of initialization and ensemble generation, and in data treatment and analysis to propose an extended comprehensive decadal prediction investigation as a contribution to CMIP 6 (Eyring et al., 2016) and to the WCRP Grand Challenge on Near Term Climate Prediction (Kushnir et al., 2016). The DCPP consists of three components. Component A comprises the production and analysis of an extensive archive of retrospective forecasts {{to be used to}} assess and understand historical decadal prediction skill, as a basis for improvements in all aspects of end-to-end decadal prediction, and as a basis for forecasting on annual to decadal timescales.

The results of the first study demonstrated that consumers were satisfied with the program and that 83. 2 % achieved stability in accommodation {{by the end of the}} program. Further the program was successful in significantly reducing inpatient bed days during the program as compared to the six months prior and this reduction was sustained for the six month period post program. Results also demonstrated that functioning (self-rated by the MHI and clinically rated by the HoNOS, LSP- 16 and FoC) improved pre- to post-program but that this effect was significant for clinical rated measures only (HoNOS and FoC). The findings also suggested that clinical and consumer measures overlapped in statistically meaningful ways. However, this overlap was not sufficient to predict reductions in inpatient bed days. The second study, an initial validation of the STORI for use within the program, provided support for the internal consistency and construct validity of the measure. Further, results also showed a sequential pattern of correlations between stage scores of the STORI. These findings were in keeping with those of a UK validation of the STORI (Weeks et al., 2011). In addition, results indicated that whilst recovery (as measured by the STORI) was not synonymous with clinical functioning (as measured by the HoNOS and LSP, there were domains where they interacted in statistically significant ways.
