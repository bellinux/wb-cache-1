50|$|In boating, a fender is {{a bumper}} used {{to absorb the}} kinetic energy of a <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessel</b> {{berthing}} against a jetty, quay wall <b>or</b> other <b>vessel.</b> Fenders, used on all types of vessels, from cargo ships to cruise ships, ferries and personal yachts, prevent damage to vessels and berthing structures. To do this, fenders have high energy absorption and low reaction force. Fenders are typically manufactured out of rubber, foam elastomer or plastic. Rubber fenders are either extruded or made in a mold. The type of fender that is most suitable for an application depends on many variables, including dimensions and displacement of the vessel, maximum allowable stand-off, berthing structure, tidal variations and other berth-specific conditions. The size of the fender unit {{is based on the}} berthing energy of the vessel which is related to the square of the berthing velocity.|$|R

He, the policeman, having resolved to make his escape, and being, in virtue of his wise, wily, and constabular nature, well able to do so, had mentioned the circumstance to the young lady, and, under promise of a handsome reward, had agreed to travel and voyage, night and day, by <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessel,</b> as fortune should favour him, in order to convey immediate intelligence of these facts to a youth named [...] "Eggirbringting," [...] whom the young lady described as being very tall and stout, and extremely handsome.|$|R

50|$|Water {{transport}} is {{the process}} of transport that a watercraft, such as a barge, <b>boat,</b> ship <b>or</b> sailboat, makes over a body of water, such as a sea, ocean, lake, canal or river. If a <b>boat</b> <b>or</b> other <b>vessel</b> can successfully pass through a waterway it is known as a navigable waterway. The need for buoyancy unites watercraft, and makes the hull a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance. When a boat is floating on the water the hull of the boat is pushing aside water where the hull now is, this is known as displacement.|$|R

There was a citadel at Samos, to which the inhabitants retired when they learned that Otanes had embarked his troops in ships on the coast, and was advancing toward the island.

He had a subterranean and secret passage from the citadel to the shore of the sea, where, in a secluded cove, were <b>boats</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessels</b> ready to take him away. Having made these arrangements to secure his own safety, he proceeded to take such a course and adopt such measures as should tend most effectually to exasperate and offend the Persians, intending to escape, himself, at the last moment, by this subterranean retreat, and to leave the inhabitants of the island at the mercy of their infuriated enemies.|$|R

The immense green fields, with herds of cattle and flocks of sheep feeding every where, and separated from each other by straight and narrow canals instead of fences; the boats passing to and fro, loaded with produce; the little bridges built over these canals here and there, for the foot paths, with the gates across them to keep the cattle from going over; the long road ways raised upon dikes, and bordered by quadruple rows of ancient and venerable trees, stretching to a boundless distance across the plains; and now and then a wide canal, with large <b>boats</b> <b>or</b> <b>vessels</b> passing to and fro,--these and a multitude of other such sights, to be seen in no other country in the world, occupied their attention all the time, and kept them constantly amused.|$|R

A ship, <b>boat,</b> <b>vessel</b> <b>or</b> any other floating structure which has good seakeeping ability is said to be very seaworthy and is able to operate effectively even in high sea states. This paper presents an investigation of the seakeeping behaviour of a fast ferry multihull, which is a typical trimaran for operations in the mediterranean sea. Numerical results and the measurements at the trimaran agree quite well in frequency and time domain. The movements in trimaran ships are less than the movements of a conventional boat (monohull) equivalent. Assuming linearity, the trimaran’s raos (Response Amplitude Operator) depend only on the trimaran’s geometry, speed and heading. Although seakeeping theory has been extensively applied for monohulls, such studies have not been accomplished for trimarans. This paper provides important information regarding the seakeeping of trimaran ships and how to be used in numerous scenarios...|$|R
