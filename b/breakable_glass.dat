25|$|A Molotov {{cocktail}} is a <b>breakable</b> <b>glass</b> bottle {{containing a}} flammable substance such as gasoline, alcohol or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually {{a source of}} ignition such as a burning cloth wick {{held in place by}} the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene, rather than petrol.|$|E
25|$|The Molotov {{cocktail}} is {{a generic}} name {{used for a}} variety of improvised incendiary weapons. Due to the relative ease of production, they are frequently used by amateur protesters and non-professionally equipped fighters in urban guerrilla warfares. They are primarily intended to set targets ablaze rather than instantly destroy them. A Molotov cocktail is a <b>breakable</b> <b>glass</b> bottle containing a flammable substance such as gasoline/petrol or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually a source of ignition such as a burning cloth wick held in place by the bottle's stopper. The wick is usually soaked in alcohol or kerosene, rather than gasoline.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of the Envoy XUV over a pickup truck or a more truck-like configuration such as the Chevrolet Avalanche (which originated the MidGate feature) is that with retractable roof and rear glass closed, the cargo area is sealed, full roof height and lockable, thus making it an enclosed SUV. The disadvantages include a much shorter cargo bed area and <b>breakable</b> side <b>glass.</b> The Envoy XUV's retractable roof was reminiscent of the Studebaker Wagonaire of the 1960s, while other features such as the 'MidGate' {{were similar to those}} of the GMC Terracross concept SUV.|$|R
50|$|Butt plugs {{normally}} have a flared base to prevent complete insertion {{and should be}} carefully sanitized before and after use. Sex toys, including objects for rectal insertion, should not be shared {{in order to minimize}} the risk of disease. Objects such as lightbulbs or anything <b>breakable</b> such as <b>glass</b> or wax candles cannot safely be used in anal masturbation, as they may break or shatter, causing highly dangerous medical situations.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} the condition of outdoor sculptures in ASEAN Sculpture Garden. This objective is to find out the details of the conditions of outdoor sculptures in ASEAN Sculpture Garden and identify any visible damages and to determine the condition in order to make recommendations for the conservation plan. The research questions are: How is the condition of outdoor sculptures in ASEAN Sculpture Garden? Is there any visible damage? What are the rates of condition of outdoor sculptures in ASEAN Sculpture Garden? Is it good, poor or at risk condition? Are there any recommendations for the conservation plan? Data is collected from condition survey through on-site documentation "and condition survey. All population of outdoor sculptures in ASEAN Sculpture Garden is selected as study samples. Six works of outdoor sculptures in ASEAN Sculpture Garden are assessed in order to identify the current conditions. The works are The Gate of Harmony, Progress, The ASEAN Dance, Growth, Barong-Barong, and Towards Peace. Data is analyzed in chronologically into six categories. Each category contains a series of tables with descriptive texts and pictures. The results of condition of outdoor sculptures in ASEAN Sculpture Garden indicate that The Gate of Harmony, Progress, The ASEAN Dance, Growth, and Towards Peace in fair condition and not at risk. However, Barong-Barong is identified as in poor condition and at risk. Recommendations for conservation plan are made for ways to stabilize the conditions of the outdoor sculptures in ASEAN Sculpture Garden. These included detailed assessment, urgent treatment, and substantial research on the deterioration of the objects. This study's conclusions indicate that the forms of damage such as water collect, cracks surfaces, broken glasses or biological attack resulting the outdoor sculptures in fair and poor conditions after being exposed to almost all of the factors that cause damage and deterioration for over 15 years. Most of the sculpture structures forms and the materials used are bound to rust, to collect water and <b>breakable</b> <b>glasses</b> over a period of time. Therefore, the best way to protect the lives of outdoor sculptures is to give awareness to artist to use the correct materials and use appropriate structure forms in the creation of outdoor sculpture in order to prevent further deterioration...|$|R
500|$|These {{technical}} limitations forced Cerny {{to simplify}} the overall designs. Inspired by M. C. Escher, he designed abstract landscapes for the courses. In retrospect, Cerny partly attributed the designs to his limited artistic skills. He was {{a fan of the}} 3D graphics used in Battlezone and I, Robot, but felt that the visuals lacked definition and wanted to create a game with [...] "solid and clean" [...] 3D graphics. Unlike most other arcade games of the time, the course images were not drawn on the pixel level. Instead, Cerny defined the elevation of every point in the course, and stored this information in a heightmap array. The course graphics were then created by a ray tracing program that traced the path of light rays, using the heightmap to determine the appearance of the course on screen. This format also allowed Cerny to create shadows and use spatial anti-aliasing, a technique that provided the graphics with a smoother appearance. Cerny's course generator allowed him more time to experiment with the level designs. When deciding what elements to include in a course, practicality was a big factor; elements that would not work or would not appear as intended were omitted, such as an elastic barricade or a teeter-totter scale. Other ideas dropped from the designs were <b>breakable</b> <b>glass</b> supports, black hole traps, and bumps and obstacles built into the course that chased the marble.|$|E

40|$|Research about Libyan female {{leadership}} is scarce. This thesis {{is the first}} qualitative study to explore, describe and explain the experiences and perspectives of Libyan female leaders in senior positions, within the Ministries of Education and Health. It introduces a deep study, rich in information which reflects the female leadership phenomenon that has been never done before in the Libyan context. A qualitative methodology, semi-structured interviews and a narrative approach were selected. This provided the researcher with a deep insight into the individual's stories. This research also used Multifactor questionnaire as a supporting instrument. One of the contributions of this thesis is its investigation {{of the role of}} `Glass Ceiling', `Glass Cliff concepts among Libyan female leaders. Both concepts in practice work slightly different, because of the Arabic concept of Wasta. Wasta relates to social relationships can have a negative impact making the glass ceiling harder to break and glass cliff more risky. However it can also have a positive impact making the glass ceiling more easily <b>breakable</b> and <b>glass</b> cliff less risky. A further contribution is the application of a feminist and constructiyist research philosophy which currently appears to be unique in Libyan studies. In addition, this thesis illustrated the support of Islam and Libyan leader Muammer AlGaddfi for women. This makes Libya different from other Arabic and Muslim countries. This thesis challenged the perception in Western literature that Arabic women are invisible in many Arabic countries; by providing evidence of senior women leaders and their experiences or voices being recorded. The Libyan female leaders stated that they tend to apply different leadership styles which could be interpreted as being in the transactional transformational distribution and authentic leadership traditions. Concepts of power, leader -manager differences, situations such as family circumstances and national cultures were explored to help the researcher to interpret and understand the stories of Libyan female leaders...|$|R
60|$|He {{finished}} his day's work {{and got on}} a tram {{to go back to}} Kennington. He wondered how Mildred would behave that evening. It was a nuisance to think that she would probably be surly and refuse to answer his questions. It was a warm evening for the time of year, and even in those gray streets of South London there was the languor of February; nature is restless then after the long winter months, growing things awake from their sleep, and there is a rustle in the earth, a forerunner of spring, as it resumes its eternal activities. Philip would have liked to drive on further, it was distasteful to him {{to go back to his}} rooms, and he wanted the air; but the desire to see the child clutched suddenly at his heartstrings, and he smiled to himself as he thought of her toddling towards him with a crow of delight. He was surprised, when he reached the house and looked up mechanically at the windows, to see that there was no light. He went upstairs and knocked, but got no answer. When Mildred went out she left the key under the mat and he found it there now. He let himself in and going into the sitting-room struck a match. Something had happened, he did not at once know what; he turned the gas on full and lit it; the room was suddenly filled with the glare and he looked round. He gasped. The whole place was wrecked. Everything in it had been wilfully destroyed. Anger seized him, and he rushed into Mildred's room. It was dark and empty. When he had got a light he saw that she had taken away all her things and the baby's (he had noticed on entering that the go-cart was not in its usual place on the landing, but thought Mildred had taken the baby out;) and all the things on the washing-stand had been broken, a knife had been drawn cross-ways through the seats of the two chairs, the pillow had been slit open, there were large gashes in the sheets and the counterpane, the looking-glass appeared to have been broken with a hammer. Philip was bewildered. He went into his own room, and here too everything was in confusion. The basin and the ewer had been smashed, the looking-glass was in fragments, and the sheets were in ribands. Mildred had made a slit large enough to put her hand into the pillow and had scattered the feathers about the room. She had jabbed a knife into the blankets. On the dressing-table were photographs of Philip's mother, the frames had been smashed and the glass shivered. Philip went into the tiny kitchen. Everything that was <b>breakable</b> was broken, <b>glasses,</b> pudding-basins, plates, dishes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine is}} an {{enhanced}} {{variant of the}} Wolfenstein 3D engine. The level design is chiefly characterized by 90 degree walls and unvarying floor and ceiling heights in individual maps, limitations that are vestiges of the Wolfenstein 3D engine. However, the Rise of the Triad engine pioneered myriad features which would be found in many later games, such as panoramic skies, simulated dynamic lighting, fog, bullet holes, <b>breakable</b> <b>glass</b> walls, and level-over-level environments (made possible by [...] "gravitational anomaly disks", suspended objects that collectively form stairs, floors, etc.).|$|E
