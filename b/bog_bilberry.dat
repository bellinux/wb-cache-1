5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador tea is the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common bilberry and <b>bog</b> <b>bilberry</b> are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E

5000|$|The {{names of}} {{blueberries}} in languages other than English often translate as [...] "blueberry", e.g., Scots blaeberry and Norwegian blåbær. Blaeberry, blåbær and French myrtilles usually {{refer to the}} European native bilberry (V. myrtillus), while bleuets refers to the North American blueberry. Russian голубика ("blue berry") does not refer to blueberries, which are non-native and nearly unknown in Russia, but rather to their close relatives, <b>bog</b> <b>bilberries</b> (V. uliginosum).|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the villagers}} live a {{subsistence}} lifestyle, {{which means that they}} continue to carry out the traditional hunter-gatherer activities of their ancestors. One of the foods that they rely on is fish such as halibut, salmon, and herring, which are dried and eaten like jerky. Berries such as salmonberries (cloudberries), black berries (crowberries), and blueberries (<b>bog</b> <b>bilberries)</b> are also gathered and used to prepare akutaq. Other native foods that are gathered include mousefood, Labrador tea, and greens such as sourdock.|$|R
25|$|In {{the zones}} most subject to inundations, {{conifers}} are more rare, {{since they do}} not like in general the wetter zones. In these forests, one can find broadleaf trees such as the aspen, very common in the Lower Dalälven, but rare {{in the rest of the}} country. These forests also have English oaks and small-leaved lindens and the wetter forests are mostly made up of alders, birch trees and willows. The richness of these forests and in particular their undergrowth depends above all on the nature of the soil. The poorer soils grow blueberries, <b>bog</b> <b>bilberries,</b> wild rosemary and cloudberry, whereas the richer soils are home in particular to Lily of the valley, woodland strawberries, purple small-reed and yellow loosestrife.|$|R

50|$|The raised bogs in the Harz {{are some}} of the best {{preserved}} in central Europe. They were formed at the end of the last ice age about 10,000 years ago. A significant proportion of the vegetation on these raised bogs is made up of peat mosses (Sphagnum spec.). The flarks (Schlenken) and the hummocks (Bulten) are home to different species of flora. In the flarks, for example, Sphagnum cuspidatum is found, whereas the hummocks are preferred by Sphagnum magellanicum. The blanket of peat moss is penetrated by dwarf bushes such as cowberry and blueberry. Bog-rosemary (Andromeda polifolia) is a relict of the ice age. Other such ice age plants include the dwarf birch (Betula nana) and few-flowered sedge (Carex pauciflora). Cranberries (Vaccinium oxicoccus) bloom from May to June. The black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) may also be seen amongst those bearing black fruit. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) grows on the drier hummocks and occasionally the cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix) may be found. Typical grasses are the sheathed cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum), known for its bright, white clusters of fruit and deergrass (Scirpus cespitosus), which is rust-red in the autumn. One fascinating moorland plant is the round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia). <b>Bog</b> or northern <b>bilberry</b> (Vaccinium uliginosum) grows on the drier margins of the bog.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{intensive}} peat cutting, {{the water}} {{balance of the}} area was disturbed, resulting {{in the death of}} some plant species. Today, cranberry and <b>bog</b> <b>bilberry</b> from the North European tundra still colonise the bog. The predominant species, however, is bog pine, but some silver birch and spruce trees have also established themselves. The bog pine stems from the mountain pine of the high mountains. In the Georgenfelder Hochmoor it is usually found as a knee-high shrub, a mountain pine or a crooked pine. These forms of growth are perfectly adapted to the harsh climate of this mountain range. Blueberries, heathers and cranberries {{can be found on the}} dry terrain. The sheath cottongrass, by contrast, has colonized the wet spots.|$|E

50|$|Inocybe geophylla {{is common}} and {{widespread}} across Europe and North America. In western North America {{it is found}} under live oak, pine and Douglas fir. Both varieties {{are found in the}} Canadian Arctic regions of northern Manitoba and North West Territories, with the nominate form found in dryish tundra heath communities composed of American dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa), Arctic willow (Salix arctica), dwarf willow (S. herbacea), polar willow (S. polaris ssp. pseudopolaris), snow willow (Salix reticulata), <b>bog</b> <b>bilberry</b> (Vaccinium uliginosum var. alpinum), lingonberry (V. vitis-idaea var. minus), alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina), alpine bistort (Persicaria vivipara), Arctic bell-heather (Cassiope tetragona) and northern white mountain avens (Dryas integrifolia) and var. lilacina in moist mossy tundra heaths, alongside such plants as American dwarf birch, snow willow, Arctic bell-heather and northern white mountain avens. It is mycorrhizal, the fruiting bodies are found in deciduous and coniferous woodlands in summer and autumn. Within these locations, fruiting bodies may be found in grassy areas and near pathways, or often on rich, bare soil that has been disturbed at roadsides, and near ditches.|$|E
50|$|Trees and grasses are not {{the only}} {{vegetation}} in the dunes though. The sandy dune heaths in Thy National Park are a rare habitat in a European context, and they are to be protected by law, so they have been a major contributory factor in establishing the national park. It is a continuous job trying to preserve them from invading flora. The larger animals are grazing excess vegetation, trees are sometimes uprooted and controlled burning is carried out occasionally, to give the sandy heath a chance. The heath vegetation might look simple to the untrained eye, but is in fact very varied, dominated by common heather, sand sedge, marram grass, the edible black crowberry, bell heather and various lichens. The sandy heaths of Thy attract many birds with some very rare breeders (in Denmark), such as crane and wood sandpiper and they form a habitat for a variety of smaller animals like the natterjack toad and many insects. The wet hollows in between support quite different plants such as <b>bog</b> <b>bilberry,</b> bayberry, marsh gentian, cranberry and a variety of sundew.|$|E
40|$|A {{nitrogen}} deficiency always causes <b>bog</b> <b>bilberry</b> syrup wine {{to have a}} poor sensory feature. This study investigated the effect of nitrogen source addition on volatile compounds during <b>bog</b> <b>bilberry</b> syrup wine fermentation. The syrup was supplemented with 60, 90, 120 or 150 mg/L dibasic ammonium phosphate (DAP) before fermentation. Results showed that an increase of DAP amounts accelerated fermentation rate, increased alcohol content, and decreased sugar level. Total phenol and total flavonoid content were also enhanced {{with the increase of}} DAP amounts. A total of 91 volatile compounds were detected in the wine and their concentrations were significantly enhanced with the increase of DAP. Ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, phenethyl acetate, ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, levo- 2, 3 -butanediol, 2 -phenylethanol, meso- 2, 3 -butanediol, isobutyric acid, hexanoic acid, and octanoic acid exhibited a significant increase of their odor activity value (OAV) with the increase of DAP amounts. <b>Bog</b> <b>bilberry</b> syrup wine possessed fruity, fatty, and caramel flavors as its major aroma, whereas a balsamic note was the least present.

40|$|Phenolic {{compounds}} {{determine the}} color quality of fruit wines. In this study, the phenolic compound content and composition, color characteristics and changes during 6 months of bottle aging were studied in wines fermented with <b>bog</b> <b>bilberry</b> syrup under three different pHs. The total anthocyanins and total phenols were around 15. 12 – 16. 23 mg/L and 475. 82 to 486. 50 mg GAE/L in fresh wines and declined 22 %– 31 % and about 11 % in bottle aged wines, respectively. In fresh wines, eight anthocyanins, six phenolic aids and 14 flavonols, but no flavon- 3 -ols were identified; Malvidin- 3 -O-glucoside, petunidin- 3 -O-glucoside and delphinium- 3 -O-glucoside were the predominant pigments; Chlorogentic acid {{was the most}} abundant phenolic acid, and quercetin- 3 -O-galactoside and myricetin- 3 -O-galactoside accounted for nearly 90 % of the total flavonols. During 6 months of bottle storage, the amounts of all the monomeric anthocyanins and phenolic acids were reduced dramatically, while the glycosidyl flavonols remained constant or were less reduced and their corresponding aglycones increased a lot. The effects of aging on blueberry wine color were described as the loss of color intensity with {{a dramatic change in}} color hue, from initial red-purple up to final red-brick nuances, while the pH of the fermentation matrix was negatively related to the color stability of aged wine...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{address the}} impact of the ice age cycles on {{intraspecific}} cpDNA diversity, {{for the first time on}} the full circumboreal-circumarctic scale. The bird-dispersed <b>bog</b> <b>bilberry</b> (or arctic blueberry, Vaccinium uliginosum) is a key component of northern ecosystems and is here used to assess diversity in previously glaciated vs. unglaciated areas and the importance of Beringia as a refugium and source for interglacial expansion. Eighteen chloroplast DNA haplotypes were observed in and among 122 populations, grouping into three main lineages which probably diverged before, and thus were affected more or less independently by, all major glaciations. The boreal 'Amphi-Atlantic lineage' included one haplotype occurring throughout northern Europe and one occurring in eastern North America, suggesting expansion from at least two bottlenecked, glacial refugium populations. The boreal 'Beringian lineage' included seven haplotypes restricted to Beringia and the Pacific coast of USA. The 'Arctic-Alpine lineage' included nine haplotypes, one of them fully circumpolar. This lineage was unexpectedly diverse, also in previously glaciated areas, suggesting that it thrived on the vast tundras during the ice ages and recolonized deglaciated terrain over long distances. Its largest area of persistence during glaciations was probably situated in the north, stretching from Beringia and far into Eurasia, and it probably also survived the last glaciation in southern mountain ranges. Although Beringia apparently was important for the initial divergence and expansion of V. uliginosum as well as for continuous survival of both the Beringian and Arctic-Alpine lineages during all ice ages, this region played a minor role as a source for later interglacial expansions...|$|E
40|$|Main {{conclusion}} MYBPA 1 -type R 2 R 3 MYB {{transcription factor}} shows down-regulation in white mutant berries of Vaccinium uliginosum deficient in anthocyanins but not proanthocyanidins suggesting {{a role in}} the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Berries of the genus Vaccinium are among the best natural sources of flavonoids. In this study, the expression of structural and regulatory flavonoid biosynthetic genes and the accumulation of flavonoids in white mutant and blue-colored wild-type <b>bog</b> <b>bilberry</b> (V. uliginosum) fruits were measured at different stages of berry development. In contrast to high contents of anthocyanins in ripe blue-colored berries, only traces were detected by HPLC-ESI-MS in ripe white mutant berries. However, similar profile and high levels of flavonol glycosides and proanthocyanidins were quantified in both ripe white and ripe wild-type berries. Analysis with qRT-PCR showed strong down-regulation of structural genes chalcone synthase (VuCHS), dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (VuDFR) and anthocyanidin synthase (VuANS) as well as MYBPA 1 -type transcription factor VuMYBPA 1 in white berries during ripening compared to wild-type berries. The profiles of transcript accumulation of chalcone isomerase (VuCHI), anthocyanidin reductase (VuANR), leucoanthocyanidin reductase (VuLAR) and flavonoid 3 ′ 5 ′ hydroxylase (VuF 3 ′ 5 ′H) were more similar between the white and the wild-type berries during fruit development, while expression of UDP-glucose: flavonoid 3 -O-glucosyltransferase (VuUFGT) showed similar trend but fourfold lower level in white mutant. VuMYBPA 1, the R 2 R 3 MYB family member, is a homologue of VmMYB 2 of V. myrtillus and VcMYBPA 1 of V. corymbosum and belongs to MYBPA 1 - type MYB family which members are shown in some species to be related with proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in fruits. Our results combined with earlier data of the role of VmMYB 2 in white mutant berries of V. myrtillus suggest that the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Vaccinium species could differ from other species studied...|$|E
