5|$|<b>By</b> <b>signing</b> the Treaty of Utrecht, King Louis XIV of France {{recognised}} the Hanoverian succession in Britain. Nevertheless, gossip that Anne and her ministers favoured {{the succession}} of her half-brother rather than the Hanoverians continued, despite Anne's denials in public and in private. The rumours were fed by her consistent refusals to permit any of the Hanoverians to visit or move to England, and by the intrigues of Harley and the Tory Secretary of State Lord Bolingbroke, who were in separate and secret discussions with her half-brother about a possible Stuart restoration until early 1714.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{was less}} {{successful}} in Gascony, which was overrun by the French.
