5|$|A {{number of}} {{children}} were killed, injured or orphaned <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence.</b> Organisations such as Citizens' Initiative reported that the violence resulted in the disturbance of children's studies {{and that there was}} a lack of counselling. Students at Gujarat University were unable to take examinations, which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption. While other schools in the state had to postpone or cancel exams, it was reported that some schools held examinations under police protection. It was also reported that many students were forced to leave their studies due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because they had lost income-earning members of their families.|$|E
5|$|Hemming's {{introduction}} {{to his work}} (Prefatio) claims that it was produced to teach Wulfstan's successors: about the things which have been committed to their care, and to show them which lands justly belong (or ought to belong) to the church, and which have been unjustly seized by evil men—first, during the Danish invasions; later, by unjust royal officials and tax collectors; and most recently, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of Normans in our own time, who by force, guile and rapine have unjustly deprived this holy church of its lands, villages and possessions, until hardly anything is safe from their depredations.|$|E

Knowing that Caesar will find the nearly $2 million Shelly took and count it in their apartment, the two women hatch a scheme to steal the money. Corky, already wary of Violet's intentions, is unsure whether to trust her.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was to map possibilities of a co-operation among the intervention centre and other entities interested in helping to people threatened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> <b>The</b> current status {{was taken from the}} professional literature. There is described an issue of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> types and forms of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> its characteristics and dynamics, causes, consequences, legal framework of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence,</b> its actors, entities helping to people threatened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and an interdisciplinary co-operation. The qualitative research was used in the thesis. A tool for the data collection was a semi-standardized interview. Questions were based on theme ranges concerning the examined issue. The research sample consisted of 13 workers of the entities helping to people at risk of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> in <b>the</b> Highland (Vysočina) region. The research showed that <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> is a very wide-spread and still underestimated issue. At the same time it is seen a considerable progress {{in the area of the}} help to people at risk <b>by</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> Further <b>the</b> research showed that workers do not exactly know services provided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Intervention Centre of the Highland (Vysočina) region. Thanks to this fact there can occur a disinformation of people threatened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> <b>The</b> staff can determine the most often demanded help from the side of the potential service users. They can also recognize that not always it is about the help the intervention centre is able to provide. The research does not confirm that the personnel generally would be influenced by prejudices at their work with people at risk <b>by</b> <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence.</b> But they were certainly also in their professional life influenced by a personal experience with <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> that acquired in their neighbourhood. The research raised a possibility of a co-operation among the intervention centre and other entities, namely organizing case conferences. This thesis can be used in practice for an acquisition or addition of professional experience related to the issue of <b>the</b> domestic <b>violence</b> and available provided services...|$|R
5|$|Under the papacies of {{successive}} Popes {{smaller groups}} of Crusaders continued {{to travel to}} the Eastern Mediterranean to fight the Muslims and aid the Crusader States in the early 12thcentury. The third decade saw campaigns by Fulk V of Anjou, the Venetians, and Conrad III of Germany and the foundation of the Knights Templar. The period also saw the innovation of granting indulgences to those who opposed papal enemies, and this marked the beginning of politically motivated Crusades. The loss of Aleppo in 1128 and Edessa (Urfa) in 1144 to Imad ad-Din Zengi, governor of Mosul, led to preaching for what subsequently became known as the Second Crusade. King Louis VII and ConradIII led armies from France and Germany to Jerusalem and Damascus without winning any major victories. As in the First Crusade, the preaching led to attacks on Jews including massacres in the Rhineland, Cologne, Mainz, Worms and Speyer amid claims that the Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. Bernard of Clairvaux, who had encouraged the Second Crusade in his preaching, was so perturbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> that he journeyed from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem.|$|E
25|$|Violence {{continued}} to blight political {{life in the}} 1970s. Gangs armed by both parties fought for control of urban constituencies. In the election year of 1980 around 800 Jamaicans were killed. Jamaicans were particularly shocked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> at that time.|$|E

25|$|Pearl was {{affected}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of the Ku Klux Klan, and was white-only {{for most of}} the 20th Century. In 1970, Pearl had 9,613 white residents and 10 black residents who were probably live-in servants to white households. By the 1990s Pearl had become more racially integrated, and by 2010 blacks made up 23% of the population.|$|E
25|$|Racially {{influenced}} police {{actions are}} illustrated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> in Cova de Moura, a low socioeconomic area housing a significant migrant population.

25|$|The King, alarmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence,</b> backed down, {{at least}} for the time being. The Marquis de Lafayette took up command of the National Guard at Paris. Jean-Sylvain Bailly, {{president}} of the Assembly at the time of the Tennis Court Oath, became the city's mayor under a new governmental structure known as the commune. The King visited Paris, where, on 17 July he accepted a tricolore cockade, to cries of Vive la Nation ("Long live the Nation") and Vive le Roi ("Long live the King").|$|E
25|$|A survey {{from the}} Justice Ministry reveals that 80% of the {{domestic}} violence victims {{do not want the}} aggressor to be imprisoned.

To the professor Cristiane Brandão, Criminal Law professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), these numbers are the result of the predominant patriarchal and sexist Brazilian society.|$|E
25|$|Occupy Mexico did {{not achieve}} {{the level of}} {{popularity}} it gained in other areas. This is attributed {{to the fact that}} Mexico's Occupy protesters, which were focused on poverty and workers' rights, failed to resonate with a public enthralled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of the Mexican Drug War. In contrast, an anti-violence movement led by Javier Sicilia during the time that the Occupy protests occurred, drew thousands onto the streets of Mexico City. The Occupy Movement was almost entirely ignored by Mexico's mainstream politicians. By late January 2012, most of the tents were empty and only a few protesters remained outside the Stock Exchange.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to this violence, efforts to curb the drug trade in Mexico have had serious effects on the area. Since 2005, the Costa Grande {{has been dominated by}} drug related violence according to the Procuraduría General de la República and state authorities. Incidents have included kidnappings and executions; including those of police and local political figures as local criminal organizations ally themselves with rival Sinaloa and Gulf cartels fighting for dominance in the region. Petatlán has been especially hard hit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence.</b> Federal Highway 200 between Acapulco and Zihuatanejo remains militarized, with soldiers manning checkpoints along the stretch looking for guns and weapons. These checkpoints randomly search private and commercial vehicles, including tour busses.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, new {{infrastructure}} projects were begun. These included the Izúcar-Tehuantepec {{section of the}} Panamerican Highway {{and the construction of}} the Miguel Alemán Dam. From the 1980s to the present, there has been much development of the tourism industry in the state. This tourism, as well as the population growth of the capital, prompted the construction of the Oaxaca-Mexico City highway in 1994. Development of tourism has been strongest in the Central Valleys area surrounding the capital, with secondary developments in Huatulco and other locations along the coast. This development was threatened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> associated with the 2006 uprising, which severely curtailed the number of incoming tourists for several years.|$|E
25|$|At Briarcliff, Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) takes Lana's secret {{notes about}} the asylum.

Asked to assist in administering the electroshock, Sister Jude is disturbed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> of the resulting treatment. In the woods, Sister Mary Eunice (Lily Rabe) asks Dr. Arden to tell her the identity of the creatures in the woods who savagely eat the meat she prepares for them. Later, Shelley (Chloë Sevigny) offers herself to Dr. Arden in return for fifteen minutes outside. He rebuffs her, calling her a slut and a whore, leading Shelley to argue that women face a double standard with their sexuality, and that she was committed by her promiscuous husband who hypocritically forbade her from engaging in extramarital sex.|$|E
