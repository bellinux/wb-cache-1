5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine {{on the port}} wing developed a fuel leak. The flight crew responded by shutting down the engine and feathering its propeller. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a <b>blind</b> <b>approach</b> to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to final approach for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E
25|$|The tee {{shots on}} Holes 1, 3, 8, 15 and 17 are blind, {{and there are}} several <b>blind</b> <b>approach</b> shots on Holes 2, 6 and 14. The second and third shots at Hole 9 are blind, {{depending}} on length. There also are several holes that are semi-blind; the surface of the green cannot be seen when playing approach shots on Holes 5, 10, 18, and on 15 (for the long hitter). These blind shots are only blind once. Still, they do make Wykagyl difficult to play for a golfer who has never seen it before. Wykagyl is unique in its mix of par threes, par fours and par fives. Most 18-hole courses have four par threes, four par fives and ten par fours, but Wykagyl has five par fives, five par threes and eight par fours.|$|E
2500|$|With HX 237 {{now under}} {{land-based}} aircraft cover, the C-in-C Western Approaches ordered Biter and her escorts [...] south, where the eastbound convoy SC 129 was being {{threatened by a}} gathering wolfpack. On 15 May, light winds over the flight deck, and {{the inability of the}} Swordfish to use the catapult launch rail, limited their bomb load to two [...] bombs. Just before they closed on the convoy a Swordfish attacked a surfaced U-boat. The two bombs caused no damage to the submarine which returned fire, damaging the plane and wounding the air observer. Their relief shadowed the submarine until it dived when it carried out another unsuccessful attack. At 13:45, Biter closed with the convoy and commenced anti-submarine patrols. The convoy reached Britain on 16 May without any loss, and Biter was ordered to the Clyde. As a result of Biter′s experiences on these early convoys, the complement of aircraft carried was increased to 15 bombers and six fighters, with a 50% increase in air crews. Homing beacons were to be fitted to all carriers together with a Type 237 <b>blind</b> <b>approach</b> beam system for use in poor visibility.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} essays advocating a <b>blinded</b> <b>approach</b> to {{experiments}} in general came from Claude Bernard {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century, who recommended splitting any scientific experiment between the theorist who conceives the experiment and a naive (and preferably uneducated) observer who registers the results without foreknowledge of the theory or hypothesis being tested. This suggestion contrasted starkly with the prevalent Enlightenment-era attitude that scientific observation can only be objectively valid when undertaken by a well-educated, informed scientist.|$|R

50|$|In a data-aided approach, {{the channel}} {{estimation}} {{is based on}} some known data, which is known both at the transmitter and at the receiver, such as training sequences or pilot data. In a <b>blind</b> <b>approach,</b> the estimation is based only on the received data, without any known transmitted sequence. The tradeoff is the accuracy versus the overhead. A data-aided approach requires more bandwidth or it has a higher overhead than a <b>blind</b> <b>approach,</b> but it can achieve a better channel estimation accuracy than a blind estimator.|$|E
30|$|A {{major issue}} for the {{application}} of maximum-ratio-combining for multimicrophone setups is the estimation of the acoustic transfer functions. In telecommunications, the signal attenuation as well as the phase shift for each transmission path are usually measured to apply MRC. With speech applications we have no means to directly measure the acoustic transfer functions. There exists several <b>blind</b> <b>approaches</b> to estimate the acoustic transfer functions (see e.g., [14 – 16]) which were successfully applied to dereverberation. However, the proposed estimation methods are computationally demanding.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the problem of minimizing the multicast decoding delay of generalized instantly decodable network coding (G-IDNC) over persistent forward and feedback erasure channels with feedback intermittence. In such an environment, the sender does not always receive acknowledgement from the receivers after each transmission. Moreover, both the forward and feedback channels are subject to persistent erasures, which can be modelled by a two state (good and bad states) Markov chain known as Gilbert-Elliott channel (GEC). Due to such feedback imperfections, the sender is unable to determine subsequent instantly decodable packets combination for all receivers. Given this harsh channel and feedback model, we first derive expressions for the probability distributions of decoding delay increments and then employ these expressions in formulating the minimum decoding problem in such environment as a maximum weight clique problem in the G-IDNC graph. We also show that the problem formulations in simpler channel and feedback models are special cases of our generalized formulation. Since this problem is NP-hard, we design a greedy algorithm to solve it and compare it to <b>blind</b> <b>approaches</b> proposed in literature. Through extensive simulations, our adaptive algorithm is shown to outperform the <b>blind</b> <b>approaches</b> in all situations and to achieve significant improvement in the decoding delay, especially when the channel is highly persisten...|$|R

40|$|Prognostication {{studies on}} {{comatose}} cardiac arrest (CA) patients {{are limited by}} lack of blinding, potentially causing overestimation of outcome predictors and self-fulfilling prophecy. Using a <b>blinded</b> <b>approach,</b> we analyzed the value of quantitative automated pupillometry to predict neurological recovery after CA. We examined a prospective cohort of 103 comatose adult patients who were unconscious 48 hours after CA and underwent repeated measurements of quantitative pupillary light reflex (PLR) using the Neurolight-Algiscan device. Clinical examination, electroencephalography (EEG), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and serum neuron-specific enolase were performed in parallel, as part of standard multimodal assessment. Automated pupillometry results were blinded to clinicians involved in patient care. Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) at 1 year was the outcome endpoint. Survivors (n[*]=[*] 50 patients; 32 CPC 1, 16 CPC 2, 2 CPC 3) had higher quantitative PLR (median[*]=[*] 20 [range[*]=[*] 13 - 41] vs 11 [0 - 55] %, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) and constriction velocity (1. 46 [0. 85 - 4. 63] vs 0. 94 [0. 16 - 4. 97] mm/s, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001) than nonsurvivors. At 48 hours, a quantitative PLR[*]<[*] 13 % had 100 % specificity and positive predictive value to predict poor recovery (0 % false-positive rate), and provided equal performance to that of EEG and SSEP. Reduced quantitative PLR correlated with higher serum neuron-specific enolase (Spearman r[*]=[*]- 0. 52, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001). Reduced quantitative PLR correlates with postanoxic brain injury and, when compared to standard multimodal assessment, is highly accurate in predicting long-term prognosis after CA.
