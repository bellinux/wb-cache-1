Until the Inclosure Acts, which came into force in England in the 18th century, there had been little need for horses to jump fences routinely, <b>but</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> act of Parliament came new challenges for those who followed fox hounds. The Inclosure Acts brought fencing and boundaries to {{many parts of the country}} as common ground was dispersed amongst separate owners. This meant that those wishing to pursue their sport now needed horses that were capable of jumping these obstacles.|$|E
