The effect of fitting clearance {{on the strength of}} bolt is discussed as well as the effect of pitch difference.

50|$|The major {{diameter}} of external threads is normally {{smaller than the}} {{major diameter}} of the internal threads, if the threads are designed to fit together. But this requirement alone does not guarantee that a bolt and a nut of the same pitch would fit together: the same requirement must separately {{be made for the}} minor and pitch diameters of the threads. Besides providing for a clearance between the crest of the <b>bolt</b> <b>threads</b> and the root of the nut threads, one must also ensure that the clearances are not so excessive as to cause the fasteners to fail.|$|E
50|$|In normal use, a nut-and-bolt joint holds {{together}} because the bolt {{is under a}} constant tensile stress called the preload. The preload pulls the nut threads against the <b>bolt</b> <b>threads,</b> and the nut face against the bearing surface, with a constant force, so that the nut cannot rotate without overcoming the friction between these surfaces. If the joint is subjected to vibration, however, the preload increases and decreases with each cycle of movement. If the minimum preload during the vibration cycle {{is not enough to}} hold the nut firmly in contact with the bolt and the bearing surface, then the nut is likely to become loose.|$|E

50|$|Typical {{drilling}} and milling operations, {{as well as}} manufacturing practices for <b>bolt</b> <b>threads,</b> introduce mechanical play proportional {{to the size of}} the fasteners. For example, bolts up to 10 mm in diameter typically have play on the order of 0.2 mm. When dowels are used in addition to bolts, however, the tighter dimensional tolerances of dowels and their mating holes—typically 0.01 mm—result in significantly less play, on the order of 0.02 mm. Manufacturing costs are inversely proportional to mechanical tolerances and, as a result, engineers must balance the need for mechanical precision against cost as well as other factors such as manufacturability and serviceability.|$|E

50|$|Specialized {{locking nuts}} exist {{to prevent this}} problem, but {{sometimes}} it is sufficient to add a second nut. For this technique to be reliable, each nut must be tightened to the correct torque. The inner nut is tightened to about a quarter to a half of the torque of the outer nut. It is then {{held in place by}} a wrench while the outer nut is tightened on top using the full torque. This arrangement causes the two nuts to push on each other, creating a tensile stress in the short section of the bolt that lies between them. Even when the main joint is vibrated, the stress between the two nuts remains constant, thus holding the nut threads in constant contact with the <b>bolt</b> <b>threads</b> and preventing self-loosening. When the joint is assembled correctly, the outer nut bears the full tension of the joint. The inner nut functions merely to add a small additional force to the outer nut and {{does not need to be}} as strong, so a thin nut (also called a jam nut) can be used.|$|E

40|$|Following STS- 107, the External Tank (ET) Project {{implemented}} {{corrective actions}} and configuration {{changes at the}} ET bipod fitting. Among the corrective actions, the existing bolt lock wire which provided resistance to potential bolt rotation was removed. The lock wire removal was because of concerns with creating voids during foam application and potential for lock wire to become debris. The bolts had been previously lubricated to facilitate assembly but, because of elimination of the lock wire, the ET Project wanted to enable the locking feature of the insert. Thus, the lubrication was removed from <b>bolt</b> <b>threads</b> and instead applied to the washer under the bolt head. Lubrication is necessary to maximize joint pre-load while remaining within the bolt torque specification. The locking feature is implemented by thread crimping in at four places in the insert.

40|$|Six {{photoelastic}} {{frozen stress}} models of I S 0 nut-bolt connections loaded in pure tension were studied. Four {{of these models}} had modifications to the threads at the load bearing end of the nut. These modifications included tapered truncation of the thread crests and taper of the whole thread form {{for a portion of}} the nut length. The maximum stress in the bolt always occurred within one pitch of the load bearing face of the nut. Truncating threads increased the maximum bolt stresses. Tapering the whole thread form reduced the maximum stress and produced a more uniform load distribution in the bolt. The conditions at the load bearing face of the nut were found to influence the load distribution in the <b>bolt</b> <b>threads</b> more than the stress concentrations in the bolt. ...|$|E

40|$|The high {{strength}} {{bolts and nuts}} are widely used in various fields. To ensure the structure safety, a lot of special bolts and nuts were studied previously. In this paper, a slight pitch difference is considered between the bolt and nut. Here, the pitch of the nut is αμm larger than the pitch of the bolt. The fatigue experiment is performed for three kinds of specimens with different levels of pitch difference. The obtained S-N curves show that the fatigue life is extended by about 1. 5 times by introducing the suitable pitch difference especially under the high stress amplitude. According to the detail investigation on the fractured specimens, {{it is found that}} the fractured positions and the crack configuration are totally different by introducing the pitch difference.

30|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{strength of}} a bolt-nut connector made from wood-based material was evaluated. The thread strength of the wooden bolt-nut connector was tested to select various parameters of the connector {{and the type of}} wood material; the wood materials tested were hard maple, white oak, ebony, glue-laminated bamboo, and densified Japanese cedar. A plane model of wooden threads with various thread angles was also evaluated. The results showed that the maximum failure load of the thread increased with increasing bolt density and connection area, which was calculated from the diameter of the bolt and the thickness of the nut. The withdrawal resistance after reaching the maximum load underwent a graded decrease because the <b>bolt</b> <b>threads</b> were broken one by one. In addition, the thread strength depended on the thread angle. In the model with a thread angle of 90 °, compressive deformation in the transverse direction occurred prior to shear deformation along the root of the threads; the model with this thread angle thus had higher strength than those with other angles.|$|E
