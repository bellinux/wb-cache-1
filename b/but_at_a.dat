5|$|A {{number of}} state governments issued {{requests}} for tender for {{the supply of}} sterile fluids and PD fluids. Baxter responded to the requests with tenders that put forward two alternative pricing options: either a state could purchase sterile fluids and PD fluids as a bundled package at a discounted rate, or the state could buy each product separately <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> higher rate.|$|E
5|$|Fighting was renewed at the {{beginning}} of 1993, as the Croatian army launched Operation Maslenica, an offensive operation in the Zadar area on January 22. The objective of the attack was to improve the strategic situation in that area, as it targeted the city airport and the Maslenica Bridge, the last entirely overland link between Zagreb and the city of Zadar until the bridge area was captured in September 1991. The attack proved successful as it met its declared objectives, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high cost, as 114 Croat and 490 Serb soldiers were killed in a relatively limited theater of operations.|$|E
5|$|Gen. Howard, {{witnessing}} this disaster, sent forward {{an artillery}} battery and an infantry brigade from von Steinwehr's reserve force, under Col. Charles Coster. Coster's battle line {{just north of}} the town in Kuhn's brickyard was overwhelmed by Hays and Avery. He provided valuable cover for the retreating soldiers, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high price: of Coster's 800 men, 313 were captured, as were two of the four guns from the battery.|$|E

5|$|In January 1894, Cripple Creek mine owners J. J. Hagerman, David Moffat and Eben Smith, who {{together}} employed {{one-third of}} the area's miners, announced a lengthening of the work-day to ten hours (from eight), with no change to the daily wage of $3.00 per day. When workers protested, the owners agreed to employ the miners for {{eight hours a day}} – <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> wage of only $2.50.|$|E
5|$|In early May, {{the mine}} owners met {{with representatives of}} the WFM in Colorado Springs in an attempt to end the strike. The owners offered to return to the eight-hour day, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> daily wage of only $2.75. The union {{rejected}} the offer and talks broke down.|$|E
5|$|Lugovoy and Kovtun met Litvinenko in the Millennium {{hotel bar}} twice, on 1 November (when the {{poisoning}} took place), and earlier, on 16 October.

5|$|On Zelter's {{death in}} 1832, Mendelssohn had hopes of {{succeeding}} him as {{conductor of the}} Sing-Akademie zu Berlin; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> vote in January 1833 he was defeated for the post by Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen. This may have been because of Mendelssohn's youth, and fear of possible innovations; it was also suspected {{by some to be}} attributable to his Jewish ancestry. Following this rebuff, Mendelssohn divided most of his professional time {{over the next few years}} between Britain and Düsseldorf, where he was appointed musical director (his first paid post as a musician) in 1833.|$|E
5|$|Steiner was {{not present}} during the bombing, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> command bunker in Franceville-Plage. After the raid, he {{set out for the}} battery, but was unable to gain entry due to the volume of fire from the British paratroopers. At the same time, a {{reconnaissance}} patrol from an army Flak unit with a half-track mounting a large anti-aircraft gun arrived. The crew had intended to seek cover at the position, but instead used the gun to engage the paratroopers.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of World War I largely halted the dreadnought arms race as funds and technical resources were diverted to more pressing priorities. The foundries which produced battleship guns were dedicated {{instead to the}} production of land-based artillery, and shipyards were flooded with orders for small ships. The weaker naval powers engaged in the Great War—France, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia—suspended their battleship programmes entirely. The United Kingdom and Germany continued building battleships and battlecruisers <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> reduced pace.|$|E
5|$|The paratroopers had {{achieved}} their primary objective, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> heavy cost, with fifty dead and twenty-five wounded; a casualty rate of exactly fifty percent. The battalion then attacked Le Plein, securing the village by expelling the platoon-sized German garrison. The survivors retired to a planned rendezvous point at 05:30, the battalion too understrength {{to achieve its}} other objectives.|$|E
5|$|The {{training}} of B-29 aircrews and {{the testing of}} prototype atom bombs was the last major contribution of Wendover Field during World War II. After war's end, some crew training continued, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> reduced level. For a while, B-29s which had returned from the Marianas were flown to Wendover for storage. In the summer of 1946, the Ogden Air Technical Service Command at Hill Army Air Field north of Salt Lake City assumed jurisdiction over all operations at Wendover Field except engineering and technical projects.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> slower rate than {{it has in the}} past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This has been the case as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E
5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves in a strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> much slower pace.|$|E
5|$|There was {{an exodus}} {{from rural areas}} {{in most of the}} country. Today the urban {{population}} represents slightly {{more than half of the}} population, according to the latest census. In many cases, people went into cities outside the traditional area of their ethnic group. There are now important Ovimbundu communities in Luanda, Malanje, and Lubango. There has been a degree of return, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> slow pace, while many younger people are reluctant to go to a rural life that they never knew.|$|E

5|$|When {{termites}} {{construct their}} nests, they use predominantly indirect communication. No single termite {{would be in}} charge of any particular construction project. Individual termites react rather than think, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> group level, they exhibit a sort of collective cognition. Specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to start building. The termite adds these objects onto existing structures, and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers. The result is a self-organised process whereby the information that directs termite activity results from changes in the environment rather than from direct contact among individuals.|$|E
5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.|$|E

But at least they think that Tommy can go through a whole movie without any fuss. Because they didn't see the ending, Didi and Stu decide to go out to see the movie again next week, <b>but</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> different theater.
