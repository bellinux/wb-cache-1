5000|$|Over a motor's {{normal load}} range, the torque's slope is {{approximately}} linear or proportional to slip because {{the value of}} rotor resistance divided by slip, , dominates torque in linear manner. As load increases above rated load, stator and rotor leakage reactance factors gradually become more significant in relation to [...] such that torque gradually curves towards <b>breakdown</b> <b>torque.</b> As the load torque increases beyond <b>breakdown</b> <b>torque</b> the motor stalls.|$|E

50|$|The basic {{fundamental}} of induction generators is {{the conversion}} between mechanical energy to electrical energy. This requires an external torque {{applied to the}} rotor to turn it faster than the synchronous speed. However, indefinitely increasing torque doesn't lead to an indefinite increase in power generation. The rotating magnetic field torque excited from the armature works to counter {{the motion of the}} rotor and prevent over speed because of induced motion in the opposite direction. As the speed of the motor increases the counter torque reaches a max value of torque (<b>breakdown</b> <b>torque)</b> that it can operate until before the operating conditions become unstable. Ideally, induction generators work best in the stable region between the no-load condition and maximum torque region.|$|E
40|$|Cavitation {{characteristics}} for {{a family}} of skewed propellers were obtained by using an in-house panel method code PROPELLA. The propellers used were the existing NSRDC (US Navy Ship Research and Development Center) skewed propellers. Detailed geometry, open water test data, and results obtained from physical cavitation tunnel tests for these propellers were taken from published literature. Predictions were completed using appropriate wake data (either uniform inflow or measured wake survey data) to determine individual blade spindle torque, in-plane and out-of-plane bending moments and their fluctuations in both open water and behind-ship conditions. For the design speed, cavitation performance was assessed in both the open water and behind-ship conditions to determine thrust and <b>torque</b> <b>breakdown.</b> Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
30|$|The terms inside {{parentheses}} in Eq.  6 {{show the}} <b>breakdown</b> of <b>torque</b> consumption: {{the first term}} is the torque expended on clamp load of thread pitch’s inclined plane, the second term is the torque expended on thread friction, and the third term is the torque expended on bearing surface friction [4]. The ratios of these component torques to total torque were calculated using the data in Table  2 and, respectively, labeled α, β, and γ. Figure  4 shows the relationships of tightening speed with α, β, and γ. Tightening speed had no major effect on α in C. japonica, C. obtusa, and P. menziesii specimens (mean: 17, 25, and 25 %, respectively). We have previously reported that bolted timber joints generally have an α of around 8 – 10 % [4]. However, the value we measured for lag screw joints {{in this study is}} over double that, seeming to signify that lag screws convert clamp force into torque more efficiently than do bolts. In C. japonica, β appear to rise slightly with increasing tightening speed, while no noticeable differences are apparent for γ. In P. menziesii specimens, however, faster tightening speeds caused β to increase and γ to decrease with increasing tightening speed: at 20  rpm, they were 25 and 50 % on average, respectively, with γ about twice as large as β.|$|R
40|$|The {{extension}} to super-cavitating propellers of the numerical panel method {{developed by the}} Marine CFD Group of the University of Genova is presented and largely validated in the paper. The validation of the theoretical model for the cavity detachment and closure {{in the wake of}} the blade profiles is presented first on a typical supercavitating profile for which theoretical and experimental solutions are known. Then the 3 D panel method is applied on the complete series of Newton- Rader trans-cavitating propeller for which experimental measurements in cavitation tunnel and numerical results obtained by other researchers have been recently published. The main dynamic characteristics such as thrust and torque coefficients versus the advance ratio and the cavitation index, but also the cavitation patterns, in terms of bubble length at various radii, bubble volume and extension on the trailing vortex wake are presented and discussed for various propellers of the N-R series, having different pitch and expanded area ratios. Good correlations are in general achieved for what regards not only cavitation patterns, but also thrust and <b>torque</b> <b>breakdown</b> consequent to the cavity inception and growth on propeller blades...|$|R
40|$|The paper proposes an {{explicite}} {{formula for}} determining the critical slip value of an induction squirel cage motor based upon five parameters. Three of these parameters - rated slip, rated and <b>breakdown</b> <b>torque</b> are known by catalogue data. Two missing parameters are the arbitrary slip between the rated and critical slip value and the corresponding torque value. These two parameters are to be experimentaly obtained. The <b>breakdown</b> <b>torque</b> value given by catalogue data is usually less accurate than the rated torque value. The proposed formula gives the possibility of analysing the error distribution of the critical slip value obtained from catalogue and measured data {{in comparison with the}} values obtained from the mechanical characteristic based on the physical parameters of an induction motor...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} various {{high performance}} induction machine control methods and provides methods for improved performance. Parameter sensitivity analyses on the discussed control methods are given. Practitioners have reported performance degradation during high speed DTC operation, including excessive torque ripple and diminished torque {{capability of the}} drive method. Asymptotic-input-output-decoupling is proposed to improve this erratic DTC performance. The results show that asymptotic decoupling compensates for erratic DTC performance with minimal control effort and controller complexity. This improvement trades off voltage headroom for torque regulation dynamics. Maximum instantaneous torque capabilities and related control strategies that can deliver high momentary forces are presented. The analyses show that by using the entire voltage headroom, in principle, up to 300 % of the <b>breakdown</b> <b>torque</b> can be obtained at stall condition without saturating the magnetic circuit. An augmented vectorized volts-per-hertz control strategy is proposed and shown to provide high instantaneous torques comparable to that obtained with vector controllers...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper was to {{evaluate}} the influence of different climatic conditions on the activity of alpha-amylase in wheat samples and bread quality parameters. Three wheat varieties grown in three different localities in three years were chosen for this study. Commonly used methods for estimation of alpha-amylase activity in wheat grain were employed. The obtained results indicated that harvest year 2013, which was characterized with the excessive amount of rainfall, exhibited {{the highest level of}} alpha-amylase activity and the lowest values of the peak viscosity. The lowest alpha-amylase level and the highest peak viscosity and FN value were observed for samples harvested in 2012 which was characterized with the greatest number of days with an average daily temperature above 30 and 35 °C. In addition, a decrease in Mixolab parameter torque C 3 and specific bread loaf volume, as well as increase in the <b>breakdown</b> <b>torque</b> (C 3 -C 4) of samples harvested in 2013 were observed, which could be attributed to rainy weather influencing increase in alpha-amylase activity. It is found that specific bread loaf volume of wheat samples is highest in 2012. Moreover, a negative correlation between alpha-amylase activity and specific bread volume for all the samples grown in three years was determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of wheat-based {{foods that are}} enriched with proteins is increasingly popular. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the effects of partial replacement of wheat flour with whey and soy proteins (0 – 30 %) on the rheological properties of dough and cookie-making quality. The incorporation of whey protein (WP) diluted the concentration of gluten, leading to an increase in dough development time (MDT) and <b>breakdown</b> <b>torque</b> and a decrease in stability time (MST) and minimum torque (MMT). The gelation of WP during the heat treatment increased dough peak torque (MPT), G′, and G′′. As a contrast, the addition of soy protein (SP) increased dough MST, MDT, and MMT. The aggregation of SP helped increase G′ and decrease tan δ of the dough in oscillatory shear tests. The weak gelling effects and higher water absorption of SP decreased MPT, G′, and G′′ of the dough during heat treatment. With SP, the spread ratio of cookies first decreased from 6. 39 to 5. 66 and then increased to 6. 86, and the overall acceptability scores ranged from 6. 62 to 7. 02, indicating that the formed soy protein network helped maintain the dough structure for obtaining an improvement in the quality of bakery products...|$|E
