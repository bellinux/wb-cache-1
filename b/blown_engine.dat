5|$|Häkkinen passed Villeneuve on lap 28 {{although}} {{he went off}} the track in the process. Herbert made his only pit stop on the same lap {{although he}} stalled and rejoined in twelfth place. Gené, Mazzacane, Ralf Schumacher and Verstappen made pit stops between laps 28 and 29. Villeneuve tried to retake fourth position from Häkkinen on the 30th lap but overshot the manoeuvre. Häkkinen made a pit stop on lap 35, emerging behind Villeneuve and Irvine. Coulthard managed to close to within 2 seconds of Michael Schumacher {{when he made his}} second pit stop on lap 38. Michael Schumacher made a pit stop on the following lap and remained in the lead. Barrichello became the leader for one lap and made his pit stop on lap 41. This allowed Michael Schumacher to reclaim the first position. By the start of lap 45, Coulthard had closed to within two seconds of Michael Schumacher. Ralf Schumacher was called into his garage by his team to retire on the 45th lap. Zonta pulled off the race track with an <b>blown</b> <b>engine</b> two laps later.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{the team}} ended their {{association}} with Radical, and replaced the SR9 with a LM P2 class Ginetta-Zytek GZ09S/2; Tim Greaves, Karim Ojjeh and Thor-Christian Ebbesvik were named as the team's regular drivers, resulting in the team being known as Team Bruichladdich. The team's first race with the car came at the LMS opener, the 8 Hours of Castellet, and they finished twelfth overall, fifth in class. The 1000km of Spa proved to be less successful; the team suffered a <b>blown</b> <b>engine</b> during qualifying, and Ebbesvik crashed {{out of the race}} after 15 laps. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Gary Chalandon replaced Ebbesvik, and the team finished tenth overall, fifth in the LM P2 class. Next up was the 1000km of Algarve, and Ebbesvik returned to the team; fifth overall, and second in class, for their first class podium of the season. The 1000 km of Hungaroring saw another fifth place overall, although mechanical difficulties with the LM P1-class cars meant that this also equated to fifth in class. The season finale, which was the 1000km of Silverstone, saw the team end the season with a 19th overall, and eighth in class. The team finished the season ranked fifth in the LMP2 Team's Championship, with 46 points.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginning}} of the 2003 season saw Hornish struggle in comparison with his previous two years at Panther. At the Indianapolis 500, he qualified in 18th place; in the race, he retired with a <b>blown</b> <b>engine</b> after completing 195 of the 200 laps. Hornish finished the race in 15th place, dropping to a tie with Buddy Rice for 12th place in points. At the following race at Pikes Peak, he started in 14th place and finished fifth (his first lead-lap finish of the season). Around this time, Panther Racing and several other teams using the Chevrolet engine built by General Motors (the parent company of Chevrolet) switched to a new engine by Cosworth which was badged as a Chevrolet engine. After the change Hornish's results began improving; he started fourth and finished second, after leading for 126 of 200 laps, at Michigan International Speedway. Two races later, at Kentucky Speedway, he qualified for the pole position and led for 181 of 200 laps to win. Hornish then won two more consecutive races, at Chicagoland and at California Speedway. He won the former race by 0.01 second over Scott Dixon and Bryan Herta, the closest top-three finish in series history. Going into the season-ending Chevy 500 at Texas Motor Speedway, Hornish was mathematically eligible win the championship; however, his car had a spray problem after 176 of 195 laps. He finished 17th, and was fifth in the final point standings with 461 points.|$|E

5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled {{to the side of the}} main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over to the side of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a <b>blown</b> <b>engine.</b> The resulting event meant he pulled to the side of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
25|$|Amon won a Tasman Series {{victory in}} January 1975 in rainy {{conditions}} where he won by 24.2 seconds. His next race at Oran Park saw Amon finish fourth {{after a long}} battle with John Walker. At Surfers Paradise, Amon was forced to miss most of the practice session when customs seized his car's gearbox. In the race, Amon retired due to a <b>blown</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mansell was {{planning}} only to stop twice and took third when Berger pitted but retired on lap 46 when his transmission failed. Häkkinen, now fourth, retired two laps {{later with a}} <b>blown</b> <b>engine.</b> There were no changes {{in the third round}} of stops although Katayama spun off from fifth soon after, on lap 54. Schumacher won once again from Hill, Berger, Frentzen, Martini and de Cesaris.|$|E

25|$|Mark Martin {{dropped out}} on lap 160 with a <b>blown</b> <b>engine.</b> He {{was the first}} of the six {{championship}} contenders to drop out, and his chances for the title were over. After a strong first half, Harry Gant slid down the standings, and he too fell out of contention for the title. Kyle Petty was still running at this point, but was nay a factor. The title would be settled between Allison, Elliott, and Kulwicki.|$|E
25|$|McLaren driver David Coulthard started second, {{alongside}} Michael Schumacher. However, Coulthard {{was forced}} to serve a ten-second stop-go penalty on lap eight because he moved forward into the lead before the start. Michael Schumacher's main rival in the championship, Mika Häkkinen, started from fourth but retired with an <b>blown</b> <b>engine</b> on lap 26. Michael Schumacher thus had an unchallenged lead {{and was able to}} clinch his seventh win of the season, despite a spin {{in the final stages of}} the race.|$|E
25|$|Räikkönen {{scored a}} third-place podium finish {{in his first}} race with McLaren, the 2002 Australian Grand Prix. Although McLaren {{suffered}} many engine failures in 2002, Räikkönen scored 24 points and four podiums, and held his own against teammate David Coulthard. Räikkönen came close to winning his first Grand Prix in France but went off track at the Adelaide hairpin {{with a handful of}} laps to go, because of oil from the <b>blown</b> <b>engine</b> of Allan McNish's Toyota on the circuit. He finished the race second. He finished the season in sixth place, one place behind his team mate. Together they achieved a solid third place for McLaren in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E

25|$|After a <b>blown</b> <b>engine</b> at California {{and falling}} to 35th in the owners points, he {{finished}} 10th at Las Vegas and reached 29th place in points. He finished 8th at Martinsville. He had {{a string of}} poor finishes including 20th at Texas, and 31st at Phoenix after being spun out by Casey Mears. He gained confidence in his team with a very strong performance at Talladega, leading for 20 laps, and finishing 2nd to his protege Brad Keselowski after Keselowski sent Carl Edwards flying into the catch fence {{in one of the}} year's biggest upsets. However, two weeks later at Richmond, Earnhardt finished 27th. He was again spun out late in the race at Darlington and ended the race in 27th place. He then finished 10th in the All-Star race at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Earnhardt's poor performance continued as he finished in 40th at the Coca Cola 600 due to an ill-handling race car.|$|E
25|$|On August 5, 2007, Earnhardt {{earned his}} first pole {{position}} in a race since 2002 at Pocono Raceway. Although Kurt Busch won the race, Earnhardt had a dramatic comeback to finish 2nd after spinning out and experiencing shock troubles. Earnhardt led for eight laps before Busch took over. On August 12 at Watkins Glen International, Earnhardt was making the push into the Top 12 of the Nextel Cup standings from his No. 13 position. After being at the No. 2 position during the race, Earnhardt had engine problems on lap 64 and had to end his race day. After the Glen, he tried furiously to reach the 12th spot in standings. However, a resurgence by Kurt Busch and a <b>blown</b> <b>engine</b> during the final race at Richmond ended his Chase hopes. That was his last chance to participate for the Championship at Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (DEI). After the 2007 season, Dale Jr. won the NMPA Chex Most Popular Driver award for the 5th consecutive time.|$|E
25|$|Ty Dillon {{attempted}} the 2015 Daytona 500 in the No. 33 for RCR with Cheerios and Kroger sponsoring. Dillon {{qualified for}} the Daytona 500 and finished 28th. Brian Scott qualified for Atlanta in the No. 33 (under the Circle Sport banner) the next week, but gave up his seat to HScott Motorsports after their driver Michael Annett missed the race. Under NASCAR rules, Falk would receive owner's points. Scott raced the next week at Las Vegas for RCR, finishing 13th, and also ran well two races later at Fontana before finishing 27th. Scott made the field at Talladega in May, but finished last after a <b>blown</b> <b>engine</b> and subsequent crash collecting Michael Waltrip. Dillon ran the car at Kansas in May promoting SpongeBob SquarePants character Plankton. Scott drove the car at Dover with Acme Markets and Kraft, finishing 36th after a crash with Kyle Busch. Dillon returned at Pocono and Michigan in June with Yuengling and Nexium sponsoring in respective events. Scott returned with Shore Lodge at the July Daytona race and the Brickyard 400.

50|$|As blast {{furnaces}} re-equipped after World War II, the favoured power source was increasingly either the diesel engine, or the electric motor. These both had a rotary output, which worked well with contemporary developments in centrifugal fans {{capable of handling}} the huge volumes of air. Although the reciprocating steam <b>blowing</b> <b>engine</b> continued where it was already in use, they were rarely installed after the war. These older plants began to close in the 1950s and numbers were drastically reduced throughout the West during the 1970s. <b>Blowing</b> <b>engines</b> of this form are now rare.|$|R
25|$|Following the cars' {{export to}} America, the KZR-1s made their first {{appearance}} {{under the new}} name at the 24 Hours of Daytona; Lupberger and Toivonen were partnered by T. J. Bell in the A410-001 chassis, whilst Collins, Zwart and Vann drove the A410-002 chassis, which was also fitted with a BMW 4-litre V8 engine. Neither car had a successful race; the A410-001 was classified 38th overall, and ninth in the SRP class, but retired due to a <b>blown</b> <b>engine</b> after 15 hours and 429 laps, whilst the other car was classified 70th, and 16th in class, due to electrical issues after six hours and 116 laps. For the 12 Hours of Sebring, Kristian Kolby replaced Toivonen, and Justin Wilson replaced Zwart, and the team were a little more successful; Collins, Vann and Wilson finished sixth overall, whilst the other car was brought home in 29th overall, and tenth in class. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Team Ascari were only allowed to enter one KZR-1, selecting Lupberger, Collins and Bell to drive it; however, an accident caused by suspension failure after an hour, and 17 laps, forced the team to retire. Team Ascari's last entry of the season came at the Cadillac Grand Prix, but neither car competed in the race. Team Ascari were classified tenth in the ALMS Team's Championship, with 19 points.|$|E
25|$|Despite taking pole {{position}} {{in the first two}} rounds, mechanical problems halted his chances of victory. He spun numerous times in South Africa, and at Monaco, his engine blew up at the start, and the win went to his teammate Denny Hulme. At the Dutch Grand Prix, he scored his first podium of the season, with second place, behind Scotsman Jim Clark. He retired in the Belgian Grand Prix with another <b>blown</b> <b>engine.</b> He fixed this by winning the French Grand Prix at the Bugatti Circuit in Le Mans. He came fourth at the British Grand Prix, behind Chris Amon, his teammate Hulme, and Clark. At the German Grand Prix, he had a huge battle with Amon, and Brabham eventually finished ahead of the New Zealander, by only half a second. Hulme was the winner. At the first ever Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park, he took a huge win, ahead of Hulme, in cold and rainy conditions. At the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, Brabham had to finish second, only a few car lengths behind John Surtees, who took his last GP win. Hulme retired from the race, cutting the gap to 3 points between the two, as the circus headed for the United States, at Watkins Glen for the United States Grand Prix. Brabham outqualified his teammate, and finished fifth in the race, and with Hulme on the podium, this meant the championship chances were looking slim for Black Jack, as the circus went to Mexico for the championship deciding and final race of the season. Once again, Black Jack outqualified his teammate, and needed to win, with Hulme fifth or lower. But Jim Clark was simply too fast during the whole weekend, and dominated the race from pole to win, with Brabham finishing over 1 minute and 25 seconds behind. Hulme finished third, and so the New Zealander won the championship, while Brabham settled for second place. The team secured the Constructors' Championship, with 67 total points scored, and 23 points ahead of Lotus which scored a total of 44 points.|$|E
500|$|After Pearson had a {{successful}} test run, he qualified {{the car with the}} third fastest time behind Richard Petty and Joe Weatherly. Pearson raced his way into the lead early in the event and was the leader after the first round of pit stops. Pearson and Petty were the only two cars on the lead lap by a restart on the 311th lap (of 400). Petty made up six seconds on Pearson in 20 laps before Petty had to retire with a <b>blown</b> <b>engine.</b> Pearson held a three lap lead over Fireball Roberts and was leading late in the race until he ran over some debris on the backstretch and blew a tire with only two laps remaining.

500|$|Richmond {{fell ill}} {{the day after}} the 1986 NASCAR annual banquet during a promotional trip to New York City. He was not well enough to begin the 1987 NASCAR season despite lengthy {{hospitalization}} in Cleveland and further rest at home; when Richmond missed the Daytona 500, his condition was reported as double pneumonia. Media later reported that he had tested positive for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). He returned to Pocono for the Miller High Life 500 {{during the middle of the}} year. Starting third, he led by the fifth lap and ultimately led 82 laps, including the final 46, to win the race by eight car-lengths over Bill Elliott. In the middle of the race, Richmond's car suffered gearbox problems. Because he could use only fourth (high) gear, he had to use that gear to slowly exit the pits. Richmond was emotional after the victory, saying, [...] "I had tears in my eyes when I took the checkered flag. Then every time anyone congratulated me, I started bawling again." [...] Richmond earned a victory in the next race at Riverside, and made his final 1987 start at Michigan International Speedway's Champion Spark Plug 400 that August, finishing 29th with a <b>blown</b> <b>engine.</b> He resigned from Hendrick Motorsports in September 1987.|$|E
