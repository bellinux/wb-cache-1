40|$|The present work {{revealed}} the catalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) by synergistic effect of anhydride group and carbon-metal species {{for the first}} time. The doping of metal on graphene oxide produced 0. 50 mmol/g of carbon-metal species, and increased the amount of anhydride groups from 0. 49 to 5. 52 mmol/g. The obtained catalyst removed 30 % of NO (990 ppm) at 300 °C. However, at the same catalytic conditions, the catalyst showed no activity toward NO reduction if anhydride groups were removed. Similarly, although graphene oxide had anhydride groups, it still exhibited no activity {{without the help of}} carbon-metal species. Furthermore, the results of temperature-programmed decomposition indicated that the amounts of anhydride and carbon-metal species were closely related to the total removal amount of NO.

However, under the right conditions, oxidation can lead to oxide layers which can be applied e. g. as protective layers against corrosion, as insulating layers in microelectronic devices and as catalytic surfaces. On late transition metals, one reason for investigating oxygen induced structures has been due to the important role oxygen is believed to play in catalytic reactions, such as the CO conversion into CO 2 <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>catalytic</b> oxidation <b>process</b> on the metal surface.

40|$|We {{report an}} {{unprecedented}} insulator-to-metal transition of the Pd-nanoparticle-decorated, single vanadium dioxide nanowires {{caused by the}} heterogeneous H 2 -Pd catalytic reactions. Upon hydrogen gas exposure, the Pd-VO 2 heteronanostructure shows a remarkably large current increase (∼ 1000 -fold) at a temperature 10 C lower than the insulator-to-metal transition temperature in the bulk. This current increase occurs slowly over the duration of several seconds to several tens of seconds, depending on the Pd coverage, temperature, and hydrogen concentration. After hydrogen flow is shut off, the conductance is not immediately returned to the original value and it takes several hours, indicating that the atomic hydrogens, produced by the dissociative chemisorption on Pd, are incorporated into VO 2. From the electronic transport measurements and finite element analyses, we suggest that the slow transition is mainly due {{to the formation of}} alternating domains of metal and insulator regions of the VO 2 crystal lattice, produced by the generated heat via the exothermic <b>catalytic</b> <b>process.</b> The current response toward hydrogen gas is also found to be reversible after the heating process.

A preliminary attempt {{to treat the}} diluted wastewater with a single SBR resulted in ineffective removal of the color, ammonia, total organic carbon (TOC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Next, COP was applied as a pretreatment {{in order to obtain}} a bio-compatible wastewater for SBR treatment in a second step. The effectiveness of the COP pretreatment was assessed by evaluating wastewater biodegradability enhancement (the ratio of biology oxygen demand after 5 d (BOD 5) to COD), as well as monitoring the evolution of TOC, carbon oxidation state (COS), average oxidation state (AOS), color, and major pollutant concentrations with reaction time. In the COP, the catalyst preserved its catalytic properties even after 70 reuse cycles, exhibiting good durability and stability. The performance of SBR to treat COP effluent was also examined. At an organic loading rate of 2. 0 kg COD/(m 3 ·d), with hydraulic retention time (HRT) = 10 h and temperature (30 ± 2) °C, the average removal efficiencies of NH 3 -N, COD, BOD 5, TOC, and color in a coupled COP/SBR process were about 80 %, 95. 8 %, 93. 8 %, 97. 6 % and 99. 3 %, respectively, with average effluent concentrations of 10 mg/L, 128 mg/L, 27. 5 mg/L, 25. 0 mg/L, and 20 multiples, respectively, which were all consistent with the national standards for secondary discharge of industrial wastewater into a public sewerage system (GB 8978 - 1996).

30|$|Glycerol {{acts as a}} top {{building}} block that probably serves as an important biorefinery feedstock [1, 2]. In addition, it is a byproduct from the production of biodiesel from vegetable oils [3]. Conversion of glycerol into valuable chemicals <b>by</b> <b>a</b> green <b>catalytic</b> <b>process</b> is <b>a</b> challenging area of present research. Glycerol is normally generated {{at the rate of}} 1  mol for every 3  mol of methyl esters synthesized [4]. Hydrogenolysis of glycerol is <b>a</b> <b>catalytic</b> chemical reaction that breaks a chemical bond in an organic molecule with the simultaneous addition of a hydrogen atom to the resulting molecular fragments. Through the selective hydrogenolysis of glycerol in the presence of metallic catalysts and hydrogen, 1, 2 -propanediol (1, 2 -PD), 1, 3 -propanediol (1, 3 -PD), and ethylene glycol (EG) could be obtained [5]. Therefore, catalytic hydrogenolysis of glycerol is another alternative route to increase the profitability of biodiesel production plants as the products of glycerol hydrogenolysis can easily replace the chemical compounds, which at present are industrially produced mainly by using non-renewable sources. Propanediol, i.e., 1, 2 -PD, a three-carbon diol with a stereogenic center at the central carbon atom, is an important medium-value commodity chemical with a 4  % annual growth in the market size. It is used for polyester resins, liquid detergents, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, tobacco humectants, flavors and fragrances, personal care, paints, animal feed, antifreeze, etc. [6]. Traditionally, it is produced by the hydration of propylene oxide derived from propylene by either the chlorohydrin process or the hydroperoxide process. There has been a rapid expansion of the market for 1, 2 -PD as an antifreeze and de-icing agent because of the growing concern over the toxicity of ethylene glycol-based products to humans and animals. 1, 3 -PD is also another product obtained during glycerol hydrogenolysis, which is a high-value specialty chemical that is mainly used in specialty polyester fibers, films, and coatings. 1, 3 -PD is copolymerized with terephthalic acid to produce the polyester SORONA 1 from DuPont, or CORTERRA 1 from Shell, which has unique properties in terms of chemical resistance, light stability, elastic recovery, and dyeability [7, 8]. 1, 3 -PD is currently catalytically produced [9].

The controllable spontaneous conversion of thin films into nanowires for large area production is investigated. The synthesis is found to depend critically on the thickness of V 2 O 5 layer. We have controlled that the nanowires that are single crystal vanadium dioxide can be grown with thickness of V 2 O 5 thin film and also we can synthesize VO 2 nanowires to various directions on the substrate. By using the patterned substrate, we can not only control the numerous VO 2 nanowire morphologies but also fabricate the guided growth of millimeter-long VO 2 nanowires. In the part 2, we report the high effective hydrogen gas sensor based on the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) by the electro-thermally induced Palladium-nanoparticles-decorated VO 2 nanowire prepared by the efficient and size-controllable growth method originated from V 2 O 5 thin film driven. We have many experiments for improved hydrogen gas detector based on the MIT. First by doping the tungsten we showed that the MIT temperature was reduced to about 40 °C. Second <b>by</b> irradiating <b>a</b> well-defined electron beam into the nanowires, we could considerably increase the conductivity up to 4 times with only a modest change in the MIT temperature (< 2 °C). When exposed to trace amounts of hydrogen gas in a single nanowire configuration, the enhanced conductivity gave rise to about two times as fast transition to metallic phase even near room temperature (35 °C), by reaching much faster (3 x) a critical current density at which the self-heating initiates. Last, especially Palladium-VO 2 nanowire near-corshell nanostructure shows remarkably large current increase at a temperature 10 °C lower than the MIT temperature in the bulk. This current increase occurs slowly over the duration of several seconds to several tens of seconds, depending on the Pd coverage, temperature, and hydrogen concentration.

The aqueous carbohydrate solutions were prepared by both hydrolysis in hot water and hydrolysis with dilute acids (H 2 SO 4, oxalic acid). The aqueous carbohydrate solutions were a mixture of xylose, water soluble hemicellulose oligomers, acetic acid, glucose, glucose oligomers, and probably some lignin polymers. Hydrolysis with hot water produced primarily hemicellulose oligomers whereas hydrolysis with acids produced mainly xylose and acetic acid. The hydrolysis co-product was a solid enriched in cellulose and lignin. The aqueous streams were hydrodeoxygenated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> two step <b>catalytic</b> <b>process</b> in which the first catalyst bed contained a Ru/C catalyst at 393 K and the second catalyst bed contained a Pt/zirconium phosphate (Pt/ZrP) catalyst at 518 K.

The two stage process was able to convert the aqueous carbohydrate streams derived from maple wood into gasoline range products with carbon yields of up to 57 % and an estimated octane number of 96. 5. No significant catalyst deactivation was observed indicating that the catalysts are very stable.
