5|$|The {{cause of}} IIH is not known.

5|$|The {{most common}} cancers {{in the brain}} come from {{elsewhere}} in the body – most commonly the lung, breast and skin. Cancers of <b>brain</b> <b>tissue</b> can also occur, and originate from any tissue {{in and around the}} brain. Meningioma, cancer of the meninges around the brain, is more common than cancers of <b>brain</b> <b>tissue.</b> Cancers within the brain may cause symptoms related to their size or position, with symptoms including headache and nausea, or the gradual development of focal symptoms such as gradual difficulty seeing, swallowing, talking, or as a change of mood. Cancers are in general investigated through the use of CT scans and MRI scans. A variety of other tests including blood tests and lumbar puncture may be used to investigate for the cause of the cancer and evaluate the type and stage of the cancer. The corticosteroid dexamethasone is often given to decrease the swelling of <b>brain</b> <b>tissue</b> around a tumour. Surgery may be considered, however given the complex nature of many tumours or based on tumour stage or type, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be considered more suitable.|$|E

Samples consisted of animal feeds (19 samples of fodder and 6 samples of feed), 31 samples of sera and 25 samples of <b>brain</b> <b>tissues</b> of dairy cattle collected from Lembang, West Java. Feeds and fodders were collected from dairy farms located in Lembang.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} pathological changes in <b>brain</b> <b>tissues</b> of Frisien Holstein dairy cattle affected by organophosphate (OP). The study was directed to anticipate spongiform encephalopathy. Samples consisted of animal feeds, sera and <b>brain</b> <b>tissues</b> were collected from Lembang, West Java. Animal feeds (fodders and commercial feed) were collected directly from the dairy farms around Lembang. Sera (31 samples) were from dairy cattle owned by the local farmers and <b>brain</b> <b>tissues</b> were from the local animal slaughter house. Pesticide residues were analysed following a standard procedure using gas chromatography (GC). There was an interaction between pesticide residues in animal feeds, residue level of pesticides in sera and <b>brain</b> <b>tissues</b> to cause encephalopathy in dairy cattle. Pesticide contamination in animal feeds was regarded as the source of encephalopathy in dairy cattle. The total average of OP residues (16. 8 ppb) were lower than organochlorines/OC (18. 7 ppb) in fodder, showing that pesticides were originated from the contaminated soils. On the other hand, the total average of OP residues in commercial feeds (12. 0 ppb), sera (85. 6 ppb) and <b>brain</b> <b>tissues</b> (22. 7 ppb) were higher than OC (1. 8; 16. 7; and 5. 1 ppb).

40|$|Abstract — Classification of <b>brain</b> <b>tissues</b> is {{becoming}} an increasingly useful tool for investigating the aging brain or disease-induced brain alterations. Numerous strategies have been proposed to classify <b>brain</b> <b>tissues</b> into white matter (WM), gray matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). How-ever, many of them fail when classifying specific regions with low contrast between tissues (e. g. cerebellum gray and white matter). Erroneous classification may lead to volume over- or under-estimation, thus leading to equivocal interpretations. In this work, instead of using gray scale images (T 1 -MPRAGE) to classify <b>brain</b> <b>tissues,</b> we use an improved pseudo multispectral classification (PMC) technique using CIE XYZ spaces and iterative K-mean clustering {{in order to enhance}} classification of the brain GM, WM and CSF.

Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges that separate the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers.

5|$|Brain AVMs may be {{detected}} on computed tomography angiography (CTA or CT angio) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA); CTA is better in showing the vessels themselves, and MRA provides more {{detail about the}} relationship between an AVM and surrounding <b>brain</b> <b>tissue.</b> In general, MRI is recommended. Various types of vascular malformations may be encountered: AVMs, micro-AVMs, telangiectasias and arteriovenous fistulas. If surgery, embolization, or other treatment is contemplated (see below), cerebral angiography may be required to get sufficient detail of the vessels. This procedure carries a small risk of stroke (0.5%) and is therefore limited to specific circumstances. Recent professional guidelines recommend that all children with suspected or definite HHT undergo a brain MRI early in life to identify AVMs that can cause major complications. Others suggest that screening for cerebral AVMs is probably unnecessary in those who are not experiencing any neurological symptoms, because most lesions discovered on screening scans would not require treatment, creating undesirable conundrums.|$|E
