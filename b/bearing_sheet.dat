40|$|Natural {{deformation}} in carbonate mylonites <b>bearing</b> <b>sheet</b> silicates occurs via {{a complex}} interaction of granular flow and solution transfer processes and involves continuous cycles of dissolution, grain boundary diffusion, nucleation and growth. In this way, new sheet silicates (a) nucleate within voids formed by grain boundary sliding of calcite grains. (b) grow, and (c) rotate towards the shear plane. As a consequence, small mica grains show {{a wide range}} of orientations with respect to the shear plane, but moderate to large grains are subparallel both {{to each other and to}} the shear plane. Increases of average grain sizes with increasing temperature of sheet silicates in mica-rich layers is more pronounced than in mica-poor layers. In the calcitic matrix however, sheet silicates can only grow via solution-precipitation and mass transfer processes. Therefore, the observed grain size variability indicates drastic differences in mass transfer behavior between the individual layers, which might be related to differences in the fluid flux. Based on these observations, a conceptual model for the microfabric evolution in sheet silicate bearing mylonites is presented. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Foil gas {{bearings}} are self-acting hydrodynamic <b>bearings</b> {{made from}} <b>sheet</b> metal foils comprised {{of at least}} two layers. The innermost top foil layer traps a gas pressure film that supports a load while a layer or layers underneath provide an elastic foundation. Foil bearings are used in many lightly loaded, high-speed turbo-machines such as compressors used for aircraft pressurization, and small micro-turbines. Foil gas bearings provide a means to eliminate the oil system leading to reduced weight and enhanced temperature capability. The general lack of familiarity of the foil bearing design and manufacturing process has hindered their widespread dissemination. This paper reviews the publicly available literature to demonstrate the design, fabrication and performance testing of both first and second generation bump style foil bearings. It is anticipated that this paper may serve as an effective starting point for new development activities employing foil bearing technology...|$|R

30|$|Among {{the various}} systems {{composed}} only of carbon 5 atoms, graphene (a two-dimensional allotrope of carbon) presents {{a framework for}} understanding of the properties of all other carbon allotropes. The properties of graphene, including a high intrinsic mobility[1, 2], a large theoretical specific surface area, and a high chemical stability, are potentially useful in applications ranging from chemical sensors to transistors[3 – 8]. Toward exploiting these unique properties of graphene, several research groups have attempted to fabricate large-scaled graphene oxide sheets[9 – 12]. Graphene oxide (GO) is a layered material consisting of hydrophilic oxygenated graphene oxide <b>sheets</b> <b>bearing</b> oxygen functional groups on their basal planes and edges[13]. It is a useful platform for fabricating functionalized graphene that can potentially confer improved mechanical, thermal, or electronic properties. The numerous chemical functionalities on a GO surface are expected to readily lend themselves to further chemical functionalization. Graphene-based materials, therefore, show promise {{in a variety of}} technological applications. The use of GO surfaces as catalysts of synthetic transformations is a relatively new research area with outstanding potential. Current efforts are directed toward harnessing the oxygen carriers present on GO surfaces as heterogeneous catalysts[14 – 16].|$|R
40|$|Air-foil {{bearings}} (AFBs) are {{self acting}} hydrodynamic <b>bearings</b> made from <b>sheet</b> metal foils comprised {{of at least}} two layers. The innermost “top foil” layer traps a gas pressure film that supports a load while the layer or layers underneath provide an elastic foundation. AFBs are currently used in many commercial applications, both terrestrial and in aerospace. AFBs provide a means to eliminate the oil system leading to reduce weight and enhanced temperature capability. Regardless of the application of the AFBs, the identification of the structural characteristics is important for successful design practice. In the present work, structural characteristics (stiffness and damping) of axial AFBs are indentified in the light of experimental results. Due to the initial high torque requirement of the AFB, the experimental setup using a single AFB is proposed instead of standard two-foil bearing setups. Experiments are carried out at maximum speed of 60, 000 rpm. Sub-structuring approach is used for identification of the structural (stiffness and damping) characteristics of the AFB. The results have shown that the developed experimental procedure is able to identify the stiffness and damping characteristics of axial AFBs accurately...|$|R

40|$|The Masonite Flexible Building (MFB) {{system is}} a {{complete}} timber building system for commercial and residential multi-storey houses. The system is subdivided into two market variants; XL and Light. The XL version is for tall and large buildings with long floor spans while the Light version is adapted for smaller buildings with lower loads. Though differing in technical performance, the functional criteria are the same for both variants. The MFB system uses prefabricated wall, floor and roof elements which are delivered in flat packages and erected on the construction site. The MFB system might be classified as a panel construction, where the load-carrying structure consists of composite light-weight timber I-beams mechanically integrated with a composite laminated wood panel called PlyBoard™. The Ibeams and the panel form a strong and rigid carcass for wall and floor elements, making the system well suited for high rise construction. A key feature of the MFB system is the connection technique which enables swift erection of the system units on site. The plyboard panels are provided with a continuous slot along the periphery. The slot {{is used as a}} general connection interface for the joining of the wall elements. The floor elements are suspended and hooked onto the <b>bearing</b> walls using <b>sheet</b> steel hangers, allowing swift assembling of the floor deck and enabling direct vertical wall-towallload transfer parallel to grain.
