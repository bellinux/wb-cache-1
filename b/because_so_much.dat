5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{it being}} a simpler project due to the {{original}} art being reusable {{turned out to be}} untrue: <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time had passed since the original's release, there were multiple parts that had to be reworked, leading to a process similar to creating a whole new game from scratch. All character graphics were redone, special effects were changed, and certain animations were added, such as sleeping animations. Some item placements were changed, the overall difficulty was adjusted, and some characters' battle statistics were altered; one such instance was making Kechi stronger than Oryu, due to it being perceived as illogical that a person with a sword would be weaker than a person fighting with her bare hands.|$|E

The Pentagon would not reconsider Rascon's case <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time had elapsed. Therefore, Rascon's comrades sought the help of Congressman Lane Evans from Illinois.

25|$|General Knox {{planned to}} have four 3-pound or 6-pound cannons {{attached}} to each infantry brigade. Though Knox liked the versatile French 4-pound cannon, he had to abandon a plan to adopt it <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> ammunition and equipment for the other guns were readily available. Knox also created an artillery park of two 24-pound cannons, four 12-pound cannons, four 8-inch howitzers, eight 5.5-inch howitzers, and 10 smaller field guns. Rotating between the infantry brigades, the artillery park, and garrisons, the artillery companies received training in different areas. Knox's tactical theory discouraged artillery duels and urged his gunners to direct their fire on infantry targets. This tactic was highly effective at Monmouth.|$|E
25|$|According to {{official}} statistics, Chechnya's {{unemployment rate in}} August 2009 was 32.9%. Although the second highest among Russian regions, the unemployment rate has almost halved since 2007. Many people remain homeless <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of Chechnya's housing was destroyed by the Russian federal forces and many people {{have not yet been}} given compensation. Not only the social (such as housing and hospitals) and economic infrastructure but also the foundations of culture and education, including most of educational and cultural institutions, were destroyed {{over the course of the}} two wars in Chechnya. However ongoing reconstruction efforts have been rebuilding the region at a quick pace over the past few years, including new housing, facilities, paved roads and traffic lights, a new mosque, and restoration of electricity to much of the region. Governmental, social and commercial life remain hobbled by bribery, kidnapping, extortion and other criminal activity; reports by the Russian government estimate that the organized crime sector is twice the Russian average and the government is widely perceived to be corrupt and unresponsive.|$|E

[...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming for {{the season}} began on August 31, and ended on December 19, 2015, with Edward J. Pei serving as {{director}} of photography. Unlike the first season, episodes were filmed concurrently, two at a time. Discussing the series' location move, Head of Marvel Television Jeph Loeb explained that [...] "Agent Carter season one took place in New York in 1946. It wasn't like {{we could go to}} New York and find 1946, so we shot in L.A. But that's {{part of the reason that}} when we talked about it, we said, 'You know what? This season let's stay in L.A.' <b>Because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of L.A. still looks like it did in 1946." [...] Butters expanded by saying the move to L.A. [...] "was something we had talked about in the middle of the first season... we realized that not only was it a good idea for the storytelling, but also...it's much easier for us to shoot L.A. for L.A. than try to shoot L.A. for New York." [...] She added the season hoped to film at Musso & Frank Grill, the Formosa Cafe, the Griffith Observatory, racetracks, piers, and other locations in Downtown Los Angeles.|$|E
500|$|<b>Because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{was changed}} in AM2R {{compared}} to the original Metroid II, with color, a larger screen, [...] "less claustrophobic" [...] caves and new gameplay controls, Guasti was {{faced with the challenge}} of recreating the original's feeling of danger within a more modern style: the original Metroid II featured [...] "tight-quarters combat", while AM2R greater amount of screen space and mobility meant that the Metroids' behavior had to be changed. They were made more agile and aggressive, with the intent that players would have to use all tools available to them to defeat them. The scale of the rooms throughout the game world also had to be changed, with some landmarks being redesigned to make better use of the larger screen; some, however, were kept similar in size to their Metroid II counterparts. While the game's first areas were made colorful and accurate to their counterparts in Metroid II, later areas were expanded and introduced new elements, featuring progressively darker caves, tighter passages, and Metroids found in more dangerous locations. This, along with increasingly darker and menacing music, was to recreate the feeling of Metroid II, which Guasti described as [...] "being lost in a dark, mysterious cave without knowing what's ahead". The added log system was designed to deliver narrative in a non-intrusive way.|$|E
500|$|In March 2001, Clemmons {{violated}} parole by committing aggravated {{robbery and}} theft again in Ouachita County. He was convicted on July 13, 2001 {{and sentenced to}} 10 years in prison. He faced charges of parole violations, but due to problems with the case, he was not served with the charges until 2004. His attorney argued the parole violation charges should be dropped <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> time had passed, and they were subsequently dismissed. Clemmons was granted parole on the robbery charges in 2004. He told the parole board he was [...] "not ready" [...] {{the first time he}} was released, but that he [...] "doesn't want to die in prison" [...] and will [...] "try to do the right thing". Clemmons moved to Washington in 2004 while still on parole, which was approved by Arkansas authorities. That year, he married a woman named Nicole Smith, although The Seattle Times later reported the relationship had [...] "been tumultuous". He was placed {{under the supervision of the}} Washington State Department of Corrections and classified as [...] "high risk to reoffend". His supervision was to continue until October 2015. He lived in Tacoma, where he ran a landscaping and power-washing business out of his house. Over the next five years, Clemmons bought six houses, including one in Arkansas and five in Washington.|$|E

500|$|In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and {{recording}} OK Computer in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near Didcot, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline {{that contributed to}} the stress of The Bends, the band still had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: [...] "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> work had gone into them." [...] The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly [...] "the loudest voice" [...] according to O'Brien. Selway said [...] "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, {{but at the same time}} we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." [...] Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead [...] "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." [...] Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's [...] "sixth member", an allusion to George Martin's nickname as the [...] "fifth Beatle".|$|E
500|$|... "Cherokee Rose" [...] {{attained}} favorable {{reviews from}} television critics. Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, {{and felt that}} it gave an accurate depiction of the characters. He opined: [...] "I {{had a problem with}} the show's tendency to wander into cul-de-sacs in the first season, mainly <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of it felt redundant, the work of writers who had no real idea how to construct narrative television. But this season, I'm starting to think they're getting a handle on things, and [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] is the sort of episode I'd like to see more off [...] as The Walking Dead continues." [...] Paste Josh Jackson asserted that the episode was superior to preceding installments, describing it as [...] "simply a catch of breath." [...] Similarly, Josh Wigler of MTV evaluated that despite less violence than usual, the quality of [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] improved from the previous episode. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed analogous sentiments, and argued that while the show's character still need more development, the development displayed in the episode was a [...] "definite {{step in the right direction}} on that front." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings concluded that the episode contained many powerful scenes. Eric Goldman of IGN was critical of the episode, ultimately giving it a seven out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "good" [...] rating. Goldman felt that [...] "Cherokee Rose" [...] was a disappointment, citing that it lack any focus or direction. Henry Hanks, writing for CNN, said that the episode was the weakest of the season.|$|E
500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if I had any foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E

500|$|Reynolds' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed. VanDerWerff professed {{that he was}} surprised that it was executed well, as he avouched that shows featuring guest appearances ruin the chemistry of the main cast. [...] "Episodes with big special guest stars can often ruin {{the rhythm of the}} main gang, but I was surprised at how readily the show incorporated Reynolds into the storyline, {{to the point where he}} almost felt like an organic part of the ensemble," [...] avouched VanDerWerff. [...] "The fact that he's still dating Malory at the end of the episode implies that he might pop back in as the season proceeds, and I wouldn't be adverse to that happening, where many special guest stars might make me roll my eyes in irritation." [...] He praised the chemistry between Reynolds and Benjamin, and commended Reynolds for having the will power to poke fun at himself. Carp echoed similar sentiments; [...] "H. Jon Benjamin alone is a voice-over superstar [...] but combined with Reynolds and the rest of the cast, that was some animated magic and a fantastic way to kick off the third season." [...] Bonaime thought that Reynolds was [...] "fine with being self-deprecating, and he gives some fantastic moments with Archer." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall enjoyed how Reynolds was utilized in [...] "The Man from Jupiter". [...] "There are times when it can feel awkward when a show spends an episode sucking up to a very special guest star, but it worked here <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> of Archer's personality—and so much of the show's approach to action—feels inspired by all those movies Reynolds did in the '70s and early '80s when he was the biggest movie star in the world.|$|E
500|$|There was a {{widespread}} debate among {{fans of the}} series as to who the character {{coming out of the}} closet would be, also similar to how they years earlier debated who shot the character Mr. Burns. Matt Groening joked at the Comic-Con convention that [...] "it's Homer". Many fans correctly guessed that it would be one of Homer's sisters-in-law, either Patty or Selma, while others believed it to be Waylon Smithers. It had for a long time been hinted on the show that the Smithers character was gay and in love with his boss Mr. Burns. However, as The Baltimore Sun writes, it would have been unlikely for Smithers to be the outed character because {{it would not have been}} a surprise to fans, and his love for his heterosexual boss would prevent him from marrying another person. Patty was suspected by fans and the press because she had not often been seen dating men on the show. The tabloid newspaper The Sun revealed already in September 2004 that the character who would come out was Patty, though this was regarded as a rumor and Jean would not confirm it. Bookmakers in the United States and the United Kingdom took bets on which character would be uncovered as homosexual, and if there would be a kiss featured in the episode—BetUS laid odds at four to five that it was Patty, while Smithers had four to one odds and Ned Flanders fifteen to one odds. A kiss was given odds of seven to five. BetUS said gamblers made more than 900 bets on the coming-out on their website. According to The Baltimore Sun, another betting site named PaddyPower.com [...] "stopped taking wagers <b>because</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money was being placed on [...]" [...] Jean told The Advocate that he thought it was [...] "an insane thing for someone to take bets on a result that can be determined by other people", referring to the Simpsons staff, [...] "and could be changed by them at the last minute." ...|$|E
