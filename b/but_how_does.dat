2500|$|An [...] "observer" [...] may {{say that}} the {{resolution}} of love was lacking because the marriage didn't work out <b>but</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> the observer know that? Perhaps [...] "it wanted a rebirth of erotic love" [...] or of [...] "earnestness". [...] A poet looks for the [...] "rare individual" [...] in order to demonstrate love's rebirth. Kierkegaard almost married Regine Olsen but changed his mind. Perhaps {{he wanted her to}} help him in his vocation as a writer just as Lillian Marvin Swenson helped her husband David and Edna H. Hong helped Howard V Hong later in life. He used that experience to build himself up rather than tear himself down. He places the responsibility on the individual listener, reader, watcher, or [...] "doer". [...] He stated his idea of hope and courage in the face of doubt in his Journals and again in this book.|$|E
2500|$|<b>But</b> <b>how</b> <b>does</b> Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses {{with his}} ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that {{standards}} of value are internal or immanent: to live well is to fully express one's power, {{to go to}} the limits of one's potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates persons from what they can do. To affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, we must overturn established identities and so become all that we can become—though we cannot know what that is in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity. [...] "Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?" ...|$|E
