In addition, fragrance and antibacterial agents can be included.

50|$|After {{the cells}} are constructed, {{conventional}} assembly system uses a robot {{to place the}} cells into a grid of 6 columns of 10 cells - other arrangements are used, but rare outside commercial settings. As they are placed, wiring consisting of a strip of silver is woven between the cells and soldered to the connectors {{on the front and}} back. A small amount of space is required between the cells to allow the strips to pass over and under the cells. The layout takes place on top of a plastic sheet known as the <b>backsheet,</b> and the cells and wiring are glued to the sheet as the assembly advances. When the glue dries, the resulting laminate is ready for assembly into a panel, which consists of gluing the cell side of the laminate to a glass sheet, adding a junction box for electrical connections, and adding an aluminum frame around the outside for mechanical robustness. Different assembly systems may use different steps, but the end result is a glass sheet on top, cells and wiring in the middle, and the <b>backsheet</b> on the back.|$|E
50|$|Conventional c-Si solar cells, {{normally}} wired in series, are encapsulated in a {{solar module}} {{to protect them}} from the weather. The module consists of a tempered glass as cover, a soft and flexible encapsulant, a rear <b>backsheet</b> made of a weathering and fire-resistant material and an aluminium frame around the outer edge. Electrically connected and mounted on a supporting structure, solar modules build a string of modules, often called solar panel. A solar array consists of one or many such panels. A photovoltaic array, or solar array, is a linked collection of solar panels. The power that one module can produce is seldom enough to meet requirements of a home or a business, so the modules are linked together to form an array. Most PV arrays use an inverter to convert the DC power produced by the modules into alternating current that can power lights, motors, and other loads. The modules in a PV array are usually first connected in series to obtain the desired voltage; the individual strings are then connected in parallel to allow the system to produce more current. Solar panels are typically measured under STC (standard test conditions) or PTC (PVUSA test conditions), in watts. Typical panel ratings range from less than 100 watts to over 400 watts. The array rating consists of a summation of the panel ratings, in watts, kilowatts, or megawatts.|$|E

The advantage of BIPV system is its multi-functionality; they fulfil the functions of a building envelope with {{the added benefit of}} generating power by replacing the traditional roofing and façade materials with PV that generate power. In this thesis, different types of PV cells and modules have been described in detail with their efficiencies and usage trends in the last decade. The different BIPV products for roof and façade are discussed in detail giving several examples. The electricity generation potential of BIPV in selected countries is compared with their actual electricity consumption. Further, the avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with electricity generation from traditional sources and transportation and distribution (T&D) losses are calculated. The results illustrate huge savings in GHGs. In BIPV different types of façade and <b>backsheets</b> are used. In this thesis, selected <b>backsheets</b> and façade were characterized in terms of their surface structure identification using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-ATR), scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and physical characterization using surface energy measurements. By using FTIR-ATR, surface polymeric materials were identified and with SEM-EDX, identification of the surface elements was possible. Surface energy measurements were useful in finding the adhesives and knowing the surface energies of the various <b>backsheets</b> and façade.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that using halved silicon wafer solar cells in a photovoltaic (PV) module is {{an efficient way to}} reduce cell-to-module resistive losses. In this work we have shown that PV modules using halved cells additionally show an improvement in their optical performance, resulting in a higher current generation. We attribute this increase in current to gains in light reflected from the <b>backsheet</b> area. An optical model is presented that quantitatively determines the influence of the <b>backsheet</b> on the short-circuit current of a PV module. We find that, for an accurate prediction, several factors have to be taken into account, including the geometry of the module, the backscattering properties of the <b>backsheet</b> and the illumination spectrum. Particularly the angularly and spectrally resolved scattering properties of the <b>backsheet</b> are shown to have a large impact on the current generation. Furthermore, light beam induced current (LBIC) measurements are used to test the backscattering properties of the <b>backsheet</b> and also the influence of the illumination spectrum. LBIC measurements are also used to verify the simulation results, giving good agreement. Thus the design of a PV module can be optimized by simulation.

The {{performance of}} fielded modules and components can be compared with the performance in durability tests using other <b>backsheet</b> materials including polyethylene terephthalate. Accelerated testing protocols are described including UV exposure based on solar irradiance in different climates and relevant albedo levels for exposure of the back of PV modules. The change in critical performance properties in durability tests including damp heat and UV is compared with backsheets that are extracted from fielded modules. Analysis of mechanical and chemical properties of the inner and outer layers of backsheets that are removed from fielded modules is examined. Area-specific coring techniques that are followed by layer composition analysis were also used to understand fielded module failure mechanisms/defects.

40|$|The composition, {{properties}} {{and construction of}} a <b>backsheet</b> has a direct bearing on its functional performance in a photovoltaic module. Typically, the performance properties are examined under fixed stress conditions and the performance and stability of backsheets to these stress conditions are studied. But exposure to the outdoor environment involves stresses acting sequentially and simultaneously. The effect of these stresses should be applied to modules as well as components to adequately assess their impact on performance and durability. To better understand the expected performance in the field, we have examined established and new <b>backsheet</b> constructions and characterized their initial {{properties and}} durability under the usual accelerated test stressors (heat, humidity, UV, temperature cycling) and under conditions where these stressors are applied sequentially or simultaneously. We have also investigated performance of materials under new stress conditions that may better simulate the operation of a PV module in the outdoor environment.

40|$|Simple diffuse rear reflectors {{can enhance}} the light path length of weakly absorbed near {{infrared}} light in silicon solar cells and set a benchmark for more complex and expensive light trapping structures like dielectric gratings or plasmonic particles. We analyzed such simple diffuse rear reflectors systematically by optical and electrical measurements. We applied white paint, TiO 2 nanoparticles, white <b>backsheets</b> and a silver mirror to bifacial silicon solar cells and measured the enhancement of the external quantum efficiency for three different solar cell geometries: planar front and rear side, textured front and planar rear side, and textured front and rear side. We showed that an air-gap between the solar cell and the reflector decreases the absorption enhancement significantly, thus white paint and TiO 2 nanoparticles directly applied to the rear cell surface lead to the highest short circuit current density enhancements. The short circuit current density gains for a 200 mu m thick planar solar cell reached up to 1. 8 mA/cm(2), compared to a non-reflecting black rear side and up to 0. 8 mA/cm(2) compared to a high-quality silver mirror rear side.

40|$|In {{order to}} make the bifacial yield {{prediction}} models commercially available, a lot of work their development, improvement and validation is being done by many research institutes. At Energy research center of the Netherlands (ECN), one such model is under development. In this project, couple of aspects were investigated to give better insight into improving the model. The two main aspects of the model that were investigated were the rear irradiance estimation and the temperature prediction of the model. Analysis of rear irradiance aspect of the bifacial yield model through simulations at low tilt angles and elevations should in practice result low rear irradiance but the results showed the opposite. From the literature, a new factor called acceptance was implemented in the rear irradiance model which led to correction in estimation of rear irradiance. For the temperature model, initially indoor measurements of three laminates of bifacial cells and three laminates of monofacial cells were performed under solar simulator. The experiment resulted in finding differences in measured and cell temperatures for all six laminates. According to measured temperatures, the bifacial cell laminates were hotter than their monofacial counterparts, which may not be correct due to higher absorption of irradiance by <b>backsheets</b> in bifacial cell laminates. The differences in calculated cell temperature and measured temperature were investigated and were found to be different. The heating behavior of all laminates was modelled and heat capacity and heat transfer coefficient found through modelling were found to be in good agreement with literature values. Outdoor measurements were used for temperature analysis of bifacial panels and again the differences in calculated cell temperature and measured temperature were found. Non-steady state temperature model was found to be more accurate for low resolution meteorological and insolation data of less than ten minutes as compared to the steady state model used by current ECN model. The difference between measured and cell temperature was translated in terms of heat transfer coefficient and for this difference, the annual energy yield results showed a variation of 1. 45 %. The results of the project showed improvement of the bifacial yield model by ECN through an improved rear irradiance estimation.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the optical performance of PV modules {{with respect to}} an increase in short circuit current density. Our evaluation is based on the combination of ray tracing simulations and measurements on test modules with four types of backsheets: Two of them are structured, the third is white and diffusively reflecting and the fourth reflects no light. Under normal incidence, structured backsheets reflect incoming light at an angle that causes total internal reflection at the glass/air interface, which guides the light to the solar cell surface. Three different irradiance conditions are studied: a) standard testing conditions (STC) with light incident perpendicular to the module surface, b) variation in the angle of incidence and c) light source with mean annual distribution of angles of incidence. Using the measured refractive index data in ray tracing simulations we find a short circuit current density (Jsc) gain of up to 0. 9 mA/cm 2 (2. 3 %) for monofacial cells and a structured <b>backsheet,</b> when compared to a white <b>backsheet</b> with diffuse reflection. For bifacial cells we calculate an even larger Jsc increase of 1. 4 mA/cm 2 (3. 6 %). The Jsc increase is larger for bifacial cells, since some light is transmitted through the cells and thus more light interacts with the <b>backsheet.</b> Our optical loss analysis reveals the best performance in STC for edge-aligned Ag grooves. This structure reduces absorption losses from 1. 8 mA/cm 2 to 0. 3 mA/cm and reflection losses from 0. 7 mA/cm to 0 mA/cm. This trend also holds under various angles of incidence as confirmed consistently by Jsc measurements and ray racing simulations. Simulations using an annual light source emitting a mean annual distribution of angles of incidence reveal grooves in both orientations edge alignment and east-west alignment achieve similar current gains of up to 1. 5 % for mono- and of 2. 5 % for bifacial cells compared to modules with white back sheets. This indicates that for modules with light guiding structures such as these backsheets optimization for STC differs from optimization for annul yield...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} proposing and {{analyzing}} an electric {{energy storage system}} fully integrated with a photovoltaic PV module, composed {{by a set of}} lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO 4) flat batteries, which constitutes a generation-storage PV unit. The batteries were surface-mounted on {{the back side of the}} PV module, distant from the PV <b>backsheet,</b> without exceeding the PV frame size. An additional low-emissivity sheet was introduced to shield the batteries from the <b>backsheet</b> thermal irradiance. The challenge addressed in this paper is to evaluate the PV cell temperature increase, due to the reduced thermal exchanges on the back of the module, and to estimate the temperature of the batteries, verifying their thermal constraints. Two one-dimensional (1 D) thermal models, numerically implemented by using the thermal library of Simulink-Matlab accounting for all the heat exchanges, are here proposed: one related to the original PV module, the other related to the portion of the area of the PV module in correspondence of the proposed energy-storage system. Convective and radiative coefficients were then calculated in relation to different configurations and ambient conditions. The model validation has been carried out considering the PV module to be at the nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT), and by specific experimental measurements with a thermographic camera. Finally, appropriate models were used to evaluate the increasing cell batteries temperature in different environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} has been performed on the Sandia Hypervelocity Launcher to determine the performance limits of conventional Whipple shields against representative 0. 8 g aluminum orbital debris plate-like fragments with velocities of 7 and 10 km/s. Supporting diagnostics include flash X-rays, high speed photography and transient digitizers for timing correlation. Two Whipple shield designs were tested with either a 0. 030 cm or a 0. 127 cm thick front sheet and a 0. 407 cm thick <b>backsheet</b> separated by 30. 5 cm. These two designs bracket the ballistic penetration limit curve for protection against these debris simulants for 7 km/s impacts...|$|E
