The journalist Gritz noted that Goldhagen [...] "does not cushion his criticisms of the Church in diplomatic language", that [...] "even philosophy professor John K. Roth, who favorably reviewed A Moral Reckoning in the Los Angeles Times, said that the adjectives [...] "unpretentious ... indecisive ... moderate ... patient" [...] do not come to mind when reading Goldhagen.

He explains: [...] "Since I never once referred to 'liberalism', called no one a 'Jewish anti-Semite' or 'self-hating Jew', said nothing about Democrats or the Iraq war, and made no attempt to 'silence' anyone, this Kafkaesque <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>indictment</b> makes me wonder what is at play here – illiteracy, dishonesty, or worse? As Bret Stephens recently put it, 'How does joining a debate become an effort to suppress it?' Rosenfeld denied it, stating that, [...] "Nobody's being silenced.... I think its a red herring to talk about silencing, this debate in fact is evidence of a robust and open discussion".|$|E
2500|$|Stortorget was {{the scene}} of the Stockholm Bloodbath in November 1520, when, during three days, the Danish-Swedish king Christian II {{beheaded}} and hanged 90 people. [...] This deed was accomplished notwithstanding the reprieve proclaimed by Queen Christina Gyllenstierna following four months of Danish siege. Nevertheless, the Danish king wasn't directly responsible for the deed. [...] The archbishop Gustav Trolle, dethroned and imprisoned by the regent Sten Sture the Elder who died during the siege, wanted to obtain a redress. [...] So, during the coronation of the Danish king, the prominent guests were confronted with the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>indictment</b> of the archbishop and subsequently condemned for blasphemy. [...] The death sentences were to be accomplished at once, so the square was cleared while a curfew forced all citizens to stay indoors. [...] The executioners beheaded archbishops, councillors, noblemen, and city magistrates indiscriminately, including Erik Johansson Vasa, father of the succeeding king Gustav Vasa who escaped the fate of his father by hiding. [...] All bodies were burned on Södermalm together with the body of the dead regent Sten Sture. The Danish king, satisfied with having pacified Sweden, returned to Denmark in December, drowning a few monks during the trip, while ignoring the dawning insurrection in Dalarna.|$|E

The extent thereof was as followeth: 'That John Bunyan, of the town of Bedford, labourer, being a person of such and such conditions, he hath, since such a time, devilishly and perniciously abstained from coming to church to hear Divine service, and is a common upholder of several unlawful meetings and conventicles, to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom, contrary to the laws of our sovereign lord the King,' &c.|$|E

Must not all the world conclude somebody had forgot the oath of a grand juryman? Yes sure, or his own, or worse.--But suppose they should ask a juror a question might criminate himself? My Lord, you know I put not bare possibilities, it is generally believed these things have been done within an oak of this town--And if I am rightly informed, the restraint a juror is under by his oath, is so well understood, that a certain person desired the clerk of the Crown to change the form of it by adding this exception: [...] "unless by leave or order of the Court." ...|$|E

The inquiry was by means of the grand jury; after the grand jury had found the <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>indictment</b> submitted to it, the commissioners proceeded to hear and determine by means of the petit jury.

50|$|It is {{not known}} at what date Richard Aston began {{practice}} as a barrister. His name appears with tolerable frequency in {{the first volume of}} Sir James Burrow's Reports of Cases in the King's Bench (1756-8), but seldom in connection with cases of first-rate importance. He became king's counsel in 1759, and in 1761 was made lord chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas in Ireland, on the resignation of Sir William Yorke. In this office he seems to have displayed considerable energy. Discovering that it was the practice of grand juries in that country to find <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>indictment</b> upon the mere perusal of depositions without examining any witnesses, he set himself to reform so scandalous an abuse. He failed, however, to carry his colleagues with him, only two out of nine disapproving of the practice, which remained unaltered until 1816, when a bill making the examination of witnesses obligatory was introduced into the House of Commons by Horner and passed into law.|$|R

In the spring of this year he had {{become a member of the}} Society for Constitutional Information. A more equal representation of the people in parliament was at this time the subject of general discussion, and he did not fail to stand forward as the strenuous champion of a measure which seemed likely to infuse new spirit and vigour into our constitutional liberties. His sentiments were publicly professed in a speech before the meeting assembled at the London Tavern, on the 28th of May; and he afterwards gave a wider currency to them from the press. He maintained that the representation ought to be nearly equal and universal; an opinion in which few would now be found to coincide; and which, if he had lived a little longer, he would probably himself have acknowledged to be erroneous. At Paris, he had written a Dialogue between a Farmer and a Country Gentleman on the Principles of Government, and it was published by the Society.

[The discontents in {{the western}} part of Pennsylvania excited by the excise law, now broke out into open insurrection.] We have already {{mentioned}} the riotous opposition this law had experienced. <b>Bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>indictment</b> had been found against some of the rioters. The marshal, when on the way to serve the processes issued by the court, was fired upon by armed men, and narrowly escaped with his life. He was subsequently seized and compelled to renounce the exercise of his official duties. The house of General Nevil, inspector of the revenue, was assailed, but the assailants were repulsed. They assembled in greater numbers; the magistrates and militia officers shrank from interfering, lest it should provoke a general insurrection; a few regular soldiers were obtained from the garrison at Fort Pitt. There was a parley. The insurgents demanded that the inspector and his papers should be given up; and the soldiers march out of the house and ground their arms. The demand being refused, the house was attacked, the out-houses set on fire, and the garrison was compelled to surrender. The marshal and inspector finally escaped out of the country; descended the Ohio, and, by a circuitous route, found their way to the seat of government; bringing a lamentable tale of their misadventures.|$|R
50|$|We {{received}} news {{of it on}} {{arriving at}} Enniskillen from the Archbishop of Cashel and Sir William Cole. The Maguires of Fermanagh and Magawrans (McGoverns) of Cavan were the leaders. They proposed to raise arms {{in anticipation of a}} Spanish landing, to surprise the castles, and to take back their confiscated lands {{now in the hands of}} undertakers. We examined one Phelim bane McCabe and gained from him the names of the ringleaders, both Maguires. We drew <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>indictment</b> against four leaders. We arraigned and tried them by a jury of good freeholders of the English who found them all guilty. We shall sentence them to death; but if your Lordship wishes to mitigate the sentence, they can be sent to Dublin; provided they have a good guard, for the natives are all embarked in the plot. We await Deputys advice before proceeding further. We do not like to set the witnesses free lest they should receive violence from the friends of the accused. Nor can we imprison them as there is no separate room in the jail, and they would have to be with the accused. We have therefore remitted them to the sheriffs house, only to be restrained from conference with any of the Irish, for which we have undertaken to try and get the sheriff some payment.|$|R

If the majority of them (and at least 12) thought that the evidence so adduced made out a sufficient case, the words [...] "a true bill" [...] were endorsed on the back <b>of</b> the <b>bill.</b> If they were of the opposite opinion, the phrase [...] "not a true bill", or the single Latin word ignoramus ("we do not know" [...] or [...] "we are ignorant (of)"), was endorsed instead and the bill was said to be [...] "ignored" [...] or thrown out. They could find a true bill as to the charge in one count, and ignore that in another; or as to one defendant and not as to another; but they could not, like a petty jury, return a special or conditional finding, or select part of a count as true and reject the other part. When some bills were [...] "found", some of the jurors came out and handed the bills to the clerk of arraigns (in assizes) or clerk of the peace, who announced to the court the name of the prisoner, the charge, and the endorsements of the grand jury. They then retired and considered other bills until all were disposed of; after which they were discharged by the judge, chairman, or recorder.|$|R
