5|$|Hurricane Barbara was {{the second}} named {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1953 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming from a tropical wave on August 11 in the southern Bahamas, Barbara moved northward and attained hurricane status the next day.

5|$|Liverpool {{kicked off}} {{the first half of}} extra time. Pirlo had a chance in the early stages, but he put his shot over the crossbar. Tomasson came close in the later stages of the first period of extra time, but he could not make contact with the ball. Vladimír Šmicer {{required}} treatment for cramp {{towards the end of the}} first period, as a number of Liverpool players felt fatigued. Liverpool had the most of the early exchanges after winning two corners, but could not score. Shortly afterwards, Milan make their final substitution replacing Gennaro Gattuso with Rui Costa. The best chance of the second half came near the end when Shevchenko shot at goal. Dudek saved only for it to rebound <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Shevchenko, who again shot from under , which Dudek again saved by pushing the shot over the bar. Liverpool had one last chance at the end of extra time, but John Arne Riise's free kick shot was blocked and following this the referee signalled the end of extra time, which meant a penalty shoot-out would decide the championship.|$|E
5|$|On December 7, 1959, the I-94/US12 freeway {{opened on}} the south side of Kalamazoo, and US12 was shifted to follow the new freeway. The former route through {{downtown}} Kalamazoo and along Stadium Drive was redesignated Bus. US12. The next year, it was renumbered BL I-94. In 1963, the US131 freeway {{opened on the}} northwest side of Kalamazoo. US131 followed M-43 eastward from the end of the freeway into the downtown area to reconnect to its original routing along Westnedge and Park. The next year, another section of US131 opened southwest of Kalamazoo, and US131 was rerouted out of downtown completely. The freeway section north of downtown opened in 1964, and Bus. US131 was designated along it into downtown and along BL I-94 <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the US131 freeway west of downtown. Later in 1965, Kalamazoo and Michikal avenues were transferred to state jurisdiction to set up the one-way pairing east–west through downtown.

25|$|The {{group that}} landed at Le Touquet had the Merlimont Plage Hotel as an objective. Intelligence had {{suggested}} that the Germans were using the hotel as a barracks.

Another German patrol then approached across the sand dunes and the group was forced to swim out to the boat, leaving its weapons behind.|$|E
25|$|After she has {{fixed the}} {{position}} of the nest, she begins to build the nest. She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a spindle and flying <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> bring in more pulps. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two posterior pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her anterior legs and mouth parts. She builds 20–30 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a petiole and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.|$|E
25|$|Alcibiades's troops, {{leading the}} Athenian pursuit, landed and {{attempted}} to pull the Spartan ships <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea with grappling hooks. The Persian troops under Pharnabazus, however, entered the fighting on the shore and began to drive the Athenians, who were outnumbered and fighting against opponents on firmer ground, into the sea. Seeing this, Thrasybulus landed his force as a diversion and ordered Theramenes to combine his troops with those of Chaereas and join the battle. For a time, Thrasybulus and Alcibiades were both driven back by superior forces, but the arrival of Theramenes and Chaereas turned the tide; the Spartans and Persians were defeated, Mindarus was killed. All the Spartan ships were captured save for those of the Syracusan allies, who burned their ships as they retreated.|$|E

25|$|After Coral Sea, the loaned pilots {{returned}} to VF-3. However, with Lexington sunk and VF-2 attached to Saratoga, VF-3 was now effectively homeless. In the interim it operated out of Pearl as a training unit. Jimmy Thach passed command to Butch O'Hare on 24 June 1942, making him CO, and O'Hare subsequently appointed Vorse as his Executive Officer (XO). Vorse wouldn't stay put {{more than a}} couple of weeks, however. The Navy was in the midst of a major reshuffling of fighter squadrons, including a move from twenty-seven to thirty-six plane squadrons as a standard complement. In the post-Midway milieu, fighter-starved air groups were actively recruiting from squadrons like O'Hare's VF-3. Champing at the bit to get <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sea, Vorse took Capt. James M. Shoemaker up on an offer to join VF-6. Only 6 July 1942 Vorse was transferred; nine days later VF-6 would depart with USS Enterprise, a part of Task Force 16 under the command of Admiral Kinkaid.|$|E
25|$|While under cover, an {{improved}} system was devised for removing Mayfly from the shed. This {{consisted of a}} series of electric winches that could gently ease it out, even in windy conditions, and on 24 September 1911 it was decided to move Mayfly from the hangar for full testing. Just as the nose cleared the hangar door, a gust caused the ship to roll virtually onto its beam ends. It eventually righted, but as it was being swung round so that the nose would point <b>back</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the dock, there were cracking sounds amidships and it broke in two. At that point the centre started to rise, and the crew in the aft gondola dived overboard causing the stern to rise. Subsequent damage was caused by a bracing cable {{on the top of the}} hull, which held fast causing several frames to be severely damaged as the hull was moved by the wind. There were no fatalities, and the wreck was returned to the shed the same day.|$|E
