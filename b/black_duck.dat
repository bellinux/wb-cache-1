40|$|To {{examine the}} {{importance}} of hunting mortality in the population dynamics of waterfowl in southwestern Australia, we estimated survival and recovery rates of 19, 523 Pacific <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> (Anas super-ciliosa) and 2, 487 grey teal (A. gibberifrons) banded in 1968 - 76 and recovered by 1978. Both species showed strong evidence of year-to-year variation in survival rates, which averaged 63 +/- 4 (SE) % and 56 +/- 6 % for adult and young Pacific <b>black</b> <b>ducks,</b> respectively, and 55 +/- 17 % for adult grey teal. First-year recovery rates indicated the average annual hunting mortality over 6 years for Pacific <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> and grey teal exposed to heavy hunting pressure was 23 +/- 2 % and 17 +/- 2 %, respectively. Hunting mortality was 9 % in 1 year for Pacific <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> exposed to light hunting. Estimates of mortality rate on opening day of hunting seasons at a site of intense hunting varied between 7 and 20 % for Pacific <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> and 5 and 16 % for grey teal. In an intensively hunted waterfowl population in southwestern Australia, nearly 60 % of all mortality of Pacific <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> and 40 % of grey teal mortality resulted from hunting.

40|$|Bowman, Jacob L. Migration {{influences}} the ecology, evolution, and conservation of migratory animals (Webster et al. 2002), yet migration routes and timing between breeding and wintering areas is virtually unknown for American <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> Anas rubripes. We used satellite telemetry to identify migration routes and stopovers, estimate migration chronology, and describe variation among <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> marked between 2007 ??? 2009 in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Virginia. A total of 31 transmitters provided {{at least one}} full data set during spring migrations. <b>Black</b> <b>ducks</b> departed wintering areas March 18 ???June 7 (x?? = April 17), averaged 3. 35 stopovers (SE = 0. 3 stopovers; range = 1 ??? 5 stopovers) and 6. 44 d at stopovers (SE = 0. 8 d; range = 0. 54 ??? 12. 2 d), migrated 1, 126 km (SE = 89. 5 km; range = 270 ??? 1, 396 km), and arrived at inferred nesting areas April 16 ???June 28 (x?? = May 9). South Atlantic Flyway <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> migrated almost twice as far and took nearly twice as many stopovers as Mississippi and North Atlantic Flyway black ducks; South and North Atlantic Flyway <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> arrived at inferred nesting areas approximately 2 and 4 weeks after those from the Mississippi Flyway, respectively. <b>Black</b> <b>ducks</b> south of the 40 th parallel migrated more than 50 % farther, took nearly twice as many stopovers, and arrived at inferred nesting areas 2 weeks after those to the north. <b>Black</b> <b>ducks</b> east of the 76 th meridian migrated nearly 25 % farther and arrived at inferred nesting areas 3 weeks after those to the west. Nine <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> spent all or portions of spring migration along the Atlantic Coast, and 10 used the Hudson and St. Lawrence River valleys. Stopovers included Long Island Sound, NY, Narragansett Bay, RI, Lake Champlain, VT, Merrymeeting Bay, ME, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. All 11 <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> wintering in Ohio stopped at Lake St. Clair, Saginaw Bay, St. Mary???s River, or the Georgian Bay. A total of 13 transmitters provided at least partial data during autumn migrations. <b>Black</b> <b>ducks</b> departed inferred nesting or molting areas October 5 ???December 1 (x?? = October 24), averaged 2. 0 stopovers (SE = 0. 3 stopovers; range = 1 ??? 4 stopovers) and spent 12. 6 d at stopovers (SE = 3. 5 d; range = 0. 25 ??? 41 d), migrated 993 km (SE = 202. 9 km; range = 277 ??? 1, 485 km), and arrived at wintering areas November 18 ???December 18 (x?? = December 1). Our study confirms the importance of known stopovers and emphasizes the continued need for conservation and management of wetland habitats along established migration corridors. Furthermore, migration chronology and stopover duration of stay from our study should be incorporated into energetic carrying capacity models to better inform and direct habitat goals for <b>black</b> <b>ducks</b> in northeastern North America.

5|$|The American <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> is {{a habitat}} generalist {{as it is}} {{associated}} with tidal marshes and present throughout the year in salt marshes from the Gulf of Maine to coastal Virginia. It usually prefers freshwater and coastal wetlands throughout northeastern America, including brackish marshes, estuaries and edges of backwater ponds and rivers lined by speckled alder. It also inhabits beaver ponds, shallow lakes with sedges and reeds, bogs in open boreal and mixed hardwood forests, as well as forested swamps. Populations in Vermont have also been found in glacial kettle ponds surrounded by bog mats. During winter, the American <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> mostly inhabits brackish marshes bordering bays, agricultural marshes, flooded timber, agricultural fields, estuaries and riverine areas. Ducks usually take shelter from hunting and other disturbances by moving to brackish and fresh impoundments on conservation land.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} shifts in waterfowl dIstnbution patterns in North America {{is the degree to which}} Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) have come to replace <b>Black</b> <b>Ducks</b> (Anas rubripes) as the dominant breeding and wintering species in the eastern half of the United States and Canada over the past several decades. The reasons for these changes in the actual and relative numbers of Mallards and <b>Black</b> <b>Ducks</b> are doubtless many and probably include such factors as man-induced habitat changes, game management practices such as artificial stocking programs and changing hunting regulations, and possibly even climatic trends, but there can be no doubt that the Mallard has successfully colonized many areas which once were almost entirely occupied by <b>Black</b> <b>Ducks,</b> and In some areas has completely replaced that species. The evolutionary consequences of increased contact between the two forms in terms of ecological competition and genetic interchange resulting from hybridization, have yet to be fully understood, but are obviously substantial...|$|R
5|$|Mallards {{frequently}} interbreed {{with their}} closest {{relatives in the}} genus Anas, such as the American <b>black</b> <b>duck,</b> and also with species more distantly related, such as the northern pintail, leading to various hybrids that may be fully fertile. This is quite unusual among such different species, and is apparently because the mallard evolved very rapidly and recently, during the Late Pleistocene. The distinct lineages of this radiation are usually kept separate due to non-overlapping ranges and behavioural cues, but have not yet {{reached the point where}} they are fully genetically incompatible. Mallards and their domesticated conspecifics are also fully inter-fertile.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} duck have brown-plumaged females {{that can be}} {{confused}} with the female mallard. The female gadwall (A.strepera) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the American <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> (A.rubripes), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (A.fulvigula), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum.|$|E
5|$|Since 1988, the American <b>black</b> <b>duck</b> {{has been}} rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the declining population. Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.|$|E
