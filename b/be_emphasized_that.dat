This was met with reciprocity in Brazil, as Lula da Silva placed Argentina as the main priority of his foreign policy. It should <b>be</b> <b>emphasized,</b> <b>that</b> the first foreign visit of Lula da Silva, as president-elect, was to Argentina in December 2002.

Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted {{as a method of}} bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar {{for the first time in}} the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must be stressed here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> the development of the Indo-Islamic architecture was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, the {{uncertainty}} principle has been confused with a somewhat similar effect in physics, called the observer effect, which notes that measurements of certain systems cannot be made without affecting the systems, that is, without changing {{something in a}} system. Heisenberg utilized such an observer effect at the quantum level (see below) as a physical [...] "explanation" [...] of quantum uncertainty. It has since become clearer, however, that {{the uncertainty}} principle {{is inherent in the}} properties of all wave-like systems, and that it arises in quantum mechanics simply due to the matter wave nature of all quantum objects. Thus, the uncertainty principle actually states a fundamental property of quantum systems, and is not a statement about the observational success of current technology. It must <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> measurement does not mean only a process in which a physicist-observer takes part, but rather any interaction between classical and quantum objects regardless of any observer.|$|E
2500|$|By {{these acts}} of salvation, Christ {{provided}} fallen mankind with {{the path to}} escape its fallen nature. The Orthodox Church teaches that through baptism into Christ's death, and our death unto sin in repentance, with God's help we can also rise with Christ into heaven, healed of the breach of our fallen nature and restored to God's grace. To Orthodox Christians, this process is {{what is meant by}} [...] "salvation", which consists of the Christian life. The ultimate goal is theosis – an even closer union with God and closer likeness to God than existed in the Garden of Eden. This very process is called Deification or [...] "God became man that man might become 'god'". However, it must <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> Orthodox Christians do not believe that man literally becomes God in His essence, or a god in his own nature. More accurately, Christ's salvific work enables man in his human nature to become [...] "partakers of the Divine nature" [...] (2 Peter 1:4); that is to say, man is united to God in Christ.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scholars}} {{maintain that}} Ashkenazi Jews are inheritors {{of the religious}} traditions of the great Babylonian Jewish academies, and that Sephardi Jews are descendants of those who originally followed the Judaean or Galilaean Jewish religious traditions. [...] Others, such as Zunz, maintain precisely the opposite. To put the matter into perspective it must <b>be</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>that</b> all Jewish liturgies in use {{in the world today}} are in substance Babylonian, with a small number of Palestinian usages surviving the process of standardization: in a list of differences preserved {{from the time of the}} Geonim, most of the usages recorded as Palestinian are now obsolete. (In the list of usages below, Sephardic usages inherited from Palestine are marked P, and instances where the Sephardic usage conforms to the Babylonian while the Ashkenazic usage is Palestinian are marked B.) By the 12th century, as a result of the efforts of Babylonian leaders such as Yehudai Gaon and Pirqoi ben Baboi, the communities of Palestine, and Diaspora communities such as Kairouan which had historically followed Palestinian usages, had adopted Babylonian rulings in most respects, and Babylonian authority was accepted by Jews throughout the Arabic-speaking world.|$|E
