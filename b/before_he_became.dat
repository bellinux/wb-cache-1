5|$|Beecham's {{repertoire}} was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers {{whose works}} were neglected in Britain <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> their advocate, such as Delius and Berlioz. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were Haydn, Schubert, Sibelius and the composer he revered above all others, Mozart.|$|E
5|$|Bill Bowerman's {{involvement}} with the university started <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> the track and field head coach in 1949. He attended the University of Oregon and played football. Coach Bill Hayward, who Bowerman credits with teaching him how to run, convinced Bowerman to run track. Bowerman graduated from Oregon in 1934 {{with a degree in}} Business.|$|E
5|$|Devin Hester {{was born}} to Juanita Brown and Lenorris Hester, Sr. in Riviera Beach, Florida. His parents {{separated}} {{when he was a}} toddler. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a teenager, his mother was severely injured in a car accident, while his father died of cancer two years later. His step-father, Derrick Brown, and brother, Lenorris, Jr., helped Hester escape his depression and rebuild his life by introducing him to football. He soon returned to his normal life and began to excel in sports and academics.|$|E

5|$|Upon being {{signed by}} the Rangers, Näslund and {{his family moved to}} Tarrytown, New York. Following his {{retirement}} from the NHL in 2009, they returned to Sweden, where Näslund began coaching his son's minor-league hockey team <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> the general manager of Modo. He participated in {{the construction of a new}} house in Örnsköldsvik that his family moved into.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if it were to have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E

5|$|Eardwulf {{was evidently}} married <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning {{his wife for}} a {{concubine}} soon after his coronation. This strained relations with the new Archbishop Eanbald II—Eanbald I {{had died in the}} year of Eardwulf's coronation. Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he was accompanied by a large retinue, including soldiers, and that he received and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably in conflict with Eardwulf over property, but it is likely that he also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.|$|E
5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> owner of the ironworks, the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's mother {{apprentice}}d her son William to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew {{also became}} an apprentice in Selby's shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Johnson {{lived with his}} mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills. His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, Annette Gordon-Reed, suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.|$|E

In Santa Beatriz, he took off piloting the first aircraft flight in Peru, flying over Lima, Callao and above the Pacific Ocean coast. The flight was witnessed by the President of Peru Augusto B. Leguía and other dignitaries. On 29 January he completed a 20-minute flight from Lima to Ancón, a day <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a flight instructor in the first flying school in South America. In early 1911 he became Peruvian Aviation Corps (PAC) colonel and {{returned to}} France as an air force envoy.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon Plankton {{is married}} to a {{supercomputer}} named Karen Plankton, who is also his sidekick and best friend. Karen is Plankton's own invention, assembled from a calculator and a mass of wires. She was Plankton's first invention when he was in grade school, and they dated <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> evil. Her system is built into most of Plankton's machines (including the Chum Bucket itself) so that she and Plankton can communicate while the latter is on a mission. She is a Mark II Surplus UNIVAC with 256 gigabytes of random-access memory.|$|E
5|$|Since {{his early}} youth {{he was very}} {{enthusiastic}} about flying and volunteered for military service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich on 10 December 1935. There he participated {{in a number of}} exercises and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) of the Reserves on 1 December 1936. In his civilian life, Brändle attained a pilot license and worked as a flight instructor. As an instructor, he trained roughly 150 students and logged more than 6,000 starts and 8,000 flight hours <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a military aviator.

5|$|The 1784 Enclosure Act allowed Henry Bankes the Younger, {{grandson}} of Ralph Bankes, {{to create the}} current estate and parkland footprint. He demolished the hamlet of Kingston which was situated adjacent to the 16th-century Keeper's Lodge, diverted the Blandford road (now the B3082) and converted former agricultural land to parkland. He undertook further minor alterations in the 1820s, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Corfe. He was a trustee for the British Museum and its parliamentary advocate, {{and some of his}} collections which were once part of the house, are now in the museum. Bankes entertained his friends at the house, including William Pitt the Younger and Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.|$|E
5|$|The {{interpersonal}} {{conflicts and}} feuds {{leading to the}} gunfight were complex. Each side had strong family ties. The brothers James, Virgil, Wyatt, Morgan, and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family, working together as pimps, lawmen, and saloon owners in several frontier towns, among other occupations, and had moved together from one town to another. Virgil served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and in 1877 became {{a police officer in}} Prescott, Arizona. He followed that with a job as a night watchman <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a constable. Wyatt had held two jobs as a police officer in the cattle-drive towns of Wichita and Dodge City, Kansas.|$|E
5|$|There was no autopsy, and {{the cause}} of Lambert's death is unknown. While many sources say that he died of a fatty {{degeneration}} of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from cardiac insufficiency; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> short of breath and collapsed. Bondeson(2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he had a sudden pulmonary embolism.|$|E

5|$|Unable to come {{to terms}} with Bouwmeester, the Panthers traded his {{negotiating}} rights to the Calgary Flames in exchange for the negotiating rights to defenceman Jordan Leopold and a third round draft pick (Josh Birkholz) in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. The deal gave the Flames four days with which they had exclusive rights to negotiate with Bouwmeester <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> an unrestricted free agent and gained the ability to negotiate with any team. Hours before that deadline expired, Bouwmeester and the Flames agreed to a five-year, $33 million contract.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{documentary}} evidence {{is available from}} Ealdred's time as Bishop of Worcester. Only five leases that he signed survive, and all date from 1051 to 1053. Two further leases exist in Hemming's Cartulary as copies only. How the diocese of Worcester was administered when Ealdred was abroad is unclear, although it appears that Wulfstan, the prior of the cathedral chapter, performed the religious duties in the diocese. On the financial side, the Evesham Chronicle states that Æthelwig, who became abbot of Evesham Abbey in 1058, administered Worcester <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> abbot.|$|E
5|$|Earl Ralph {{had secured}} {{control of the}} castle at Dol, and in September 1076 William {{advanced}} into Brittany and laid siege to the castle. King Philip of France later relieved the siege and defeated William at Dol, forcing him to retreat back to Normandy. Although this was William's first defeat in battle, it did little to change things. An Angevin attack on Maine was defeated in late 1076 or 1077, with Count Fulk le Rechin wounded in the unsuccessful attack. More serious was the retirement of Simon de Crépy, the Count of Amiens, to a monastery. <b>Before</b> <b>he</b> <b>became</b> a monk, Simon handed his county of the Vexin over to King Philip. The Vexin was a buffer state between Normandy and the lands of the French king, and Simon had been a supporter of William. William {{was able to make}} peace with Philip in 1077 and secured a truce with Count Fulk in late 1077 or early 1078.|$|E
