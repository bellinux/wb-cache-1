This file was last viewed in Adobe Acrobat 9. 4 The {{focus of this}} research has been to further my understanding of casting slip (liquefied clay) concerning its properties, construction methods, as well as investigations into the possibilities of the fired casting slip surfaces. The main objective of the research is to formulate a casting slip {{that could be used}} for its whiteness and thinness as well as maintain a level of strength. I began by experimenting with different formulations of casting slip. By testing combinations of different percentages of raw clay components, certain qualities can be amplified. An investigation of various papers, wire, and wax for surface development began in hopes of finding additional creative opportunities. Tea <b>bag</b> <b>paper,</b> as well as rice paper is utilized to construct armatures onto which the casting slip is applied. By brushing casting slip on the surface of the paper I am able to ascertain how much slip would crack and fall off prior to firing, which would also indicate whether the work would survive a kiln firing. Firing samples of wire at various temperatures tests the wires durability and level of heat resistance. These casting slips are based on porcelain clay bodies, which are white upon being kiln-fired. Depending on the specific ingredients in these clay bodies, it will determine the quality of white (chalk white, creamy white, etc.). A casting slip was formulated, which fired to a cool white; the surface of the clay also has a slight sheen. The tea <b>bag</b> <b>paper</b> as of yet is still the best choice for my process of construction. The nickel chromium wire withstood the highest temperatures and provided the greatest amount of support during the kiln firing. Since testing these elements, an investigation into the surface of the casting slip began...|$|E

40|$|Elongation at {{failure is}} an {{important}} but underrated functional property of paper. Traditionally, elongation has been of specific importance for sack and <b>bag</b> <b>paper</b> grades. Mechanical treatments at high consistency are known to induce fibre deformations {{that contribute to the}} elongation of paper. However, it is not clear to what extent different fibre deformations can improve the elongation of paper. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of three mechanical treatments on fibre and paper properties. The wing defibrator, the E-compactor, and the Valley beater were used for treating chemical softwood pulp. It was found that the type and intensity of mechanical treatments significantly affect the formation of fibre deformations, and thus the resulting properties of paper. The combination of high-consistency wing defibrator treatment and subsequent low-consistency valley beating provided paper with high elongation potential and good strength properties without impairing the dewatering properties...|$|E

40|$|Efficacy of {{pollination}} bags made of new nonwoven fabrics {{was compared}} with the traditional paper bags in sorghum during 2015 using three cultivars comprising BR 007 B (red seeded), SC 283 (white seeded) and 1167048 hybrid with tannin (brown seeded). The five pollination bag treatments were: no bagging, traditional paper <b>bag,</b> <b>paper</b> bag plus plastic screen bag for extra bird protection, duraweb®SG 2 polypropylene bag and duraweb®SG 1 polyester bag. There was no bird damage on tannin hybrid but birds damaged bags to access grains {{of the other two}} varieties. Varieties and bag types differed significantly, and also showed significant interactions for panicle weight (at P< 0. 06), seed weight and average seed weight per panicle. The tannin hybrid was consistently a better performer for all traits regardless of bag type. The paper bags were the worst for bird damage. Duraweb® SG 1 was the best performer for all traits including bird damage followed by duraweb®SG 2. The joint regression analysis showed that BR 007 B performed consistently under all bag types with average response. On the other hand, SC 283 improved its response with the increasing quality of bag type at an above average rate for panicle weight and seed traits. It was concluded that new nonwoven fabric bags could replace paper bags in providing better seed production potential and greater protection against bird damage. 201...|$|E

In recent years the activities of human consumption “clean ” products, with no extra added sugars, food additives and preservatives increases. The aim of this study was to evaluate cereal muesli with seeds quality changes during storage. Samples of muesli with seeds (linseeds, pumpkins seeds, almond slices) were packaged in 3 different packages –paper <b>bag,</b> <b>paper</b> tubes and Doypack (standup pouches) and stored for 6 months (at 20 ± 2 °C temperature and air humidity – 50 ± 5 %). During the storage moisture content, water activity, and microbiological safety were evaluated. After 6 months storage of muesli with seeds, the moisture content in samples packaged in the paper tube decreases by 14. 3 %, in Doypack– 20. 5 % and in paper bag by 34. 9 %. The lowest moisture content was determined for muesli samples storage in the paper package – 6. 00 %. Water activity compared to the fresh prepared muesli (aw= 0. 56) decreased, in paper tube it was 0. 33, in paper bag – 0. 16 and in Doypack – 0. 47. As more unusable for cereal muesli with seeds packaging paper bags was detected, because of essential quality changes of samples during storage.

The PFI mill was an effective deshive refiner, but a poor modeling base due to the insensitive response of shive content to changes in processing conditions. The Bauer 187 performed well as a deshive refiner and model base. A strong relationship was found between post-treatment von Alfthan values and Bauer 187 control variables. A best model of Bauer 187 deshive refining was selected by the total square error criterion. That model involves a complex relationship of plate gap, stock consistency, and throughput rate, but, in general, reducing plate gap and increasing stock consistency reduces post-treatment shive contents. Conditions which optimized the efficiency of Bauer 187 deshive refining depended upon the desired shive content of processed pulp. Shive contents typical of industrially deshived pulp were most efficiently obtained by Bauer 187 deshive refining at 1. 5 mm plate gap, 1. 2 kg/minute throughput rate, and 12 percent consistency. The effects of deshive refining on pulp washing and strength development potential were also investigated. Chemical recovery from high yield kraft pulp was improved by Bauer 187 deshive refining. Washing improvements became more pronounced as pulp yield was increased. Pulp strength at common levels of CSF and sheet bulk generally benefited from Bauer 187 deshive refining. Strength differences between deshived and undeshived pulps were attributable to differences in the amount of strength development beating necessary to achieve specified bulks and freenesses...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{symbolic}} steps {{of the environmental movement}} has been the banning of the plastic bag, while promoting the use of another symbol of the environmental crusade, the reusable bag. Policy makers both locally and nationally feel that plastic bag bans and taxes are {{a step in the right}} direction and if accepted will pave the way for further environmental regulations. However, the banning and promotion of certain bags can create confusion and stress on the environmentally-conscious consumer. This research seeks to inform the environmentally- conscious consumer about the life cycles of shopping bags. To allow the consumer to make an informed decision, the life cycles of a conventional plastic <b>bag,</b> <b>paper</b> bag and {{the symbolic}} “Go Green” reusable bag were researched from cradle to grave. This includes the use of resources in the production process, length of use of the bag, recycling methods, landfill statistics and the total carbon foot print associated with each bag type. The life cycle information can then be used by the informed voter in regards to plastic bag bans and taxes. By comparing the three major bag types it becomes clear that all have their own environmental problems. Ultimately, what determines the environmental impact of any bag type is the amount of resources used in the production process. The best way to reduce this environmental impact is to reuse a bag as many times as possible no matter what type. This research shows that based on production alone a conventional plastic bag requires the least amount of resources and energy to produce, while paper and reusable bags require more. On the flip side, a plastic bag can take up to a thousand years to break down in the environment, which greatly increases its potential to create environmental harm. Based on the life cycles and total carbon footprints of each bag type there is little rationale in limiting their usage due to the threat of climate change. When the carbon footprints of consumer bags are compared to the carbon footprints of other current practices the bags rank trivial, meaning the carbon footprint of consumer shopping bags is low. Positive or negative this symbolic movement puts environmental issues on the public’s radar and allows for other issues to gain attention...|$|E
