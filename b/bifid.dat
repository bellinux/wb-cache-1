5|$|The tail, {{according}} to Schwartz, {{is longer than}} in the potto. He does not provide measurements of the tail of AMZ 6698 and notes {{that at least one}} vertebra is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 caudal vertebrae in an illustration of AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of caudal vertebrae ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the potto, though {{according to}} Stump the tail of Pseudopotto is longer than any seen in pottos. The false potto allegedly has shorter spines on its cervical (neck) and first and second thoracic (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false potto differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a <b>bifid</b> (two-tipped) spine on the second cervical vertebra, but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 potto specimens he examined.|$|E

25|$|Paeonia daurica is a {{perennial}} herbaceous photosynthesising plant, emerging {{in spring and}} retreating underground in the autumn. It has slender carrot-shaped roots which are directed downwards. The leaves are alternately set along the stems and have an outline of 5–11½×8–17cm. The lower leaves are usually composed of three sets of three entire or sometimes <b>bifid</b> leaflets, and occasionally there is third order division, resulting in a maximum of nineteen leaflets. The shape of the leaflets is wide to narrowly oval, with the largest width at midlength or towards the tip. The base of the leaflets {{is more or less}} wedge-shaped or sometimes rounded, the margin is entire and sometimes wavy, and the tip is rounded or has a smaller or larger sharp tip. The upper surface of the leaf is hairless, while the undersides are hairless or sparsely to densely covered in felty hairs. The hermaphrodite flowers are set individually {{at the end of the}} stems and are subtended by none to two leafy bracts. The flower itself consists of two or three green sepals, five to eight petals, that may be white, pale yellow, yellow, yellow with a red blotch at the base or with a reddish margin, pink, red, or purple-red, and many stamens consisting of pale, yellow, pink or purple filaments topped by anthers that contain yellow pollen. At the very centre of each flower are one to five carpels that are glabrous, sparsely to densely covered in felty hairs and almost directly tipped by the stigmas which are mostly curved or S-shaped from above.|$|E
2500|$|The plant terminates in a dichotomous cyme, with a {{peduncle}} supporting each flower. The floral {{leaves are}} <b>bifid</b> (split in two parts) and ovate, while the involucral bracts are bright red, irregularly acuminate in shape (e.g., like a slipper), and about [...] in length with a long, thin tube. The flower is void of scent. The male pedicel is hairy, while the female is glabrous. The seed pod is about [...] long and [...] wide, and ovoid in shape (with truncated ends).|$|E
2500|$|The pupa is {{described}} by Bell as [...] "The pupa has the dorsal line of the thorax absolutely parallel to the longitudinal axis of the pupa for two-thirds of its length, consequently the hinder part just before the margin is perpendicular to this part, it is raised suddenly but very slightly above the front margin of segment 4, and {{the front end of}} this parallel dorsal line is at an angle, and a sharpish angle, with the front slope of the thorax .... the cremaster is distinctly <b>bifid</b> at the extremity, and has some shiny, very stout, black, suspensory hooks dorsally {{as well as at the}} extremity. There is a dorsal rugose black tip to the snout terminating the head, which snout is cylindrical in its apical half; there is no black line round the eye and there is a dark green-blue dorsal line which is yellow on the thorax as well as the supra-spiracular yellow line. Length 34mm; length of snout 3mm; breadth at segment 7 is 9mm; height at apex of curve of wing (segment 6) 10mm; height at apen of thorax 8mm".|$|E
2500|$|From behind, the {{vertebral}} column presents in the median line the spinous processes. In the cervical region (with {{the exception of}} the second and seventh vertebrae) these are short, horizontal and <b>bifid.</b> In {{the upper part of the}} thoracic region they are directed obliquely downward; in the middle they are almost vertical, and in the lower part they are nearly horizontal. In the lumbar region they are nearly horizontal. The spinous processes are separated by considerable intervals in the lumbar region, by narrower intervals in the neck, and are closely approximated in the middle of the thoracic region. Occasionally one of these processes deviates a little from the median line [...] which can sometimes be indicative of a fracture or a displacement of the spine. On either side of the spinous processes is the vertebral groove formed by the laminae in the cervical and lumbar regions, where it is shallow, and by the laminae and transverse processes in the thoracic region, where it is deep and broad; these grooves lodge the deep muscles of the back. Lateral to the spinous processes are the articular processes, and still more laterally the transverse processes. In the thoracic region, the transverse processes stand backward, on a plane considerably behind that of the same processes in the cervical and lumbar regions. In the cervical region, the transverse processes are placed in front of the articular processes, lateral to the pedicles and between the intervertebral foramina. In the thoracic region they are posterior to the pedicles, intervertebral foramina, and articular processes. In the lumbar region they are in front of the articular processes, but behind the intervertebral foramina.|$|E
2500|$|Leucocoryneae are {{terrestrial}} perennial herbaceous plants. They have tunicate bulbs, {{which may}} be simple or prolific (with bulbils), rarely lateral rhizomes. The outer bulb scales (cataphyll) are papyraceous, colourless or violaceous (Zoellnerallium). They {{may or may not}} have a garlic like odour. The leaves are large, with membranous sheaths, usually forming an underground neck. The leaf lamina is flat, green, and glaucous, glabrous or papillose. The inflorescence may be pauciflor (Ipheion, Beauverdia, rarely Tristagma) or pluriflor (up to 30). The spathe is formed by [...] a single <b>bifid</b> membranous bract (Ipheion) or from two papyraceous bracts partially fused at the base. The pedicels, which are not articulated at the receptacles, are papilose or glabrous. The flowers are hermaphroditic and actinomorphic, the perianth corolla like, with 6 (8 in Beauverdia) tepals fused at their base to form a floral tube arising around the ovary. There are 6 stamens (8 in Beauverdia), 3 fertile and 3 not (staminodes), rarely 6 (Leucocoryne), in two whorls of three (Tristagma, Ipheion) or one whorl. The filaments which are adnate (fused) to the tepals, uniting at their bases, the anthers dorsifixed (attached at their back) are oblong, yellow brown or green. The ovaries are superior and sessile with three (four in Beauverdia) carpels and locules (four in Beauverdia) and septal nectaries. The number of ovules is either 2, 4 or 30 per locule, arranged in two rows. The style is apical and persistent. The stigma has three (four in Beauverdia) lobes, or is trifid, and is papillose. The capsule, which is humifuse (Ipheion, Beauverdia) or aerocarpic, globose or prismatic, and contains many seeds (pluriseeded) which are irregular and polyhedral with a black tegmen. The embryo is linear or slightly curved.|$|E

60|$|The glands {{apparently}} absorb {{more quickly}} than do the quadrifid and <b>bifid</b> processes; and on the view above maintained, namely that they absorb matter from putrid water occasionally emitted from the bladders, they ought to act {{more quickly than}} the processes; as these latter remain in permanent contact with captured and decaying animals.|$|E
60|$|Mouth.--Mandibles, {{with the}} basal {{edges of the}} five teeth pectinated by minute, short, strong spines on one side; {{inferior}} angle extremely short. In one specimen, there was a minute pectinated tooth {{between the first and}} second; in another, the second tooth was <b>bifid</b> on its summit; in another, the fourth was rudimentary.|$|E
60|$|As far as I {{could make}} out, the <b>bifid</b> {{processes}} are {{developed in the}} same manner as the quadrifids, excepting that the two primary terminal cells never become divided, and only increase in length. The glands on the valve and collar appear at so early an age that I could not trace their development; but we may reasonably suspect that they are developed from papillae like those on the outside of the bladder, but with their terminal cells not divided into two. The two segments forming the pedicels of the glands probably answer to the conical protuberance and short footstalk of the quadrifid and <b>bifid</b> processes. I am strengthened in the belief that the glands are developed from papillae like those on the outside of the bladders, from the fact that in Utricularia amethystina the glands extend along the whole ventral surface of the bladder close to the footstalk.|$|E
60|$|Mouth.--Labrum highly bullate in {{the upper}} part, with a row of teeth on the crest; mandibles with four teeth, the fourth close to the {{inferior}} apex, which is very little developed, sometimes making the fourth tooth appear simply <b>bifid.</b> Maxillæ with two large spines on the upper angle, beneath {{which there is a}} large depression, bearing one rather long and thick, and four short and thick, spines; inferior upraised part with a double row of longer and thinner spines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not my work," [...] said Sir Richmond. [...] "I {{admit that}} it might be like that, but it isn't like that. It has not worked out like that. The two drives go on side by side in me. They have no logical connexion. All I can say is that for me, with my <b>bifid</b> temperament, one makes a rest from the other, and is so far {{refreshment}} and a renewal of energy. But I do not find women coming into my work in any effectual way." ...|$|E
60|$|The inner side of {{the collar}} (see the {{previous}} fig. 20) is covered with several crowded rows of processes, differing in no important respect from the quadrifids, except in bearing only two arms instead of four; they are, however, rather narrower and more delicate. I shall call them the bifids. They project into the bladder, and are directed towards its posterior end. The quadrifid and <b>bifid</b> processes no doubt are homologous with the papillae on the out{{side of the}} bladder and of the leaves; and we shall see that they are developed from closely similar papillae.|$|E
60|$|Finally, as {{numerous}} minute animals are captured by this plant in its native country and when cultivated, {{there can be}} no doubt that the bladders, though so small, are far from being in a rudimentary condition; on the contrary, they are highly efficient traps. Nor can there be any doubt that matter is absorbed from the decayed prey by the quadrifid and <b>bifid</b> processes, and that protoplasm is thus generated. What tempts animals of such diverse kinds to enter [page 439] the cavity beneath the bowed antennae, and then force their way through the little slit-like orifice between the valve and collar into the bladders filled with water, I cannot conjecture.|$|E
60|$|Utricularia griffithii (Malay and Borneo).--The {{bladders}} are {{transparent and}} minute; one which was measured being only 28/1000 {{of an inch}} (.711 mm.) in diameter. The antennae are of moderate length, and [page 444] project straight forward; they are united for a short space at their bases by a membrane; and they bear a moderate number of bristles or hairs, not simple as heretofore, but surmounted by glands. The bladders also differ remarkably {{from those of the}} previous species, as within there are no quadrifid, only <b>bifid,</b> processes. In one bladder there was a minute aquatic larva; in another the remains of some articulate animal; and in most of them grains of sand.|$|E
60|$|The {{bladders}} {{are filled}} with water, and sometimes include bubbles of air. They bear internally rather short, thick, quadrifid processes arranged in approximately concentric rows. The two pairs of arms {{of which they are}} formed differ only a little in length, and stand in a peculiar position (fig. 28); the two longer ones forming one line, and the two shorter ones another parallel line. Each arm includes a small spherical mass of brownish matter, which, when crushed, breaks into angular pieces. I have no doubt that these spheres are nuclei, for closely similar ones [page 435] are present in the cells forming the walls of the bladders. <b>Bifid</b> processes, having rather short oval arms, arise in the usual position on the inner side of the collar.|$|E
60|$|From this {{description}} it is sufficiently obvious how Genlisea secures its prey. Small animals entering the narrow orifice--but what induces them to enter {{is not known}} any {{more than in the}} case of Utricularia--would find their egress rendered difficult by the sharp incurved hairs on the lips, and as soon as they passed some way down the neck, it would be scarcely possible for them to return, owing to the many transverse rows of long, straight, downward pointing hairs, together with the ridges from which these project. Such creatures would, therefore, perish either within the neck or utricle; and the quadrifid and <b>bifid</b> papillae would absorb matter from their decayed remains. The transverse rows of hairs are so numerous that they seem superfluous merely for the sake of preventing the escape of prey, and as they are thin and delicate, they probably serve as additional absorbents, {{in the same manner as}} the flexible bristles on the infolded margins of the leaves of Aldrovanda. The spiral arms no doubt act as accessory traps. Until fresh leaves are examined, it cannot be told whether the line of junction of the spirally wound lamina is a little open along its whole course, or only in parts, but a small creature which forced its way into the tube at any point, would be prevented from escaping by the incurved hairs, and would find an open path down [page 451] the tube into the neck, and so into the utricle. If the creature perished within the spiral arms, its decaying remains would be absorbed and utilised by the <b>bifid</b> papillae. We thus see that animals are captured by Genlisea, not by means of an elastic valve, as with the foregoing species, but by a contrivance resembling an eel-trap, though more complex.|$|E
60|$|The {{sensitive}} filaments {{are formed}} of several rows of elongated cells, filled with purplish fluid. They {{are a little}} above the 1/20 of an inch in length; are thin and delicate, and taper to a point. I examined the bases of several, making sections of them, but {{no trace of the}} entrance of any vessel could be seen. The apex is sometimes <b>bifid</b> or even trifid, owing to a slight separation between the terminal pointed cells. Towards the base there is constriction, formed of broader cells, beneath which there is an articulation, supported on an enlarged base, consisting of differently shaped polygonal cells. As the filaments project at right angles {{to the surface of the}} leaf, they would have been liable to be broken whenever the lobes closed together, had it not been for the articulation which allows them to bend flat down.|$|E
60|$|The collar (called the peristome by Cohn) is evidently formed, {{like the}} valve, by an inward {{projection}} of {{the walls of the}} bladder. The cells composing the outer surface, or that facing the valve, have rather thick walls, are of a brownish colour, minute, very numerous, and elongated; the lower ones being divided into two by vertical partitions. The whole presents a complex and elegant appearance. The cells forming the inner surface are continuous with those over the whole inner surface of the bladder. The space be- [page 402] tween the inner and outer surface consists of coarse cellular tissue (fig. 20). The inner side is thickly covered with delicate <b>bifid</b> processes, hereafter to be described. The collar is thus made thick; and it is rigid, so that it retains the same outline whether the bladder contains little or much air and water. This is of great importance, as otherwise the thin and flexible valve would be liable to be distorted, and in this case would not act properly.|$|E
60|$|Only one {{experiment}} was tried on the quadrifid processes and glands {{with reference to}} their power of absorption. A bladder was punctured and left for 24 hrs. in a solution of one part of urea to 437 of water, and the quadrifid and <b>bifid</b> processes were found much affected. In some arms {{there was only a}} single symmetrical globular mass, larger than the proper nucleus, and consisting of yellowish matter, generally translucent but sometimes granular; in others there were two masses of different sizes, one large and the [page 438] other small; and in others there were irregularly shaped globules; so that it appeared as if the limpid contents of the processes, owing to the absorption of matter from the solution, had become aggregated sometimes round the nucleus, and sometimes into separate masses; and that these then tended to coalesce. The primordial utricle or protoplasm lining the processes was also thickened here and there into irregular and variously shaped specks of yellowish translucent matter, as occurred in the case of Utricularia neglecta under similar treatment. These specks apparently did not change their forms.|$|E
60|$|Finally, the {{conclusion}} to which we are led by the foregoing experiments and observations is that the bladders have no power of digesting animal matter, though {{it appears that the}} quadrifids are somewhat affected by a fresh infusion of raw meat. It is certain that the processes within the bladders, and the glands outside, absorb matter from salts of [page 424] ammonia, from a putrid infusion of raw meat, and from urea. The glands apparently are acted on more strongly by a solution of urea, and less strongly by an infusion of raw meat, than are the processes. The case of urea is particularly interesting, because we have seen that it produces no effect on Drosera, the leaves of which are adapted to digest fresh animal matter. But the most important fact of all is, that in the present and following species the quadrifid and <b>bifid</b> processes of bladders containing decayed animals generally include little masses of spontaneously moving protoplasm; whilst such masses are never seen in perfectly clean bladders.|$|E
60|$|Filamentary Appendages.--These, in a {{medium-sized}} specimen, are arranged on the prosoma in four longitudinal approximate rows, there being twelve in each row; {{those in the}} two outer rows are only half the length {{of those in the}} two inner rows; those nearest the thorax are the longest; there are some papillæ outside the outer rows. In a very large specimen with its capitulum 1.3 in length, these filaments were very much more numerous, and some were placed on the first segment of the thorax, and at the bases of several of the posterior cirri. Some of the filaments are <b>bifid,</b> trifid, and even branched. In all the specimens, at the bases of the first pair of cirri, there are, on each side, a pair of filaments, (one below the other,) pointing upwards, less than half as long as those on the prosoma: also {{on each side of the}} mouth, there is a longer and thicker filament, pointing upwards, with a few very minute scattered spines on it; the apices of these three pair of filaments, as well as of some of the others, are roughened with very minute pectinated scales. All these filaments were gorged with the branching testes.|$|E
60|$|Messrs. V. Thompson, Goodsir, and Bate, {{have kept}} alive {{for several days}} the larvæ of Lepas, Conchoderma, Balanus, Verruca, and Chthamalus, and have {{described}} the changes which supervene {{between the first and}} third exuviations. The most conspicuous new character is the great elongation of the posterior point of the carapace into an almost filiform, spinose point in Lepas, Conchoderma, Chthamalus, and Balanus, but not according to Goodsir, in one of the species of the latter genus. The posterior point, also, of the abdomen becomes developed in Balanus (Goodsir) into two very long, spear-like processes, serrated on their outer sides; in Lepas and Conchoderma, according to Thompson, into a single, tapering spinose projection; and in Chthamalus, as figured by Mr. Bate, the posterior <b>bifid</b> point, as well as the depending ventral fork, increase much in size. Another important change, which has been particularly attended to by Mr. Bate, is the appearance of spinose projections and spines (some of which are thick, curved, and strongly plumose, or, almost pectinated along their inner sides) on the pedicels and lower segments of the shorter rami of the two posterior pairs of limbs.|$|E
60|$|On the Absorption {{of certain}} Fluids by the Quadrifid and <b>Bifid</b> processes.--These {{experiments}} were tried {{to ascertain whether}} certain fluids, which seemed adapted for the purpose, would produce the same effects on the processes as the absorption of decayed animal matter. Such experiments are, however, troublesome; for it is not sufficient merely to place a branch in the fluid, as the valve shuts so closely that the fluid apparently does not enter soon, if at all. Even when bristles were pushed into the orifices, they were in several cases wrapped so closely round by the thin flexible edge of the valve that the fluid was apparently excluded; so that the experiments tried in this manner are doubtful and not worth giving. The best plan {{would have been to}} puncture the bladders, but I did not think of this till too late, excepting in a few cases. In all such trials, however, it cannot be ascertained positively that the bladder, though translucent, does not contain some minute animal in the last stage of decay. Therefore most of my experiments were made by cutting bladders longitudinally into two; the quadrifids were examined with No. 8 of Hartnack, then irrigated, whilst under the covering glass, with a few drops of the fluid under trial, kept in a damp chamber, and re-examined after stated intervals of time with the same power as before.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bentham was so kind as {{to send me}} dried {{flowers of}} this species and of Ae. mollis, both {{inhabitants}} of South America. The two forms differ conspicuously, as the deeply <b>bifid</b> stigma of the one, and the anthers of the other project far above {{the mouth of the}} corolla. In the long-styled form of the present species, the style is twice and a half as long as that of the short-styled. The divergent stigmas of the two forms do not differ much in length, nor as far as I could perceive in their papillae. In the long-styled flowers the filaments adhere to the corolla close up to the anthers, which are enclosed some way down within the tube. In the short-styled flowers the filaments are free above the point where the anthers are seated in the other form, and they project from the corolla to an equal height with that of the stigmas in the long-styled flowers. It is often difficult to measure with accuracy pollen-grains, which have long been dried and then soaked in water; but they here manifestly differed greatly in size. Those from the short-styled flowers were to those from the long-styled in diameter in about the ratio of 100 to 62. The two forms of Ae. mollis present a like difference in the length of their pistils and stamens.|$|E
60|$|The neck is {{likewise}} lined throughout its whole length with transverse rows of long, thin, transparent hairs, having broad bulbous (fig. 30) bases, with similarly constructed sharp points. They arise from little projecting ridges, formed of rectangular epidermic cells. The hairs vary {{a little in}} length, but their points generally extend down to the row next below; so that if the neck is split open and laid flat, the inner surface resembles a paper of pins,--the hairs representing the pins, and the little transverse ridges representing the folds of paper through which the pins are thrust. These rows of hairs are indicated in the previous figure (29) by numerous transverse lines crossing the neck. The inside of the neck is [page 449] also studded with papillae; those in the lower part are spherical and formed of four cells, as in {{the lower part of}} the utricle; those in the upper part are formed of two cells, which are much elongated downwards beneath their points of attachment. These two-celled papillae apparently correspond with the <b>bifid</b> process in the upper part of the bladders of Utricularia. The narrow transverse orifice (o, fig. 29) is situated between the bases of the two spiral arms. No valve could be detected here, nor was any such structure seen by Dr. Warming. The lips of the orifice are armed with many short, thick, sharply pointed, somewhat incurved hairs or teeth.|$|E
