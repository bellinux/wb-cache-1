40|$|Recent {{evaluations}} in {{the field}} of biomass separations have resulted in a novel concept termed the “embedded membrane. ” Biomass solutions, which typically consist of a sludge-like material, contain a wide range of particle types and concentrations. These highly abusive solutions have the potential to cause reduced flux and even catastrophic failure through erosion mechanisms within the membrane. The embedded membrane concept relies on embedding finer, filtration inducing particles (e. g. ceramic such as TiO 2) into the interstices of a macroporous support (e. g., sintered metal such as sintered stainless steel). It is believed that the embedded membrane would be resistant to erosion processes, since only the macroporous support material would be subjected to the harsh hydrodynamic properties of the flowing <b>bulk</b> <b>process</b> fluid. Moreover, the finer, filtration inducing embedded particles that provide the necessary filtration efficiency are protected from the <b>bulk</b> <b>process</b> fluid. In an effort to investigate the embedded membrane concept, samples of sintered stainless steel membranes embedded with ceramic particles have been prepared...|$|E

The dynamics of the charge spreading due to three mechanisms are calculated: (a) surface conduction; (b) surface charge spreading due to self-repulsion; and (c) bulk space charge motion, which is necessarily coupled to a surface charge. Self-similar motion occurs in all three cases. The AFM signals decay with time, and the shapes of the decay curves are similar. We show that the surface-charge-perturbed cases can be identified because the time constant depends on the magnitude of the initial charge, but that separating the pure surface spreading from the <b>bulk</b> <b>process</b> may prove difficult...|$|E
