40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} wind turbines as new participants on prices and allocation within balancing markets. We introduce the cost-minimizing electricity sector model ELMOD-MIP, that includes detailed unit-commitment constraints, complex {{combined heat and power}} constraints, and minimum bid sizes for balancing capacity reservation. The model also features a novel approach of modeling balancing reservation by considering possible activation costs already during the reservation phase, mimicking the activation anticipation of market participants. The model includes the spot and balancing market of Germany and is applied to scenarios for 2013 and 2025. The results for 2025 show, in comparison to 2013, a price increase for positive and negative reserves, in case no new participants enter the market. With the participation of wind turbines the cost for <b>balancing</b> <b>provision</b> is reduced by 40 %, but above 2013 values. The relative cost savings from wind participation are higher for negative reserve provision than positive reserve provision, as wind turbines can use their full capacity if not activated and {{do not have to be}} curtailed ex ante. The participation of wind turbines especially reduces the occurrence of peak prices for positive and negative reserves in 2025. This reduction effect occurs even with a relatively low share where wind turbines participate with only five percent of their capacity. Therefore, further fostering the process of allowing wind turbines to participate in the German reserve market seems favorable...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{expands the}} {{discussion}} about future balancing reserve provision to the long-term perspective of 2050. Most pathways for a transformation towards a decarbonized electricity sector rely on very high shares of fluctuating renewables. This {{can be a challenge}} for the provision of balancing reserves, although their influence on the balancing cost is unclear. Apart from the transformation of the generation portfolio, various technical and regulatory developments within the balancing framework might further influence balancing costs: i) dynamic dimensioning of balancing reserves, ii) provision by fluctuating renewables or new (battery) storage technologies, and iii) exchange of balancing reserves between balancing zones. The first part of this paper discusses and transforms these developments into quantitative scenario definitions. The second part applies these scenarios to dynELMOD (dynamic Electricity Model), an investment model of the European electricity system that is extended to include balancing reserve provision. In contrast to other models applied in most papers on balancing reserves, this model is capable of evaluating the interdependencies between developments in balancing reserve provision and high shares of fluctuating renewables jointly. The results show that balancing reserve cost can be kept at current levels for a renewable electricity system until 2050, when using a dynamic reserve sizing horizon. Apart from the sizing horizon, storage capacity withholding duration and additional balancing demand from RES are the main driver of balancing costs. Renewables participation in <b>balancing</b> <b>provision</b> is mainly important for negative reserves, while storages play an important role for the provision of positive reserves. However, only on very few occasions, additional storage investments are required for balancing reserve provision, as most of the time sufficient storage capacities are available in the electricity system...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{adaptive}} online energy-aware scheduling algorithm by exploiting the reconfiguration capability of a Virtualized Networked Data Centers (VNetDCs) processing {{large amount of}} data in parallel. To achieve energy efficiency in such intensive computing scenarios, a joint <b>balanced</b> <b>provisioning</b> and scaling of the networking-plus-computing resources is required. We propose a scheduler that manages both the incoming workload and the VNetDC infrastructure to minimize the communication-plus-computing energy dissipated by processing incoming traffic under hard real-time constraints on the per-job computing-plus-communication delays. Specifically, our scheduler can distribute the workload among multiple virtual machines (VMs) and can tune the processor frequencies and the network bandwidth. The energy model used in our scheduler is rather sophisticated and takes into account also the internal/external frequency switching energy costs. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheduler guarantees high quality {{of service to the}} users respecting the service level agreements. Furthermore, it attains minimum energy consumptions under two real-world operating conditions: a discrete and finite number of CPU frequencies and not negligible VMs reconfiguration costs.

40|$|This {{report is}} the consensus-based, agreed {{position}} {{of the participants in}} a workshop for experts in sputum smear microscopy organised in August 2005 by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (The Union), and as such reflects their views, but not necessarily those of their respective organisations. The group reviewed current practices in sputum smear microscopy for tuberculosis (TB) and suggests considering certain changes in standard guidelines for the sputum collection strategy and the definition of sputum smear-positive TB. The Ziehl-Neelsen staining guidelines need to incorporate a wider error margin for widespread application under field conditions. Quality assurance is of utmost importance, and needs more commitment from National Tuberculosis Programmes and other health authorities. In particular, allocation of sufficient resources for rechecking and integration of laboratory supervision must be ensured. Countries must make better investments in the purchase of high quality microscopes and laboratory supplies.

This article advocates this view {{against the backdrop of}} the coverage and financing of existing social security programmes and points to the inadequacies of these measures in attaining the objectives of higher economic growth and the eradication of poverty. A character-istic feature of current social security programmes in South Asian economies is that they are designed in a conceptual vacuum and are implemented mainly as wel-fare measures. The emphasis is on promotional measures and even within that cat-egory, on poverty alleviation programmes. A <b>balanced</b> <b>provision</b> of promotional and protective social security measures is not evident in any country.

It is also apparent {{that there is a}} rapid development of childcare and other work-family <b>balance</b> <b>provisions</b> in collective labour agreements (CLAs) : either these provisions are being included in collective agreements, or existing provisions are being expanded. The reasons for this are obvious: from the employee’s point of view, childcare provisions make it interesting for women to join or stay in the labour market; from the employer’s point of view, although it may be a costly issue, these provisions may help attract and retain female employees. The main question is the following: to what extent can the share of female employees covered by a CLA explain the presence of work-family provisions in CLAs? Furthermore, does the gender of the union negotiator have a significant additional affect? The DUCADAM dataset, a digital database on collective labour agreements in the Netherlands, is used to tackle these questions. The findings show that the hypothesised relationships do not exist. Appar-ently, the supply of work-family provisions in CLAs is not a response to female employees’ demands, nor is it affected by the negotiator’s gender. Rather, economical factors seem to underlie work-family developments in CLAs, as indicated by the positive correlation between work-family provisions and yearly wage increase levels...|$|R
