40|$|There {{are very}} limited {{studies on the}} bond of spliced fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) reinforcing bars. Spliced bars are necessary for the limitation of the available bar lengths (standard manufactured length of reinforcing bar). In addition, this type of splice is required at the construction joints. Furthermore, <b>bundled</b> <b>bars</b> are required instead of spaced bars in case of heavily reinforced concrete structures. By using <b>bundled</b> <b>bars,</b> the congestion of reinforcement can be avoided. The current standards for steel reinforcement (such as CSA A 23. 3 and ACI 318) cannot {{be used for the}} FRP bars due to the inherent differences in their mechanical properties and surface configurations. There are no design recommendations available regarding the use of spliced bundled FRP bars. The results of this research project will fill this gap. In this context, 33 large-scale concrete beams reinforced with single or bundled tensile spliced FRP bars were subjected to a four-point flexural test until failure. Two types of FRP bars were used, namely glass FRP and carbon FRP bars. The effects of the bar diameter, splice length, number of <b>bundled</b> <b>bars,</b> confinement by stirrups, and thickness of the concrete cover on the bond strength, bond stress distribution, cracking behaviour and mode of failure of the spliced FRP bars in concrete were investigated. Furthermore, the research presented herein evaluates the existing recommendations for the spliced FRP bars (CAN/CSA-S 6 - 00, ISIS-M 03 - 01, CAN/CSA-S 806 - 02, and ACI 440. 1 R- 03). In addition, the average bond stresses and the critical splice lengths for the FRP bars with different diameters were investigated. The flexural test results indicated that the FRP stress limit is directly proportional to the splice length. Moreover, the ultimate strength analysis method can be used to predict the maximum stress in the spliced FRP bars. The results of these experiments show that the transverse reinforcement (steel stirrups in this case) is effective at increasing the bond strength. An objective of this research work was to develop an equation to predict the maximum average bond stress of the tensile lap-splice of FRP bars embedded in concrete. The proposed equation, which relates the average bond stress to the thickness of the concrete cover, the FRP bar diameter, the splice length, the concrete compressive strength, and the transverse reinforcement ratio, agrees well with the test data.

40|$|Reinforcement strength, {{ductility}} and bendability {{properties are}} important components in design of reinforced concrete members, as {{the strength of}} any member comes mainly from reinforcement. Strain compatibility and plastic behaviors are mainly depending on reinforcement ductility. In construction practice, often welding of the bars is required. Welding of reinforcement is an instant solution in many cases, whereas welding is not a routine connection process. Welding will cause deficiencies in reinforcement bars, metallurgical changes and re-crystallization of microstructure of particles. Weld metal toughness is extremely sensitive to the welding heat input that decreases both of its strength and ductility. For determining the effects of welding in reinforcement properties, 48 specimens were tested with 5 different bar diameters, divided into six groups.

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} the special situations, when the cover of {{reinforcement}} of structural members exceeds 50 mm, {{and it may be}} appropriate to provide a surface reinforcement. The new Model Code 2010 [1, 2] mentions such a reinforcement, but doesn’t specify its type, cover and the area amount. However such a surface reinforcement is able to increase the bending and especially shear resistance of structural members, subjected to bending and shear. In addition to that the surface reinforcement reduces an expansion and width of cracks. According to Eurocode 2 [3], Part 1 - 1 in Annex J – Detailing rules for particular situations – there are some special cases when such a surface reinforcement should be used. It is necessary to use this reinforcement type when:•diameter of designed bars is greater than 32 mm, or equivalent diameter of <b>bundled</b> <b>bar</b> exceeds this limit;•cover to reinforcement is greater than 70 mm (for enhanced durability);•crack widths without using surface reinforcement exceed allowed limit;•reinforced concrete structure is subject to fire and there is a risk of falling off of a concrete in the later stage of a fire exposure according to Part 1 - 2 of Eurocode 2 [5, 6]. The surface reinforcement should consist of wire mesh or small diameter bars and should be placed outside of links.

The principle changes in MC 2010 include raising the limit on concrete strength that may be used when determining bond resistance to 110 MPa, introduction of a coefficient η 4 to cater for different reinforcement Classes, and coverage of new construction materials including epoxy coated and headed bars. The format of design rules has been changed to permit more rational treatment of confinement from concrete cover and transverse reinforcement, the contribution of end hooks and bends for tension bars, and end bearing to compression laps. New guidance is provided covering a range of construction techniques and service environments and the influence of long term degradation.

40|$|The use of {{non-metallic}} {{glass fibre}} reinforced polymer (GFRP) materials {{as an alternative}} to steel reinforcement in concrete is gaining acceptance mainly due to their high corrosion resistance. A high strength-to-weight ratio and ease of handling and. fabrication are added advantages. However, the thermal characteristics of GFRP rods. can be sUbstantially different from those of concrete and conventional steel bars. The difference in the transverse thermal expansion between concre'te and FRP rods may cause hoop stresses within the concrete which can adversely affect the bond between the concrete and the rods and, eventually, lead to the formation of cracks within the concrete cover when the temperature increases. This research is an experimental investigation of the influence of transverse thermal expansion of GFRP rod on the flexural performance of concrete slabs. Fourteen concrete slabs (divided into four series, A, 8, C and D) were constructed and tested. The slab specimens, 1 S 0 xSOOx 2800 mm, were reinforced longitudinally using GFRP rod of 13, 16 or 19 mm bar diameters. No shear reinforcement was provided. The reinforcement ratio, bar diameter, clear bar spacing, concrete cover and placement configurations of GFRP rods were all varied. Each slab was simply supported and subjected to a two-point incremental load to failure. Prior to these ultimate loading tests, some test slabs were either thermally cycled once (series A, 8 and C) or nine times (series D). One slab from each series (A, 8 and C) was tested as a control specimen at room temperature only (no imposed thermal history). The flexural behaviour of these slabs in terms of crack pattern, crack width, deflections, ultimate strength and mode of failure as well the thermal behaviour of GFRP reinforced slabs was investigated. In addition, an attempt has been made to examine the effect of temperature change (100 Â°C) on the mechanical behaviour of GFRP materials. The properties evaluated included the tensile strength, bond behaviour and maximum bond stress. Finally, the experimental results were also compared with the theoretical predictions obtained from the ACI 440. 1 R- 06, analytical models and with numerical simulations obtained from nonlinear finite element analysis (DIANA- 9, 200 S). The experimental results showed that the control slabs performed better than the thermally cycled slabs in terms of: mid-span deflection, surface crack widths and ultimate capacity. A number of parameters: reinforcing placement configuration of GFRP bars, bar size, reinforcement ratio, and thermal actions were found to affect the flexural behaviour of the slabs. Due to the transverse thermal incompatibility between the concrete and GFRP, thermal action appears to influence the bond between the concrete and GFRP bars. It was found that the critical concrete cover for GFRP slabs using single or <b>bundled</b> <b>bars</b> depends on reinforcing placement configuration, the transverse thermal expansion of GFRP bars, bar diameter and the concrete tensile strength. To reduce the potential of thermally-induced transverse cracking in GFRP concrete slabs reinforced with a single bar (13, 16 and 19 mm) at a temperatur~ incr~. ase of up to 60 Â°C, a vertical concrete. cover greater than 1. S times the bar diameter (at least 1. Sdb), a horizontal concrete cover equal or greater than SO mm, and a higher tensile strength of the concrete (at least 2. 4 MPa for 13 mm bars) are recommended. For slabs reinforced with bundled (two) bars (13 and 16 mm),the required concrete cover is 1. Sdb and 2. Sdb with tensile strength ler = 3. 2 and 3. 6 MPa, respectively.

Ovako AB was the outsourcer and the studies were carried out on their production plant in Hällefors. The production in Hällefors included the making of hot rolled, peeled and ground bar and wire and also the manufacturing of pre-components from bars. The plant in Hällefors was certified with ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001 and TS 16949. The statistical analyses showed that crushing injuries and other soft tissue injuries were the most common type of injuries at the production plant in Hällefors during the time period 1 / 1 2014 – 28 / 4 2015. The second most common type of injuries was cutting injuries, sprains and muscle strains. During the same time period the most frequently reported reasons for an injury or a close call were getting hit by a flying or a falling object. The second most common reason was getting stuck or crushed between objects. The qualitative in-depth interviews pointed out that crushing injuries, cutting injuries, injuries from falls, burns and repetitive strain injuries were the most common injury types at the production plant in Hällefors. The interviewees described that tangled <b>bundles,</b> crooked <b>bars,</b> short bars, sharp edges on cut bars, work up on machines and loading tables, slippery surfaces, welding spatters and the manoeuvring of overhead cranes and vehicles are the biggest reasons why accidents occurs. The tool has the form of a checklist and the content is, based on the results from the study, divided in five different areas; Physical work environment, Psychological work environment, Ergonomics and work methods, Technical facilities and hand-held tools and at last Machines, vehicles and automation. The main part of the questions focuses on the risks with manual lifting and manual handling, but physical environmental factors and the functionality of machines also stands for a big part. The recommendation to Ovako is to implement the risk identifying tool at their unit in Hällefors and continue the development of the content. There are many positive sides with a safe work environment and good working conditions. Wellbeing of the employees, financial benefits for the company and stronger competitive forces are just some of these. The result of this master thesis project are applicable for other type of businesses in the industry sector. However, the tool needs to be optimized based on the specific work conditions to obtain optimal benefits. Safety needs priority!Validerat; 20160814 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
