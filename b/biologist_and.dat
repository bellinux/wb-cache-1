5|$|Although Beebe {{attempted}} {{to ensure that}} Barton would receive credit as the Bathysphere's inventor and Beebe's fellow diver, the popular media tended to ignore Barton and pay attention only to Beebe. Barton was often resentful of this, believing Beebe to be deliberately hogging the fame. Beebe in turn lacked patience for Barton's unpredictable moods, and felt that Barton did not display the proper respect for the natural world. Still, Beebe and Barton both had something the other needed: Beebe for {{his experience as a}} marine <b>biologist,</b> <b>and</b> Barton for his mechanical skill. Out of pragmatic concern for the success of their dives, they managed to resolve their disagreements well enough to work together at Nonsuch Island, although they did not remain on good terms afterwards.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, Belgian {{physicist}} Joseph Plateau examined soap films, {{leading him}} to formulate {{the concept of}} a minimal surface.

Scottish biologist D'Arcy Thompson pioneered the study of growth patterns in both plants and animals, showing that simple equations could explain spiral growth. In the 20th century, British mathematician Alan Turing predicted mechanisms of morphogenesis which give rise to patterns of spots and stripes. Hungarian biologist Aristid Lindenmayer and French American mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot showed how the mathematics of fractals could create plant growth patterns.|$|E
5|$|Jaws is a 1975 American thriller film {{directed}} by Steven Spielberg {{and based on}} Peter Benchley's 1974 novel of the same name. In the story, a giant man-eating great white shark attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, a fictional New England summer resort town, prompting the local police chief to hunt it {{with the help of}} a marine <b>biologist</b> <b>and</b> a professional shark hunter. The film stars Roy Scheider as police chief Martin Brody, Robert Shaw as shark hunter Quint, Richard Dreyfuss as oceanographer Matt Hooper, Murray Hamilton as Larry Vaughn, the mayor of Amity Island, and Lorraine Gary as Brody's wife, Ellen. The screenplay is credited to both Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer Carl Gottlieb, who rewrote the script during principal photography.|$|E

5|$|SpongeBob SquarePants is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by marine <b>biologist</b> <b>and</b> animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. The series {{is set in}} the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom, and centers on the adventures and endeavors of SpongeBob SquarePants, an over-optimistic sea sponge that annoys other characters. Many of the ideas for the show originated in an unpublished, educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in the mid-1980s. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 after the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, another Nickelodeon television series that Hillenburg previously directed.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Richard Dawkins {{described himself}} as a neo-Paleyan in The Blind Watchmaker (1986), where he argued, following the evolutionary <b>biologist</b> <b>and</b> humanist Julian Huxley, that Paley's watch analogy fails to recognise the difference between the complexity of living organisms and that of inanimate objects. Living organisms can reproduce themselves, so they can change to become more complex from generation to generation. Inanimate objects such as watches are unable to pass on any changes, so they never become more complex unless a watchmaker redesigns them. The comparison breaks down, in Dawkins's view, because of this important distinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} of the American {{animated}} television sitcom SpongeBob SquarePants, created by former marine <b>biologist</b> <b>and</b> animator Stephen Hillenburg, aired from May 1, 1999 to April 8, 2000, and consists of 20 episodes. The series chronicles the exploits and adventures of the title character and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom. The show features the voices of Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Rodger Bumpass, Clancy Brown, Mr. Lawrence, Jill Talley, Carolyn Lawrence, Mary Jo Catlett, and Lori Alan. Among the first guest stars {{to appear on the}} show were Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway voicing the superhero characters of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Emile Durkheim {{was born}} in Épinal in Lorraine, the son of Mélanie (Isidor) and Moïse Durkheim. He came {{from a long line}} of devout French Jews; his father, grandfather, and {{great-grandfather}} had been rabbis. He began his education in a rabbinical school, but at an early age, he decided not to follow in his family's footsteps and switched schools. Durkheim led a completely secular life. Much of his work was dedicated to demonstrating that religious phenomena stemmed from social rather than divine factors. While Durkheim chose not to follow in the family tradition, he did not sever ties with his family or with the Jewish community. Many of his most prominent collaborators and students were Jewish, and some were blood relations. Marcel Mauss, a notable social anthropologist of the pre-war era, was his nephew. One of his nieces was Claudette (née Raphael) Bloch, a marine <b>biologist</b> <b>and</b> mother of Maurice Bloch, who became a noted anthropologist.|$|E
5|$|The Mendelian and biometrician {{models were}} {{eventually}} reconciled {{with the development}} of population genetics. A key step was the work of the British <b>biologist</b> <b>and</b> statistician Ronald Fisher. In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes, and that natural selection could change gene frequencies in a population, resulting in evolution. In a series of papers beginning in 1924, another British geneticist, J. B. S. Haldane, applied statistical analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths, and showed that natural selection worked at an even faster rate than Fisher assumed.|$|E
5|$|While {{travelling}} {{by train}} to Stromberg's base in Sardinia, Bond saves Amasova from Jaws, and their cooling rivalry turns to affection. Posing as a marine <b>biologist</b> <b>and</b> his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover {{that he had}} launched a mysterious new supertanker, the Liparus, nine months previously. As they leave the base, an unknown henchman on a motorcycle featuring a rocket sidecar, Jaws in a car, and Naomi, an assistant/pilot of Stromberg in an attack helicopter, chase them, but Bond and Amasova escape underwater when his car – a Lotus Esprit from Q Branch – converts into a submarine. Jaws survives a car crash and Naomi is killed when Bond fires a sea-air missile from his car which destroys her helicopter. The pair also encounter a fleet of Stromberg's minisubs which Amasova obliterates by launching mines. Bond finds out that the Liparus has never visited any known port or harbor. Amasova discovers that Bond killed her lover (as shown {{at the beginning of}} the movie), and she vows to kill Bond as soon as their mission is complete.|$|E

40|$|Computational {{modeling}} is {{an important}} element of systems biology. One of its important applications is modeling complex, dynamical, and biological systems, including viral infections. This type of modeling usually requires close cooperation between <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> mathematicians. However, such cooperation often faces communication problems because biologists do not have sufficient knowledge to understand mathematical description of the models, and mathematicians do not have sufficient knowledge to define and verify these models. In many areas of systems biology, this problem has already been solved; however, in some of these areas there are still certain problematic aspects. The goal of the presented research was to facilitate this cooperation by designing seminatural formal language for describing viral infection models that will be easy to understand for <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> easy to use by mathematicians and computer scientists. The ModeLang language was designed in cooperation with <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> its computer implementation was prepared. Tests proved that it can be successfully used to describe commonly used viral infection models and then to simulate and verify them. As a result, it can make cooperation between <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> mathematicians modeling viral infections much easier, speeding up computational verification of formulated hypotheses...|$|R
