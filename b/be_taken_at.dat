5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument rests on the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E
5|$|As {{the match}} went to penalties, Rio Ferdinand won the coin toss for Manchester United, and opted for his side {{to go first}} in the shoot-out, which would <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> the end housing the Manchester United fans. Tevez stepped up first and sent Čech the wrong way. Ballack was next up, {{shooting}} powerfully past Van der Sar. Carrick buried his spot-kick, as did Juliano Belletti with his first touch of the game, having come on for Makélélé {{at the end of}} extra time. The first miss of the shoot-out came from Ronaldo, who characteristically stuttered in his run-up in an attempt to put Čech off, but the goalkeeper dived to his right to save.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he could <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> <b>At</b> about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a new role as a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the oath, the monarch may take {{what is known as}} the Accession Declaration if he or she has not yet made it. This declaration was first required by the Bill of Rights of 1689 and is required to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> either the first meeting of the parliament after a new monarch's accession (i.e. during the State Opening of Parliament) or at his or her coronation. The monarch additionally swears a separate oath to preserve Presbyterian church government in the Church of Scotland and this oath is taken before the coronation.|$|E
5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> face value because of its political implications.|$|E

Mulder meets with Scully at the hospital, who reveals that her sister died a few hours before. Mulder tells Scully that he believes that the truth is still in the X-Files.

5|$|However, {{even where}} {{recognisable}} facts are present, {{their use in}} the History cannot <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> face value. In the Life of Alexander Severus, the History makes the claim at 24.4 that Alexander had considered banning male prostitution but had decided against making it illegal, although the author added that the emperor Philip did later ban the practice. Although the claim about Alexander is false, the note about Philip is true — {{the source of this}} is Aurelius Victor (28.6–7, and who in turn sourced it from the Kaisergeschichte), and the History even copies Victor's style of moralising asides, which were not in the Kaisergeschichte. Normally, this anecdote would have been included in a Life of Philip, but its absence saw the author include it in another life. This is taken as evidence that the mid-work lacuna is deliberate, as the author was apparently reluctant to abandon any useful material that could be gleaned from the Kaisergeschichte.|$|E
5|$|Perfect Dark is a first-person shooter {{in which}} players control Carrington Institute agent Joanna Dark {{through a series}} of levels {{collected}} together into missions. The general gameplay {{is similar to that of}} its predecessor GoldenEye 007, with features such as stealth sections and objectives determined by difficulty settings carried over. Players can crouch, duck, lean, and drop from most ledges, but there is no jump ability. A number of tutorials and training activities can <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> the Carrington Institute, which acts as the game's central hub. The Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is needed to access the game's campaign and most of the multiplayer features, although a limited subset of the Combat Simulator options are available without the device; around 35% of the game is playable without an Expansion Pak, as estimated on the game's box and Instruction Booklet.|$|E

5|$|The Belgo-Congolese {{situation}} remained difficult {{until early}} June, when the Baro and Sobat rivers rose enough for reinforcements from the Congo to reach them. They {{then decided to}} try and sever the Italian supply line between Saïo and Mogi, another town upon the plateau. To hold the line near Bortai Brook, the Belgians could only spare around 250 men for an attack. It was hoped that cutting the Italians off would allow the British, stalled in their advance at Gidami, to move south and encircle Saïo. On 9 June the Belgian force attacked Mogi, their flank covered {{by the arrival of}} a new battalion from the Congo. The Italian garrison, numbering around 300 men, held off the assault. Believing that that the town could only <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> a heavy cost, the Belgians instead fortified their positions around Mogi and sent patrols to ambush the road by which Saïo was being supplied.|$|E
5|$|To {{improve his}} {{academic}} profile, Moore planned to attend American Christian School in Aston, Pennsylvania, {{but a new}} NCAA rule was instituted that limited the number of core classes able to <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> a prep school. Lacking the required number of credits to receive an athletic scholarship, he enrolled at Temple as a non-scholarship student and sat out his freshman year as a redshirt. In his freshman debut the following year, he scored 11points against East Tennessee State. Moore followed that performance up with a double-double of 11points and 10rebounds versus the College of Charleston, and a season-high 13points in a loss to Clemson. As a freshman, Moore averaged 4.5points and 2.3rebounds per game in 13.2minutes of playing time. After his 13th game, he was suspended due to Temple eligibility rules and did not play {{in the remainder of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|William {{wrote an}} account of the Lateran Council and a history of the Islamic states from the time of Muhammad. Neither work survives. He is famous today as the author of a history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. William {{composed}} his chronicle in excellent Latin for his time, with numerous quotations from classical literature. The chronicle is sometimes given the title Historia rerum in partibus transmarinis gestarum ("History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea") or Historia Ierosolimitana ("History of Jerusalem"), or the Historia for short. It was translated into French soon after his death, and thereafter into numerous other languages. Because it is the only source for the history of twelfth-century Jerusalem written by a native, historians have often assumed that William's statements could <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> face value. However, more recent historians have shown that William's involvement in the kingdom's political disputes resulted in detectable biases in his account. Despite this, he is considered the greatest chronicler of the crusades, {{and one of the best}} authors of the Middle Ages.|$|E

5|$|Claiborne made no overt legal {{attempts}} to re-assert control over Kent Island during the commission's rule of Maryland, although a treaty concluded {{during that time}} with the Susquehannocks claimed that Claiborne owned both Kent and Palmer Islands. Claiborne's legal designs on Maryland were once again defeated when Oliver Cromwell returned Calvert to power in 1653, after the Rump Parliament ended. In 1654, Governor Stone of Maryland tried to reclaim authority for the proprietor and declared that Claiborne's property and his life could <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> <b>at</b> the Governor's pleasure. Stone's declaration was ignored and Claiborne and Bennett again overthrew him, creating a new assembly in which Catholics {{were not allowed to}} serve. Calvert, now angry at Stone for what he perceived as weakness, demanded that Stone do something, and in 1655 Stone reclaimed control in St. Mary's and led a group of soldiers to Providence (modern Annapolis). Stone was captured and his force defeated by local Puritan settlers, who took control of the colony. Given the new situation, Claiborne and Bennett went to England in hopes of convincing Cromwell to change his mind but, to their dismay, no decision was made and, lacking royal authority, the Puritans gave power over to a new governor appointed by Calvert. Going behind Claiborne's back, Bennett and another commissioner reached an agreement with Calvert that virtually guaranteed his continued control over Maryland through the remainder of the Protectorate.|$|E
