5|$|European music between 800 and 1100 {{became more}} sophisticated, more {{frequently}} requiring instruments capable of polyphony. The 9th-century Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that, in the Byzantine Empire, typical instruments included the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably {{a type of}} harp or lyre), salandj (probably a bagpipe) and the lyra. The Byzantine lyra, a <b>bowed</b> string instrument, is an ancestor of most European <b>bowed</b> instruments, including the violin.|$|E

5|$|Calabria, alone, has 30 {{traditional}} musical instruments, some {{of which}} have strongly archaic characteristics and are largely extinct elsewhere in Italy. It is home to the four- or five-stringed guitar called the chitarra battente, and a three-stringed, <b>bowed</b> fiddle called the lira, which is also found in similar forms in the music of Crete and Southeastern Europe. A one-stringed, <b>bowed</b> fiddle called the torototela, is common in the northeast of the country. The largely German-speaking area of South Tyrol is known for the zither, and the ghironda (hurdy-gurdy) is found in Emilia, Piedmont and Lombardy.|$|E

50|$|Shorter <b>bow</b> designsbecame popular {{during the}} Ming dynasty (1368-1644 CE). Wubei Zhi (Chapter 102) {{describes}} several <b>bow</b> styles popular during the Mingdynasty: in the North, the short-siyah <b>bow,</b> grooved-siyah <b>bow,</b> grooved-bridge bow,and long-siyah bow; in the South, the Chenzhou <b>bow,</b> short-siyah <b>bow,</b> as well asbamboo composite <b>bows</b> finished with lacquer; the Kaiyuan <b>bow</b> {{was used in}} all parts of Ming China. The small-siyah <b>bow</b> (Chinese: 小稍弓) differed from earlier Chinesedesigns in that its siyahs were short and set at an angle forward ofthe string when at rest. Its design is possibly related to theKorean horn <b>bow.</b> The Kaiyuan <b>bow</b> (Chinese: 开元弓) was a small-to-medium size <b>bow</b> whichfeatured long siyahs, and it was the <b>bow</b> of choice for high-rankingofficers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bow</b> frog is the {{end part}} of a {{stringed}} musical instrument's <b>bow</b> that encloses the mechanism responsible for tightening and holding the <b>bow</b> hair ribbon.

5|$|Although most of {{the figures}} are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of his}} assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head <b>bowed</b> and hands clasped behind his back. His daughters served as models for some of the figures.|$|E
5|$|An {{orangutan}} {{has a large}}, bulky body, a thick neck, very long, strong arms, short, <b>bowed</b> legs, and no tail. It {{is mostly}} covered with long, reddish-brown hair and grey-black skin. Sumatran orangutans have more sparse and lighter-coloured coats. The orangutan has a large head with a prominent mouth area. Though largely hairless, their faces can develop some hair in males, giving them a moustache.|$|E
50|$|Multiple <b>bow</b> {{systems have}} a special system of pulling the sinew via several <b>bows</b> (which can be recurve <b>bows).</b> The {{workings}} {{can be compared to}} a modern compound <b>bow</b> system. The weapon uses several different <b>bows</b> instead of one <b>bow</b> with a tackle system to achieve a higher acceleration of the sinew via the multiplication with each <b>bow's</b> pulling effect.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Bows</b> {{are also}} made from other materials, such as carbon-fibre—stronger than wood—and {{fiberglass}} (often {{used to make}} inexpensive, lower-quality student <b>bows).</b> An average cello <b>bow</b> is [...] long (shorter than a violin or viola <b>bow)</b> [...] high (from the frog to the stick) and [...] wide. The frog of a cello <b>bow</b> typically has a rounded corner {{like that of a}} viola <b>bow,</b> but is wider. A cello <b>bow</b> is roughly [...] heavier than a viola <b>bow,</b> which in turn is roughly [...] heavier than a violin <b>bow.</b>|$|R

5|$|As {{the chief}} {{parliamentary}} spokesman for an abandoned policy, Calvert no longer served a useful purpose to the English Royal Court, and by February 1624 his duties had been restricted to placating the Spanish ambassador. The degree of his disfavour was shown {{when he was}} reprimanded for supposedly delaying diplomatic letters. Calvert <b>bowed</b> to the inevitable. On the pretext of ill health, he began negotiations {{for the sale of}} his position, finally resigning the secretariat in February 1625.|$|E
5|$|Bowen and the Spurs {{bounced back}} {{and won the}} NBA title in 2005, {{defeating}} the Detroit Pistons. The Spurs could not win back-to-back titles, however, and <b>bowed</b> out 4–3 in a seven-game series against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Playoffs. As a testament to his controversial style of play, Bowen picked up a $10,000 NBA fine for kicking Ray Allen in the back during a March 2006 game.|$|E
5|$|During the 1860s and 1870s, {{there were}} {{occasional}} anti-Chinese demonstrations in the poorer districts of San Francisco. Riots, sometimes resulting in fatalities, took place.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a study of the}} {{traditional}} use of a special kind of wood in <b>bow</b> construction in Eurasia and North America. This special kind of wood, called compression wood and coming from coniferous trees, has unique qualities that makes it suitable for <b>bow</b> construction. <b>Bows</b> made using this special wood have been referred to as Finno-Ugric <b>bows,</b> Sámi <b>bows,</b> Two-Wood <b>bows</b> and Eurasia laminated <b>bows.</b> These <b>bows</b> appear to have developed from archaic forms of compression wood self <b>bows</b> that were made from a single piece of wood. Recently features similar to the Eurasian compression wood <b>bows</b> have been discovered in <b>bows</b> originating from Alaska, and the use of compression wood for <b>bow</b> manufacture has been known to some Canadian Inuit groups. This paper addresses the origin and possible diffusion pattern of this innovation in <b>bow</b> technology in Eurasia and suggests a timeframe and a possible source for the transfer of this knowledge to North America. This paper also discusses the role of the Asiatic composite <b>bow</b> in the development of <b>bows</b> in Eurasia. </p...|$|R

Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
