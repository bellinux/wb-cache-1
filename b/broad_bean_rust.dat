40|$|The differentiation-specific {{formation}} of three isoforms of pectinesterase by the <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> <b>rust</b> fungus Uromyces viciae-fabae is described. Activity becomes detectable when substomatal vesicles are formed. In crude extracts isoform A contributed 78 % {{of the total}} pectinesterase activity, and isoforms B and C contributed 20 % and 2 %, respectively. All three isoforms were found extracellularly in ratios identical to those in extracts. The isoelectric points of the pectinesterase isoforms were 8. 4 (A), 5. 7 (B), and 4. 7 (C) as determined by chromatofocusing. Isoform A had an M, of 33500 and showed a distinct pH optimum at 6. 0. The M, of isoform B was 4 OOOO; its pH optimum ranged from 5. 5 to 7 - 5. Due to its extremely low activity, isoform C was not further characterized.

40|$|Abstract Background Non-host {{resistance}} (NHR) confers {{plant species}} immunity against {{the majority of}} microbial pathogens and represents the most robust and durable form of plant resistance in nature. As {{one of the main}} genera of rust fungi with economic and biological importance, Puccinia infects almost all cereals but is unable to cause diseases on legumes. Little is known about the mechanism of this kind of effective defense in legumes to these non-host pathogens. Results In this study, the basis of NHR in broad bean (Vicia faba L.) against the wheat stripe rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), was characterized. No visible symptoms were observed on broad bean leaves inoculated with Pst. Microscopic observations showed that successful location of stomata and haustoria formation were significantly reduced in Pst infection of broad bean. Attempted infection induced the formation of papillae, cell wall thickening, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and accumulation of phenolic compounds in plant cell walls. The few Pst haustoria that did form in broad bean cells were encased in reactive oxygen and callose materials and those cells elicited cell death. Furthermore, a total of seven defense-related genes were identified and found to be up-regulated during the Pst infection. Conclusions The results indicate that NHR in broad bean against Pst results from a continuum of layered defenses, including basic incompatibility, structural and chemical strengthening of cell wall, posthaustorial hypersensitive response and induction of several defense-related genes, demonstrating the multi-layered feature of NHR. This work also provides useful information for further determination of resistance mechanisms in broad bean to rust fungi, especially the adapted important <b>broad</b> <b>bean</b> <b>rust</b> pathogen, Uromyces viciae-fabae, because of strong similarity and association between NHR of plants to unadapted pathogens and basal resistance of plants to adapted pathogens. </p...|$|E

40|$|Common bean is an economically, nutritionally, and {{socially}} important crop. It is grown in distinct regions and different seasons {{around the world}} by subsistence level farmers with low-technology input {{as well as by}} farmers that use high input technologies. One important factor that can limit the bean growing and drastically affect grain yields is the high number of destructive pathogens that attack and cause serious damage to the crop. Among them is <b>bean</b> <b>rust,</b> incited by the fungus Uromyces appendiculatus. This disease is distributed throughout the world, but it effectively causes major production problems in humid tropical and subtropical regions.
