500|$|George S. Hammond is a United States Air Force Major General (later Lieutenant General) from Texas, who {{commands}} Stargate Command (SGC) in {{the first}} seven seasons of Stargate SG-1. The series pilot introduces Hammond as the successor of Major General West, {{the commander of the}} Stargate Project in the original Stargate film. Hammond had been stationed as a Lieutenant at the Cheyenne Mountain Complex (the present-day location of Stargate Command) in 1969, Hammond's mentioned relatives include his wife, who had died of cancer four years before the events of the series began, and his granddaughters named Kayla and Tessa (whose telephone number occupies Hammond's first speed dial <b>button</b> <b>above</b> the President of the United States which occupies the second). [...] His father is also mentioned in the Season 2 episode entitled 1969.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first batch}} of 44 Class 357/0 units were ordered {{at a cost}} of £200 million by Prism Rail in March 1997 to replace the Class 310 slam-door units, and allow the return of 18 hired Class 317 units to their other {{franchise}} West Anglia Great Northern. Construction started in 1999, and they are currently leased by c2c from Porterbrook. They were built in the green LTS Rail colour scheme, painted with a white livery with dark green doors and underskirt (bottom body panels). Their interior consists of dark green seat moquette with alternating rows of large flecks of light blue and light green, light green plastic seat tops with slots in the side for reservation tickets (which are not used) with dark green insets, a stone pattern linoleum floor, purple plastic interior, light green handrails and metal luggage racks with large circular perforations and light green edges, and dark green stickers on the inter-carriage gangway doors. The [...] "door out of order" [...] display is in between the interior door buttons, with the door close <b>button</b> <b>above</b> and the door open button below, unlike in the 357/2 units. These units were fitted with the voice of Julie Berry. See 1973 tube stock for info on her announcement career.|$|E
50|$|Flat or sew-through buttons have holes {{through which}} thread is sewn {{to attach the}} button. Flat buttons may be {{attached}} by sewing machine rather than by hand, and may be used with heavy fabrics by working a thread shank to extend {{the height of the}} <b>button</b> <b>above</b> the fabric.|$|E
50|$|On the {{top edge}} are two pairs of buttons: display {{brightness}} <b>buttons</b> <b>above</b> the left ear, and volume <b>buttons</b> <b>above</b> the right ear. Adjacent buttons are shaped differently—one concave, one convex—so that the user can distinguish them by touch.|$|R

50|$|The {{weapon is}} based on the SPAS-12, and has similar pump-action/{{semi-automatic}} firing modes. In semi-automatic mode a gas piston drives a bolt carrier and rotating bolt. In pump-action mode the same components are driven by sliding the fore-end backwards. Pump-action mode is required to reliably fire low-pressure (less lethal) ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. Switching between firing modes is done by pressing a <b>button</b> <b>above</b> the foregrip, and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards. The barrel is chrome lined and features screw-in choke tubes.|$|E

There are 5 doors {{on each side of}} the tram (10 total). Doors will open on demand (passenger has to push a <b>button).</b> <b>Above</b> each door, there is an infrared photosensor system which can be used to count passengers boarding the tram. It can be used to automatically close the doors, if no passenger has passed through for a certain amount of time.|$|E
50|$|The Juno-60 {{provides}} a single triangle-wave variable-rate LFO for modulation options. This is routed into the DCO to create pitch vibrato and pulse-width modulation, plus into the lowpass filter {{to generate a}} tremolo effect. All three choices can be used simultaneously, each with their own individual depth settings. The LFO can then either be triggered manually by the left hand using a large <b>button</b> <b>above</b> the pitch bend lever or set to engage automatically whenever a key was pressed. The LFO also features a slider to adjust a delay time for when it will be triggered automatically.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, Roland {{released}} a two-oscillator monophonic synthesizer called the Promars, {{which is often}} considered a monophonic version of the Jupiter-4. The Promars {{did not have the}} Jupiter-4's arpeggiator or its [...] "ensemble" [...] chorus effect, and reduced the four voice cards to two with basic detune. It had the memory and preset selection <b>buttons</b> <b>above</b> the keyboard, which were less clumsy to use than those on the Jupiter-4. It also had 37 keys, making slightly smaller than the Jupiter-4.|$|R

50|$|A 3-axis {{accelerometer}} senses {{the orientation}} of the phone and changes the screen accordingly, allowing the user to easily switch between portrait and landscape mode. Photo browsing, web browsing, and music playing support both upright and left or right widescreen orientations. Unlike the iPad, the iPhone does not rotate the screen when turned upside-down, with the Home <b>button</b> <b>above</b> the screen, unless the running program has been specifically designed to do so. The 3.0 update added landscape support for still other applications, such as email, and introduced shaking the unit as a form of input. The accelerometer {{can also be used to}} control third-party apps, notably games. It is also used for fitness tracking purposes, primarily as a pedometer.|$|E

50|$|The bill is {{calculated}} by counting {{the number and}} type of plates of the consumed sushi. Plates with different colors, patterns, or shapes have different prices, usually ranging from 100 yen to 500 yen. The cost of each plate is shown on signboards or posters in the restaurant. In general, cheap items come on plain plates, {{and the level of}} plate decoration is related to the price. The most expensive items tend to come on gold colored plates. Expensive items may be placed on two plates, with the price being the sum of the prices of the individual plates. Some conveyor belt sushi restaurant chains, such as Kappa Sushi or Otaru Zushi, have a fixed price of 100 yen for every plate. This is similar to the phenomenon of 100-yen shops. A <b>button</b> <b>above</b> the conveyor belt can be used to call the attendants to count the plates. Some restaurants have a counting machine where the customer drops the plates to be counted automatically.|$|E

40|$|Consumer’s {{preferences}} and purchase motivation of products often {{lie in the}} purchasing behaviors generated by the synthetic evaluation of form features, color, function, and price of products. If an enterprise can bring these criteria under control, they can grasp the opportunities in the market place. In this study, the product form, brand, and prices of five DSLR digital cameras of Nikon, Lumix, Pentax, Sony, and Olympus were investigated from the image evaluation and eye tracking. The web-based 2 -dimensional analytical tool was used to present information on three layers. Layer A provided information of product form and brand name; Layer B for product form, brand name, and product price {{for the evaluation of}} purchase intention (X axis) and product form attraction (Y axis). On Layer C, Nikon J 1 image samples of five color series were presented for the evaluation of attraction and purchase intention. The study results revealed that, among five Japanese brands of digital cameras, LUMIX GF 3 is most preferred and serves as the major competitive product, with a product price of US$ 630. Through the visual focus of eye-tracking, the lens, curvatured handle bar, the curve part and shuttle <b>button</b> <b>above</b> the lens as well as the flexible flash of LUMIX GF 3 are the parts that attract the consumer’s eyes. From the verbal descriptions, it is found that consumers emphasize the functions of 3 D support lens, continuous focusing in shooting video, iA intelligent scene mode, and all manual control support. In the color preference of Nikon J 1, the red and white colors are most preferred while pink is least favored. These findings can serve as references for designers and marketing personnel in new product design and development...|$|E
40|$|The {{response}} {{of three different}} SiC-ZrB 2 ceramics obtained by hot-pressing was studied at typical conditions of thermal protection systems of a re-entry spacecraft.

When {{compared}} to the 525, you will find the same <b>buttons</b> <b>above</b> the LCD. The 720 has a colour LCD with six buttons/activities instead of four. The eight play/stop etc. buttons have been moved to the lower part. The Mute and Prev buttons have been moved and in their place, there are extra up and down buttons — same as on the 550. Compared to the 500 series, the glow button has been removed. These remotes do not have the Sound and Picture buttons to change key mappings, like the 550/555 remotes does. Lacking red, green, yellow and blue colour buttons, the 720 has 49 buttons. It can control up to 12 devices.|$|R
