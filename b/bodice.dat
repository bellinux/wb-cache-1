5|$|A steel corset in the Stibbert Museum, Florence, Italy, is {{dated to}} the mid-16th century, and {{thought to be}} similar to the metal stays {{recorded}} as having been made by a corazzaio mastro (master armour-maker) for Eleanor of Toledo and delivered to her on 28 February 1549. However, as Eleanor's wardrobe records do not list any boned or stiffened corsets, it is thought that her steel <b>bodice</b> was designed for medical or therapeutic reasons rather than worn as a fashionable garment.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{women also}} {{generally}} wear similar dresses as the Hindu women. However, the one {{difference is that}} the tunic they wear is considerably shorter, just touching the knee. They don a small vest called a angi, worn beneath the <b>bodice.</b> A small shirt or kurta is also common. Hindu men wear an angrakha, long tunic that touches the knees. A cloth waist-band and tight fitting pajama and a small pagri (top hat) worn on top of the head completes their ensemble.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the history}} of {{migrants}} arriving in Chamba from across Kashmir and Tibet over the centuries, today Chamba {{has a variety of}} traditional dresses, defined by the region to which they belong. The most traditional dress worn by Hindu women, on special occasions, is the pashwaj. Pashwaj is a gown with a short <b>bodice</b> (blouse) covering up to the waist. A shirt is worn, below which the dress falls in many folds, nearly touching the ground. The typical casual dress though, however, is a pairahan, with a chadar or dupatta (stoll) worn over the head. The lower half of the body is covered by a pyjama, known as a suthan.|$|E

50|$|From about 1740, most {{gowns and}} <b>bodices</b> were worn {{to reveal the}} stomacher, which covered {{the front of the}} torso from {{neckline}} to waist or even below the waist. The <b>bodice's</b> lacings would then criss-cross over the stomacher, and eventually the lacings became a series of decorative bows.|$|R

5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality {{does not make it}} a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened <b>bodice,</b> and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E
25|$|As a fitted style emerged under Spanish influence, {{the gown}} was {{made as a}} {{separate}} <b>bodice</b> and skirt; this <b>bodice</b> usually fastened at the side or the side-back with hooks and eyes or lacing.|$|E
25|$|Corsets {{also began}} to be worn about this time. At first they were called pairs of bodies, which refers to a {{stiffened}} decorative <b>bodice</b> worn {{on top of another}} <b>bodice</b> stiffened with buckram, reeds, canes, whalebone or other materials. These were not the small-waisted, curved corsets familiar from the Victorian era, but straight-lined stays that flattened the bust.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy silks {{in solid}} colors became fashionable for both {{day and evening}} wear, and a skirt might be made with two <b>bodices,</b> one long-sleeved and high necked for {{afternoon}} wear and one short-sleeved and low-necked for evening. The <b>bodices</b> themselves were often triangular, and featured a two-piece front with a closure and a three-piece back construction.|$|R
25|$|In the 1840s, {{collapsed}} sleeves, low necklines, elongated V-shaped <b>bodices,</b> and fuller skirts characterised {{the dress}} styles of women.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, {{designers}} of women's undergarments relaxed the corset. The invention of new, flexible but supportive materials allowed whalebone and steel bones to be removed. The emancipation or liberty <b>bodice</b> offered {{an alternative to}} constricting corsets, and in Australia and the UK the liberty <b>bodice</b> became a standard item for girls as well as women.|$|E
25|$|The {{trend for}} broad skirts slowly {{disappeared}} during the 1870s, as women started to prefer an even slimmer silhouette. Bodices {{remained at the}} natural waistline, necklines varied, while sleeves began under the shoulder line. An overskirt was commonly worn over the <b>bodice,</b> and secured into a large bow behind. Over time though, the overskirt shortened into a detached basque, resulting in an elongation of the <b>bodice</b> over the hips. As the bodices grew longer in 1873, the polonaise was thus introduced into the Victorian dress styles. A polonaise is a garment featuring both an overskirt and <b>bodice</b> together. The tournure was also introduced, and along with the polonaise, it created an illusion of an exaggerated rear end.|$|E

25|$|Unfitted gowns (called nightgowns in England) {{with long}} hanging sleeves, short open sleeves, or no sleeves at all were worn over the <b>bodice</b> and skirt and {{tied with a}} ribbon sash at the waist. In England of the 1610s and 1620s, a loose nightgown was often worn over an {{embroidered}} jacket called a waistcoat and a contrasting embroidered petticoat, without a farthingale. Black gowns were worn for the most formal occasions; they fell out of fashion in England in the 1630s in favour of gowns to match the <b>bodice</b> and petticoat, but remained an important item of clothing on the Continent.|$|E

25|$|While {{manufacturing}} {{was beginning}} to become more organized, homemade bras and bandeaux were still quite popular, usually made of white cotton, but they {{were little more than}} bust <b>bodices</b> with some separation.|$|R
25|$|By 1860's when Europe was {{all about}} made to fit {{tailoring}} crinolines were considered impractical. In 1870's women preferred more slimmer silhouette hence bodices grew longer and polonaise was introduced that was a skirt and <b>bodice</b> made together. In 1870s there was a invention of Ciurass <b>Bodice</b> that {{is a piece of}} armour that covers the torso and functions like a corset. Towards the end of Victorian reign dresses were flared naturally as crinolines were rejected by middle class women and designers such as Charles Fredrick Worth were also against it. All these inventions and changes in fashion led to women liberation as tailored looks improved posture and were more practical.|$|E
25|$|Bodices were long-waisted at the {{beginning}} of the century, but waistlines rose steadily to the mid-1630s before beginning to drop again. In the second decade of the 17th century, short tabs developed attached to the bottom of the <b>bodice</b> covering the bum-roll which supported the skirts. These tabs grew longer during the 1620s and were worn with a stomacher which filled the gap between the two front edges of the <b>bodice.</b> By 1640 the long tabs had almost disappeared and a longer, smoother figure became fashionable: The waist returned to normal height at the back and sides with a low point at the front.|$|E

25|$|The décolleté style made shawls {{to become}} an {{essential}} feature of dresses. Corsets lost their shoulder straps, and fashion was to produce two <b>bodices,</b> one closed décolletage for day and one décolleté for evening.|$|R
25|$|Open-fronted <b>bodices</b> {{could be}} filled {{in with a}} {{decorative}} stomacher, and {{toward the end of}} the period a lace or linen kerchief called a fichu could be worn to fill in the low neckline.|$|R
25|$|Minoan men wore loincloths and kilts. Women wore robes {{with short}} sleeves and layered, flounced skirts. The robes {{were open to}} the navel, exposing their breasts. Women could also wear a strapless, fitted <b>bodice,</b> and {{clothing}} patterns had symmetrical, geometric designs.|$|E
25|$|The robe à la française or sack-back gown, {{with back}} pleats hanging loosely from the neckline, long worn as court fashion, made its last {{appearance}} {{early in this}} period. A fitted <b>bodice</b> held {{the front of the}} gown closely to the figure.|$|E
25|$|There is {{historical}} evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or {{any hint of}} a bosom. Early English Puritans used a tight <b>bodice</b> to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century Spaniards put lead plates across the chests of young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing.|$|E
50|$|Girls' <b>bodices</b> usually {{reflected}} adult styles, {{in their}} best clothes at least, and low <b>bodices</b> and necklaces are common. Boys often, though not always, had dresses that were closed up to the neck-line, and often buttoned at the front—rare for girls. They frequently wear belts, and in periods when female dresses had a V at the waist, this is often seen on little girls, but not on boys. Linen and lace at the neck and cuffs tend to follow adult styles for each gender, although again the clothes worn in portraits no doubt do not reflect everyday wear, and may not reflect even best clothes accurately.|$|R
25|$|Young boys wore skirts with {{doublets}} or back-fastening <b>bodices</b> {{until they}} were breeched at six to eight. They wore smaller versions of men's hats over coifs or caps. Small children's clothing featured leading strings at the shoulder.|$|R
