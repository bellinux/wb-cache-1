Farris gives a young girl a 'button box' which, depending on the buttons or levers that are used, can dispense magical treats or cause death and destruction. Chizmar was asked whether or not Richard Farris's initials signified that he was another manifestation of Randall Flagg; his response was “Maayyybee... He's definitely mysterious, and it's really obvious there's more to him than meets the eye." [...] Chizmar later revealed during a Reddit AMA session that the initials were indeed indicative of Farris being Flagg.|$|E

Most important of all, it should teach that learning is fun...|$|R

40|$|Once upon a time, {{there were}} two large black boxes, A and B, {{connected}} by a long insulated copper wire.

50|$|In early 2001, Edinburgh-born Jon Bews, {{formerly}} of Bùrach, replaced Patterson on fiddle, and {{later that year}} Tyrone <b>button</b> <b>box</b> and whistle player Leo McCann was asked to join to expand the band's largely string-driven sound. McCann toured with the band {{for the first time}} on the Scottish Folk Festival tour of Germany in January 2002, where the band honed the material for their second album on Greentrax, 3 Ravens. Launched on their return visit to Cambridge Folk Festival in August 2002, the band's recording of the traditional song 'Billy Taylor' set to Polwart's tune attracted the attention of BBC Radio 2's Mike Harding and significant airplay boosted the band's profile considerably. Polwart's song 'Thaney', about the Scottish Saint Thenew, (more commonly known as Enoch), earned a nomination in the 2003 Radio 2 Folk Awards. 3 Ravens also showcased Byrne's own growing songwriting talents for the first time, with his Angus Scots lament 'The Lang Road Doon'. 3 Ravens was recorded at Castlesound Studios in Pencaitland, East Lothian.|$|E
50|$|To produce 35mm slides on the Genigraphics system, the {{operator}} created the slide information (bar chart, line graph, pie chart or graphics and background artwork) without actually viewing {{this on the}} screen. The slide would be created in full and then the screen was 'regenerated'. It took about a minute for the screen to regenerate and produce the visual representation of the slide. The textual and other non-graphic input {{was sent to the}} processor with a set of commands (x,y coordinates etc.). Vector artwork was generated by dropping a set of vertices on the screen using a pen, tablet and 'puck' (a three <b>button</b> <b>box</b> operated with the free hand). Whilst drawing your graphic by dropping the vertices on the screen, a pink wireframe with the vertices as small squared would show you where each plotted point would be. Fill colours and borders where then plotted to the finished vector. The background could be graduated from one colour to a second colour using 2000 lines to reproduce a very smooth graduation effect.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the types}} found in the United States is the North American [...] "Polish-style polka," [...] which has roots in Chicago, with large Czech and Polish minorities; two sub-styles are [...] "The Chicago Honky" [...] (using {{clarinet}} and one trumpet) and [...] "Chicago Push" [...] featuring the accordion, Chemnitzer & Star concertinas, upright bass or bass guitar, drums, and (almost always) two trumpets. North American [...] "Slovenian-style polka" [...] is fast and features piano accordion, chromatic accordion, and/or diatonic <b>button</b> <b>box</b> accordion; it is associated with Cleveland. North American [...] "Dutchmen-style" [...] features an oom-pah sound often with a tuba & banjo, and has roots in the American Midwest.

Traditional dances from this region reflect the influence of polka-dancing European immigrants.
