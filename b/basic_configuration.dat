5|$|Bristol Aero Engines and Hooker {{had already}} {{been working on a}} project to produce a {{suitable}} VTOL engine; this engine combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of the}} compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. With a suitable engine already being developed, Camm and his team at HSA proceeded to develop the company's first VTOL aircraft, designated as the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The P.1127 was envisioned as a subsonic VTOL-capable strike aircraft, while also serving to demonstrate and prove the capabilities of the aircraft's <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> and to validate the performance of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine that powered it.|$|E
25|$|The design {{achieved}} {{a very low}} price point and in its <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> sold for US$6,000, complete and ready to fly, in the late 1990s. It was the least expensive complete aircraft available at that time.|$|E
25|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> {{was similar}} to earlier gliders such as the Stamer Lippisch ZÃ¶gling and the Grunau IX, but the SG 38 was an entirely new design.

25|$|In 1997, the Diamond DA40 a four-place IFR aircraft, {{received}} certification; it {{was followed}} by the twin diesel engine DA42 in 2004. According to Flight International, the DA40 was capable of outperforming many similar aircraft which at that time had carried substantially greater purchase costs than the DA40 outfitted with a <b>basic</b> <b>configuration.</b> When launched in 2001, the DA40TDI would be the production aircraft powered by a single diesel-based piston engine.|$|E

25|$|A {{technical}} dispute arose {{between the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment and the English Electric Company (EEC) {{as to the}} optimum configuration for the company's proposed supersonic fighter. A single-seat, mid-winged research machine was built to investigate the low speed handling of the possible configurations. The same <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> of the P.1 was incorporated into a simpler testbed that had a fixed undercarriage. Since the SB5 was to test the low-speed flight characteristics, there was no requirement for the undercarriage to be retractable.|$|E
25|$|The first {{operational}} {{version of}} the Meteor, designated as the Meteor F.1, apart from the minor airframe refinements, was a straightforward 'militarisation' of the earlier F9/40 prototypes. The dimensions of the standard Meteor F.1 were 41ft 3 in (12.58m) long with a span of 43ft 0 in (13.11m), with an empty weight of 8,140lb (3,823kg) and a maximum takeoff weight of 13,795lb (6,270kg). Despite the revolutionary turbojet propulsion used, {{the design of the}} Meteor was relatively orthodox and did not take advantage of many aerodynamic features utilised on other jet fighters, such as swept wings; the Meteor shared a broadly similar <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> to its German equivalent, the Messerschmitt Me 262.|$|E
25|$|In its {{simplest}} (and {{most commonly}} used) form, the railgun differs {{from a traditional}} electric motor in that no use is made of additional field windings (or permanent magnets). This <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> is formed by a single loop of current and thus requires high currents (e.g., of order one million amperes) to produce sufficient accelerations (and muzzle velocities). A relatively common variant of this configuration is the augmented railgun in which the driving current is channelled through additional pairs of parallel conductors, arranged to increase ("augment") the magnetic field experienced by the moving armature. These arrangements reduce the current required for a given acceleration. In electric motor terminology, augmented railguns are usually series-wound configurations.|$|E

25|$|This approach, {{which is}} not {{compatible}} with Windows Group Policy, was repeated in Windows XP. The reasons for this design decision by Microsoft are not known, and it has resulted in heavy criticism. Microsoft significantly improved this in Windows Vista by redesigning the power management system to allow <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> by Group Policy. The support offered {{is limited to a}} single per-computer policy. The most recent release, Windows 7 retains these limitations but does include refinements for timer coalescing, processor power management, and display panel brightness. The most significant change in Windows 7 is in the user experience. The prominence of the default High Performance power plan has been reduced with the aim of encouraging users to save power.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> of a station, various features set certain types of station apart. The first {{is the level of}} the tracks. Stations are often sited where a road crosses the railway: unless the crossing is a level crossing, the road and railway will be at different levels. The platforms will often be raised or lowered relative to the station entrance: the station buildings may be on either level, or both. The other arrangement, where the station entrance and platforms are on the same level, is also common, but is perhaps rarer in urban areas, except when the station is a terminus. Elevated stations are more common, not including metro stations. Stations located at level crossings can be problematic if the train blocks the roadway while it stops, causing road traffic to wait {{for an extended period of}} time.|$|E
25|$|The {{device was}} called SHRIMP {{and had the}} same <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> (radiation implosion) as the Ivy Mike wet device, except with a {{different}} type of fusion fuel. SHRIMP used lithium deuteride (LiD), which is solid at room temperature; Ivy Mike used cryogenic liquid deuterium (D2), which required elaborate cooling equipment. Castle Bravo was the first test by the United States of a practical deliverable fusion bomb (hydrogen bomb), even though the TX-21 as proof-tested in the Bravo event was not weaponized. The successful test rendered obsolete the cryogenic design used by Ivy Mike and its weaponized derivative, the JUGHEAD, which was slated to be tested as the initial Castle Yankee. It also used a 7075 aluminium 9.5cm thick ballistic case. Aluminium was used to drastically reduce the bomb's weight and simultaneously to provide sufficient radiation confinement time and to raise yield, a departure from the heavy stainless steel casing (304L or MIM 316L) employed by contemporary weapon-projects.|$|E

500|$|Barnaby was {{severely}} criticised, particularly by Sir Edward Reed, himself a former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy, because Collingwoods waterline armour belt was concentrated amidships {{and did not}} extend {{to the ends of}} the ship. Reed believed that this weakness meant that the ship could be sunk from the consequent uninhibited flooding if her unarmoured ends were riddled by shellfire and open to the sea. Barnaby deliberately selected a hull shape with narrow, fine ends to limit the volume of the hull that could be flooded and situated the armoured deck below the waterline to prevent it from being pierced by enemy shells and flooding the lower part of the ironclad. Furthermore, he heavily subdivided the hull to limit the amount of water that could enter through any one hit and placed coal bunkers above the armoured deck to absorb the fragments from exploding shells. Unbeknownst to his critics, Collingwood was tested in 1884 with her ends and the large spaces in her hold ballasted with water and her draught only increased by [...] and she lost a minor amount of speed. The price was that the ship lacked buoyancy at her ends and tended to bury her bow in oncoming waves rather than be lifted over them. Her speed was greatly reduced in a head sea and the resulting spray made working the guns very difficult. Collingwood tended to roll heavily and was not regarded as a good seaboat. Despite these issues, her <b>basic</b> <b>configuration</b> was followed by most subsequent British ironclads and predreadnought battleships until the revolutionary [...] of 1905.|$|E
