50|$|The {{station was}} built {{next to the}} level {{crossing}} of the Ottery Road which was operated by the station staff. A signal <b>box</b> <b>was</b> provided in 1875 at {{the east end of}} the station {{on the north side of}} the line, opposite goods yard.

Some <b>boxes</b> <b>were</b> light blue, some a darker blue. The illustrator for Mercury was Mario Davazza (History of Mercury 2013). Into the 1970s later <b>boxes</b> <b>were</b> red with windows.

5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the <b>Box</b> <b>is</b> used to fill empty room left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E
50|$|Fishing tackle boxes {{have for}} many years been an {{essential}} part of the anglers equipment. Fishing tackle <b>boxes</b> <b>were</b> originally made of wood or wicker and eventually some metal fishing tackle <b>boxes</b> <b>were</b> manufactured. The first plastic fishing tackle <b>boxes</b> <b>were</b> manufactured by Plano in response to the need for a product that didn't rust. Early plastic fishing tackle <b>boxes</b> <b>were</b> similar to tool boxes but soon evolved into the hip roof cantilever tackle boxes with numerous small trays for small tackle. These types of tackle <b>boxes</b> <b>are</b> still available today but they have the disadvantage that small tackle gets mixed up. Fishing tackle <b>boxes</b> have also <b>been</b> manufactured so the drawers themselves become small storage boxes, each with their own lids. This prevents small tackle from mixing, and can turn each drawer into a stand-alone container which can be used to carry small tackle to a rod some distance from the main tackle box.|$|R
