40|$|Abstract: Almost all {{students}} use social media but few lecturers {{use it in}} their teaching process. This study examines students' perceptions {{of the use of}} social media in the process of teaching English in STKIP Rappang Muhammadiyah, South Sulawesi, Indonesia. This study was conducted using a mixed method, including quantitative and qualitative data Data were collected using a questionnaire that collected <b>background</b> <b>information</b> <b>of</b> <b>participants,</b> a four-point Likert scale to gauge the students' perceived use of social media in class. and open-ended questions to gather more data rich in the beliefs, attitudes, wishes and concerns of students regarding the use of social media in the writing classroom. Findings from this study indicate that the majority of students showed a positive attitude toward and a willingness to use social media in the writing classroom However, factors such as large classes, lack of training {{on the use of the}} Internet, and the lack of facilities could be possible barriers to the use of social media in the classroo...|$|E
40|$|While the {{existence}} of social inequality in health in childhood as well as among adults is well established, research of mechanisms underlying this inequality is still sparse. The study aim was {{to report on the}} development of self-rated health and depressive symptoms from age 15 to 18 years in a cohort study of Danish adolescents. Methods: The cohort comprised 3, 681 individuals born in 1989, 3058 individuals answered the baseline questionnaire in 2004, and 2400 responded to a follow-up questionnaire in 2007, with 2181 individuals participating in both rounds (59 % of the original cohort). Social <b>background</b> <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> was derived from a national register. For the analysis two variables indicating change in the two health indicators was computed by subtracting the 2007 levels of the variables from the levels experienced in 2004. Results: After 3 years, mean self-rated health (SRH) deteriorated slightly in adolescents (- 0. 24; 95 % CI = - 0. 28 to - 0. 19) across all socioeconomic status (SES) groups and depressive symptoms increased (0. 64; 95 % CI = 0. 52 to 0. 75). High household income was protective for decrease in SRH (0. 62; 0. 43 - 0. 91). Negative lifestyle changes were associated with poorer SRH and more depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Self-rated health and depressive symptoms changed to the worse among Danish adolescents from age 15 to 18 years. Negative changes in several lifestyle factors were found to accompany the deterioration of health. This result stresses the intrinsic relationship between lifestyle changes and health and the possible positive effect of maintaining and enhancing positive lifestyle factors. </span...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the utilisation {{of a music}} anger management technique as an effective therapeutic aid in addressing the problems that children in residential care have in managing and expressing their anger. A literature review was conducted which provided evidence that music can be a helpful tool in teaching children appropriate ways to manage their anger. An empirical study was conducted and five participants were chosen through a sampling process. <b>Background</b> <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the five <b>participants</b> was obtained and data analyses were presented from the data gathered in the pre- and post-assessments processes {{before and after the}} implementation of the music anger management technique. The data that gave rise to several empirical findings were then reduced. From the empirical study, it can be concluded that the music anger management technique can be used effectively to improve inappropriate anger management. Getting firsthand experience of the implementation of the music anger management technique led me to derive psycho-educational guidelines, which can assist the educational psychologist in using the music anger management technique in addressing unmanaged anger in children in residential care.

40|$|Title: Preschool – {{a social}} {{language}} environment and an arena for emergent literacy processes. Author: Martina Norling By focusing on preschool, as an arena for emergent literacy and language learning processes, this thesis put the lens on preschool staff´s approaches and {{strategies in the}} social language environment in Swedish preschools. Taking its point of departure in real preschool settings, the overall purpose of this thesis {{is to develop a}} greater understanding of this social language environment, with particular emphasis on the quality dimensions of strategies, such as the preschool staff´s sensitivity and approaches in the preschool environment. Two didactic issues are of special importance to the thesis: preschool staff´s descriptions of what kind of strategies and approaches they use in the social language environment as well as how preschool staff support children’s language learning processes in literacy-related activities. The thesis consists of four articles aimed at capturing, variations of dimensions of preschool staff strategies as well as approaches that contribute to highlighting essential strategies for supporting children in the social language environment. The theoretical framework in this thesis consists of social constructivism (Vygotsky, 1997) and bioecological theory (Bronfenbrenner, 2005). The four empirical studies in this thesis have made possible a mixed method design. The data production consists of questionnaires with questions regarding <b>background</b> <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants,</b> observation instruments (scoring the quality of the social language environment), focus group interviews, video observations as well as a systematic literature review. In this thesis, three dimensions of preschool staff strategies in social language environment emerged: play strategies, emotional strategies and communicative strategies. The social language environment in Swedish preschool can be described in terms of those three strategy dimensions and continuous interplay processes among children, peers and preschool staff, over time. The quality dimensions of strategies focus, on preschool staff efforts and children’s prerequisites of learning processes, rather than focusing on children’s individual performance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{influence}} of hip-hop culture on the communication skills of students as perceived by teachers at three high schools in Houston, Texas. Hip-hop culture consists of: rap music, breakdancing, graffiti art, and deejaying. Hip-hop is currently one of the most popular forms of music and represents the dominant culture of today's inner-city youth. The researcher issued written surveys to 30 teachers in Houston, Texas. The high schools selected for this study were: Yates High School (Houston Independent School District), Wheatley High School (Houston Independent School District), and Eisenhower High School (Aldine Independent School District). Two teachers were also interviewed for the study. The final part of the study was the production of an educational hip-hop CD by the researcher. The literature review focuses on the history and practices of hip-hop in regard to language. Once the surveys were received and the interviews were completed, the researcher compiled statistics regarding the <b>background</b> <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> and the level of influence that each teacher felt that hip-hop culture has on students. The major findings of the study were: 1. Hip-hop culture heavily influences the oral language and written communication of students based upon the opinions of teachers at selected high schools in Houston, Texas. 2. Hip-hop can be used as a tool to supplement the teaching of various academic concepts as evidenced by the practices of teachers at selected high schools in Houston, Texas. Based on the findings of the study, the researcher recommends: 1. Teachers should acknowledge hip-hop culture and allow students to express their interest in hip-hop culture in the classroom. 2. Teachers should find ways to incorporate hip-hop culture into the curriculum to arouse students' interest in learning. For instance, allow students to learn from listening to educational rap songs. 3. Teachers should find ways to use hip-hop culture in the classroom to improve the acquisition and retention of academic concepts. Examples could include allowing students to write rap songs about academic concepts...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the factors associated with coaching burnout in teacher-coaches. Some of the factors identified as possible characteristics of burnout are gender, level at which the participants coach, age, compensation for coaching, and if the individual success of players or the team affects burnout. Past research has identified gender, level, and other personal factors as being factors related to burnout. For this study, forty teacher-coaches were used (males n = 26, females n = 14). The researcher randomly selected teacher-coaches from middle schools and high schools in Indiana and Illinois. A survey entitled "Coaching Burnout" was used to gather the data. The survey was a researcher-created instrument that contained three sections. These sections consisted of a Likert-scale rating format, and sections on the demographics and <b>background</b> <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants.</b> Participants completed the survey and returned it to the researcher. Specific computations were made on the data to determine which factors were significant at the. 05 level to burnout. The tests conducted were a Pearson Correlation test, independent t-tests, a one-way ANOVA, and Cronbach's alpha. Age, gender, compensation, sports, success of the players and team, coaching years, and teaching years were factors investigated in the study. The age <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> and compensation were found to be the only factors related to burnout. All of the other factors had no significance and could not be identified as a factor relating to burnout <b>of</b> the <b>participants.</b> As a result of the factors not being significant to burnout, {{the participants in this study}} are not currently exhibiting burnout. This does not mean the participants have not experienced burnout in the past or will not experience burnout in the future. During this study, the researcher did identify two factors related to burnout, but further research still needs to be conducted on the topic. Because burnout is a real phenomenon in teachercoaches, characteristics and factors of burnout need to be identified so the proper guidance and support can be given to those performing dual-roles in our schools.

40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} was conducted to investigate role extension for MRI technologists in New Zealand. It sought to identify role extension activities performed by MRI technologists and to determine {{if any of these}} roles had or were becoming part of their routine practice. Information about the education and training given to the MRI technologists to enable them to perform these role extension activities and to identify the need for formal education was also collected. Methods: Structured questionnaires were sent to MRI technologists in New Zealand to gather both quantitative and qualitative data. Closed questions were used for <b>background</b> <b>information</b> <b>of</b> the <b>participants</b> including the types of departments in which they work, the role extension activities they performed and the education and training they had received. Open questions were used to gather information about the participant’s opinions about the education and training they had received. Results: Eighty-eight questionnaires were returned from a total of 154 dispatched giving a 57 % response rate. Respondents worked in public and private departments ranging in size from one scanner with one or two technologists to four scanners with over 15 technologists. Almost all of the respondents performed IV cannulation, contrast injection, routine scans and complex scans. Other role extension activities performed by some respondents included drug administration, protocolling forms, prescribing contrast and other drugs, and checking pre-MRI orbit x-rays. Reporting routine MRI scans was not performed by any MRI technologist. Education and training received for the role extension activities included: learning by experience; informal and formal in-house training; formal education; and postgraduate qualification from an education provider. More formal training was provided for procedural role extension activities, such as IV cannulation, than for those requiring cognitive skills, such as prescribing contrast and checking pre-MRI orbit x-rays. Conclusions: The data showed MRI technologists were performing a variety of role extension activities to varying degrees. The education and training received by some was perceived to be inadequate, being either as courses provided for other health professionals, or experiential learning. A few MRI technologists were unofficially prescribing contrast and other drugs, and checking pre-MRI orbit x-rays without having proper support and education...|$|R

The World Summit on Sustainable Development made clear {{the need for}} increased access to affordable, reliable and cleaner energy {{and the international community}} agreed in the Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainable Development on the importance of the development agenda in considering any climate change approach. To this end, six countries (Australia, China, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and the United States) have come together to form the Asia Pacific Partnership in accordance with their respective national circumstances, to develop, deploy and transfer cleaner, more efficient technologies and to meet national pollution reduction, energy security and climate change concerns consistent with the principles of the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The APP builds on the foundation of existing bilateral and multilateral initiatives complements. APP has established eight public-private sector Task Forces covering: (1) cleaner fossil energy; (2) renewable energy and distributed generation; (3) power generation and transmission; (4) steel; (5) aluminium; (6) cement; (7) coal mining; and (8) buildings and appliances. As a priority, each Task Force will formulate detailed action plans outlining both immediate and medium-term specific actions, including possible "flagship" projects and relevant indicators of progress by 31 August 2006. The partnership will help the partners build human and institutional capacity to strengthen cooperative efforts, and will seek opportunities to engage the private sector.

40|$|The {{trucking}} {{industry is}} the largest freight sector, making up about 70 percent of all domestic shipment in the United States and contributes greatly the American economy. About 10 billion tons of goods are shipped annually and of that, about 800, 000 shipments of hazardous materials are transported in the United States each day by trucks, resulting in 300 million annual shipments (Federal Motor Carrier Security Administration). These hazardous materials (HazMat) range from relatively harmless products, such as hair spray and perfumes, to bulk shipments of gasoline by highway cargo tanks, to transportation of poisonous, explosive, and radioactive materials. The complexity of this commodity makes them of particular interest, especially to carriers, shippers, consignees, emergency responders, and government officials. However, at both the national and state levels, the transport of HazMat shipments has not been analyzed to the degree necessary to completely understand the operational logistics. To assist strategic planning on the development and expansion for highway infrastructure and to mitigate security risk due to HazMat shipment, {{it is necessary to}} understand their shipment/flow characteristic, and more broadly, the current awareness and preparedness of shippers and carries of risk mitigation. Therefore, more research is necessary to help federal and local government to make efficient regulations regarding risk mitigation of HazMat highway shipments. The objective of this project is to understand the risk involved with HazMat shipment and the mitigation strategies/tools used in an effort to lessen the impact of HazMat-caused incidents on people, property and environment through actions taken before a disaster strikes. To accomplish this objective, a survey questionnaire was developed and distributed to HazMat shippers/carriers. The questionnaire mainly consists of three parts: part 1, <b>background</b> <b>information</b> <b>of</b> survey <b>participants</b> including company name, size, and location; part 2, commodity flow characteristics including HazMat type, shipping tonnage, and shipping mileage, etc.; and part 3 : the state and future of risk mitigation including current precautionary measures and technologies, and future plans on strengthening security, etc. Inland waterway (IWW) is another important mode of transportation in the U. S. The inland waterways networks consist of nearly 12, 000 navigable miles which makes it vast in geographical area and ability to carry high tonnages of goods (U. S Army Corps of Engineers, 2005). The direct access to large ports makes it a very beneficial for carriers using this mode of shipment. The inland waterways accounts for over 624 million tons of freight annually and create tremendous cost savings for U. S agriculture sector. It is also has a vital connection in energy production in the U. S resulting in low energy cost. This makes it a crucial economy contributor; making up 14 % of our intercity freight and is valued nearly $ 70 billion (National Waterways Foundation, 2008). It is a logical mode for transporting several commodities due to its relative low cost compare to other modes of transportation and more environmentally friendly option. Despite these benefits inland waterway for shipment remains under-utilized and many of the existing infrastructures are nearing their designed life span. The objectives our research are: 1. To understand the factors that manufacturers consider before choosing what mode of transportation is appropriate for their commodity; 2. To propose an incentive that will either encourage participants who are currently using inland waterways to increase the volume transported via inland waterway or stimulate those who are not currently using to consider shipping via inland waterway. A survey questionnaire was designed and distributed to manufacturers. Data collected from the survey was analyzed and presented the subsequent chapters. This document focuses on the two areas discussed earlier; First, Risk Management of Hazardous Material (Chapter 1) and second, Identify factors that can help boost the use of inland waterway shipment (Chapter 7). The goal is to observe data collected from surveys and propose recommendations {{that can be used to}} improve both area of focus at the end of this research...|$|R
40|$|Bandura {{said that}} people are self-organizing, proactive, self-reflecting, and self-regulating, {{and they are not}} just {{reactive}} organisms directed by the environmental events or inner forces. Accordingly, in society the belief that people have in their effectiveness {{in order to be able}} to have control over the events in their life is the most important element. If people believe that they can make favorable influences and prevent the unfavorable ones by their performances, they will be motivated enough to act. Bandura (2001) believed that efficacy beliefs affect the way people think either positively or negatively, the kind of aims they would like to achieve and also their commitments to have the results of their efforts. Having high levels of self-efficacy motivates people to have higher goals and as a result they persevere if they face the obstacles or any adverse situation and also they will perform much better. We should remember that self-efficacy is based on a motivational construct and it is the self perception of competence instead of actual level of competence, so actions and behaviors will be better predicted by beliefs instead of actual performance. This study explored the English language center teachers’ self-efficacy in teaching English and its interaction with their reported proficiency level in English, their perceived use of teaching strategies, and their personal background characteristics such as age, gender, level of teaching, years of teaching English, experience traveling or studying abroad, getting IELTS or TOEFL, highest level of education, and type of certificate achieved. The quantitative method of analysis, particularly descriptive and correlational research methods were used in this study. The instruments used in this study consisted of four questionnaires: 1) Teachers’ sense of efficacy in teaching English, 2) Teachers’ reported English language vi proficiency, 3) teachers’ perceived use of teaching strategies, and 4) Teachers’ personal <b>background</b> <b>information.</b> The <b>participants</b> <b>of</b> this research were 187 English teachers in Language schools in 10 different geographical zones of the capital city.
