5|$|According to {{the most}} recent (July 2015) {{revision}} of the official United Nations World Population Prospects, the world population is projected to reach 8.5 <b>billion</b> by 2030, up from the current 7.3 <b>billion</b> (July 2015), to exceed 9 <b>billion</b> people by 2050, and to reach 11.2 <b>billion</b> by the year 2100. Most of the increase will be in developing countries whose population is projected to rise from 5.6 <b>billion</b> in 2009 to 7.9 <b>billion</b> in 2050. This increase will be distributed among the population aged 15–59 (1.2 <b>billion)</b> and 60 or over (1.1 <b>billion)</b> because the number of children under age 15 in developing countries is predicted to decrease. In contrast, the population of the more developed regions is expected to undergo only slight increase from 1.23 <b>billion</b> to 1.28 <b>billion,</b> and this would have declined to 1.15 <b>billion</b> but for a projected net migration from developing to developed countries, which is expected to average 2.4 million persons annually from 2009 to 2050. Long-term estimates in 2004 of global population suggest a peak at around 2070 of nine to ten <b>billion</b> people, and then a slow decrease to 8.4 <b>billion</b> by 2100.|$|E
