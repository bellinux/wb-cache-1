BDS response plans were formulated by the USPS in conjunction with local responders including fire, police, hospitals and public health. Employees of these facilities have been educated about anthrax, response actions, and prophylactic medication. Because of the time delay inherent in getting final verification that anthrax has been used, prophylactic antibiotic treatment of possibly exposed personnel must be started as soon as possible.|$|E

SNAs have enabled the first commercialized molecular medical diagnostic {{systems of the}} modern era of nanotechnology (Fig. 5). The FDA-cleared Verigene System, commercialized by Nanosphere, is now sold in over twenty countries. This technology allows the detection of markers for many diseases, including infectious disease and cancers, with a sensitivity and selectivity far exceeding that of conventional diagnostic tools. Indeed, the Verigene is transforming patient care by transitioning molecular diagnostic screening from centralized, often remote, analytical laboratories to the local hospital setting, which dramatically decreases the time required for diagnosis. Further, the Verigene has enabled the identification of new markers for Alzheimer's disease, HIV, and cardiac disease {{as well as new}} tests for the early detection of a variety of forms of prostate cancer.

We evaluated the performance of a new NGS assay (Hospital Acquired Infection <b>BioDetection</b> System; Pathogenica) during an outbreak of sequence type 131 (ST 131) Escherichia coli infections in a nursing home in The Netherlands. The assay was performed on 56 extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL) E. coli isolates collected during 2 prevalence surveys (March and May 2013). Typing results were compared to those of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), whereby we visually assessed the agreement of the <b>BioDetection</b> phylogenetic tree with clusters defined by AFLP. A microarray was considered the gold standard for detection of resistance genes. AFLP identified a large cluster of 31 indistinguishable isolates on adjacent departments, indicating clonal spread. The <b>BioDetection</b> phylogenetic tree showed that all isolates of this outbreak cluster were strongly related, while the further arrangement of the tree also largely agreed with other clusters defined by AFLP. The <b>BioDetection</b> assay detected ESBL genes in all but 1 isolate (sensitivity, 98 %) but was unable to discriminate between ESBL and non-ESBL TEM and SHV beta-lactamases or to specify CTX-M genes by group.

40|$|Compared with {{traditional}} radioimmunoassay and fluoroimmunoassay for early diseases detection, the magnetic immunoassay utilizing magnetic nanoparticles as bio-labels and magnetic signal sensors as detectors has remarkable advantages because most biological samples exhibit no magnetic background and highly sensitive measurements can be performed. This thesis presents {{the development of}} <b>biodetection</b> platform {{taking advantage of the}} physical-and chemical-stability, low-toxicity, and environmentally-safety of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and the high-sensitivity, low-cost, and portable capabilities of magnetoresistive (MR) sensors. The first part explained why a magnetic <b>biodetection</b> platform is desirable, and what advantages it possesses. Then the magnetism of IONPs utilized in this detection system was introduced, followed by the introduction of main synthesis methods to obtain the desirable IONPs. The working principle of MR sensor was explained, and the recent advances about the <b>biodetection</b> platforms with various magnetoresistive sensors and magnetic IONPs labeling was reviewed. A brief summary of new contributions reported in this thesis was summarized. Then the establishment of home-made measurement setups for the characterization of MR sensor was described. The MR loops of MR sensors can be obtained with the instrument using two-point probe measurement, four-point probe measurement, or Wheatstone bridge measurement. The single MTJ sensor, MTJs array sensor, and the GMR spin valve sensor in Wheatstone bridge were characterized here. The magnetic IONPs were prepared through co-precipitation method and thermal decomposition method, and then surface-functionalized using citric acid and fatty acids to acquire carboxyl groups for the binding ability with biomolecules. The physical and chemical properties, sterilizing-treatment tolerability and biocompatibility of nanoparticles were studied. Furthermore, two new synthesis methods were developed to obtain novel magnetic gold/iron oxide nanocomposites for their potential use as magnetic bio-labels. A magnetic detection platform was built, and the detection of 10 -nm superparamagnetic IONPs with MR sensor was first realized here. The output signal of the giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor in Wheatstone bridge exhibited log-linear function of the concentration of IONPs, making our sensing system suitable for use when ultra-small bio-labels are needed. The <b>biodetection</b> platform with MR sensor and IONPs was successfully developed and applied for the detection of antigen biomolecules. The feasibility of magnetic <b>biodetection</b> system, based on magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) sensors and carboxyl-group functionalized IONPs, to detect AFP antigens (liver cancer biomarker) and p 24 antigens (HIV biomarker) was demonstrated here for the first time. By taking advantages of its high sensitivity, low power consumption, low cost, and feasibility to be miniaturized, the development of magnetoresistive <b>biodetection</b> platform will bring revolutionary impact on the <b>biodetection</b> techniques for clinical early diseases diagnosis. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
