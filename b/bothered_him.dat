5|$|On 17 August 636, Vahan pondered {{over his}} {{failures}} and {{mistakes of the}} previous day, where he launched attacks against respective Muslim flanks, but after initial success, his men were pushed back.

5|$|The 1931 {{season was}} Hornsby's last as a {{full-time}} player. Boils on his feet <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> during {{the start of the}} 1932 season, and he did not play his first game until May29. Hornsby played right field from May29 to June10, appeared in two games as a pinch hitter, played third base from July14 through July18, and played one last game as a Cub when he pinch-hit on July31.|$|E
5|$|When Feynman {{was nearing}} death, he asked Danny Hillis {{why he was}} so sad. Hillis replied that he thought Feynman was going to die soon. Feynman said that that {{sometimes}} <b>bothered</b> <b>him,</b> too, adding, when you get to be as old as he was, and have told so many stories to so many people, even when he was dead he would not be completely gone.|$|E

5|$|Roy {{started the}} first month of the season scoring at his normal rate, but by December it started showing that his knees, which have <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> since college and were injured in April, were ailing due to lack of cartilage. He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers {{announced}} that he would be out indefinitely. It was widely speculated that Roy {{would not be able to}} play at an All-Star level again. This forced the team to start running its offense through forward LaMarcus Aldridge and backup guard Wesley Matthews.|$|E
5|$|When {{designing}} Naruto for his Part II appearance, Kishimoto {{changed his}} character's clothing to an orange and black top, orange pants, and black sandals. He also {{gave him a}} red cape with black flames at the bottom when fighting Pain, {{a member of the}} Akatsuki. He drew Naruto's forehead-protector wider to make his eyebrows easier to draw, something that had <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> with his previous design. He also noted that Naruto's pants made the character look too childish. To remedy this, Kishimoto designed them to roll up, giving him a more mature appearance. He gave Naruto this look in order to make him stand out during action scenes.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{made the}} Pro Bowl again in 1952, {{when he had}} 952 total yards and six touchdowns. Cleveland {{advanced}} to the NFL championship {{for the third time}} in a row that year, losing 17–7 to the Detroit Lions. In 1953, Jones's production declined: he had just 401 total yards and no touchdowns, and he decided to retire after the Browns reached and lost another championship game. He went back to Ruston to work at a lumber business he ran in the offseason, but Brown asked him to return in 1954, saying the team needed him. Jones played for two more years, winning two more championships with the Browns before retiring for good. He pulled his hamstring in an exhibition game before the 1955 season, an injury that caused him to miss several games and <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> all season.|$|E

5|$|Named at centre half-back for Victoria in {{the game}} against Western Australia, Nash arrived in Perth with such a severe cold {{he was unable to}} train in the lead up to match. Nash injured his knee and ankle in Victoria's win over Western Australia in Perth in early July and was unable to train for a week. While Nash did not miss any matches due to the injuries, they <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> {{throughout}} the season and he was forced to miss South Melbourne Footballers' weekly dance at the Lake Oval Social Hall. Although carrying injuries, Nash continued to show his versatility, playing around the ground and led South Melbourne to the Grand Final, their third in a row, only to be defeated by Collingwood.|$|E
5|$|At Simpson's next race, the four-day Grand Prix d'Eibar, {{his first}} in Spain, his knee injury still <b>bothered</b> <b>him.</b> He won the second stage, but {{was forced to}} quit during the {{following}} stage. His injury had not healed, even after treatment by various specialists, but for financial reasons {{he was forced to}} enter the Tour de France with the British team. He abandoned on stage three, which started in Roubaix, struggling to pedal on the cobbles. Three months after his fall at Paris–Roubaix he saw a doctor at St. Michael's Hospital in Paris. He gave Simpson injections in his knee, which reduced the inflammation. Once healed, he competed in the road world championships in Berne, Switzerland. On the track he qualified for the individual pursuit with the fourth-fastest time, losing in the quarter-finals to Peter Post of the Netherlands. In the road race, Simpson was part of a seventeen-rider breakaway that finished together in a sprint; he crossed the line in ninth place.|$|E
25|$|Johnson, Spitz and Van Osdel shared {{first place}} (and the {{national}} championship) {{in the high}} jump.

25|$|Marshall had hip {{surgery on}} March 31, 2009, to repair an aggravated hip that <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> during the 2008 season. He {{returned}} {{in time for}} training camp in late-July; however, he didn't always fully commit to practicing. This led the Broncos to suspend him {{for the last two}} games of the preseason (he didn't play in the first two preseason contests) for conduct detrimental to the team.|$|E
25|$|In 1863 Champlin was {{appointed}} to command of the Draft Depot at Camp Cleveland, Ohio. However this order was revoked in late August, most likely due to his health condition. Instead, Champlin {{was assigned to the}} command of the Draft Depot near his home in Grand Rapids on September 22. Champlin's hip wound still <b>bothered</b> <b>him,</b> and he reportedly resigned his commission in the Union Army on November 8, 1863.|$|E
25|$|O'Neal missed {{training}} camp due to surgery on an arthritic toe. He opted against a more involved surgery to return back quicker. Still, his toe <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> throughout the season. Jackson also missed most of camp {{due to the}} death of his 94-year-old mother, and Bryant returned to Philadelphia to bury his grandfather. Combined with the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, O'Neal said {{it would be hard for}} basketball players to be divided by pettiness.|$|E

25|$|Talks between Nixon and Prime Minister Edward Heath {{may have}} been bugged. Heath did not {{publicly}} display his anger, with aides {{saying that he was}} unconcerned about having been bugged at the White House. According to officials, Heath commonly had notes taken of his public discussions with Nixon so a recording would not have <b>bothered</b> <b>him.</b> However, officials privately said that if private talks with Nixon were bugged, then Heath would be outraged. Even so, Heath was privately outraged over being taped without his prior knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Hartnell {{continued}} to play comic characters until he was cast in the robust role of Sergeant Ned Fletcher in The Way Ahead (1944). From then on his career was defined by playing mainly policemen, soldiers, and thugs. This typecasting <b>bothered</b> <b>him,</b> for even when cast in comedies he found he was invariably playing the 'heavy'. In 1958 he played the sergeant in the first Carry On film comedy, Carry On Sergeant, and appeared as a town councillor in the Boulting brothers' film Heavens Above! (1963) with Peter Sellers. He also appeared as Will Buckley – another military character – in the film The Mouse That Roared (1959), again with Sellers.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June 1989, a sack {{filled with}} {{dynamite}} sticks was discovered near a beach house Falcone had rented {{in the town}} of Addaura by policeman Nino Agostino. Although Falcone had been threatened before, this failed attempt <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> in the extreme because it had all the signs of an inside job. At the time, he was meeting Swiss prosecutors Carla Del Ponte and Claudio Lehman from Lugano who were helping to investigate the Mafia's financial holdings in Switzerland. Falcone believed that the assassination attempt not only involved the Mafia but some people in government as well. During the investigations into the money laundering networks of the Mafia, it became clear that former Palermo police chief Bruno Contrada who had moved to the intelligence service SISDE had warned a suspect about his impending arrest so that he could escape in time.|$|E

25|$|Rose's sophomore season {{started off}} with an ankle injury in his first preseason game. Rose {{would go on to}} miss the rest of the preseason. Rose started the Bulls' season opener against the San Antonio Spurs but played limited minutes. Rose's ankle <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> for most of November, but as his ankle healed, his game improved. On January 28, 2010, Rose was elected to his first career All-Star Game as a reserve for the Eastern Conference, making him the first Bulls player to be {{selected}} since Michael Jordan in 1998. Rose ended up with eight points, four assists and three steals in the game. The Bulls once again made the playoffs in the 2009–10 season, finishing with a 41–41 record. In the playoffs Rose averaged 26.8 points and 7.2 assists, but the Bulls lost in five games to the Cleveland Cavaliers.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, 2016, the Dodgers re-signed Hill to a three-year, $48 million, contract. Hill {{came down}} with a blister on his left middle finger, an issue that had <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> {{throughout}} the previous season. Making his first {{start of the season}} against the San Diego Padres on April 5, 2017, Hill pitched five innings, but left the game with the lingering blister on his finger. Two days later, on April 7, Hill was placed on the 10-day disabled list. On April 17, Hill was again placed on the 10-day disabled list due to the same finger blister lingering, marking the second time in almost 11 days that Hill went on the disabled list. He returned to the lineup to earn National League Pitcher of the Month honors in July with a 40 record, 1.45 ERA and 40 strikeouts against only 5 walks in 5 starts.|$|E
25|$|Kazmir {{was focused}} on {{improving}} his mechanics going into spring training, a problem that had <b>bothered</b> <b>him</b> {{at the end of}} the previous season but battled a hip injury for much of camp. Possibly as a result of the injury, he suffered from a loss of velocity on his pitches and his poor performance in Cactus League games led to him losing his spot in the starting rotation and beginning the season on the disabled list. He worked on refining his delivery and hoped to rejoin the club at some point during the season however he experienced some discomfort after a minor league rehab appearance in late June and was shut down again. He was sent home for a time in July to work with a body mechanics specialist in Houston. He did make some end of season rehab appearances for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes but did not play in the majors at all this season.|$|E
