40|$|AbstractFish {{quality has}} {{a direct impact on}} market price and its {{accurate}} assessment and prediction are of main importance to set prices, increase competitiveness, resolve conflicts of interest and prevent food wastage due to conservative product shelf-life estimations. In this work we present a general methodology to derive predictive models of fish freshness under different storage conditions. The approach makes use of the theory of optimal experimental design, to maximize data information and in this way reduce the number of experiments. The resulting growth model for specific spoilage microorganisms in hake (Merluccius merluccius) is sufficiently informative to estimate quality sensory indexes under time-varying temperature profiles. In addition it incorporates quantitative information of the uncertainty induced by fish variability. The model has been employed to test the effect of factors such as fishing gear or evisceration, on fish spoilage and therefore fish quality. Results show no significant differences in terms of microbial growth between hake fished by long-line or <b>bottom-set</b> <b>nets,</b> within the implicit uncertainty of the model. Similar conclusions can be drawn for gutted and un-gutted hake along the experiment horizon. In addition, whenever there is the possibility to carry out the necessary experiments, this approach is sufficiently general to be used in other fish species and under different stress variables...|$|E
40|$|The artisanal gillnet fishery {{around the}} Balearic Islands is {{experiencing}} a growing problem with bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus depredating the <b>bottom-set</b> <b>nets.</b> The resulting catch loss engenders hostility from fishers, and interactions between dolphins and nets can result in bycatch mortality. One potential mitigation measure is the placement of acoustic alarms, or pingers, on the nets. However, as pingers have produced mixed results in studies of their effectiveness in other fisheries, direct evidence is needed on whether they will be effective in this fishery. We report on a large-scale experimental trial in which 59 different vessels from the artisanal fleet were each equipped with identical nets, and each vessel was assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: no pinger, inactive pinger or active pinger. Three brands of pinger were tested. During the trial, data on fishing operations were recorded by onboard observers. A total of 1193 fishing operations were observed. We analysed 2 response variables, {{the presence or absence}} of evidence that dolphins had interacted with the net, and standardized yields, using generalized linear mixed models. Overall net interaction rates were reduced by 49 % with active pingers, but not all pinger brands were equally effective. Yields, measured as profit per unit effort, were increased by 9 % in the active-pinger condition, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0. 592). Our results suggest that pingers in the artisanal fisheries of the Balearic Islands reduced the rate of net interaction, but further study is required given dolphins’ potential for habituation.

40|$|Six {{species of}} spiny {{lobsters}} {{of the genus}} Panulirus have been recorded in Ceylon waters. It is clear, therefore, that species dominance and ecological separation in the genus Panulirus is demonstrable and that the separation {{is dependent on the}} particular ecological preferences of the different species. In order to determine the factors governing the ecological separation, it was decided to make a detailed study of the environments in which the different species were found. Diving operations constituted the chief method of investigation. However, information was also obtained from commercial skin-divers, trap fishermen, <b>bottom-set</b> <b>net</b> fishermen and trawling operations. The period of investigations extended from 1962 - 1968...|$|R
50|$|The main {{threat to}} {{porpoises}} is static fishing {{techniques such as}} gill and tangle <b>nets.</b> Bycatch in <b>bottom-set</b> gill <b>nets</b> is considered the main anthropogenic mortality factor for harbour porpoises worldwide. Several thousand die each year in incidental bycatch, which has been reported from the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, off California, and along {{the east coast of}} the United States and Canada. <b>Bottom-set</b> gill <b>nets</b> are anchored to the sea floor and are up to 12.5 mi in length. It is unknown why porpoises become entangled in gill nets, since several studies indicate they are able to detect these nets using their echolocation. Porpoise-scaring devices, so-called pingers, have been developed to keep porpoises out of nets and numerous studies have demonstrated they are very effective at reducing entanglement. However, concern has been raised over the noise pollution created by the pingers and whether their efficiency will diminish over time due to porpoises habituating to the sounds.|$|R
40|$|During November and December 1959 several {{specimens}} of Sardinella clupeoides were encountered from the Rameswaram Road fish landing centre on the Gulf of Mannar. Subsequently {{on the west}} coast of India several specimens were collected from Vizhingam during May, November and December 1960; January, February, March and December 1961.

The new species is characterised by the following combination of characters: lateral-line scales 53 – 56; transverse scale rows 4 / 5; long pectoral fins (extending beyond a line from origin of pelvic fins to origin of dorsal fin); caudal peduncle compressed (depth greater than width); and pelvic fins unpigmented...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reach an {{estimate}} of the amount of gill-net set, potential sources of information are reviewed. The principal enmeshing gears in Irish waters are briefly described. The following sources of information are examined on the extent of the fishery: salmon drift net licence sales figures, the register of fishing vessels, The European Communities' Logbook and, of greatest value, a survey of gears in use carried out in 1991. Additional information is supplied on sales of netting and on landings by gill net, the latter based mainly on limited sampling data. The total length of large mesh <b>bottom-set</b> gill <b>net</b> is calculated as 100, 000 km days annually...|$|R
40|$|There {{are five}} species of marine turtles {{occurring}} {{in and around}} Mandapam - Rameswaram; both in the Gulf of Mannar and Palk Bay regions. They are incidentally caught live in trawl net, shore-seine, drift-gill <b>net</b> and <b>bottom-set</b> gill <b>net</b> operations in this area. They are in great demand in the rural sector. Though, the fishermen are aware that these endangered animals are protected, often the profit motive make them to sell these turtles. Whenever, any incidence is brought to the notice of the Regional Centre of the Institute, {{attempts have been made}} to rescue and release them back to the sea as a conservation measure...|$|R
2500|$|The use of {{acoustic}} alarms {{to mitigate}} by-catch {{and also to}} protect aquaculture sites has been proposed but has advantages and risks associated with the alarms. Acoustic deterrent devices, or pingers, have {{reduced the number of}} cetaceans caught in gill nets.

40|$|Sand {{lobsters}} {{are generally}} landed as a by-catch in shrimp and cephalopod trawl nets operating in coastal waters (20 - 60 m depths). The resource is most abun-dant off the north-west and south-east coasts. With {{the increase in}} demand for sand lobsters in export market, the resource achieved prominance in exploitation. The gear used predominantly was “pannu valai” operated as a <b>bottom-set</b> gill <b>net.</b> Generally the mesh size of this net varies from 60 - 65 / 80 - 85 mm and net is approximately 1 - 1. 5 km long. The size group analysis indicates the dominance of juveniles and sub-adults in shallow depths and a preferential movement of the animals with increasing size and maturity towards deeper waters and possibly towards a lower temperature regime...|$|R
40|$|The fishing methods {{along the}} {{south-east}} coast of India with special {{reference to the}} Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar {{in the vicinity of}} Mandapam include the operation of drift gill <b>nets</b> and <b>bottom-set</b> gill <b>nets</b> from plank-built boats, boat seines or bag nets from catamarans, shore seines, hooks and lines and traps, {{depending on the type of}} fish available a: a particular locality. Operation of trawl nets from mechanised vessels in this area on a commercial scale is comparatively recent. Though a few small mechanised boats have been conducting trawling operations especially off Rameswaram for the past few years, no systematic survey of the fishing grounds has been carried out nor are the biological data for the commercially important fishes that could be caught in these nets available. During the course of their work on the biology of silver-bellies and prawns of this area. the authors had opportunity to make sose general observations on the catches landed by the I ndo-Norwegian Project medium boats and since such observations are lacking for this area till date, the information gathered during the year 1964 is given in this paper. Although quantitative data are also presented in this account to indicate the general trend, special attention has been paid to the qualitative analyses of the catches through an year since the chief aim of the paper is to provide information on the availability of various species of fish and prawns that could be commercially exploited...|$|R

Acoustic deterrent devices, or pingers, have {{reduced the number of}} cetaceans caught in gill nets. Harbour porpoises have been effectively excluded from <b>bottom-set</b> gill <b>nets</b> during many experiments for instance in the Gulf of Maine, along the Olympic Peninsula, in the Bay of Fundy, and in the North Sea.

There has been a recent re-evaluation of the potential of pingers and their use in other fisheries due to their growing success.An experiment on the California drift gill net fishery demonstrated how acoustic pingers reduce marine mammal bycatch. It was shown that bycatch was significantly reduced for common dolphins and sea lions. Bycatch rates were also lower for other cetacean species like the Northern right whale dolphin, Pacific white-sided dolphin, Risso’s dolphin and Dall's Porpoise. It is agreed upon that the more pingers on a net, the less bycatch. There was a 12-fold decrease in common dolphin entanglement using a net with 40 pingers.However, the widespread use of pingers along coastlines effectively excludes cetaceans such as porpoises from prime habitat and resources. Cetaceans which are extremely sensitive to noise are effectively being driven from their preferred coastal habitats by the use of acoustic devices. In poorer quality habitat, harbour porpoises are subjected to increased competition for resources. This situation is recognized as range contraction which can be a result of climate change, anthropogenic activity, or population decline. Large scale range contractions are considered indicative of impending extinction. A similar form of deterrent is noise pollution originating from vessel traffic.|$|R
40|$|Passive nets are {{currently}} {{among the most}} important fishing gears largely used along the Mediterranean coasts by the small scale fisheries sector. The fishing effort exerted by this sector is strongly correlated with net dimensions. Therefore, the use of passive nets is worldwide managed by defining net length and net drop. The EC Reg. 1967 / 2006 reports that the length of <b>bottom-set</b> and drifting <b>nets</b> may be also defined considering their weight or volume; however, no practical suggestions for fisheries inspectors are yet available. Consequently,  even if such technical measures are reasonable from a theoretical viewpoint, they are hardly suitable as a management tool, due to the difficulties in harbour control. The overall objective {{of this paper is to}} provide a quick methodological approach for the gross estimation of passive net length (by net type) on the basis of net volume. The final goal is to support fisheries managers with suitable advice for enforcement and control purposes. The results obtained are important for the management of the fishing effort exerted by small scale fisheries. The methodology developed in this study should be considered as a first attempt to tackle the tangled problem of net length estimation that can be easily applied in other fisheries and areas in order to improve the precision of the models developed herein...|$|R
