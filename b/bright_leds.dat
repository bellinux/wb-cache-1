40|$|Since 1993, InGaN {{light-emitting}} diodes (LEDs) have been improved and commercialized, but these devices have not fulfilled their original promise as solid-state replacements for light bulbs as their light-emission efficiencies have been limited. Here we describe {{a method to}} enhance this efficiency through the energy transfer between quantum wells (QWs) and surface plasmons (SPs). SPs can increase the density of states and the spontaneous emission rate in the semiconductor, and lead to the enhancement of light emission by SP–QW coupling. Large enhancements of the internal quantum efficiencies (etaint) were measured when silver or aluminium layers were deposited 10 nm above an InGaN light-emitting layer, whereas no such enhancements were obtained from gold-coated samples.

These “green” lights will also to help reduce electric energy usage. With no trenching, wiring or electrical work required, solar powered traffic lights are perfect for road safety and traffic control applications. Solar traffic lights are fitted with the latest technology in electronics. They are based on photovoltaic or PV for short. A solar panel which {{is located on the}} top of the pole converts sunlight into electrical power. A solar charger regulates the voltage coming out of the solar panel. The regulated power obtained is used to charge a battery. During daytime, the traffic lights can use voltage direct from solar panel. At the same time, the battery can be charge for using at night. Lighting is produced by arrays of extra <b>bright</b> <b>LEDs</b> that are much brighter than bulbs. LED last for years and is very energy efficient.

40|$|During {{electrowinning}} of copper, oxidation reaction {{occurs at}} {{the surface of the}} lead anode and oxygen gas is liberated. The size and the burst mechanism of the oxygen bubbles are known to have significant effects on the generation of acid mist. However, {{little is known about the}} actual size and its distribution of the oxygen bubbles that are generated under typical operating conditions of a copper electrowinning tankhouse. This paper presents a technique for the measurement of oxygen bubbles formed in a copper elec-trowinning process. Live images of the generated oxygen bubbles were captured by utilizing a high speed camera, super <b>bright</b> <b>LEDs</b> and a special viewing chamber. A MATLAB based software was developed to analyse the images and to determine the size of the bubbles. The effect of electrical current density on the size of the oxygen bubbles was experimentally investigated. Results show that regardless of the current density applied, bubbles were found in various sizes ranging from 33 μm up to 278 μm. They also revealed that current density had negligible effect on bubble size distribution. The mean bubble diameter for all three different current densities was found to be between 65 and 68 μm. Experimentally measured amount of acid mist was found to increase linearly with the increase of current density. Based on Faraday’s Law, the total volume oxygen generated at the anode is linearly related to the current density. Since the current density had negligible effect on the bubble size, it was postulated that the total number of bubbles generated at the anode was also linearly related to current density...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{explains}} the project {{which is a}} special kind of LED Display Board for performing dance movement according to the rhythm of music. Nowadays, LED display boards are widely used in advertising and other applications. LED display boards can also be used indoors or outdoors. The objective of this system is to design a display panel by using several dozens of LED matrix display. The display pattern can desire to be changed easily and modified by the user. This LED display board is overall in two major components; which are the microcontroller and LED display panel. Microcontrollers with programs are developed to generate characters and graphics for this module. In this system, when the LED display board is “ON”, it will display the messages and then dance movements by the rhythm of music using a PIC microcontroller. It is not needed to change the LED panel, only to change the input data in PIC program. In this system, LED panel is controlled by a program in microcontroller from serial to parallel shift registers using the scanning method. PIC microcontroller is for generating the output signal to output display board by using a program. Then, it will be run on the LED display board. This is very useful in area like railway platforms, streets, banks, training institutes and other applications to show data information on the large LED boards. As a result, this LED display board is useful as indoors or outdoors as it is also economic. This display consists of maximum 72 <b>bright</b> <b>LEDs</b> which are rotated to show the display. In this system, this display can show data information which will require a whopping 512 LEDs. Therefore hardwar...|$|E
