The Chesapeake Bay watershed (CBW), a particularly valuable watershed within the United States, has undergone considerable land use change over the past 400 years and faces many restoration challenges. Using fish indicators of biological integrity (IBIs), and data for land use, land cover, and environmental attributes, five empirical models (CART model, Random Forest, Conditional Tree, Conditional Forest, and ordinal logistic regression) were used to predict the <b>biological</b> <b>condition</b> of 1 st- 3 rd order streams within the CBW.

25|$|Cognitive {{biology is}} an {{emerging}} science that regards natural cognition as a biological function. It {{is based on}} the theoretical assumption that every organism—whether a single cell or multicellular—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a sensory-motor coupling. That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the <b>biological</b> <b>conditions</b> in which its genes survives {{from one generation to the}} next. And since by Darwinian theory the species of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems, and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more we understand the nature of cognition.|$|E

40|$|We used field-derived {{data from}} streams in Nevada, USA, to {{quantify}} relationships between stream <b>biological</b> <b>condition,</b> in-stream stressors, and {{potential sources of}} stress (land use). We used 2 freshwater macroinvertebrate-based indices to measure biological condition: a multimetric index (MMI) and an observed to expected (O/E) index of taxonomic completeness. We considered 4 categories of potential stressors: dissolved metals, total dissolved solids, nutrients, and flow alteration. For physicochemical factors that varied predictably across natural environmental gradients, we quantified potential stress as the site-specific difference between observed (O) and expected (E) levels of each factor (O–Estress). We then used 2 sets of Random Forest models to quantify relationships between: 1) <b>biological</b> <b>condition</b> and potential stressors, and 2) stressor values and land uses. The 2 indices of <b>biological</b> <b>condition</b> were differentially responsive to stressors, indicating that no single measure of <b>biological</b> <b>condition</b> could fully characterize assemblage response to stress. Total dissolved solids (as measured by electrical conductivity [EC]) and metal contamination were the stressors most strongly associated with biological degradation. The most likely sources of these stressors were agriculture, urban development, and mining. Our findings highlight {{the need to develop}} EC criteria for streams. Measures of <b>biological</b> <b>condition</b> and stress that account for natural variability should reduce errors of inference and increase confidence in causal analyses. This approach will require development of robust models capable of predicting physical and chemical reference conditions.

6000|$|It follows, therefore, {{that from}} {{the time when the}} ancestral man first walked erect, with hands freed from any active part in locomotion, and when his brain-power became {{sufficient}} to cause him to use his hands in making weapons and tools, houses and clothing, to use fire for cooking, and to plant seeds or roots to supply himself with stores of food, the power of natural selection would cease to act in producing modifications of his body, but would continuously advance his mind through the development of its organ, the brain. Hence man may have become truly man--the species, Homo sapiens--even in the Miocene period; and while all other mammals were becoming modified from age to age under the influence of ever-changing physical and <b>biological</b> <b>conditions,</b> he would be advancing mainly in intelligence, but perhaps also in stature, and by that advance alone would be able to maintain himself as the master of all other animals and as the most widespread occupier of the earth. It is quite in accordance with this view that we find the most pronounced distinction between man and the anthropoid apes in the size and complexity of his brain. Thus, Professor Huxley tells us that [...] "it may be doubted whether a healthy human adult brain ever weighed less than 31 or 32 ounces, or that the heaviest gorilla brain has exceeded 20 ounces," [...] although [...] "a full-grown gorilla is probably pretty nearly twice as heavy as a Bosjes man, or as many an European woman."[226] The average human brain, however, weighs 48 or 49 ounces, and if we take the average ape brain at only 2 ounces less than the very largest gorilla's brain, or 18 ounces, we shall see better the enormous increase which has taken place in the brain of man since the time when he branched off from the apes; and this increase will be still greater if we consider that the brains of apes, like those of all other mammals, have also increased from earlier to later geological times.|$|E

40|$|To {{protect and}} restore the {{biological}} integrity of streams, {{we need to be}} able to both detect biological degradation and infer likely causes of impairment. Managers often use biological indices to measure <b>biological</b> <b>condition</b> and detect degradation. However, the ability to detect degradation can be limited by the performance of the indices we develop. Index performance varies widely, but the sources of this variation are often unclear. In addition, although bioassessments are useful tools for detecting biological degradation, they do not identify stressors associated with impairment. My thesis research had two general goals: 1) develop statistically and ecologically robust indices to measure <b>biological</b> <b>condition</b> in Nevada streams and 2) quantify relationships between land uses, stressors, and <b>biological</b> <b>condition</b> to infer likely causes of degradation. I developed two biological indices for Nevada streams, a multimetric index (MMI) and observed to expected (O/E) taxa ratios, and determined if index performance was related to site isolation and sample evenness. The Nevada O/E indices were relatively imprecise compared with those from other regions, which likely results from low assemblage predictability associated with spatial isolation of aquatic habitats in arid regions. In contrast, the Nevada MMI was more precise than most previously developed MMIs, likely the result of using models to reduce natural variation in index scores. Sample evenness was positively associated with both O/E and MMI scores. Adjustments of index scores for sample evenness increased index precision, but also altered relative differences in index values and therefore inferences of biological impairment at specific sites. I also quantified relationships between <b>biological</b> <b>condition,</b> instream stressors, and land uses and used a weight of evidence approach to infer likely causes of degradation. Land uses such as agriculture, urbanization, and mining were associated with the spatial distributions of instream stressors, and these stressors were associated with variation in <b>biological</b> <b>condition.</b> Total dissolved solids and metal contamination were the stressors most strongly associated with <b>biological</b> <b>condition.</b> By detecting <b>biological</b> degradation and identifying important stressors and their potential sources, the tools I developed should help managers target conservation and restoration efforts and improve their ability to protect freshwater resources...|$|R
