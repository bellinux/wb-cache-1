5|$|The Ottoman wars instigated great {{demographic}} changes. Croats migrated towards Austria and {{the present-day}} <b>Burgenland</b> Croats are direct descendants of these settlers. To replace the fleeing Croats, the Habsburgs {{called on the}} Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier. Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737–39.|$|E
5|$|Since then, under Strache's leadership, {{the party}} has again {{attracted}} an increase in its popular support. In the 2013 legislative election the FPÖ won 20.5% of the vote and, more recently, it came ahead either of the SPÖ or the ÖVP in some state elections, entered in a SPÖ-led government in <b>Burgenland</b> and gained more than 30% {{of the vote in}} Vienna. Finally, in the 2016 presidential election, FPÖ member Norbert Hofer won the first round, receiving 35.1%, but was defeated by The Greens' candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, 53.8% against 46.2%, in the final run-off (an earlier run-off was invalidated).|$|E
5|$|The FPÖ fared {{much better}} than the BZÖ in polls {{following}} the 2005 split, with the first tests in regional elections in Styria and <b>Burgenland.</b> On 23 April 2005 Heinz-Christian Strache was elected as new chairman of the FPÖ, taking over from interim leader Hilmar Kabas. As most of the party's office-seeking elite had gone over to the BZÖ, the FPÖ was again free from responsibility. Under Strache the party's ideology grew more radical, and it returned to its primary goal of vote-maximising. The FPÖ did reasonably well in October's Vienna election, in which Strache was the leading candidate and ran a campaign directed strongly against immigration. It took a 14.9% share, while the BZÖ won just 1.2%.|$|E
5|$|Meyszner {{remained}} {{stationed at}} Judenburg {{for the next}} nine years, although he was sent on several detachments. In 1921, {{he was promoted to}} Major der Polizei (Major of Police). While commanding a gendarmerie detachment sent to oversee the unification of <b>Burgenland</b> with Austria in August 1921, Meyszner was shot in the leg by local Hungarians rebelling against the transfer. In 1922, his unit subdued significant labour unrest in the Judenburg region and in 1927 it quelled a strike {{in the aftermath of the}} July Revolt of 1927. Meyszner joined the Austrian Nazi Party on 5 September 1925, and was allocated membership number 10,617. In May 1927 he was granted an audience with Adolf Hitler, along with two of his Home Guard comrades, Walter Pfrimer and Hanns Albin Rauter. On 1 January 1929, Meyszner was transferred to Graz where he came into contact with more right-wing organisations.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Slavonia is characterised by significant migrations, as {{is that of}} Croatia as a whole, starting {{with the arrival of}} the Croats, between the 6th and 9th centuries. Following the establishment of the personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102, and the joining of the Habsburg Empire in 1527, the Hungarian and German speaking population of Croatia began gradually increasing in number. The processes of Magyarization and Germanization varied in intensity but persisted until the beginning of the 20th century. The Ottoman conquests initiated a westward migration of parts of the Croatian population; the <b>Burgenland</b> Croats are direct descendants of some of those settlers. To replace the fleeing Croats the Habsburgs called on the Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier. Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737–39. Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918, the Hungarian population declined, due to emigration and ethnic bias. The changes were especially significant in the areas north of the Drava river, and Baranja County where they represented the majority before World War I.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Croatia is characterised by significant migrations, {{starting with the}} arrival of the Croats in the area. According to the work De Administrando Imperio written by the 10th-century Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, the Croats arrived in the area of modern-day Croatia in the early 7thcentury. However, that claim is disputed, and competing hypotheses date the event between the 6th and the 9th centuries. Following the establishment of a personal union of Croatia and Hungary in 1102, and the joining of the Habsburg Empire in 1527, the Hungarian and German speaking population of Croatia began gradually increasing in number. The processes of Magyarization and Germanization varied in intensity but persisted to the 20th century.

To replace the fleeing Croats the Habsburgs called on the Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier. Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737–39. Similarly, Venetian Republic rule in Istria and in Dalmatia, following the Fifth and the Seventh Ottoman–Venetian Wars ushered gradual growth of Italian speaking population in those areas. Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary in 1918, the Hungarian population declined, especially in the areas north of the Drava river, where they represented the majority before World War I.|$|E
25|$|Within Austria Blaufränkisch is a {{permitted}} {{variety in}} several Districtus Austriae Controllatus (DAC) zones. Producers in the <b>Burgenland</b> tend to delineate light bodied, unoaked Blaufränkisch wines to the Mittleburgenland DAC Classic, while labeling more full bodied, oaked styles as <b>Burgenland</b> DAC Reserve.|$|E
25|$|In Austria, Pinot noir {{is usually}} called Blauburgunder (literally Blue Burgundy) and {{produced}} in <b>Burgenland</b> and Lower Austria. Austrian Pinot noir wines are dry red wines similar in character {{to the red}} wines of Burgundy, mostly aged in French barriques. Some of the best Austrian Pinots come from Neusiedlersee and Blaufraenkischland (<b>Burgenland),</b> and Thermenregion (Lower Austria).|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} wine-producing areas are in Lower Austria, <b>Burgenland,</b> Styria and Vienna. The Grüner Veltliner grape {{provides some of}} Austria's most notable white wines and Zweigelt is the most widely planted red wine grape.|$|E
25|$|These {{were smaller}} settlements, market {{towns and villages}} with defenses, which might collectively be {{described}} as Stadtchen. These occur particularly in <b>Burgenland,</b> but also in Styria, and East Tirol. They are primarily defenses against the Turkish incursions and marauding Hungarian brigands. These walled and defended settlements were mainly constructed in the period between the first siege of Vienna in 1529 and the second siege in 1683. In 1622 the Esterhazy’s succeeded to {{the control of the}} area around Eisenstadt the modern <b>Burgenland</b> and {{in the light of the}} threats from the Turks and the marauding Hungarian groups started the fortification of the larger villages and settlements. At Oggau am Neusiedler See the walls may have started to be built earlier following the Bocskay rebellion in 1605, which had left the small market town devastated. Other settlements in <b>Burgenland</b> to be walled were Rust, (which together with the Altstadt at Eisenstadt) which were now given the special status of “Royal Free Cities” and Purbach and Donnerskirchen. The four settlements – Oggau am Neusiedler See, Purbach, Rust and Donnerskirchen – formed a defended group along the western edge of the Neusiedler See. Around 1640 probably all of these settlements had angled bastions added to the walls for mounted artillery.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{vineyard}} of the South <b>Burgenland,</b> Eisenberg reflects the red, iron-rich soil which imparts a distinct spiciness to the Blaufränkisch grown here. A speciality here is Uhudler wine, made from hybrids with North American {{species such as}} Isabella, Concord, Delaware, Noah, Elvira and Ripadella, which was banned for a while after the 1985 scandal.|$|E
25|$|The {{population}} of Hallstatt drew its wealth from the salt industry. Imports of luxury goods {{stretching from the}} North and Baltic seas to Africa have been discovered in the cemetery at Hallstatt. The oldest evidence of an Austrian wine industry was discovered in Zagersdorf, <b>Burgenland</b> in a grave mound. The Cult Wagon of Strettweg, Styria is evidence of contemporary religious life.|$|E
25|$|Outside Hungary, it {{is found}} planted around the Crimea where {{producers}} have endeavored {{to make their own}} versions of Tokaji. For the same reason, small plantings of the grape have been done in the Swartland region of South Africa. In Austria it is most commonly found in <b>Burgenland</b> (where is known as Zapfner)) and Styria (where it is known as Mosler).|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of Austrian elections, there were {{different}} ballots in all nine states (in 2002 there were three different ballots, in 2006 there were seven). The ballots featured parliamentary parties in the order of votes they received in the last election, i.e. SPÖ, ÖVP, Greens, FPÖ, BZÖ. The extraparliamentary parties were listed in the order in which they submitted their state candidate lists, and this order was different in all nine states; Dinkhauser, for instance, wanted the FRITZ to be the last on the ballot in all nine states, but the Left (in <b>Burgenland</b> and Tyrol) and the Christians (in Salzburg) submitted their lists after he did. The longest ballots could be found in Carinthia and Vienna, which broke the previous record of eleven lists (Vorarlberg, 1994) with twelve lists. <b>Burgenland,</b> Salzburg, Tyrol and Upper Austria had eleven lists, and Lower Austria, Styria and Vorarlberg had only the ten national lists on the ballot.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that Blaufränkisch or a similar forerunner of the grape was already cultivated in regions of present Austria (Lower Austria and <b>Burgenland)</b> in the 10th century. In his 1777 publication Beschreibung der in der Wiener Gegend gemeinen Weintrauben-Arten, ampelographer Sebastian Helbling accounted the variety {{as one of the}} best red grape varieties of Lower Austria, and used the name Schwarze Fränkische for it.|$|E
25|$|Zápolya {{would rule}} Hungary {{until his death}} in 1540. Following his demise, Hungary was split into three parts. The north-west (present-day Slovakia, western Transdanubia and <b>Burgenland,</b> western Croatia and parts of {{north-eastern}} present-day Hungary) remained under Habsburg rule; although initially independent, later it became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy under the informal name Royal Hungary. The Habsburg Emperors would from then on be also crowned as Kings of Hungary.|$|E
25|$|On 29 March 1945 the Soviet {{commander}} Fyodor Tolbukhin's troops {{crossed the}} former Austrian border at Klostermarienberg in <b>Burgenland.</b> On 3 April, {{at the beginning}} of the Vienna Offensive, the Austrian politician Karl Renner, then living in southern Lower Austria, established contact with the Soviets. Joseph Stalin had already established a would-be future Austrian cabinet from the country's communists in exile, but Tolbukhin's telegram changed Stalin's mind in favor of Renner.|$|E
25|$|The northwestern {{part of the}} old {{kingdom of}} Hungary (present-day Slovakia, western Transdanubia and <b>Burgenland,</b> plus western Croatia and parts of present-day northeastern Hungary) {{remained}} under Habsburg rule as the realm of King Ferdinand.

The Habsburg Emperors would from then on be crowned also as Kings of Hungary. The Turks were unable to conquer the northern and western parts of Hungary.|$|E
25|$|Bergfrieds {{averaged}} 20 to 30 metres in height, {{although those}} at Forchtenstein Castle in <b>Burgenland,</b> Austria, and Freistadt Castle reach {{a height of}} 50 metres. Compared with the donjon, which occupies a relatively large ground area because of its elaborate interior layout with living rooms, a hall, kitchen, etc., the bergfried usually has a much smaller footprint, which, although of similar height to the donjon gives it the slimmer appearance of a tower. As a building, the bergfried has an even stronger vertical emphasis than the donjon.|$|E
25|$|Born in Nádkút, Vas, Austria-Hungary (now Rohrbrunn, <b>Burgenland,</b> Austria), {{he was the}} son of Joseph Brunner and Ann Kruise. He {{joined the}} Nazi Party in 1931 and the Sturmabteilung (SA) in 1932. After joining the SS in 1938, he was {{assigned}} to the staff of the Central Office for Jewish Emigration in Austria and became its director in 1939. He worked closely with Eichmann on the Nisko Plan, a failed attempt to set up a Jewish reservation in Nisko, Poland, later that same year.|$|E
25|$|Dürrnberg and Hallein (Salzburg) were Celtic salt settlements. In eastern Styria and the <b>Burgenland</b> (e.g., Oberpullendorf) {{high-quality}} {{iron ore}} was mined and processed, then exported to the Romans as ferrum noricum (Noric iron). This {{led to the}} creation of a Roman trading outpost on the Magdalensberg in the early 1st century , later replaced by the Roman town Virunum. Fortified hilltop settlements (oppida), e.g. Kulm (east Styria), Idunum (mod. Villach), Burg (Schwarzenbach), and Braunsberg (Hainburg), were centers of public life. Some cities such as Linz (Lentos) date back to this period also.|$|E
25|$|The Austrian federal {{states of}} Carinthia and Styria {{are home to}} a {{significant}} indigenous Slovene-speaking minority while in the easternmost state, <b>Burgenland</b> (formerly part of the Hungarian portion of Austria–Hungary), there are significant Hungarian- and Croatian-speaking minorities. Of the remaining number of Austria's people that are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former East Bloc nations. Guest workers (Gastarbeiter) and their descendants, as well as refugees from the Yugoslav wars and other conflicts, also form an important minority group in Austria. Since 1994 the Roma–Sinti (gypsies) have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria.|$|E
25|$|On 9 July 1945 the Allies {{agreed on}} the borders of their {{occupation}} zones. Vorarlberg and North Tyrol {{were assigned to the}} French Zone; Salzburg and Upper Austria south of the Danube to the American Zone; East Tyrol, Carinthia and Styria to the British Zone; and <b>Burgenland,</b> Lower Austria, and the Mühlviertel area of Upper Austria, north of the Danube, to the Soviet Zone. The French and American zones bordered those countries' zones in Germany, and the Soviet zone bordered future Warsaw Pact states. Vienna was divided among all four Allies. The historical center of Vienna was declared an international zone, in which occupation forces changed every month. Movement of occupation troops ("zone swap") continued until the end of July.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, DNA {{analysis}} {{confirmed that}} Grüner Veltliner {{was a natural}} crossing of Savagnin (Traminer) and obscure Austria grapevine {{from the village of}} Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge located outside Eisenstadt in <b>Burgenland</b> region of eastern Austria. The vine was first found in 2000 in an overgrown part of a pasture in a location where there had not been any vineyard since the late 19th century, and is assumed to have been the last vine in this location for over a century. Local experts were not able to determine the variety of the vine. Only when it was threatened to be ripped out in 2005 additional samples were taken and later analyzed at Klosterneuburg. Genetic analysis in the following years by Ferdinand Regner was able to determine that St. Georgener-Rebe is a parent variety to Grüner Veltliner.|$|E
25|$|The {{region is}} located in the {{south-western}} part of Slovakia and has an area of 2,053km² and a population of 622,706 (2009). The region is split by the Little Carpathians which start in Bratislava and continue north-eastwards; these mountains separate two lowlands, the Záhorie lowland in the west and the fertile Danubian Lowland in the east, which grows mainly wheat and maize. Major rivers in the region are the Morava River, the Danube and the Little Danube; the last of these, together with the Danube, encircle the Žitný ostrov in the south-east. There are three protected landscape areas in the region: the Little Carpathians, Záhorie and Dunajské luhy. The region borders Trnava Region in the north and east, Győr-Moson-Sopron county in Hungary in the south, <b>Burgenland</b> in Austria in the south-west and Lower Austria in the west.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of the Emperor Claudius (41–54 AD), the Roman {{province}} of Noricum had as its boundaries, to the north the Danube, to the north-east the Vienna Woods, in the east approximately the current eastern border of Styria while in the south-east and south it was bounded by the Eisack and Drava rivers. Later, under Diocletian (284–305), the province was divided along the main Alpine ridge into a northern (Noricum ripense) and a southern (Noricum mediterraneum). Across the Ziller in the west, corresponding to the present provinces of Vorarlberg and Tyrol lay the province of Raetia incorporating the earlier territory of Vindelicia. In the east lay Pannonia, today's <b>Burgenland.</b> To the south was Region 10, Venetia et Histria. The Danube river formed the Danubian limes (limes Danubii fluminis), a defensive line separating Upper and Lower Austria from the Germanic tribes of the Marcomanni and Quadi.|$|E
25|$|Occupation of Germany and Austria by the Soviet troops was {{followed}} by large-scale dismantling of former German equipment which was shipped to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Austria lost, in 1951 dollars, 200 million dollars' worth of German industrial properties (out of total 1.5 billion). Plunder continued until the early summer of 1946, when the Soviet policy changed from taking Austrian assets to managing them for a profit. The Soviet Department for Investigation of German Properties compiled an inventory of remaining industrial assets in the Soviet zone (Lower Austria, <b>Burgenland</b> and eastern districts of Upper Austria). June 27, 1945, the Soviet command transformed this Department into the Administration for Soviet Property in Eastern Austria (USIVA) and placed all industrial assets under its control. In 1947 the name was shortened to USIA. Its internal structure mimicked that of the Soviet cabinet, with nine divisions paralleling nine ministries of industries. No less than eleven ministries in Moscow had a say in USIA affairs.|$|E
25|$|Outside of {{the regions}} {{discussed}} above, Chardonnay {{can be found}} in cooler climate sites in Italy, Greece, Israel and Lebanon as well as Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, England, Georgia, Germany, Slovakia, Hungary, Macedonia, Moldova, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Serbia and Switzerland. In Austria, the grape varieties known as Feinburgunder in <b>Burgenland</b> & Vienna and Morillon in Styria was not identified as Chardonnay till the late 1980s. Today, Austrian Chardonnays range from the rich, oaked aged varieties to leaner, more aromatic styles based on Austrian Rieslings to sweet late harvest styles. In nearby Germany, this distinctly French wine grape was slow to gain a footing being only officially sanctioned since 1991. Today it is most commonly found in the Baden, Palatinate and Rheinhessen regions. In Switzerland, Chardonnay is found mostly around Bündner Herrschaft, Geneva and Valais. In Spain, Chardonnay has been increasingly used in the sparkling wine Cava. It is also permitted in the Denominación de Origen (DO) wines of Costers del Segre, Navarra and Somontano. In the wine regions of the former Soviet Union, Chardonnay has lagged behind in white wine grapes plantings in favor Rkatsiteli, Aligote and Riesling. The Portuguese experimentation with Chardonnay has been mostly influenced by flying winemakers from Australia and the examples produced so far are very New World in style.|$|E
500|$|In 1920, Mikl was {{accepted}} by the new Austrian Army (...) , joining the 11th Alpenjäger Regiment. During 1920–21 he was rapidly promoted to Hauptmann (captain), and on 20 October 1920 he was posted to the 5th Cyclist Battalion in Villach, Carinthia. In 1921, his battalion was deployed to <b>Burgenland</b> {{to assist in the}} transfer of that region from Hungary to Austria. In 1922, he changed his name to the more Germanised Mickl. According to his biographers Richter and Kobe, at this time the Austrian police wanted to speak to Mikl regarding alleged arms trafficking offences, and his decision to change his name may have related to the police inquiries. On 2 May 1922, Mickl married Helene Zischka in Klagenfurt; their only child, Manfred, was born in 1923. That same year, he was promoted to the rank of Major, having worked on the frontier with Italy, trained border guards and proving an accomplished mountaineer.|$|E
500|$|Omaha {{returned}} {{the following day}} to the vicinity that Rio Grande had been sunk and again encountered an unknown merchant steamer. She once again challenged the unknown contact with her searchlight, and again received no response to her signals. This time Omaha fired two warning shots over the unknown ship's bow, {{due to the fact}} that it appeared that she was dead in the water. An explosion was observed, followed by smoke billowing from her. Captain Elwood M. Tillson ordered Omahas 6-inch battery to train on the unknown contact and open fire. Captain Tillson then allowed members of the crew to rotate topside to observe the gunfire since many of the men were unable to view the action against Rio Grande the previous day. The ship, later identified as another German blockade runner, <b>Burgenland,</b> sank by her stern thirty minutes later.
