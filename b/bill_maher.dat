5|$|The {{design of}} the villainous Ursula was based upon drag {{performer}} Divine. An additional early inspiration before Divine was Joan Collins {{in her role as}} Alexis Carrington in the television show Dynasty, due to a suggestion from Howard Ashman, who was a fan of the series. Pat Carroll was not Clements and Musker's first choice to voice Ursula; the original script had been written with Bea Arthur of the Disney-owned TV series The Golden Girls in mind. After Arthur turned the part down, actresses such as Nancy Marchand, Nancy Wilson, Roseanne, Charlotte Rae, and Elaine Stritch were considered for the part. Stritch was eventually cast as Ursula, but clashed with Howard Ashman's style of music production and was replaced by Carroll. Various actors auditioned for additional roles in the film, including Jim Carrey for the role of Prince Eric, and comedians <b>Bill</b> <b>Maher</b> and Michael Richards for the role of Scuttle.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-five media {{commentators}} {{were interviewed}} for the film.

After confirming Boone, <b>Bill</b> <b>Maher</b> and Janeane Garofalo on Fuck, it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.|$|E
