40|$|A novel nonlocal four-photon {{interaction}} on the deformed spacetime {{is derived}} and {{studied in the}} three selected models (I, II, III). The first two models (I, II) are obtained via two distinct second-order θ-exact Seiberg-Witten maps of the noncommutative U(1) gauge field strength on Moyal space. The third one (III), inspired by the manifestly gauge invariant structures emerging in the first two, due to the model generality has been constructed with {{a different set of}} freedom parameters. The physical relevancy of all models is analyzed by evaluating the four-photon-tadpole diagram, which, when combined with the <b>bubble</b> <b>graph,</b> enables us to fully consider all contributions to the one-loop photon polarization tensor. For an arbitrary noncommutative matrix theta^μν, the full quadratic IR divergence cancellation in the one-loop photon two-point function is obtained with particular combinations of Seiberg-Witten map/gauge-symmetry freedom parameters in models I and II. Finally, our model III enables complete elimination of all pathological terms in the photon polarization tensor at one-loop order if a special value for the theta matrix is chosen.

A pathway contains various bio-molecules in different layers of the cell {{which is responsible for}} specific cancer type. Researchers are highly interested in understanding the relationships among the proteins of different pathways and furthermore want to know how those proteins are interacting in different pathways for various cancer types. Biologists find it useful to merge the data of different cancer studies in a single network and see the relationships among the different proteins which can help them detect the common proteins in cancer studies and hence reveal the pattern of interactions of those proteins. We introduce the CancerLinker, a visual analytic tool that helps researchers explore cancer study interaction network. Twenty-six cancer studies are merged to explore pathway data and bio-molecules relationships that can provide the answers to some significant questions which are helpful in cancer research. The CancerLinker also helps biologists explore the critical mutated proteins in multiple cancer studies.

In the UV we find a one-parameter family of solutions that approach asymptotically AdS_ 5 × S^ 5 with a logarithmic flow of the coupling plus non-perturbative terms that correctly reproduce all UV and IR renormalon singularities.

Despite the large impact that NCDs are predicted to have, particularly in developing countries, estimates of disease burden are sparse and inconsistent. This systematic review transparently estimates prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Southern Asia, its association with urbanization and provides insight into the policy challenges facing the region. Methods The databases Medline and PubMed were searched for population– based studies providing estimates of diabetes prevalence in the Southern Asia region.

The fault diagnosis is the process of identifying faulty processors in a multiprocessor system through testing.

40|$|The paper proposes {{designs of}} {{interconnection}} networks (graphs) which can tolerate link failures. The networks under study {{belong to a}} subclass of Cayley graphs whose generators are subsets of all possible transpositions. We specifically focus on star and bubble sort networks. Our approach is to augment existing dimensions (or generators) {{with one or more}} dimensions. If the added dimension is capable of replacing any arbitrary failed dimension, it is called a wildcard dimension. It is shown that, up to isomorphism among digits used in labeling the vertices, the generators of the star graph are unique. The minimum number of extra dimensions needed to acquire i wildcard dimensions is derived for the star and bubble sort networks. Interestingly, the optimally augmented star network coincides with the Transposition network, Tn. Transposition networks are studied rigorously. These networks are shown to be optimally fault tolerant. Tn is also shown to possess wide containers with short length. Fault diameter of Tn is shown to be n.

40|$|A fully Lagrangian {{compressible}} numerical {{framework for}} the simulation of underwater implosion of a large air bubble is presented. Both air and water are considered compressible and the equations for the Lagrangian shock hydrodynamics are stabilized via a variationally consistent multiscale method. A nodally perfect matched definition of the interface is used and then the kinetic variables, pressure and density, are duplicated at the interface level. An adaptive mesh generation procedure, which respects the interface connectivities, is applied to provide enough refinement at the interface level. This framework is verified by several benchmarks which evaluate {{the behavior of the}} numerical scheme for severe compression and expansion cases. This model is then used to simulate the underwater implosion of a large cylindrical bubble, with a size in the order of cm. We observe that the conditions within the bubble are nearly uniform until the converging pressure wave is strong enough to create very large pressures {{near the center of the}} bubble. These bubble dynamics occur on very small spatial (0. 3 mm), and time (0. 1 ms) scales. During the final stage of the collapse Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities appear at the interface and then disappear when the rebounce starts. At the end of the rebounce phase the bubble radius reaches 50 % of its initial value and the bubble recover its circular shape. It is when the second collapse starts, with higher mode shape instabilities excited at the bubble interface, that leads to the rupture of the <b>bubble.</b> Several <b>graphs</b> are presented and the pressure pulse detected in the water is compared by experiment.

However, listing and analysing all bubbles in a given graph is usually unfeasible in practice, due to the exponential number of bubbles present in real data graphs. In this paper, we propose a notion of a bubble generator set, i. e. a polynomial-sized subset of bubbles from which all the others can be obtained through the application of a specific symmetric difference operator. This set provides a compact representation of the bubble space of a graph, which can be useful in practice since some pertinent information about all the bubbles can be more conveniently extracted from this compact set.
