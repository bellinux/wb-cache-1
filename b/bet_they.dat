5|$|Another shootout {{occurred}} between Henry Clark and Sykes Griffen on December 1, 1878, at Cassidy's Silver Reef Saloon. Although {{it is not}} known exactly what happened, it is believed that Griffen, a faro dealer at the saloon, and Clark, a regular patron, had previously argued over gambling matters. The shooting began when Griffen argued with Clark about a <b>bet</b> <b>they</b> had made. After arguing for several minutes, Griffen pulled a pistol on Clark and shot him. Several witnesses said that Clark pulled a pistol on Griffen and shot him, while other witnesses said that after Clark was shot, other patrons in the saloon, including Clark's father, beat and shot Griffen.|$|E
500|$|After {{their visit}} to the Raja, the villagers witness a cricket match. Bhuvan mocks the game and gets into an {{argument}} {{with one of the}} British officers. Taking an instant dislike to Bhuvan, Russell offers to cancel the taxes of the whole province [...] "for three years" [...] if the villagers can beat his men in a game of cricket. If the villagers lose, however, they will have to pay three times their normal taxes. Bhuvan accepts this wager on behalf of the villages in the province, without their consent. When the other villagers learn about the <b>bet,</b> <b>they</b> are furious with Bhuvan. He argues that it is important for everyone to fight against British rule.|$|E
500|$|The Beauty Process {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Rolling Stone editor Alec Foege {{felt that the}} album is both more powerful and crisper than its predecessors, stating that the band had [...] "matured into punk's distaff Jagger and Richards." [...] Although he considered the song [...] "Lorenza, Giada, Alessandra" [...] to be a rip-off of Sonic Youth's [...] "Swimsuit Issue", he concluded that the band offers [...] "more fresh stylistic variations on classic punk into 40 minutes than most bands come up with during a career. Clever, cocky and ultimately ageless, The Beauty Process gives punk the face lift it deserves without smoothing the wrinkles." [...] Similarly, Heidi Macdonald of CMJ New Music Monthly praised the album's different moods and attitude-filled lyrics, commenting that The Beauty Process includes [...] "just enough self-examination {{to show that the}} girls have grown up, <b>bet</b> <b>they</b> haven't gotten stale." ...|$|E

500|$|There was {{discussion}} among {{the producers of}} the series regarding whether Bertram {{should be included in}} the storyline, as he had not appeared in any episodes for several years. An un-used scene was intended for broadcasting which showed Stewie, while trying to find Waldo in an Abercrombie & Fitch catalog, saying to Brian [...] "Oh, turn to the next page. I <b>bet</b> <b>they</b> put him in someone's utility pocket", but it was never used as it was not deemed funny enough for the episode. Originally, Peter singing [...] "Milkshake" [...] to inmates at a prison was going to be naked and push his nipples from underneath, but broadcasting standards objected; as a result, the show broadcast Peter wearing underpants and pushing his nipples from the side. When Peter and Lois are in the restaurant and Peter leaves to [...] "warn the chef of Lois' arrival", Lois was intended to say [...] "If he won't put something in me, I will", but the gag was never broadcast.|$|E

This occurs in particular when two people have opposing but strongly held views on truth or events. Not only do the parties hope to gain from the <b>bet,</b> <b>they</b> place the bet also to demonstrate their certainty about the issue. Some means of determining {{the issue at stake}} must exist. Sometimes the amount bet remains nominal, demonstrating the outcome as one of principle rather than of financial importance.|$|E

2500|$|There {{is also a}} {{computerised}} racing game {{is known}} as Trackside, where players can also bet on a Win, Place, Quinella or Trifecta, and recently First Fours. Trackside has twelve runners in different racing modes: Thoroughbreds, Harness, Hurdles and Greyhounds. The Trackside odds are fixed and do not change regardless {{of how many people}} are playing. Trackside is operated by Tabcorp Holdings and is run inside TAB venues. Its original tag-line was Win real money on unreal horses, but when greyhound races were introduced, the tag-line was dropped and the logo changed to a 'T' in a green circle with the word TRACKSIDE written in a different font. Note that greyhound races still use twelve runners to match the horse races, unlike regular greyhound races which always have eight runners in a race (unless eight are not available). The former logo featured a cartoon horse and the name TRACKSIDE written in the Ad Lib (typeface) font. Trackside results can also be viewed on SKYtext teletext channels 698 and 699, however this can seemingly only be viewed inside TAB venues, along with the other SKYtext racing results (previously, Seven Network used to host teletext, but cancelled the service on 30 September 2009, leaving only channel 801 open for closed captions). Recently, the Trackside system has been updated to allow Flexi Trifecta and Flexi First Four bets, where picking multiple runners for each position will give a percentage of the total win (for example, if runner numbers 1 and 2 are picked first and second respectively, and the user picks both 3+4 for third place for a $1 <b>bet,</b> <b>they</b> will receive 50% of the dividend of the 1+2+3 or 1+2+4 trifecta if won). As of December 2012, Flexi bets could only be placed via the EasyBet terminal (EBT) machines, however paper Trackside tickets containing Flexi Trifecta and First Four options have since been produced. During a system update in 2014, the hurdle races were removed, and races have become more frequent, being every three minutes instead of every four minutes. The minimum bet per game is 50 cents, unlike Keno which is $1 per game. There are also [...] "mystery" [...] bets, where the computer can randomly pick the first three or four runners in a boxed trifecta or first four bet. These tickets are a fixed price of $3 and $5 respectively.|$|E
