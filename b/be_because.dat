5|$|About a {{week after}} the final, a family in Coleraine were {{targeted}} in an allegedly sectarian attack, thought to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> they were flying a Tyrone GAA flag from their home.|$|E
5|$|Phineas is {{also very}} modest. He tends to put Ferb's name on inventions. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Ferb {{does most of the}} building. However, he never seems angry or resentful of giving his brother the credit.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{attributed}} these circles to the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, {{and have}} noted that they are comparable to the stone circles found further south, in Dartmoor. However, {{in contrast to the}} two known Exmoor circles, over seventy such monuments have been identified on Dartmoor. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Exmoor, unlike Dartmoor, has no natural granite. Instead it has Devonian slates and Hangman Grits, both of which easily break up into small slabs, resulting in a general shortage of big stones on Exmoor.|$|E

6000|$|... 'It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> I <b>was</b> your father's oldest friend, young man,' {{returned}} Mr. Brownlow; 'it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> {{the hopes}} and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man: it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> he knelt with me beside his only sisters' death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would--but Heaven willed otherwise--have made her my young wife; it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> my seared heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died; it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> of {{all these things that}} I am moved to treat you gently now--yes, Edward Leeford, even now--and blush for your unworthiness who bear the name.' ...|$|R

5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation so {{they are able to}} compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also <b>be</b> <b>because</b> an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> Wilfrid's opulent lifestyle was uncongenial to Bede's monastic mind; it may also be that the events of Wilfrid's life, divisive and controversial as they were, simply did not fit with Bede's theme of the progression to a unified and harmonious church.|$|E
5|$|C. c. coronoides, the {{nominate}} or eastern subspecies, {{is found}} across most of eastern Australia. Its range is also {{highly correlated with}} the presence of sheep. This is thought to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the frequency of dead animals, which can be an important source of food. Ornithologist Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation, and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies, which appears static. The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread.|$|E
40|$|Why do rising incomes {{not make}} people happier? Some {{argue that it}} <b>is</b> <b>because</b> we quickly become {{accustomed}} to our new acquisitions. Others {{would say that it}} <b>is</b> <b>because</b> relative status <b>is</b> the goal, not the material acquisitions themselves. But Avner Offer opines it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> we have a difficult time postponing gratification. This is an intriguing notion, one of many in his new book. ...|$|R

5|$|Drugs in the gliflozin class (SGLT2 inhibitors), {{which are}} {{generally}} used for type 2 diabetes, {{have been associated}} with cases of diabetic ketoacidosis where the blood sugars are not significantly elevated ("euglycemic DKA"). This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> they were being used in people with type 1 diabetes, but in those with type 2 diabetes it may be {{as a result of an}} increase in glucagon levels.|$|E
5|$|Female orangutans have eight-year {{intervals}} between births, {{the longest}} interbirth intervals among the great apes. Unlike many other primates, male orangutans {{do not seem}} to practice infanticide. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> they cannot ensure they will sire a female's next offspring because she does not immediately begin ovulating again after her infant dies.|$|E
5|$|In 793 the {{vulnerability}} of the English east coast was exposed when the monastery at Lindisfarne was looted by Vikings and a year later Jarrow was also attacked, events which Steven Plunkett reasons would ensure that the East Anglians were governed firmly. Ã†thelberht's claim to be a king descended from the Wuffingas dynasty (suggested by the use of a Roman she-wolf and the title REX on his coins) could <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of a need for strong kingship {{as a result of the}} Viking attacks.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> I {{have much}} {{confidence}} in you, Monsieur," [...] he said, [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> I go--peut-etre--to dangere, to death, that I {{come here and}} {{ask you to do}} me a favor." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hours {{before the}} shooting, Bello {{sent an e-mail}} to the New York Daily News, making various accusations in regards to his firing, stating [...] "First, I was told it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> I always kept to myself. Then it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of an altercation with a nurse. Then I was told, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> I {{threatened}} a colleague." [...] Bello blamed a specific doctor for blocking his career progress and costing him $400,000.|$|R
50|$|The {{narration}} {{implies that}} Zebedee's {{reason for not}} joining with Doogal and the others on their quest <b>was</b> <b>because</b> he went to search for Zeebad; in the original, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> he had to stay behind to guard the roundabout.|$|R
5|$|In some church {{records the}} town is {{referred}} to as 'Norton Canonicorum' as an alternative to Midsomer Norton, and this may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the local Priory's link to Merton Priory in London until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1546.|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, the funerary {{complex of}} the layer pyramid shows {{no trace of}} an {{enclosure}} wall, which is present in both earlier and later pyramid complexes. This could <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the stones constituting the wall were robbed over time, or simply because the wall was never started, being usually the last element of the pyramid complex to be built.|$|E
5|$|Just before migration, the ruff {{increases}} {{its body}} mass {{at a rate}} of about 1% a day, much slower than the bar-tailed godwits breeding in Alaska, which fatten at four times that rate. This is thought to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the godwit cannot use refuelling areas to feed on its trans-Pacific flight, whereas the ruff is able to make regular stops and take in food during overland migration. For the same reason, the ruff does not physiologically shrink its digestive organs to reduce bodyweight before migrating, unlike the godwit.|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Johnny, {{even at that}} moment, {{hated the}} man; perhaps it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> at that moment he loved and {{believed}} in Florry, or perhaps it <b>was</b> only that <b>because</b> at that moment he was nearer the greater Truth than his questioner, but he said, in a husky voice, [...] "You lie!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Es por eso por lo que lo hice = [...] "That is why I did it", more literally: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> of {{that that}} I did it", or {{completely}} literally: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> {{of that because}} of which I did it" ...|$|R
5000|$|This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> in 90% of contested trials {{the court}} does not order shared {{parenting}} [...] Part of this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> {{of the belief}} of many judges that if parties have to litigate for shared custody then they are unsuited to it.|$|R
5|$|Low immune {{function}} {{has also been}} implicated in endometrial cancer. High blood pressure is also a risk factor, but this may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of its association with obesity. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|Many {{believe that}} person {{might benefit from}} {{prevention}} with antiepileptic drugs. Although this is widely practiced, it is controversial and not based on good evidence. In some studies, use of these medications {{was associated with a}} worse prognosis; although it is unclear whether this might <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the drugs themselves actually cause harm, or because they are used more often in persons with a poorer prognosis. There is a possibility of a gastric hemorrhage due to stress ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E

[...] Bernard {{wondered}} {{what she was going}} to say--if she were going to be silly enough to allude to the most impudent of fictions; then, as she stood opening and closing her blue fan and smiling at him in the fire-light, he felt that she was silly enough for anything.

5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} {{vary in their}} {{appraisal}} of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state {{that he was a}} bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than he should <b>be</b> <b>because</b> commentators found him hard to categorize and because he chose not to commercialize.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> of missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{have failed}} to note signs of {{accretion}} leading up to Type Ia supernovae, and this is now thought to <b>be</b> <b>because</b> the star is first loaded up to above the Chandrasekhar limit while also being spun up to a very high rate by the same process. Once the accretion stops the star gradually slows until the spin is no longer enough to prevent the explosion.|$|E

50|$|BYU was {{returning}} 28 {{players from the}} previous year but Golden Richards would not be one of them.
