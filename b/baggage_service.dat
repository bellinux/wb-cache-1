5000|$|Illinois Central Railroad ceased {{passenger}} train {{service to the}} depot in 1965.

It was subsequently restored based on the original architectural drawings, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 1993, as Newbern Illinois Central Depot. In 1992, Amtrak service was moved from the small stop in nearby Dyersberg to the restored Newbern Depot in order to serve both towns; it is thus sometimes called the Newbern-Dyersberg station. Amtrak's City of New Orleans train comes through twice a day; the depot is a flag stop, meaning passengers can get on or off the train, but there is no staffed ticketing or <b>baggage</b> <b>service.</b> The museum exhibits old photos, railroad tools, uniforms, schedules, and other memorabilia, along with model trains and artwork commemorating the town's railroading past.|$|E
