5|$|Following this, in 1972, the {{legislature}} {{added a new}} SR117, which extended this part of SR75 southwest to the Mexican border near Border Field State Park, to the state highway system, and a southerly extension of SR125 to the border at Otay Mesa to the state highway and Freeway and Expressway systems. Two years later, planning began {{for the construction of}} the Otay Mesa crossing and the construction of SR75 to connect it to I-5 and I-805. Later, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO), the local association of municipal governments, recommended using $4million of federal funding for the construction of SR75. The CPO later endorsed expediting construction of the freeway before completion of the border crossing, so that the freeway would primarily serve <b>border</b> <b>traffic,</b> thus preventing land speculation in Otay Mesa. While Mexican authorities wanted the crossing constructed in 1975, the CPO indicated that the funding for SR75 would not be available until at least 1980, or even 1985. Following this, Representative Lionel Van Deerlin attempted to accelerate the construction of the crossing, even though there was no funding for the highway.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a similar}} system for local <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> permits between Spain and Morocco {{regarding}} Ceuta and Melilla. This system is older and {{was included in the}} 1991 accession treaty of Spain to the Schengen Area.|$|E
25|$|Permits {{are issued}} with a {{validity}} period of {{between one and}} five years and allow for a stay in the border area of up to three months. Permits may only be issued to lawful residents of the border area who have been resident in the border area {{for a minimum of}} one year (or longer if specified by the bilateral agreement). Applicants for a permit have to show that they have legitimate reasons to cross frequently an external land border under the local <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> regime. Schengen states must keep a central register of the permits issued and have to provide immediate access to the relevant data to other Schengen states.|$|E

25|$|Border {{guards are}} {{required}} to stamp the travel documents of third-country nationals when they cross external borders. However, nationals of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and Vatican City are exempt from this requirement, as are heads of state, whose visits were announced through diplomatic channels, and holders of local <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> permits and residence permits. Certain exemptions also apply to the crews of ships and aircraft. Third-country nationals who otherwise fulfil all the criteria for admission into the Schengen area must not be denied entry for the sole reason {{that there is no}} remaining empty space in their travel document to affix a stamp; instead, the stamp should be affixed on a separate sheet of paper.|$|E
25|$|Cabell {{reiterated the}} US demand that Sonoran {{officials}} halt the sporadic shooting from the Mexican {{side of the}} border, to which Calles said that the shooters were “irresponsible men” and beyond his control. All civilians in Nogales, Sonora, had been ordered to turn in their weapons to the authorities; some, however, retained their arms. In addition to exchanging mutual assurances of peace, Cabell and Calles each pledged to investigate the incident. <b>Border</b> <b>traffic</b> resumed as the military conference continued, and peace apparently had returned to Ambos Nogales. Before full normality returned to the community, a US soldier was wounded by fire from the Mexican side; after lying in the post hospital for a few hours, the angry trooper went to the border and shot and wounded a Mexican sentry keeping guard. After a brief but angry exchange with Calles, Cabell ordered the arrest of the vengeful army private and prevented further violence.|$|E
25|$|There are {{suggestions}} {{about a new}} larger border checkpoint to be built on the Norwegian side, as the current station has insufficient capacity to handle increased traffic, and the ground is not sufficiently stable to allow an expansion at the current site. Individual Norwegian police executives {{have called for a}} common border checkpoint located directly on the border line. This would allow for a more cost-effective and less time-consuming operation. However, Norwegian and Russian legislation, as well as the Schengen Agreement, prohibit such an operation. The Parliament of Norway's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has taken initiative to introduce a 24-hour-a-day opening time at the crossing; this has been rejected by the local police district, who stated that nearly all trans-border traffic is persons and that there is hardly any demand for a night service. Estimates show that <b>border</b> <b>traffic</b> may increase to 400,000 crossings by the mid- to late 2010s. The demand for a larger station remains as of 2017.|$|E

50|$|Article 104(a) of the Austrian Criminal Code prohibits {{trafficking}} {{for both}} sexual exploitation and forced labor.

Penalties prescribed in Article 104(a) and Article 114 range up to 10 years’ imprisonment, while penalties prescribed in Article 217 range from six months’ to 10 years’ imprisonment. These penalties are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape.|$|R

2500|$|An area very {{prone to}} rockslides is the Pigeon River Gorge, {{especially}} {{in the vicinity of}} the Tennessee–North Carolina state line. Throughout the 1970s, this stretch of I-40 was repeatedly shut down by rockslides, sometimes for several weeks at a time. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, TDOT dug over [...] of horizontal drains, blasted out large volumes of unstable rocks, and installed massive mesh catchment fences. Nevertheless, rockslides in 1985 and 1997 again forced the closure of I-40 in the Pigeon River Gorge for several weeks. Additional stabilization measures were implemented, including the blasting of loose rock, the installation of rock bolts, and the construction of a better drainage system. In spite of these measures, another massive rock slide occurred in the Pigeon River Gorge on October 26, 2009, blocking all lanes just across the border at North Carolina mile 3. The section was closed to traffic in both directions until April 25, 2010. On January 31, 2012, the westbound lanes of I-40 were closed because of a rockslide near the North Carolina <b>border.</b> <b>Traffic</b> was detoured along I-26 and I-81 and reopened a few months later.|$|E

50|$|Often, {{in order}} {{to cross the border}} into Greece, illegal {{immigrants}} have to pay a smuggler. The vast majority of arrested migrant smugglers—58.4% of those arrested in the first eight months of 2000—are Greek citizens. The Albanian mafia is the second-largest group of smugglers, involved mostly in the smuggling of other Albanians. The Turks are also prevalent smugglers across the Turkish-Greek <b>border.</b> <b>Trafficking</b> organizations in Albania can charge up to US$4,000 per person they can smuggle across, and it has become a lucrative business for many smugglers. Illegal immigrants from Poland and other former Soviet bloc countries in particular also use chain migration, in which close links with home villages are maintained and relatives or friends are recruited to work in Greece and recommended to employers; jobs are transferred between immigrants returning to their home countries for a few months' visit and newcomers from their hometowns.|$|R
