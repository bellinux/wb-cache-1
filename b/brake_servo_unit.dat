5000|$|This article mainly {{refers to}} the {{mechanical}} device {{in the context of}} a brake power booster or vehicular braking-system assist. The term [...] "vacuum servo" [...] is actually a generic term for any device which uses a vacuum to amplify/boost the mechanical effort of a device by use of a vacuum in an assisting chamber, either attached to the input or output, or placed between the input and output. In a Vacuum <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> the <b>unit</b> is placed between the brake pedal and the hydraulic master cylinder, using stored vacuum to amplify the drivers pedal efforts, giving a greater braking force.|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{production}} was suspended in 1978 while the braking problems {{were resolved by}} some engineering changes including removing the <b>brake</b> <b>servo.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{were some}} {{changes to the}} 14/28 chassis and {{suspension}} and the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> was deleted. Production ended in 1929, after approximately 700 cars had been built.|$|R
50|$|The Rekord B had {{introduced}} Rekord buyers to a dual circuit braking system the previous year, and this feature was {{carried over into}} the Rekord C along with the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> and front-wheel disc brakes.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{stability}} and precision of noncircular manufacture process, the variable spindle speed turning is applied to noncircular turning process. The variable spindle turning system is designed. The character of variable spindle speed is analyzed. The linear <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> available for variable speed noncircular turning process is designed. An active disturbance rejection control technique is applied to <b>servo</b> <b>unit.</b> The experiment results show that surface quality and tracking error of variable spindle speed noncircular turning are better than constant speed machining. The linear <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> is able to track the desired trajectory of cutting tool motion...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study was undertaken {{to design and}} implement a microcomputer based gun control and interactive display system which is suitable {{as a model of}} a shipboard Gun Fire Control System and Tactical-Situation display. The stand-alone system includes two plasma display scopes, a microcomputer, a cathode ray tube (CRT), an analog-to-digital, digital-to-analog (ADC/DAC) board and a <b>servo</b> <b>unit.</b> The scope of the effort includes, calculation of target information, prediction of target values, solution of anti-air warfare and surface fire control problems. The <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> was connected to the computer through the ADC/DAC board. The use of the <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> and the true-motion plotter emulates the shipboard weapon system environment.

50|$|Engines {{fitted with}} three SU HS4 {{carburettors}} and an improved camshaft were {{announced at the}} end of May 1961. Other changes included a vertical barred front grille. Optional extras were similar to the Mark I. From August 1961 a <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> was also available as an optional extra, which greatly improved braking performance.|$|R
50|$|The braking {{configuration}} {{was also}} essentially {{that from the}} previous Rekords, with a dual circuit hydraulically controlled system along with the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> as before, and incorporating, on larger engined versions, a brake force limiter for the rear brakes. The car used disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the back.|$|R
50|$|In the UK {{two common}} grades of brake shoe {{material}} {{used to be}} available. DON 202 was a high friction material that did not require a <b>brake</b> power <b>servo.</b> The disadvantage was that the lining was prone to fading on steep hills (calculate the kilowatts dissipated by a one-ton car descending a 15% hill at a constant 60 mph) A harder lining, the famous VG95 was produced but this required a <b>brake</b> <b>servo.</b> The other snag was that the parking brake would often fail the annual MOT test unless the high friction linings were installed just for the test.|$|R
50|$|The braking {{configuration}} {{was also}} essentially {{that from the}} previous Rekord, with a dual circuit hydraulically controlled system along with the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> as before, with the addition, on larger engined versions, of a brake force limiter for the rear brakes. The car used disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the back.|$|R
50|$|Power {{assisted}} brakes are supplied as standard. However, {{because the}} vacuum supply {{from the engine}} in-let manifold that normally supplies the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> is not available on an electric vehicle, a dedicated vacuum pump is used. (Typical operation of the vacuum pump is on for 10-15 seconds and off {{for a couple of}} minutes).|$|R
5000|$|Many new BMW petrol engines {{do not use}} a {{throttle}} {{in normal}} running, but instead use [...] "Valvetronic" [...] variable-lift intake valves to control the amount of air entering the engine. Like a diesel engine, manifold vacuum is practically non-existent in these engines and a different source must be utilised to power the <b>brake</b> <b>servo.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{in every}} Bristol saloon since the 404, a {{compartment}} accessed via a hinged panel between {{the front of}} the driver's door and the rear of the front wheel arch housed the battery, fuse panel, windscreen wiper motor and <b>brake</b> <b>servos.</b> [...] A similar panel {{on the other side of}} the car housed the spare wheel and jack.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{drum brake}} designs {{have at least}} one leading shoe, which gives a servo-effect. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect and its braking force is always {{proportional}} to the pressure placed on the brake pad by the braking system via any <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> <b>braking</b> pedal, or lever. This tends to give the driver better [...] "feel" [...] and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to [...] "bell mouthing" [...] and trap worn lining material within the assembly, both causes of various braking problems.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the H6 was its brakes. They were light-alloy drums on all four wheels with power-assist {{the first in the}} industry, driven with a special shaft from the transmission. When the car was decelerating, its own momentum drove the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> to provide additional power. This technology was later licensed to other manufacturers, including arch-rival Rolls-Royce.|$|R
5000|$|The First Philips {{machine was}} model number N1500, {{after which the}} format is also known. This had [...] "first generation" [...] {{mechanics}} including magnetic <b>braking</b> <b>servo</b> systems applied to relatively large mains voltage induction motors. The {{outer edge of the}} cabinet was wooden. The power cable was detachable, but used an obscure connector for which replacements are not readily available.|$|R

50|$|Rear springs were 15 inches {{longer than}} in the {{previous}} model. The <b>brakes</b> had <b>servo</b> assistance.|$|R
50|$|Following this spell at Aston Martin, he {{returned}} to Ford in 1995, taking over as director of Service Engineering within the Customer Service Division, his time there being most noticeable for an early television appearance in a combative appearance opposite Anne Robinson on the BBC's Watchdog programme, robustly defending Ford's handling of a safety recall campaign for <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> assist pumps in its diesel car range.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{is often}} used to drive {{auxiliary}} systems on the vehicle. Vacuum-assist <b>brake</b> <b>servos,</b> for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine manifold vacuum to increase pressure on the brakes. Since braking is nearly always accompanied by the closing of the throttle and associated high manifold vacuum, this system is simple and almost foolproof. Vacuum tanks were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{dual circuit}} brake {{system with a}} <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> is used. The front wheels have disc brakes, that are - except for the 518i - internally ventilated. All models with 2.4 l displacement or less have rear drum brakes, while all models with 2.5nbsp;l or more displacement have non internally ventilated rear disc brakes. To prevent the wheels from blocking, BMW equipped the E28 with an anti-lock braking system, although it was an option in some markets.|$|R
50|$|Mechanically, {{this model}} is fitted with a torque {{vectoring}} rear differential, able to send 100% of the torque {{to the left or}} right wheel, and, on the model which debuted in July 2015, a six-speed manual transmission, made by ZF. The braking system uses carbon ceramic rotors, six-pot front and four-pot rear calipers, and auxiliary rear calipers for the parking brake. The electronic stability control and the traditional <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> are combined in a single electromechanical system.|$|R
50|$|Together {{with the}} Giulia 1300 Ti, the GT 1300 Junior pioneered {{the use of}} ATE disc brakes as later fitted {{throughout}} the 105 series, replacing the Dunlop discs on earlier cars. The first few GT 1300 Juniors lacked a <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> and had the low rear wheelarches of the Giulia Sprint GT and Giulia Sprint GTV. From 1967, a servo was fitted as standard, together with higher rear wheelarches as adopted later on the 1750 GTV.|$|R
50|$|When {{owned by}} GEC {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, many (if not the vast majority) of Lincoln {{engineering}} firms did not survive difficult financial conditions. This included Clayton Dewandre, (who made vacuum and air-pressure <b>brake</b> <b>servos</b> and associated equipment for commercial vehicles). W.H.Dorman had been bought by English Electric in 1961 and took over an old R & H factory on Beevor Street. Dormans would be bought by Perkins in 1993, then closed in 1995.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, it was {{discovered}} that failures in a <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> supplied by Parker Hannifin to Boeing for use in their 737 aircraft may have contributed to several incidents, including that of United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, the Mercedes-Benz W112 {{platform}} featured an {{air suspension}} on the 300SE models. The system used a Bosch main valve with two axle valves {{on the front}} and one on the rear. These controlled a cone-shaped air spring on each wheel axle. The system maintained a constant ride height utilizing an air reservoir that was filled by a single-cylinder air compressor powered by the engine. In 1964, the Mercedes-Benz 600 used larger air springs and the compressed air system also powered the <b>brake</b> <b>servo.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{following}} years the types ACL2, BDF1, BDF2 and BDS1 were introduced, and were produced {{until the early}} summer of 1940 when the unexpected speed of the German invasion {{put an end to}} most passenger car production in France. Two changes towards the end of 1937 were the introduction of Renault's newly developed mechanical <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> as well as the removal of one of the two access points for the fuel tank which from now on had to be filled using a single fuel filler on the right hand side of the rear panel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{brake and}} other pedals are {{independent}} of the frame. Beneath the floor boards there is a hand wheel for primary adjustment of the 4-wheel brakes which have enclosed brake drums. The hand brake operates separate shoes in the rear drums and may be adjusted {{from the top of}} the lever. The rear brakes are operated by a single cable which gives compensation and an even pressure to each rear wheel and the front brakes are operated by pull-rods. Unusually for this period and price range there is a <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> motor in the bottom of the gearbox.|$|R
50|$|The <b>brakes,</b> with vacuum <b>servo</b> assistance, were on {{the rear}} wheels only.|$|R
40|$|DE 202006010201 U 1 UPAB: 20070214 NOVELTY - The <b>unit</b> has a <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> (3), {{supported}} movably along {{a longitudinal}} motional trajectory, moved from an initial position {{to a final}} position using an actuator and guided back from the final position to the initial position. Another actuator which is designed {{in the shape of}} retracting spring has two spring ends, where one end in an area of an end section of a support unit and other end in an area of the <b>servo</b> <b>unit</b> are connected. USE - Used for remote locking of fuel tank cap within an area of a motor vehicle, and as control unit for releasing arbitrary kind and development mechanical functional units of arbitrary kind and development. ADVANTAGE - The <b>servo</b> <b>unit,</b> supported movably along a longitudinal motional trajectory, moved from the initial position to the final position using the actuator and guided back from the final position to the initial position, thus enabling to realize non manual operation of the actuator unit. The actuator unit can be designed in a compact manner and can function in a reliable manner, such that the actuator unit is applicable as low cost product for multiple application possibilities. The necessary components of the actuator unit can be scaled and are not subjected to mechanical wear, such that inspite of miniaturized design the manufacturing cost is kept small and reliable operational reliability of the actuator unit is ensured...|$|R
50|$|The FF also {{suffered}} from a design problem, and not one easily cured: the system was set up for a driver in the right hand seat, and no considerations {{had been made to}} making it left-hand drive. In particular, the central transfer case and both propeller shafts protruded into the left-hand seat space. The steering gear and <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> were fitted on the right-hand side, and there was no space for them on the left. By the early 1970s, Jensen's primary markets were in overseas markets where cars were driven on the right hand side of the road (particularly the United States), and the FF could not be sold there.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} the rest of the light car range, the Rapier's front {{suspension}} was re-engineered to replace the half king pin on each side of the car with a sealed for life ball joint. All other suspension joints became either sealed for life or were rubber bushed thereby eliminating every grease point on the car. Gearing was adjusted overall to compensate for the smaller wheels and the front brake discs were reduced in size so that they would fit inside the wheels. A <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> became standard and the spring and damper settings were adjusted to give a softer ride. A new diaphragm clutch and new clutch master cylinder brought lighter and more progressive clutch operation.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{exterior}} the most evident changes were the updated signature Lancia split grille first introduced with the 1979 Delta, the glazed rear buttresses (providing better visibility) and, {{in place of}} the model badging on the tail, a full width brushed aluminium strip. Larger eight-spoke 5,5Jx14" [...] alloy wheels from the Beta were adopted to clear the upsized brake rotors and calipers, and the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> was removed to address the brake lockup issue.In the cabin there was a new three spoke Momo steering wheel {{in place of the}} old two spoke one, as well as revamped trim and fabrics.The engine was revised too: a higher compression ratio, Marelli electronic ignition and new carburettors made for torque gain.|$|R
