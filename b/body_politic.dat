The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: As militarisation of <b>bodies</b> <b>politic</b> {{continues}} apace {{the world}} over, as military organisations again reveal themselves as primary political, {{economic and cultural}} forces in many societies, we argue that {{a new form of}} political economic organisation is emerging: neo-feudal corporatism. Drawing upon Bourdieu, we theorise <b>bodies</b> <b>politic</b> as living habitus. <b>Bodies</b> <b>politic</b> are prepared for war and peace through new mediations, which are also forms of public pedagogy. The process of militarisation requires the generation of new, antagonistic evaluations of other <b>bodies</b> <b>politic.</b> Such evaluations are inculcated by means of new mediations, the movement of meanings across time and space, between histories, places, and cultures. New mediations touch new and different aspects of the body politic: its eyes, its ears, its organs, but they are consistently targeted at the formation of dispositions, the prime movers of action.

25|$|In his {{analysis}} of medieval political theology, The King’s Two Bodies, Ernst Kantorowicz describes medieval kings as containing two bodies: a body natural, and a <b>body</b> <b>politic.</b> The theme of the king's two bodies is pertinent throughout Richard II, from the exile of Bolingbroke to the deposition of King Richard II. The body natural is a mortal body, subject to all the weaknesses of mortal human beings. On the other hand, the <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> is a spiritual body which cannot be affected by mortal infirmities such as disease and old age. These two bodies form one indivisible unit, with the <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> superior to the body natural.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable, sustained, or survivable {{development}} are defined here as distinct "sustainability" constraints on intertemporal distribution, {{in a context}} which ignores uncertainty, environmental, and intratemporal concerns. Such constraints are neither self-contradictory; nor redundant, for they can conflict with maximizing {{the present value of}} utility ("optimality"); nor inferior, since the axioms underlying "optimality" are ethically arbitrary and refuted by empirical psychological data. Axiomatic arguments may clarify but cannot resolve debates about intertemporal concerns. Data suggest that sustainability constraints are not respected, and that intertemporal welfare functions containing a preference for "sustained improvement" may better reflect what <b>bodies</b> <b>politic</b> mean by sustainability. ...|$|R

Neither of the spellings defined a hierarchy among the Habsburg dynastic kingdoms, principalities, duchies, and other <b>bodies</b> <b>politic.</b> The Habsburg monarchs ruled the kingdoms of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia as their Kings. The title Emperor applied to their role as heads of the conglomerate of the mostly German states called the Holy Roman Empire until 1806. The same title, Emperor, came to identify their role as rulers of the newly named Austrian Empire that the Habsburgs attributed so from 11 August 1804.|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} policy failure of Trudeau's first term was the 1969 White Paper on Indians, which was {{promoted}} by new Department of Indian and Northern Affairs minister Jean Chrétien {{as part of}} Trudeau's push for classical liberal participatory democracy. The statement proposed the general assimilation of First Nations into the Canadian <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> through {{the elimination of the}} Indian Act and Indian status, the parcelling of reserve land to private owners, and the elimination of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. The White Paper prompted the first major national mobilization of Indian and Aboriginal activists against the Federal government's proposal, leading to Trudeau setting aside the legislation.|$|E
25|$|Inspired by {{elements}} from outside its ranks, the royal guard {{had sought to}} impose its views upon the <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> by 'pronouncing' against the régime. Challenged by this call of arms, Godoy and his royal patrons found that they had few defenders. The officer corps {{as a whole was}} disgruntled by the failure of reforms to make any difference in its situation, and his orders to resist the French were already widely disobeyed; much of the upper nobility and the Church was hostile; reformist circles had long since lost all faith in Godoy's political credentials; and the common people were in a state of open revolt. As for Fernando, he was seen as a saviour, the reception that he received when he rode into Madrid on 24 March.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{connection}} to this general geographic region, {{it is difficult to}} determine from the Torah the exact boundaries of the tribe, to the extent that it is even uncertain whether Asher even had continuous territory. Sites which according to the Bible were allocated to Asher, and whose locations have since been identified, appear to be a scattered distribution of settlements rather than a compact and well-defined tribal region. Despite appearing to have had good contact with the markets of Phoenicia, Asher appears, throughout its history, to have been fairly disconnected from the other tribes of Israel; additionally it seems to have taken little part in the antagonism portrayed in the Torah between the Canaanites and the other tribes, for example in the war involving Barak and Sisera. Critical scholars generally conclude that Asher consisted of certain clans that were affiliated with portions of the Israelite tribal confederation, but were never incorporated into the <b>body</b> <b>politic.</b>|$|E
50|$|Radical {{deliberation}} {{refers to}} a philosophical view of deliberation inspired {{by the events of}} the student revolution in May 1968. Political theory concerned with radical democracy, particularly that of such theorists as Michel Foucault, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, Jacques Ranciere, and Alain Badiou also focus upon deliberation insofar as the process of engagement between disparate positions create the conditions of possibility for a politics. Notably for these thinkers, the task of radical democracy is always and already unfinalized, subject to a series of changes which occur outside of the conscious influence of any single actor and are instead the discursive effects of the contingent assemblies of larger <b>bodies</b> <b>politic.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} sentence from Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity is {{an instance of}} a false analogy from physical bodies to what are called <b>bodies</b> <b>politic.</b> “As there could be in natural bodies no motion of any thing unless there were some which moveth all things, and continueth immovable; even so in politic societies {{there must be some}} unpunishable, or else no man shall suffer punishment.” There is a double fallacy here, for not only the analogy, but the premise from which it is drawn, is untenable. The notion that there must be something immovable which moves all other things, is the old scholastic error of a primum mobile.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins and}} {{propagation}} of the Riverkeeper movement involve citizen ownership and empowerment. Democracies {{can be assessed}} by how fairly they distribute natural wealth and whether the <b>bodies</b> <b>politic</b> have equal access to it. When government fails to secure these goals, our legal structure offers ways to reassert our claims as citizens. Right-to-know laws such as the Freedom of Information Act afford citizens the power to demand knowledge of government and corporate activity in their communities. If these acts violate environmental laws, they can prosecute polluters {{in the place of}} the U.S. Attorney General under citizen-suit provisions that are part of every major federal environmental statute. These laws give the public democratic rights to regain ownership over their neighborhoods.|$|R
500|$|In 1947, the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans {{the right}} to democratically elect their own governor, which it first {{exercised}} in 1948. The Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, and approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year.

500|$|One of {{the main}} themes in Le Père Goriot is the quest to {{understand}} and ascend society's strata. The Charter of 1814 granted by King Louis XVIII had established a [...] "legal country" [...] which allowed only {{a small group of}} the nation's most wealthy men to vote. Thus, Rastignac's drive to achieve social status is evidence not only of his personal ambition but also of his desire to participate in the <b>body</b> <b>politic.</b> As with Scott's characters, Rastignac epitomizes, in his words and actions, the Zeitgeist in which he lives.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Cromwell (c. 1485–1540) {{also came}} to define Henry's government. Returning to England from the {{continent}} in 1514 or 1515, Cromwell soon entered Wolsey's service. He turned to law, also picking up a good knowledge of the Bible, and was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1524. He became Wolsey's [...] "man of all work". Cromwell, driven in part by his religious beliefs, attempted to reform the <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> of the English government through discussion and consent, and through the vehicle of continuity and not outward change. He was seen by many people as the man they wanted to bring about their shared aims, including Thomas Audley. By 1531, Cromwell and those associated with him were already responsible for the drafting of much legislation. Cromwell's first office {{was that of the}} master of the King's jewels in 1532, from which he began to invigorate the government finances. By this point, Cromwell's power as an efficient administrator in a Council full of politicians exceeded what Wolsey had achieved.|$|E
60|$|You cannot but {{perceive}} in this scheme, {{that it has}} {{a direct}} and immediate tendency to sever France into a variety of republics, and to render them totally independent of each other, without any direct constitutional means of coherence, connection, or subordination, except what may be derived from their acquiescence in the determinations of the general congress of the ambassadors from each independent republic. Such in reality is the National Assembly; and such governments, I admit, do exist in the world, though, in forms infinitely more suitable to the local and habitual circumstances of their people. But such associations, rather than <b>bodies</b> <b>politic,</b> have generally been the effect of necessity, not choice; and I believe the present French power is the very first body of citizens who, having obtained full authority to do with their country what they pleased, have chosen to dissever it in this barbarous manner.|$|R
50|$|His great {{plea for}} toleration {{is based on}} the impossibility of {{erecting}} theology into a demonstrable science. It is impossible all should be of one mind. And what is impossible to be done is not necessary it should be done. Differences of opinion there must be; but heresy is not an error of the understanding but an error of the will. He would submit all minor questions to the reason of the individual member, but he set certain limits to toleration, excluding whatsoever is against the foundation of faith, or contrary to good life and the laws of obedience, or destructive to human society, and the public and just interests of <b>bodies</b> <b>politic.</b> Peace, he thought, might be made if men would not call all opinions by the name of religion, and superstructures by the name of fundamental articles. Of the propositions of sectarian theologians he said that confidence was the first, and the second, and the third part.|$|R
5000|$|Tax protesters also {{cite the}} U.S. Supreme Court case of Butcher's Union Co. v. Crescent City Co. for the {{argument}} that an income tax should not be imposed on labor, sometimes quoting the following language: A monopoly is defined 'to be an institution or allowance from the sovereign power of the state, by grant, commission, or otherwise, to any person or corporation, for the sole buying, selling, making, working, or using of anything whereby any person or persons, <b>bodies</b> <b>politic</b> or corporate, are sought to be restrained of any freedom or liberty they had before or hindered in their lawful trade,' All grants of this kind are void at common law, because they destroy the freedom of trade, discourage labor and industry, restrain persons from getting an honest livelihood, {{and put it in}} the power of the grantees to enhance the price of commodities. They are void because they interfere with the liberty of the individual to pursue a lawful trade or employment.|$|R
500|$|Gay {{publications}} in which The Homosexual Matrix received reviews included The Advocate, {{where it was}} discussed by the novelist George Whitmore, and The <b>Body</b> <b>Politic,</b> where it was criticized by Michael Lynch, who wrote that while initially delighted by the work, he later concluded {{that it is a}} [...] "deceptive book inadequate to its task" [...] that the gay movement should not endorse. In his view, Tripp made many claims without empirical evidence and neglected lesbianism and female sexuality in general. Lynch argued that Tripp's understanding of sexual relations between men and women, and his account of how tension between the sexes creates erotic excitement, were influenced by biological determinism. Lynch found Tripp's discussion of why societies have increased divisions between the sexes interesting, but also poorly worked out. Lynch accepted Tripp's view that sexual orientation depends on learning, but disagreed with the details of his account, and argued that Tripp's theories are [...] "linked to psychoanalytic assumptions." [...] Lynch accused Tripp of seeking to legitimize homosexuality [...] "by making it bland", criticized Whitmore for defending him, and expressed partial agreement with Hendin's review.|$|E
500|$|The Tom Cruise {{video is}} {{referred}} to specifically {{at the start of}} the Anonymous YouTube video posting, and is characterized as a [...] "propaganda video". The video utilizes a synthesized voice and shows floating cloud images using a time lapse method as the speaker addresses the leaders of Scientology directly: [...] "We shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form..." [...] The video goes on to state: [...] "We recognize you as serious opponents, and do not expect our campaign to be completed in a short time frame. However, you will not prevail forever against the angry masses of the <b>body</b> <b>politic.</b> Your choice of methods, your hypocrisy, and the general artlessness of your organization have sounded its death knell. You have nowhere to hide because we are everywhere... We are Anonymous. We are Legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us." [...] By January 25, 2008, only four days after its release, the video had been viewed 800,000 times, and by February 8, 2008 had been viewed over 2million times. Author Warren Ellis called the video [...] "creepy in and of itself" [...] and a [...] "manifesto, declaration of war, sharp political film".|$|E
500|$|Once Lowe {{joined the}} {{permanent}} cast, Chris' role changed into {{more of an}} authority figure concerned with integrity and efficiency, although he continued to maintain his positive attitude and personality. Schur said of this second role: [...] "He doesn’t like frayed ends or controversies [...] he wants the <b>body</b> <b>politic</b> to be as clean-running and organic as his own human body. Part of {{the design of the}} character was to give the other characters a true boss [...] an actual authority figure whose rules and regulations meant they had to toe certain lines, even while his endlessly cheery disposition made it hard to argue with him." [...] As a result, Chris Traeger changed in minor ways once he became a regular character. In his earlier episodes, Chris avoided associating himself with anything negative and constantly made Ben report bad news to people. As city manager in later episodes as a regular, however, Chris started imposing rules or changes around the office that were not popular and seemed less resistant about enforcing them. For example, Chris began to enforce his strict no-dating policy around city hall. Additionally, in the episode [...] "Jerry's Painting", Chris forcefully orders Leslie to destroy a painting when it proves to be controversial, and becomes angry with her when she tries to resist those orders.|$|E
5000|$|Justice Brennan wrote a dissent {{that was}} joined by Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens.
