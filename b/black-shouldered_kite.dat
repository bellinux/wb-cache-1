5|$|<b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> usually hunt singly or in pairs, though {{where food}} is {{plentiful}} they occur in small family groups {{and can be}} loosely gregarious at times of irruptions, with up to 70 birds reported feeding together during a mouse plague. They roost communally, like other Elanus species.|$|R
50|$|Predators {{of young}} jacky dragons are {{numerous}} and can include small mammals, such as feral cats or rats, and other reptiles. Adults face aerial predation from birds such as kookaburras, ravens, <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kites,</b> and Nankeen kestrels. The dragons use visual cues {{such as the}} changing area over time, edge length, shape, and orientation in the recognition of aerial predators.|$|R
500|$|<b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> form monogamous pairs. The {{breeding}} season is usually August to January, but {{is responsive to}} mice populations, and some pairs breed twice in a good season. Both sexes are involved in building the nest, which is a large untidy shallow cup of sticks usually in the foliage {{near the top of}} trees, taking about two weeks to complete the nest-building. The flat nest is built of thin twigs and is around [...] across when newly built, but growing to around [...] across and [...] deep after repeated use. The nest is lined with green leaves and felted fur, though linings of grass and cow dung have also been reported. It is generally located in the canopy of an isolated or exposed tree in open country, elevated [...] or more above the ground. <b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> have been known to use old Australian magpie, crow or raven nests.|$|R
500|$|The <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite</b> (Elanus axillaris), Australian <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite,</b> {{or simply}} Australian kite, {{is a small}} raptor found in open habitat {{throughout}} Australia. It resembles similar species found in Africa, Eurasia and North America, including the black-winged kite, a species that {{has in the past}} also been called [...] "black-shouldered kite".|$|E
500|$|The <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801, as Falco axillaris. Its specific name {{is derived from}} the Latin axilla, meaning [...] "armpit".|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "black-shouldered kite" [...] was {{formerly}} {{used for a}} Eurasian and African species, Elanus caeruleus, with the Australian species, Elanus axillaris, and the North American species, the white-tailed kite Elanus leucurus, treated as subspecies of this. These three Elanus species have comparable plumage patterns and sizes, however, they are now regarded as distinct, and the name black-winged kite is used for E. caeruleus. Modern references to the <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite</b> should therefore unambiguously mean the Australian species, E. axillaris. The Australian <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite</b> {{was formerly}} called E. notatus, {{but it was not}} clear that the name applied to this species alone.|$|E
500|$|They are {{territorial}} {{when food}} is not abundant. The practice of [...] "tail flicking" [...] where, on landing, the tail is flicked up and lowered {{and the movement}} repeated persistently {{is thought to be}} a possible territorial display. <b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> have been observed in aerial combat at the margins of territories, locking talons in a behaviour described as [...] "grappling".|$|R

Both sexes are involved in building the nest, which is a large untidy shallow cup of sticks usually in the foliage {{near the top of}} trees, taking about two weeks to complete the nest-building. The flat nest is built of thin twigs and is around 28 to 38 cm across when newly built, but growing to around 78 cm across and 58 cm deep after repeated use. The nest is lined with green leaves and felted fur, though linings of grass and cow dung have also been reported. It is generally located in the canopy of an isolated or exposed tree in open country, elevated 5 to 20 m or more above the ground. <b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> have been known to use old Australian magpie, crow or raven nests.|$|R
5|$|<b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> form monogamous pairs, {{breeding}} between August and January. The birds {{engage in}} aerial courtship displays which involve high circling flight and ritualised feeding mid-air. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days. Chicks are fully fledged within {{five weeks of}} hatching and can hunt for mice {{within a week of}} leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the home territory.|$|R

500|$|Early naturalist George Shaw {{had called}} it the blue-faced honey-sucker in 1826. Other common names include white-quilled honeyeater, and blue-eye. Its {{propensity}} for feeding on the flowers and fruit of bananas in north Queensland has given it the common name of banana-bird. A local name from Mackay in central Queensland is pandanus-bird, as it is always found around Pandanus palms there. It is called morning-bird from its dawn calls before other birds of the bush. Gympie is a Queensland [...] term. Thomas Watling noted a local indigenous name was der-ro-gang. John Hunter recorded the term gugurruk (pron. [...] "co-gurrock"), but the term was also applied to the <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite</b> (Elanus axillaris). It is called (minha) yeewi, where minha is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', in Pakanh and (inh-)ewelmb in Uw Oykangand and Uw Olkola, where inh- is a qualifier meaning 'meat' or 'animal', in three aboriginal languages of central Cape York Peninsula.|$|E
500|$|Like other elanid kites, black-shouldered kites hunt by {{quartering}} grasslands {{for small}} creatures. This can {{be from a}} perch, but more often by hovering in mid-air. When hunting the kite hovers with its body hanging almost vertically, and its head into the wind. Unlike the Australian kestrel, the black-winged kite shows no obvious sideways movement, even in a strong breeze. One study of a nesting pair noted that the male searched aerially for 82% of the search time. Typically, a kite will hover [...] above a particular spot, peering down intently, sometimes {{for only a few}} seconds, often for a minute or more, then glide swiftly to a new vantage point and hover again. When hunting from a perch, a dead tree is the preferred platform. Like other Elanus kites, The <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite</b> grips a vertical branch with a foot on either side, each one above the other and turned inwards, which enables them to maintain a secure footing on relatively small branches. Though hovering is the most common hunting method, the kites have been observed searching the ground beneath a vantage point for periods of up to an hour.|$|E
5|$|<b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with {{v-shaped}} up-curved wings, the primaries slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|R

40|$|Occasional {{observations}} of <b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>Kites</b> Elanus caeruleus in Europe {{date back to}} the mid- 19 th century, but it was only recorded as a breeding species in the early 1960 s in Portugal and a few years later in neighbouring Spain. This recent colonization, possibly from Africa where the species is abundant, may be due to climate change, land-use changes in southern Europe, or both. As a first step to understanding this range expansion process we have developed a habitat selection model using data from the current strongholds of its European distribution. Comparing the proportion of different habitat types around 46 breeding sites and 45 randomly chosen plots, we have found that the area of cultivated parklands known as dehesas in Spain is a strong predictor of the current distribution range of breeding pairs of <b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>Kites.</b> Specifically, the percentage of dehesas with planted cereal and a low density of trees (i. e. < 7 trees/ha and thus a savannah-like habitat) within the study plots explained 44. 6...|$|R
50|$|Wildflowers of {{the area}} include Douglas irises, Indian paintbrushes, buttercups, lupins, cluster-lilies, California poppies and {{shooting}} stars. Trout, salmon, newts and salamanders inhabit the area's streams, and Bullfrog Pond hosts sunfish, black bass, and bullfrogs. Birds such as wild turkeys, wood ducks, spotted owls, great blue herons, ravens, <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kites,</b> California quail, woodpeckers, hawks, and tyrant-flycatchers are seen there. Native mammals include squirrels, deer, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, skunks, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions. Feral pigs have also been reported.|$|R
5|$|<b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> are {{generally}} silent, {{except in the}} breeding season when their calls, though weak, can be persistent. They primarily utter clear whistled 'chee, chee, chee' calls in flight and while hovering, or a hoarse wheezing 'skree-ah' when perched. The call has been confused {{with that of a}} silver gull. A short high whistle is the primary contact call between a pair, while a harsh scraping call is the most common call used by females and large young, and brooding females call to their young with a deep, soft, frog-like croak.|$|R

25|$|Native fauna {{species have}} been greatly reduced by past {{agricultural}} practices and the introduced rabbit is now common. Eastern bearded dragons, White's skink, eastern brown snake, and sleepy lizard reptile species are seen; a total of twenty {{species have been}} seen within the park. <b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> and nankeen kestrels hunt over the grasslands. red-rumped parrots and crested pigeons are seen feeding {{on the ground and}} wattlebirds, musk lorikeets, noisy miners and honeyeaters in the flowering gums and along creeklines. The park is home to a small population of the worm-like and vulnerable Flinders Ranges worm-lizard (Aprasia pseudopulchella).|$|R
5|$|Each year in {{late summer}} {{thousands}} of black swans and ducks descend on the area as the inland waterways they inhabit dry up. Waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants, oyster catchers and terns are common often year round.

50|$|The 'M' or 'W' on the {{underside}} of its wing, and lack of black wing tips help distinguish it from the <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite.</b> In flight, it beats its wings more slowly and deeply. Finally, the latter species is diurnal, not nocturnal.|$|E
50|$|For {{some recent}} decades, it was lumped with the black-winged kite of Europe and Africa as Elanus caeruleus and was collectively called <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite.</b> More {{recently}} it was {{argued that the}} white-tailed kite differed from the Old World species in size, shape, plumage, and behavior, and that these differences were sufficient to warrant full species status. This argument was accepted by the American Ornithologists' Union, so the white-tailed kite was returned to its original name. Meanwhile, the Old World E. caeruleus is once again called black-winged kite, while the name <b>black-shouldered</b> <b>kite</b> is now reserved for an Australian species, Elanus axillaris, which had also been lumped into E. caeruleus but is now regarded as separate again.|$|E

5|$|<b>Black-shouldered</b> <b>kites</b> live almost {{exclusively}} on mice, and have become a specialist predator of house mice, often following outbreaks of mouse plagues in rural areas. They take other suitably sized creatures when available, including grasshoppers, rats, small reptiles, birds, and even (very rarely) rabbits, but mice and other mouse-sized mammals account for over 90% of their diet. Their influence on mouse populations is probably significant: adults take two or three mice a day each if they can, around a thousand mice a year. On one occasion, a male was observed bringing no less than 14 mice to a nest of well-advanced fledglings within an hour. In another study, a female kite was seen to struggle back to fledglings in the nest with a three-quarters grown rabbit, a heavy load for such a small bird.|$|R
