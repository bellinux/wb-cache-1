The Plan proposed using slot machine revenue to reduce taxes by $1.5 billion (an average 30% decrease for homeowners) and included $687 million in increased education funding. The plan was {{to be paid for}} with a proposed income tax increase from 2.80% to 3.75% plus increased taxes on utilities and beer.

25|$|The {{proposed}} deal eliminated some of {{the spending}} cuts required by the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015. This did not decrease federal spending; instead, by {{reducing the amount of}} spending cuts the government was going to be forced to make by the sequester, it actually increased government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the sequester remained in place. Some Republicans wanted Speaker John Boehner to pursue a temporary measure that would cover the rest of Fiscal Year 2014 at the level set by the sequester – $967 billion, rather than pass this <b>budget</b> <b>deal,</b> which would have $45 billion in additional spending.|$|E

Although Congress tried to negotiate a Continuing resolution to fund the government pending negotiation of the larger budget, it became clear on September30, 2013, that no temporary agreement would be reached. Without an agreed-upon budget from Congress, Burwell as Director was tasked with initiating a federal government shutdown, the first U.S. federal government shutdown in 17 years. Burwell sent a memo advising agencies and executive departments to shut down, including the closing of national parks, visitors' centers, and even the [...] "panda-cam" [...] at the National Zoo. The shutdown lasted 16 days. Once the government reopened, Burwell helped negotiate a two-year <b>budget</b> <b>deal</b> to avoid future shutdowns.|$|E

500|$|When a final {{agreement}} was reached with the Republican legislative leadership, Dayton called a special session of the legislature on July 19. The legislature met on July 20 and passed the budget bills, which were signed the same day by the governor. Most state employees returned to work on July 21, facing a backlog of unfinished work and new problems in many agencies. After the budget was passed, Dayton said he approached Republicans again after meeting with ordinary citizens—who said they wanted government services to resume and did not care how the shutdown was ended—and because he feared a worse <b>budget</b> <b>deal</b> and unease in the DFL legislative minorities. Zellers said when the deal was finalized that in his view it was [...] "a deal {{that we can all}} be disappointed in, but a deal that is done, a budget that was balanced".

2500|$|Residents {{did become}} angry, however, when D.C. Mayor Vincent C. Gray {{announced}} {{a plan in}} June 2012 to build a temporary parking lot on the ground of the Crummell School to accommodate 65 intercity passenger buses while a bus terminal near Union Station was being rebuilt. Area activists claimed {{they had not been}} consulted before the plan was announced, and they objected to the noise, exhaust fumes, and traffic that they said would plague their neighborhood. When Michael Durso, a staff member {{in the office of the}} Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development, met with residents in September 2012, he was verbally assaulted by Ivy City residents. When Mayor Gray declined to reconsider the plan, the citizens sued in D.C. Superior Court. The Washington Post columnist Courtland Milloy argued that Gray's action occurred because Ward 5 council member Harry Thomas, Jr. had recently gone to prison and his successor, Kenyan McDuffie, had only been in office a few months. At trial, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development Victor L. Hoskins admitted that the city did not know what environmental or health laws or regulations it had to meet to relocate the bus parking, and that the cost of the temporary parking lot had never been estimated. Durso testified that at least six sites were considered for the bus parking lot, but only the Ivy City site had the proper zoning, access, and space. D.C. Superior Court Judge Judith N. Macaluso, however, ruled on December 10 that the city had [...] "deliberately disregarded" [...] its own laws requiring local neighborhood consultation and that the city had [...] "evaded environmental screening by mischaracterizing the project" [...] on zoning and business occupancy documents. The injunction was temporary, however, and a series of court hearings occurred over the next two years as the city fought to build the parking lot at the Crummell School. In an attempt to stop the parking lot relocation, Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh and Ward 5's Kenyan Duffie worked to secure $1.925 million ($ in [...] dollars) in the city's 2015 budget to fund a community center at the Crummell School. [...] The <b>budget</b> <b>deal</b> also included $7 million ($ in [...] dollars) to renovate the structure in 2016. The court lifted its injunction in March 2014, after it found that the city was able to justify construction of the bus parking lot at the Crummell School under city and federal health and environmental laws. On April 1, 2014, Gray was defeated in the Democratic primary by D.C. City Council member Muriel Bowser, who went on to win the general election on November 5, 2014. On July 30, 2015, Mayor Bowser announced an end to the city's attempt to put a bus parking lot at the Crummell School. Instead, the city would disperse the buses to parking lots at Buzzard Point, Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium, and at curbside spaces around town.|$|E
