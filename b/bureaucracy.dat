In these works Weber described {{what he saw as}} society's movement towards rationalisation. Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart {{from the rest of the}} world. Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt {{from the}} full-text article: During {{the past several}} decades there has been a {{persistent}} and constant trend in our society that has not gained the prominence it deserves. This trend has been the continuous growth in the autonomy and power of public <b>bureaucracies.</b> The community power literature, for example, has systematically ignored public <b>bureaucracies</b> in its search for the power structure of cities (Aiken and Mott, 1970). The reasons why public <b>bureaucracies</b> have been overlooked by these researchers stem from a number of theoretical and methodological shortcomings that need not concern us here. The point, however, is that we have not regarded public <b>bureaucracies</b> as loci of power in our cities...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{performance}} of government-managed irrigation systems persists globally. This paper argues that addressing performance requires not simply more investment or different policy approaches, but {{reform of the}} <b>bureaucracies</b> responsible for irrigation management. Based on reform experiences in The Philippines, Mexico, Indonesia, and Uzbekistan, we argue that irrigation (policy) reform cannot be treated in isolation from the overall functioning of government <b>bureaucracies</b> and the wider political structure of the states. Understanding {{of how and why}} government <b>bureaucracies</b> shape reform processes and outcomes is crucial to increase the actual significance of reforms. To demonstrate this, the paper links reform processes in the irrigation sector with the wider discourse of bureaucratic reform in the political science, public administration, and organisational science literature. Doing so brings to light the need for systematic comparative research on the organisational characteristic of the irrigation <b>bureaucracies,</b> their bureaucratic identities, and how these are shaped by various segments within the <b>bureaucracies</b> to provide the insights needed to improve irrigation systems performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{last two}} decades of forest policy discussions have been {{dominated}} by calls for sustainable management of forest resources. Consequently, multiple international and domestic policies, supporting sustainable forest management (SFM), have evolved in numerous jurisdictions. Policies in developing countries often rely on foreign donors’ projects, which supplement domestic SFM policy. These policies assign various policy tasks to specific public <b>bureaucracies,</b> who then compete for these very tasks, {{as well as the}} related staff and budgets. Therefore, project and policy task assignment greatly influences bureaucratic power. This article analyzes the distributive effects of SFM policy on power (in terms of coercion, incentives and dominant information) among relevant domestic and foreign donor <b>bureaucracies</b> in Bangladesh. Concepts from power theory, bureaucratic politics theory, and concepts of policy and policy process were combined to analyze 121 Bangladeshi SFM policies from 1992 – 2013, which assign a total of 1012 policy tasks to specific public <b>bureaucracies.</b> Using qualitative content analysis, inferences about power were assigned to specific competing <b>bureaucracies</b> by the totality of SFM policies made. Results identify domestic and foreign <b>bureaucracies</b> whose power distribution benefit most from the SFM policies viz. their competitors. It is concluded that <b>bureaucracies</b> gaining the most power set the limits and directions in designing, implementing and evaluating various elements of any national SFM policies...|$|R
