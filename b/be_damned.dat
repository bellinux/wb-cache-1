5|$|Abum tells another story, {{which he}} {{believes}} shows that mankind no longer needs demonic temptation to <b>be</b> <b>damned.</b> Abum followed an everyman figure called Brock, watching his grindingly repetitive life. Brock visited {{a strip club}} often but without joy, which led Abum to believe he no longer took pleasure from sinning. One day, Abum added an additional irritation to Brock's life, posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket. This was enough to drive Brock to suicide. However, during this time, Abum also encountered Black, who again saw his demonic nature.|$|E
5|$|The disproportion was {{so great}} at parting, {{that it was almost}} impossible, in Drury Lane, to muster up a {{sufficient}} number to take in all the parts of any play; and of them so few were tolerable, that a play must of necessity <b>be</b> <b>damned,</b> that had not extraordinary favour from the audience. No fewer than sixteen (most of the old standing) went away; and with them the very beauty and vigour of the stage; they who were left being for the most part learners, boys and girls, a very unequal match for them that revolted.|$|E
25|$|Another area {{of debate}} is {{the fate of}} the unevangelized (i.e. those who have never had an {{opportunity}} to hear the Christian gospel), those who die in infancy, and the mentally disabled. Some Protestants agree with Augustine that people in these categories will <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> to Hell for original sin, while others believe that God will make an exception in these cases.|$|E

25|$|This work is chiefly {{remarkable}} {{because in}} some places it seems to recommend parents not to bequeath anything to their children, on the plea {{that it is better}} for the children to suffer want in this world than that their parents should <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> in the next (iii. 4). Salvian is very clear on the duty of absolute self-denial in the case of sacred virgins, priests and monks (ii. 8-10).|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of limited atonement is often argued from the theological argument of double jeopardy. In the limited view, Jesus Christ {{has taken the}} penalty of the elect - that Jesus died {{for those who would}} believe, so that those for whom Christ died must be saved and cannot <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> as it would be unjust for God to punish the same sins twice (double jeopardy). If Jesus died for all, they argue, then all must be saved. The penal theory of the atonement is therefore the basis of the necessity for a limited atonement.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, in {{a lawsuit}} against our church, a woman accused my husband and three others of molesting her twenty-five years earlier. She didn’t {{remember}} the alleged “abuses” before her thirties, and then believed she was recovering lost memories. She also imagined that 18 people witnessed the abuse, and she listed them by name. However, none of those named supported her stories of abuse. Montgomery County police investigated and filed no charges. After eighteen months, an independent investigator concluded her accusations likely never happened. But that didn’t spare us from a witch hunt. In the initial months, the accused were labeled child sex offenders {{and the story of}} the abuse, truth <b>be</b> <b>damned,</b> was aggressively promoted in news, radio and social media.|$|E

25|$|As {{in other}} regions of the Maritimes, Miramichi culture is firmly {{grounded}} in the Mi'kmaq, Acadian, English, Scottish, and Irish traditions of the region's founding population, particularly in the fishing, sailing and lumbering industries. Every bend in the rivers, from Push and <b>Be</b> <b>Damned</b> Rapids to the Turnip Patch has a distinctive name. These roots and the lives of their ancestors provided inspiration for the novels of local author David Adams Richards, the tales and folklore of Herb Curtis, and the fiction and non-fiction books of Chatham writer Raymond Fraser. Local young adult author Valerie Sherrard's first historical novel, Three Million Acres of Flame, deals with the 1825 Miramichi Fire, one of the largest recorded land fires in North American history.|$|E
25|$|After this {{there are}} four {{consecutive}} chapters recording or summarising the content of charters. Styr son of Ulf, grants land which he had bought around Darlington in chapter twenty-nine, Snaculf son of Cytel grants Bradbury, Mordon, Sockburn and Girsby in chapter thirty, Bishop Ealdhun grants land to earls Ethred, Northman and Uhtred in chapter thirty-one, while in chapter thirty-two Cnut grants Staindrop with its dependencies. Chapter thirty-three recounts a miracle whereby, after prayers by King Guthred, Cuthbert caused the earth to swallow up a Scottish army which had invaded and sacked the monastery of Lindisfarne. The Historia then closes with its colophon relating that, because of the miracle Guthred had issued a decree of protection for land given to St Cuthbert, and warning that anyone violating the protection and taking land from St Cuthbert will <b>be</b> <b>damned.</b>|$|E
25|$|Without a body to {{be kicked}} or a soul to <b>be</b> <b>damned,</b> a {{corporation}} does not itself suffer penalties administered by courts, but those who stand to lose their investments will. A company will, as a separate person, be the first liable entity for any obligations its directors and employees create on its behalf. If a company {{does not have enough}} assets to pay its debts as they fall due, it will be insolvent - bankrupt. Unless an administrator (someone like an auditing firm partner, usually appointed by creditors on a company's insolvency) is able to rescue the business, shareholders will lose their money, employees will lose their jobs and a liquidator will be appointed to sell off any remaining assets to distribute as much as possible to unpaid creditors. Yet if business remains successful, a company can persist forever, even as the natural people who invest in it and carry out its business change or pass away.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, in Grand Valley {{with the}} promise of the railway, the town began to boom. Regular voyages were made by steam sternwheelers to the city, each {{bringing}} more and more settlers. In the spring of 1881, General Thomas L. Rosser, Chief Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway arrived in Grand Valley. It was Rosser's job to choose the townsites for the railway. Rosser approached Dougald McVicar of Grand Valley and offered him $25,000 for the railway in Grand Valley. McVicar countered with $50,000 to which Rosser replied that “I’ll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> if a town of any kind is ever built here". So instead Rosser crossed the Assiniboine river and built the site of the railway on the high sandy south of the River, two miles west of Grand Valley. So the site was then moved to a site just west of today's current First Street bridge in Brandon. A shanty had been built there by a man named J.D. Adamson, and it was on this quarter section Adamson claimed that Rosser chose as the townsite for the CPR Railway and named Brandon.|$|E

For every sin committed during the mortal life of the dead, another ball is added. Jack attempts to throw Jake curves in an attempt to see a ball drop. If a soul witnesses Jake drop one of the balls, it will <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> to hell. Souls who see Jake successfully complete the act ascend to heaven.|$|E

500|$|The British Royal House faced {{a serious}} problem during the First World War because of its blood ties to the ruling family of Germany, Britain's prime adversary in the war. Before the war, the British royal family had been known as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In 1910, George V became King {{on the death of}} his father, King Edward VII, and {{remained}} king throughout the war. He was the first cousin of the German Kaiser WilhelmII, who came to symbolise all the horrors of the war. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the Duke of Teck, a descendant of the German Royal House of Württemberg. During the war H. G. Wells wrote about Britain's [...] "alien and uninspiring court", and George famously replied: [...] "I may be uninspiring, but I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> if I'm alien." ...|$|E
500|$|Tamara Coniff of Billboard {{magazine}} {{noted that}} the verses of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] resemble those of Aretha Franklin's songs. Tom Breihan commented that Knowles [...] " [...] with force and purpose on the verses". As the song opens, she tells her lover, [...] "I can't let you go", and that she will not allow another woman to take everything she owns, including the chinchilla coats and {{the house on the}} coast. Knowles screams the refrain—"Ring the alarm, I've been doin this too long / But I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> if I see another chick on your arm"—"through a thick fog of distortion", as noted by Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that she chants the lines with grit and urgency, while Breihan wrote that she sings them [...] "with a frantic intensity". Knowles later declares that her relationship is [...] "not the picture perfect movie everyone would assume".|$|E
500|$|William Corder (born 1803) {{was the son}} of a local {{farmer and}} had a {{reputation}} as something of a fraudster and a ladies' man. He was known as [...] "Foxey" [...] at school because of his sly manner. He had fraudulently sold his father's pigs, although his father had settled the matter without involving the law, but Corder had not changed his behaviour. He later obtained money by passing a forged cheque for £93 and he had helped local thief Samuel [...] "Beauty" [...] Smith steal a pig from a neighbouring village. When Smith was questioned by the local constable over the theft, he made a prophetic statement concerning Corder: [...] "I'll <b>be</b> <b>damned</b> if he will not be hung some of these days". Corder had been sent to London in disgrace after his fraudulent sale of the pigs, but he was recalled to Polstead when his brother Thomas drowned attempting to cross a frozen pond. His father and three brothers all died within 18 months of each other and only William remained to run the farm with his mother.|$|E
