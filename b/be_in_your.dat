25|$|Muhyiddin Muhammad b. 'Ali Ibn 'Arabi (or Ibn al-'Arabi) AH 561- AH 638 (July 28, 1165 – November 10, 1240) is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most important Sufi masters, although he never founded any order (tariqa). His writings, especially al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya and Fusus al-hikam, have been studied within all the Sufi orders as the clearest expression of tawhid (Divine Unity), though because of their recondite nature they were often only given to initiates. Later those who followed his teaching became known as the school of wahdat al-wujud (the Oneness of Being). He himself considered his writings to have been divinely inspired. As he expressed the Way to one of his close disciples, his legacy is that 'you should never ever abandon your servant-hood (ʿubudiyya), and that there may never <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> soul a longing for any existing thing'.|$|E

[...] Moore changed her schedule at late notice to participate in filming, and Draper wrote Moore's scene as it was being filmed; Draper quickly created a set that depicted the backstage green room of the talk show, Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Moore and Nat filmed the scene in one take, and Draper was impressed with her son's performance, while saying that Moore's presence added credibility to the project.|$|E
40|$|This {{relative}} clause puzzle concerns a systematic {{and not yet}} understood difference between finite and infinitival relatives in English. Earlier work on the topic (see, for example, Chomsky and Lasnik 1977, Rizzi 1990, Déprez 1995 for discussion) has not yet provided a satisfactory account of the pattern illustrated here. In infinitival subject (1) and non-subject (2) -(3) {{relative clause}}s an overt relative pronoun is excluded. Only the empty operator is possible. (1) a. The man [Op [_ _ to solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *The man [who [_ _ to solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. (2) a. The book [Op [to read _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *The book [which [to read _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. (3) a. A linguist [Op [to work with _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. *A linguist [whom [to work with _ _]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. This restriction does not hold for finite relative clauses. As shown in the (b) -examples below, an overt wh-element can <b>be</b> used <b>in</b> all corresponding finite relative sentences: (4) a. *The man [Op [_ _ should solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office. b. The man [who [_ _ should solve the problem]] <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> office...|$|R

500|$|Meade {{made his}} {{decision}} {{late that night}} in a council of war that included his senior staff officers and corps commanders. The assembled officers agreed that, despite the beating the army took, it was advisable for the army to remain in its present position and to await attack by the enemy, although there was some disagreement about how long to wait if Lee chose not to attack. There {{is some evidence that}} Meade had already decided this issue and was using the meeting not as a formal council of war, but as a way to achieve consensus among officers he had commanded for less than a week. As the meeting broke up, Meade took aside Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, in command of the II Corps, and predicted, [...] "If Lee attacks tomorrow, it will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> front. ... he has made attacks on both our flanks and failed and if he concludes to try it again, it will be on our centre." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Dover Press reissued Goldman's biography, Living My Life, and in 1972, feminist writer Alix Kates Shulman {{issued a}} {{collection}} of Goldman's writing and speeches, Red Emma Speaks. These works brought Goldman's life and writings to a larger audience, {{and she was in}} particular lionized by the women's movement of the late 20th century. In 1973, Shulman was asked by a printer friend for a quotation by Goldman for use on a T-shirt. She sent him the selection from Living My Life about [...] "the right to self-expression, everybody's right to beautiful, radiant things", recounting that she had been admonished [...] "that it did not behoove an agitator to dance". The printer created a statement based on these sentiments that has become one of Goldman's most famous quotations, even though she probably never said or wrote it as such: [...] "If I can't dance I don't want to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> revolution." [...] Variations of this saying have appeared on thousands of T-shirts, buttons, posters, bumper stickers, coffee mugs, hats, and other items.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} was almost uniformly positive. [...] The New York Daily News headline proclaimed [...] "Hair Revival's High Fun". [...] The review praised the daring direction, [...] "colorfully kinetic" [...] choreography and technical {{accomplishments of the}} show, especially the lighting, commening that [...] "as a smile-inducing celebration of life and freedom, [...] highly communicable"; but warning: [...] "If you're seated on the aisle, count on [...] to <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> face or your lap or ... braiding your tresses." [...] The New York Post wrote that the production [...] "has emerged triumphant.... These days, the nation is fixated less on war {{and more on the}} economy. [...] As a result, the scenes that resonate most are the ones in which the kids exultantly reject the rat race." [...] Variety enthused, [...] "Director Diane Paulus and her prodigiously talented cast connect with the material in ways that cut right to the 1967 rock musical's heart, generating tremendous energy that radiates to the rafters. ... What could have been mere nostalgia instead becomes a full-immersion happening. ... If this explosive production doesn't stir something in you, {{it may be time to}} check your pulse." [...] The Boston Globe dissented, saying that the production [...] "felt canned" [...] and [...] "overblown" [...] and that the revival [...] "feels unbearably naive and unforgivably glib".

500|$|The Ionians did however hold {{meetings}} {{to discuss the}} conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: [...] "Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand {{on the edge of a}} razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished." [...] Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh.

I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who you might not have heard from in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she had anyone in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you have to acknowledge that there are people that aren’t with you anymore, so there’s a song that does that.

2500|$|After declaring {{he would}} be [...] "popping in from time to time" [...] afterwards, Sting threw the {{microphone}} down and left the ring. Days after the infamous promo, he was booked for shows in New Japan Pro Wrestling, {{to take part in}} the Japan/U.S. Superstars Tournament, where he defeated Masahiro Chono in the first round, but was eliminated in the second round by Shiro Koshinaka. His last match of 1996 took place on September 23 at the Yokohama Arena, where he and Lex Luger teamed up to defeat Arn Anderson and Steven Regal. It would end up being his last tour of Japan. On the October 21, 1996, edition of Nitro, Sting returned for the first time since the night after Fall Brawl. In a match where the impostor Sting was wrestling Mr. JL, Sting emerged wearing a trench coat and white face paint with black marks around his eyes. He went in the ring and attacked nWo Sting (who was still imitating Sting's old mannerisms at this point) with his new finisher, the Scorpion Death Drop inverted DDT, two jumping elbow drops, a Stinger Splash and a Scorpion Deathlock while the rest of the nWo came to ringside. Rather than intervene, they simply stood by and watched. After Sting was done, Ted DiBiase and Kevin Nash came into the ring and made Sting an offer to join the nWo and get back at WCW for betraying him. Sting, after a pause, first called out the nWo Sting as a [...] "cheap imitation," [...] before telling the nWo, [...] "the real Sting may or may not <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> price range," [...] and then concluded by saying [...] "the only thing that's for sure about Sting is that nothing's for sure". [...] With that, Sting left the ring and would not speak (on mic) on WCW programming again for over a year. After this a silent, almost ghostly Sting, carrying a baseball bat as a weapon, began appearing in the rafters at WCW events and began painting his entire face with black and white corpse paint. Sting's new gimmick was inspired by the 1994 film The Crow. In retaliation, nWo Sting, who was still imitating Borden, began painting his face this way as well. While appearing on a WCW/nWo merchandise special on QVC Sports in late 1999, Borden admitted that Scott Hall had initially suggested the idea of painting his face like the character of Eric Draven from The Crow. Sting maintains aspects of his [...] "Crow" [...] persona to date, occasionally with different designs and use of color of the face paint.|$|E
