2500|$|On 8 September {{she arrived}} in Paris and was shown around; ladies were shocked by her {{masculine}} appearance and demeanor and the unguarded freedom of her conversation. When visiting the ballet with la Grande Mademoiselle, she, as the latter recalls, [...] "surprised me very much â€“ applauding the parts which pleased her, taking God to witness, throwing herself <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> crossing her legs, resting them on the arms of her chair, and assuming other postures, such as I had never seen taken but by Travelin and Jodelet, two famous buffoons... She was in all respects a most extraordinary creature".|$|E
60|$|Sylvia leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> {{and glanced}} appreciatively at the moor.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice sat <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> {{as though}} she had been struck.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pett leaned <b>back</b> faintly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> She felt overcome.|$|R
60|$|My aunt's want of {{interest}} in the proceedings expressed itself by a little weary sigh. She leaned <b>back</b> resignedly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Steerforth, fallen <b>back</b> stiffly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> {{and making}} no sound but a moan, cast her eyes upon {{her with a}} wide stare.|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed at}} him, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> with half-closed eyes.|$|E
60|$|Miss Clopsey, {{left alone}} in the office, sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|She sat <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> and {{regarded}} his pinched and determined visage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had nothing}} {{particular}} to write about; and besides, I always intended {{to come back}} to Pisa and see you," [...] answered Brigida, leaning <b>back</b> luxuriously <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|Katharine {{smiled a}} little weakly. She was <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> but Sir Denis seemed to have {{forgotten}} to release her hand, which she {{made no effort to}} withdraw.|$|R
60|$|When {{the meal}} was finished, Father Agustin kept Walthew talking while Blanca leaned <b>back</b> silently <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> <b>Her</b> look was strained, and once Walthew {{surprised}} her cautious glance at the clock.|$|R
60|$|Lady Carey leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> for {{a moment}} with half-closed eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dowson, past speech, sank <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> {{and stared}} at him.|$|E
60|$|The light {{died out}} of Mrs. Vandemeyer's eyes. She leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Crayford leaned <b>back</b> absently <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> For {{the first}} time since the {{conversation}} had begun, she let a question pass without making a reply. The truth is, Mrs. Crayford was thinking.|$|R
60|$|Then the {{sustaining}} purpose {{seemed to}} die out of her, and she sank <b>back</b> suddenly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> with <b>her</b> face hidden from him. Jordan crossed the little room, and stooping beside her slipped an arm about her.|$|R
6000|$|The stranger's manner was so doggedly {{confident}} that Mrs. Wade sank <b>back</b> tremblingly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> The man put his slouch hat on his knee, twirled it round once or twice, {{and then said}} with the same stubborn deliberation:-- ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pendyce leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> smiling, and {{wrinkling}} her fine, thin nose.|$|E
60|$|The {{lieutenant}} turned towards Nina, who, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> {{watched her}} father steadily.|$|E
60|$|Annabel leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> {{and laughed}} till the tears stood in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Nobody {{disturbed}} {{them and}} the shady room was cool. The smell of heliotrope floated in; one heard the fountain splash and the languid rumble of the surf. Betty leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> revolving <b>chair</b> and Kit lighted a cigarette.|$|R
60|$|Her {{long fingers}} stole into the {{cigarette}} box. She accepted a light {{from him and}} leaned <b>back</b> once more <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Chalk sat <b>back</b> helplessly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> {{and gazed}} {{from her husband}} to Captain Brisket, and from Captain Brisket back to her husband. Captain Brisket, red-faced and confident, sat upright {{on the edge of}} his chair as though {{inviting}} inspection; Mr. Chalk plucked nervously at his fingers. Captain Bowers suddenly broke silence.|$|R
60|$|Both {{departed}} {{to perform}} these behests, and, leaning <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> Aunt Kipp reposed.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Van Brandt leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> {{and covered}} {{her eyes with}} her hands.|$|E
60|$|Miss Jelks leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> with a ladylike sneer {{upon her}} {{expressive}} features.|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{a matter}} of fact, I'm not. Nobody could feel very {{pleasant}} at this temperature; and I'm disappointed--with several things." [...] She leaned <b>back</b> languidly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> {{with an air of}} weariness. [...] "When that happens it's a relief to be disagreeable to anybody who comes along. Besides, you're not in the least entertaining this afternoon." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{an amateur}} concert for a commendable {{purpose in the}} Vancouver opera-house, which, since the {{inhabitants}} of the mountain province do not expect any organized body to take over their individual responsibilities, was a somewhat unusual event, and Miss Barbara Heathcote, who had not as yet found it particularly entertaining, was leaning <b>back</b> languidly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
40|$|Inez S. Wilson, home {{economist}} of the National Livestock and Meat Board, leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> office <b>chair,</b> with {{a characteristic}} twinkle <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eye, and introduced her two right hand men: Miss Florence Plondke, who, among other things, arranges certain WOI talks; and Miss Mildred Bast whose pleasant voice is heard each Wednesday rooming over NBC...|$|R
60|$|Again she was silent. But after {{a moment}} dropped <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> and laughed uneasily.|$|E
60|$|She leant <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> the Doctor {{holding her}} hand, and {{standing}} by her side.|$|E
60|$|As soon as {{her husband}} had gone, Mrs. Tolbridge leaned <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair</b> and laughed quietly.|$|E
60|$|Miss Minerva {{listened in}} silence. It was {{the silence of}} true {{interest}} and sympathy, while Carmina was speaking of her mother. When her lover's name became mingled with the remembrances of her childhood--the change came. Once more, the tell-tale lines began to harden in the governess's face. She lay <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b> <b>Her</b> fingers irritably platted and unplatted {{the edge of her}} black apron.|$|R
60|$|So the old dame {{broke into}} a long poem, slow and dull in the inception, but {{quickening}} as the interest grew, until with darting hands and glowing face she poured forth the verses which told of the emptiness of sordid life, the beauty of heroic death, the high sacredness of love and the bondage of honor. Nigel, with set, still features and brooding eyes, drank in the fiery words, until at last they died upon the old woman's lips and she sank <b>back</b> weary <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|Already {{the terror}} of {{a few hours ago}} seemed to have passed away from the girl who leaned <b>back</b> so lazily <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>chair,</b> {{watching}} the tip of her patent shoe swing backwards and forwards. She could even think of what had happened. Very soon {{she would be able to}} forget it.|$|R
