For evaluation we used 3 indikators: 1. average Power Output - PO - [W] 2. average power output on kg body weight - PO. kg- 1 - [W. kg- 1] 3. complete work - W - [Nm] Method: Testing on swim trainer Biokinetic by tests which simulated free style <b>strokes</b> and <b>butterfly</b> <b>strokes.</b> 10 strokes by free style and butterfly styl, 50 and 100 <b>strokes</b> by <b>butterfly</b> style. Results: Some people lives in mistake about their directionality. Someone think, {{that he is}} better for long distance, and oposit eis true.

25|$|The front crawl or forward crawl, {{also known}} as the Australian crawl or American crawl, is a {{swimming}} stroke usually regarded as the fastest of the four front primary strokes. As such, the front crawl stroke is almost universally used during a freestyle swimming competition, and hence freestyle is used metonymically for the front crawl. It is one of two long axis strokes, the other one being the backstroke. Unlike the backstroke, the <b>butterfly</b> <b>stroke,</b> and the breaststroke, the front crawl is not regulated by the FINA. This style is sometimes referred to as the Australian crawl although this can sometimes refer to a more specific variant of front crawl.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are four}} main strokes used in {{competition}} and recreation swimming: the front crawl, {{also known as}} freestyle, the breaststroke, the backstroke and the butterfly. [...] Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke. In 1873, John Arthur Trudgen introduced the trudgen to Western swimming competitions. [...] The <b>butterfly</b> <b>stroke</b> developed in the 1930s, and was considered {{a variant of the}} breaststroke until accepted as a separate style in 1953. Butterfly is also known as the hardest stroke to many, but it burns the most calories compared to the other 3 strokes.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>butterfly</b> <b>stroke</b> {{has three}} major parts, the pull, the push, and the recovery. These {{can also be}} further subdivided. From the initial position, the arm {{movement}} starts very similarly to the breast stroke. At the beginning the hands sink a little bit down with the palms facing outwards and slightly down at shoulder width, then the hands move out to create a Y. This is called catching the water. The pull movement follows a semicircle with the elbow higher than the hand and the hand pointing towards {{the center of the}} body and downward to form the traditionally taught [...] "keyhole".|$|E

She enjoyed sustained success thereafter, often competing in exhibition and carnival events, including a [...] "swim decathlon" [...] in 1934 before a crowd of 50,000, in which she won every event. By 1935, the New York Times made her favorite in seven of the nine events in the upcoming Nationals, depending on which she chose to compete in. Her best swimming events were the individual medley and the distance events, neither of which were Olympic events in the 1930s. [...] (The medley used only three strokes: the <b>butterfly</b> <b>stroke</b> was not separated from the breaststroke until 1952.) ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is only a}} short {{window for}} {{breathing}} in the butterfly. If this window is missed, swimming becomes very difficult. Optimally, a butterfly swimmer synchronizes the taking of breaths with the undulation {{of the body to}} simplify the breathing process; doing this well requires some attention to <b>butterfly</b> <b>stroke</b> technique. The breathing process begins during the underwater [...] "press" [...] portion of the stroke. As the hands and forearms move underneath the chest, the body will naturally rise toward the surface of the water. With minimum effort, the swimmer can lift the head to fully break the surface. The swimmer breathes in through the mouth. The head goes back in the water after the arms come out of the water as they are swinging forward over the surface of the water. If the head stays out too long, the recovery is hindered. The swimmer breathes out through mouth and nose till the next breath.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1933 Henry Myers swam a <b>butterfly</b> <b>stroke</b> in {{competition}} at the Brooklyn Central YMCA. The butterfly style evolved from the breaststroke. David Armbruster, swimming coach at the University of Iowa, researched the breaststroke, especially considering the problem of drag due to the underwater recovery. In 1934 Armbruster refined a method to bring the arms forward over {{the water in a}} breaststroke. He called this style [...] "butterfly". While the butterfly was difficult, it brought a great improvement in speed. One year later, in 1935, Jack Sieg, a swimmer also from the University of Iowa, developed a kick technique involving swimming on his side and beating his legs in unison, similar to a fish tail, and then modified the technique afterward to swim it face down. He called this style Dolphin fishtail kick. Armbruster and Sieg quickly found that combining these techniques created a very fast swimming style consisting of butterfly arms with two dolphin kicks per cycle. Richard Rhodes claims that Volney Wilson invented the 'Dolphin' after studying fish, and used it to win the 1938 US Olympic Trials, earning him a disqualification.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} {{steps to the}} arm {{movement}}: outsweep, insweep, and recovery. The movement starts with the outsweep. From the streamline position, the palms turn out and the hands separate to slightly past shoulder width. The outsweep {{is followed by the}} insweep, where the hands point down and push the water backwards. The elbows stay in the horizontal plane through the shoulders. The hands push back until approximately the vertical plane through the shoulders. At the end of the insweep the hands come together with facing palms in front of the chest and the elbows are at the side at the body. In the recovery phase, the hands are moved forward again into the initial position under water. The entire arm stroke starts slowly, increases speed to the peak arm movement speed in the insweep phase, and slows down again during recovery. The goal is to produce maximum thrust during the insweep phase, and minimum drag during the recovery phase.Another variant is the underwater pull-down, similar to the push phase of a <b>butterfly</b> <b>stroke.</b> This stroke continues the insweep phase and pushes the hands {{all the way to the}} back to the sides of the hip. This greatly increases the push froAs a variant, it is possible to recover the arms over water. This reduces drag, but requires more power. Some competitive swimmers use this variant in competition.≤ ...|$|E

30|$|SWUMANOID had {{sufficient}} DOF to perform {{not only the}} crawl stroke, but also the back and <b>butterfly</b> <b>strokes.</b> However, it could not perform the swimming motion of the breaststroke due to the following three reasons: (1) the thigh joint only had one DOF, (2) the knee joint could not be as fully flexed as a human’s, (3) and the ankle joint could not be as fully dorsi-flexed as a human’s as well. These points for the lower limbs did not become problems when SWUMANOID performed the flutter kick for the crawl stroke, but did when it performed the breaststroke. Indeed, for the breaststroke, the thigh joints have to possess three DOF since the legs move in a complicated manner. The knee and ankle joints {{also have to be}} fully flexed and dorsi-flexed, respectively, for the recovery position of the legs.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the race {{characteristics}} of the start and turn segments of national and regional level swimmers. In the study, 100 and 200 -m events were analysed during the finals session of the Open Comunidad de Madrid (Spain) tournament. The “individualized-distance” method with two-dimensional direct linear transformation algorithm was used to perform race analyses. National level swimmers obtained faster velocities in all race segments and stroke comparisons,although significant inter-level differences in start velocity were only obtained in half (8 out of 16) of the analysed events. Higher level swimmers also travelled for longer start and turn distances but only in the race segments where the gain of speed was high. This was observed in the turn segments, in the backstroke and <b>butterfly</b> <b>strokes</b> and during the 200 -m breaststroke event, but not in any of the freestyle events. Time improvements due to the appropriate extension of the underwater subsections appeared to be critical for the end race result and should be carefully evaluated by the “individualized-distance” method...|$|R
