5|$|After Banner, Briskin {{returned}} to work at Columbia Pictures, where he began producing for them in 1926, and in 1928 he was given control over 18 of their productions. By 1929, Briskin had risen to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>top</b> executive at the studio, sharing honors with studio head Harry Cohn, in giving the closing address at Columbia's annual sales meeting in July 1929. By the end of 1929, Briskin was the assistant general manager of Columbia, and {{on a visit to}} New York City signed several Broadway playwrights to long-term contracts with the studio, including Elmer Harris, Jo Swerling, and Paul Hervey Fox. Not only was Briskin active in the production office at Columbia, but he also played on Columbia's baseball team, which competed in the Motion Picture Baseball League. It was while working at Columbia that Briskin met Frank Capra. In 1930, Briskin's brother Irving, who he had employed while at Banner, joined him as a producer at Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Following an announcement, in August 2015, that {{tennis player}} Sania Mirza {{was to be}} awarded, a Public-Interest Litigation was filed in the Karnataka High Court. The petitioner, Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha, {{mentioned}} that his performance was ignored by the committee. Girisha claimed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>top</b> contender for the award with 90 points, owing to his silver medal winning act at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the Men's High Jump F42 event. The petition mentioned that the points for Mirza's Grand Slam titles from 2011 until 2015 should not be counted as the events were {{not a part of}} the list of sports events to be considered for the performance evaluation. The court withheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry about the selection process. The Ministry nevertheless presented the award to Mirza on 29 August 2015 amidst the case processing.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} high school at Curie High School in Chicago where he won Naismith and Mr. Basketball USA {{recognition}} as national player of the year. He did not play organized basketball until eighth grade, but by late in his freshman season he became a notable contributor to his high school's varsity team. He was ranked among the top 20 prospects in the national class of 2014 prior to his sophomore season. As a junior, he moved into the top 10 of the national class and was recognized as an All-American.

5|$|Johansen rapidly climbed {{prospect}} charts for the 2010 NHL Draft, {{starting the}} year as a potential second round selection, before rising to 16th among North American skaters when the NHL Central Scouting Bureau (CSB) released its mid-season ranking. Johansen's coach with Penticton noted that, {{as one of the}} younger players of his draft class, his skill was often overlooked. NHL scouts praised his speed, playmaking ability and vision on the ice but believed he needed to show more consistency and physicality. He had been compared to Ottawa Senators centre Jason Spezza, while Johansen had said he tried to model his game after San Jose Sharks centre Joe Thornton. He finished the season as the tenth ranked skater according to Central Scouting and was projected to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>top</b> 20 pick, perhaps as high as top 10. With the fourth overall pick in the 2010 NHL Draft, Johansen was chosen by the Columbus Blue Jackets.|$|E

Ennis helped the new-look Wildcats dominate the NBL with an 8–0 start to the season, a start which ultimately culminated in a 21–7 overall record and a minor premiership.

Despite the Conservatives strengthening in the 2008 election overall, Arrison was unable to defeat Szabo, and Mississauga South was one of the few ridings outside Quebec where the Liberal Party increased the percentage of the vote received from 2006 (albeit very slightly).|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} {{preceding}} the season, Oklahoma was hyped to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>top</b> 5 team and national title contender. They initially were the {{favorite to win}} the Big 12 South. Following the dismissal of OU's returning quarterback Rhett Bomar, many felt the defending national champion Texas Longhorns were now the favorite (the Sooners dropped six spots in the Coaches Poll {{during the first two}} weeks of the season despite winning both of those weeks). The Sooners opened their season 3–2 with a controversial loss to Oregon and a loss to Texas. The Sooners also lost their Heisman-hopeful running back Adrian Peterson during their sixth game to a broken collar bone. Many had written the Sooners off at this point. However, the Sooners won their next seven games while Texas lost their last two and the Sooners became the outright winners of the Big 12 South and faced the Big 12 North winner, Nebraska, in the Big 12 Championship Game. They won that game 21–7 and were given an automatic berth to represent the Big 12 in the Fiesta Bowl.|$|E
25|$|In January 1965, Secretary McNamara {{asked the}} Air Force to {{consider}} a new low-cost tactical fighter design for short-range roles and close air support to replace several types like the F-100 Super Sabre and various light bombers then in service. Two basic designs could fill this role; the Navy favored designs like the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk and LTV A-7 Corsair II, pure attack aircraft, while the Air Force {{was more interested in}} fighters like the Northrop F-5, fighters with a secondary attack capability. The former were more capable in the attack role, while the latter might be less so but could defend themselves. If the Air Force did choose an attack design, maintaining air superiority would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>top</b> priority. The next month, a report on light tactical aircraft suggested the Air Force purchase the F-5 or A-7, and consider a new higher-performance aircraft to ensure its air superiority. This point was reinforced after the loss of two Republic F-105 Thunderchief aircraft to obsolete MiG-15s or MiG-17s on 4 April 1965.|$|E

25|$|The 2013–14 {{season was}} a record-setting {{one for the}} Ducks, but one which began with a 6–1 mauling {{at the hands of}} the Colorado Avalanche, which saw {{respective}} head coaches Bruce Boudreau and Patrick Roy almost come to blows at the game's conclusion. The Ducks responded with seven-straight wins, a run which was repeated and surpassed twice more during the season, including a franchise-record setting 10 consecutive wins from December 6 to 28, 2013. At one point of the season, the Ducks won 18 of 19 games, the longest run of one-loss play in the NHL for 45 years. A 9–1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on January 15 saw Anaheim establish a 20–0–2 record at the Honda Center, which matched the longest season-opening home points streak in 34 years, as well as setting a franchise-record for goals scored in a game (9), and powerplay goals scored in a game (6). Dustin Penner was eventually traded to the Washington Capitals, and prior to the NHL trade deadline, the Ducks acquired veteran defenceman Stephane Robidas from the Dallas Stars. Behind a Hart Trophy-caliber season from club captain Ryan Getzlaf, solid depth scoring, a steady if unspectacular defence and solid goaltending in the form of Jonas Hiller and rookie sensation Frederik Andersen, many felt that the Ducks were primed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>top</b> contender for the Stanley Cup.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} season with the NTDP Jones spent time with both the under 17 and under 18 teams. He served as co-captain of the U-17 team. Jones {{registered}} 21 in 37 game of the NTDP season, which included league play in the United States Hockey League (USHL), plus international play and games against division II and III National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) teams. His 21 points led the team in defense scoring. He continued to serve as co-captain the following season, but slipped to second on the team in defense scoring registering 31 points in 52 total games. After his second season Jones needed to choose whether to play his draft year in the NCAA or with the Silvertips in the WHL. Jones decided that Everett {{was not a good}} fit for him and was expected to attend the University of North Dakota. After being informed that Jones would not play for them the Silvertips traded the rights to talk to Jones to the Portland Winterhawks for a conditional bantam draft pick, but retained his rights. Two weeks later, Portland signed Jones and traded two signed players and the rights for two more players to officially complete the trade for acquiring his rights. While playing for Portland, Jones was projected to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>top</b> selection in the 2013 National Hockey League (NHL) Entry Draft. At the season's mid-way point the NHL Central Scouting ranked Jones as the number one prospect among North American Skaters and the International Scouting Services listed him first overall.|$|E

Despite a bad start suffering a 6–1 mauling {{at the hands of the}} Colorado Avalanche, the Ducks followed the opener with seven-straight wins, a run which was repeated and surpassed twice more during the season, including a franchise-record setting 10 consecutive wins from December 6 to 28, 2013.
