40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the {{coordination}} of order and production policy between buyers and suppliers in supply chains. When a buyer and a supplier of an item work independently, the buyer will place orders based on his economic order quantity (EOQ). However, the <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> EOQ may not lead to an optimal policy for the supplier. It can be shown that a cooperative batching policy can reduce total cost significantly. Should the buyer have the more powerful position to enforce his EOQ on the supplier, then no incentive exists for him to deviate from his EOQ in order to choose a cooperative batching policy. To provide an incentive to order in quantities suitable to the supplier, the supplier could offer a side payment. One critical assumption made throughout in the literature dealing with incentive schemes to influence <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> ordering policy is that the supplier has complete information regarding <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure. However, this assumption is far from realistic. As a consequence, the buyer has no incentive to report truthfully on his cost structure. Moreover there is an incentive to overstate the total relevant cost in order to obtain as high a side payment as possible. This paper provides a bargaining model with asymmetric information about the <b>buyer</b> <b>s</b> cost structure assuming that the buyer has the bargaining power to enforce his EOQ on the supplier in case of a break-down in negotiations. An algorithm for the determination of an optimal set of contracts which are specifically designed for different cost structures of the buyer, assumed by the supplier, will be presented. This algorithm was implemented in a software application, that supports the supplier in determining the optimal set of contracts...|$|R

These results are in contrast to those obtained in the literature that assumes a Markov process with a binary state space. e. g. Battaglini, 2005. I then show that when the sets of possible types in any two adja-cent periods satisfy a certain overlapping condition (which is always satis. ed with a continuum of types), then the dynamics of the optimal mechanism can be signi. cantly simpli. ed by as-suming the shocks are independent over time.

These conditions are satis. ed, for example, {{in the case of an}} AR(1) process, a Brownian motion, but also when shocks have a multiplicative e as it is often the case in. nancial applications. Furthermore, the distortions in the optimal quantities are independent of the distributions of the shocks and, when the <b>buyer.</b> <b>s</b> valuation is additively separable, they are also independent of whether the shocks are transitory or permanent.

40|$|When {{brand equity}} became {{a hot topic}} in the late 80 ’s, the success of one {{industry}} after another shows {{that it has a}} prominent role in the realm of marketing. According to David Aaker, brand equity can be categorised into brand awareness, brand associations, perceived quality, brand loyalty and other proprietary brand assets. The brand equity brings values to both customer and firms. Brand equity, however, cannot be measured in dollars and cents but rather a direct result of how consumers value a brand based on their experiences and perceptions. Therefore, Kevin Keller’s model examines brand equity based on customer perception. In the Malaysian pharmaceutical industry, prescription brands are mainly from innovator companies. However, the innovator brands are not as compelling as the FMCG’s due to the support for generic medications. There are two types of buyers, business-to-business and business-to-consumer buyers. The doctors and pharmacists are the business customers with a unique role where they have deep influence in consumer decision to purchase. Therefore, {{the first part of the}} study is to understand the perceptions of both business customers and consumers towards Aaker’s five brand assets. The fifth brand asset selected is country-of-origin because it is assumed that developed country is preferred to developing country when purchasing prescription drugs. In addition, in the second part of the study, the researcher is interested to find out the roles of corporate and condition brands in prescription branding based on customers’ feedback. The information gathered provides preliminary understandings of the effects of the pharmaceutical companies’ branding and marketing strategies in Malaysian markets. Findings from this study demonstrate that the innovator brands are strong in perceived quality and performance-related associations. Brand awareness, imagery-related associations, brand loyalty and country-of-origin are viewed as less important. The <b>B</b> 2 <b>B</b> <b>buyers</b> are the technical buyers who place performance as the most important factors in their purchase decision. The <b>B</b> 2 C <b>buyers</b> consider doctor’s recommendations as the most important factor. The B 2 C market is divided into brand onscious and brand indifferent segments. The brand equity is weak in the prescription market due to the constraints of healthcare regulations and the unpleasant connotation of disease and treatment. The results also show that corporate branding has a positive role in prescription drugs and condition branding is generally not favoured for common conditions. In conclusion, brand equity can be created and maintained if pharmaceutical companies are able to find ways to communicate their brand to their customers, particularly the <b>B</b> 2 <b>B</b> <b>buyers</b> and brand-conscious consumers. Although this can be difficult, given the regulation and business constraints, it is still possible to build a strong brand. This is largely dependent on the ability of pharmaceutical companies to successfully implement their marketing mix to uncover brand promise that delivers product satisfaction and improved ‘quality of life’...|$|R

American Republicanism presents the primary republican narratives in their American context, providing contemporary lawyers, philosophers, and historians with a window into the attitudes and understandings that animated the Constitution.
