50|$|The first {{priority}} for Fairfax was {{to secure the}} town from outside relief as well as excursions by the trapped men. He ordered the construction of forts to surround the town and sited his siege cannon to fire against the walls. His thinly spread men were soon reinforced when six companies of horse and dragoons arrived and when the Suffolk Trained Bands, who Norwich had expected to join the Royalists, instead joined the Parliamentary side. The Suffolk men were actually more concerned about preventing either side from spreading <b>destruction</b> <b>into</b> <b>their</b> county and in recognition of this Fairfax gave them the task of guarding the bridges across the River Colne {{to the north and}} east. Parliamentarian ships were ordered to blockade the harbour and the river mouth to prevent any re-supply via that route.|$|R
60|$|Many years {{previous}} to {{the opening}} of our tale, it was deemed expedient, by the rulers of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company, to effect, if possible, a reconciliation or treaty of peace between the Muskigon Indians of James's Bay and the Esquimaux of Hudson's Straits. The Muskigons are by no means a warlike race; on the contrary, they are naturally timid, and only plucked up courage to make war on their northern neighbours in consequence of these poor people being destitute of firearms, while themselves were supplied with guns and ammunition by the fur-traders. The Esquimaux, however, are much superior to the Muskigon Indians physically, and would have held their adversaries in light esteem had they met on equal terms, or, indeed, on any terms at all; but the evil was that they never met. The Indians always took them by surprise, and from behind the rocks and bushes sent <b>destruction</b> <b>into</b> <b>their</b> camps with the deadly bullet; while their helpless foes could only reply with the comparatively harmless arrow and spear. Thus the war was in fact an annual raid of murderers. The conceited Muskigons returned to their wigwams in triumph, with bloody scalps hanging at their belts; while the Esquimaux pushed farther <b>into</b> <b>their</b> ice-bound fastnesses, and told their comrades, with lowering brows and heaving bosoms, of the sudden attack, and of the wives and children who had been butchered in cold blood, or led captive to the tents of the cowardly red men.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{advanced}} exergy analysis {{was applied to}} a R 744 booster refrigeration system with parallel compression {{taking into account the}} design external temperatures of 25 C and 35 C, as well as the operating conditions of a conventional European supermarket. The global efficiencies of all the chosen compressors were extrapolated from some manufactures' data and appropriated optimization procedures of the performance of the investigated solution were implemented. According to the results associated with the conventional exergy evaluation, the gas cooler/condenser, the HS (high stage) compressor and the MT (medium temperature) display cabinet exhibited the highest enhancement potential. The further splitting of their corresponding exergy <b>destruction</b> rates <b>into</b> <b>their</b> different parts and the following assessment of the interactions among the components allowed figuring out the real achievable improvements. The avoidable irreversibilities of the HS compressor and that of the MT evaporator were mainly and completely endogenous, respectively. On the other hand, the gas cooler/condenser could be predominantly improved by decreasing the inefficiencies of the MT evaporator. As regards the auxiliary compressor, large enhancements were attainable through the drop in the irreversibilities occurring in the remaining component...|$|R
