5|$|At a temple, which Meera visits as {{her daily}} ritual, Zeenat makes her first contact. Zeenat is {{too afraid to}} tell Meera {{the truth about the}} situation, and she does not reveal who she is or why she has come.

In the process, Zeenat realizes helplessness; this is totally new to her forthright way of thinking. Meera, on the other hand, gets a glimpse of freedom; this brings her out of the shell of the traditions in her haveli and gives her a new perspective on her life.|$|E
40|$|The word “education” {{originated}} from the Latin word e-ducare, meaning “To <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> from within”. This ancient educational philosophy of “bringing out from within” carries through to modern times. One way modern {{colleges and universities}} apply this philosophy is by offering and implementing service opportunities, encouraging students to <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> their underlying skills to help others. Projects created by students’ own initiatives or with student involvement {{are more likely to}} be successful, because the service will <b>bring</b> <b>out</b> students’ underlying talents...|$|R

5|$|In the 1998 storyline {{where he}} fakes dissociative {{identity}} disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also <b>brings</b> <b>out</b> remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E
5|$|When the {{predecessor}} of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu {{by adding the}} Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as Icees, juices, and bottled waters. As the company expanded {{both inside and outside}} the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious beliefs. To generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its products, or <b>brings</b> <b>out</b> completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.|$|E
