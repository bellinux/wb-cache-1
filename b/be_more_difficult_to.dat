5|$|Of {{the many}} {{diseases}} of humans {{that were found}} to be caused by viruses in the 20th century one, smallpox, has been eradicated. The diseases caused by viruses such as HIV and influenza virus have proved to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> control. Other diseases, such as those caused by arboviruses, are presenting new challenges.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more {{defensible}} locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and so that it would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5000|$|Reduced species (often an anion) {{with a more}} {{positive}} cell potential <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> oxidize than reduced species with a more negative cell potential. For example, it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> oxidize sulfate anions {{than it is to}} oxidize bromide anions.|$|R

50|$|The lateral {{tensioner}} has {{the advantage}} that the clutch cover is easier to mount but the disadvantage that it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reach nearby the bar. Tensioners through the clutch cover are easier to operate, but the clutch cover <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> attach.|$|R
5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> obtain a visa when {{compared}} to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem. In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E
5|$|Genital herpes can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{diagnose}} than oral herpes, {{since most}} HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing {{is often used}} to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{negotiated}} {{the release of}} six of the eleven men on the patrol, but {{were not able to}} gain the freedom of their Sierra Leone Army liaison officer and the other men before the West Side Boys' demands became increasingly unrealistic. Negotiators concluded that these were delaying tactics rather than an effort to resolve the crisis; by 9 September, the soldiers had been held for over a fortnight. Fearing that the soldiers would be killed or moved to a location from which it would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> extract them, the British government authorised an assault on the West Side Boys' base, to take place at dawn the following day, 10 September.|$|E

5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E
5|$|The {{protection}} of habitats {{is a necessary}} step in the maintenance of biodiversity because if habitat destruction occurs, the animals and plants reliant on that habitat suffer. Many countries have enacted legislation to protect their wildlife. This may {{take the form of}} the setting up of national parks, forest reserves and wildlife reserves, or it may restrict the activities of humans with the objective of benefiting wildlife. The laws may be designed to protect a particular species or group of species, or the legislation may prohibit such activities as the collecting of bird eggs, the hunting of animals or the removal of plants. A general law on the {{protection of}} habitats may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> implement than a site specific requirement. A concept introduced in the United States in 1973 involves protecting the critical habitat of endangered species, and a similar concept has been incorporated into some Australian legislation.|$|E
25|$|Interstitial duplications of {{chromosome}} 15 can <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> detect on {{a routine}} chromosome analysis but are clearly identifiable using a 15q FISH study. Families should always discuss the results of chromosome and FISH studies with a genetic counselor or other genetics professionals to ensure accurate interpretation.|$|E
50|$|Though {{cognitive}} interviews {{have been}} shown to yield many positive results, this technique is not without its limitations. The most commonly cited problem regarding cognitive interviews is that they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> perform than standard police interviews. Cognitive interviews (CI) <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> conduct than standard interviews (SI) in several ways.|$|R
5000|$|Oxidized species (often a cation) {{with a more}} {{negative}} cell potential <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> reduce than oxidized species with a more positive cell potential.

25|$|Modern cutting {{technology}} {{has allowed the}} development of increasingly complex and hitherto unthinkable shapes, such as stars and butterflies. Their proportions are mostly {{a matter of personal}} preference; however, due to their sharp terminations and diamond's relative fragility, these cuts are more vulnerable to accidental breakage and may therefore <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> insure.|$|E
25|$|There are two double stars {{within the}} {{constellation}} {{which can be}} observed using a small telescope, Gamma Volantis and Epsilon Volantis, along with two galaxies which may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see clearly, NGC 2442 and NGC 2434. The magnitudes of the Gamma Volantis stars are fourth and sixth, and of Epsilon Volantis fourth and eighth.|$|E
25|$|Somewhat similar {{annual reports}} are the Indices of Economic Freedom and the Global Competitiveness Report. They, {{especially}} the later, look at many more {{factors that affect}} economic growth, like inflation and infrastructure. These factors may however be more subjective and diffuse since many are measured using surveys and they may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> change quickly compared to regulations.|$|E

25|$|In 2017, {{the project}} {{announced}} that it had reached the benchmark of only missing 74 melodies of pizmonim from the 'Shir Ushbaha Hallel VeZimrah' pizmonim book. When the project first began, they were missing over 300 pizmonim. The last 74 pizmonim that are still missing will <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> obtain due to the aging population and the general difficulty of those specific pizmonim.|$|E
25|$|Wild silks {{also tend}} to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> dye than silk from the {{cultivated}} silkworm. A technique known as demineralizing allows the mineral layer around the cocoon of wild silk moths to be removed, leaving only variability in color {{as a barrier to}} creating a commercial silk industry based on wild silks in the parts of the world where wild silk moths thrive, such as in Africa and South America.|$|E
25|$|The second legal {{criterion}} is {{that the}} constitution must be rigid. This is important to ensure that constitutional provisions can only be changed by an authority that is higher in status than the ordinary legislative body existing under the Constitution. However, rigidity {{does not mean that}} the Constitution is completely immutable. If the Constitution is static, the nation's political development may be stunted. Instead, rigidity of the Constitution merely contemplates that compared to ordinary legislation, the Constitution should <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> amend.|$|E

25|$|Trauma {{occurs in}} {{approximately}} 5% of all pregnancies, {{and is the}} leading cause of maternal death. Additionally, pregnant women may experience placental abruption, pre-term labor, and uterine rupture. There are diagnostic issues during pregnancy; ionizing radiation has been shown to cause birth defects, although the doses used for typical exams generally are considered safe. Due to normal physiological changes that occur during pregnancy, shock may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> diagnose. Where the woman is more than 23 weeks pregnant, it is recommended that the fetus be monitored for at least four hours by cardiotocography.|$|E
25|$|The Officers of Govboard {{consist of}} the Grand Poobah, the Shama Llama Ding Dong, and the {{annually}} renamed Treasurer, {{as well as}} the office of Secretary, which will also be annually renamed. The names were chosen on the theory that their powers would <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> abuse given such humorous and unlikely titles. The Grand Poohbah roughly corresponds with the position of President, and is responsible for managing external relations. The Shama Llama Ding Dong, with position similar to a Vice President, runs the weekly Govboard meetings and all internal affairs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD exhibit {{what is known}} as overvalued ideas. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be {{uncertain}} whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> do ERP therapy on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the person has an unshakeable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from psychotic disorders.|$|E
