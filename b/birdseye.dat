5|$|However, {{the game}} was still marred by {{technical}} difficulties, so Bob Fitch completely redesigned the Warcraft II engine within two months to ensure {{that many of the}} features desired by the designers, such as the abilities for units to burrow and cloak, could be implemented. Later improvements to the game included pre-rendered sprites and backgrounds, constructed using 3D Studio Max. An isometric in-game view was also adopted, in contrast to Warcraft IIs 3/4s <b>birdseye</b> perspective. In addition, the game utilized high quality music, composed by Blizzard's resident composers, and professional voice actors were hired.|$|E

Before sailing to France, on 27 May 1917, Dodd sent his assistant, Lt. <b>Birdseye</b> B. Lewis, to New York with instructions to round-up qualified candidates for the aviation staff. Among the applicants was auto race car driver, Edward V. Rickenbacker, who was promptly enlisted as a sergeant first class, chauffeur. Upon his arrival in Europe in late 1917, Dodd was appointed lieutenant colonel in the Signal Corps.|$|E

5|$|While blank {{variety is}} the {{defining}} demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another, {{there are some}} shared features spanning Balabushka's fleeting 16-year career. Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight-grained maple, based on Balabushka's belief that a single-direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of curly maple or <b>birdseye</b> maple. He used stainless steel joints and delrin butt caps almost exclusively. A small number of his cues feature ivory joints and ivory butt caps, making them highly valued collector's items. Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish-brown bumper, and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps, with the highly sought after leather wrap a rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer. Unless a different length was specified, Balabushka made all his cues to a standard 57½ inches in length.|$|E

25|$|Frozen food is food {{preserved}} {{by the process}} of freezing. Freezing food is a common method of food preservation which slows both food decay and, by turning water to ice, makes it unavailable for most bacterial growth and slows down most chemical reactions. Clarence <b>Birdseye</b> offered his quick-frozen foods to the public. <b>Birdseye</b> got the idea during fur-trapping expeditions to Labrador in 1912 and 1916, where he saw the natives use freezing to preserve foods.|$|E

50|$|<b>Birdseye's</b> next field assignment, {{off and on}} from 1912 to 1915, was in Labrador in the Dominion of Newfoundland (now part of Canada), {{where he}} became further {{interested}} in food preservation by freezing, especially fast freezing. He was taught by the Inuit how to ice fish under very thick ice. In -40 °C weather, he discovered that the fish he caught froze almost instantly, and, when thawed, tasted fresh. He recognized immediately that the frozen seafood sold in New York was of lower quality than the frozen fish of Labrador, and saw that applying this knowledge would be lucrative. His journals from this period, which record these observations, are held in the Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College.|$|R

You are our heroine, you are our saint, and {{there has never been}} any one like you!" [...] Verena had no glance for Ransom now, and there was neither deprecation nor entreaty in her face. A wave of contrition, of shame, had swept over her--a quick desire to atone for her secret swerving by a renewed recognition of the nobleness of such a life as Miss <b>Birdseye's.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of Freon in the 1920s expanded the refrigerator market during the 1930s {{and provided a}} safer, low-toxicity alternative to previously used refrigerants. Separate freezers became common during the 1940s; the popular term at {{the time for the}} unit was a deep freeze. These devices, or appliances, did not go into mass production for use in the home until after World War II. The 1950s and 1960s saw technical advances like automatic defrosting and automatic ice making. More efficient refrigerators were developed in the 1970s and 1980s, even though environmental issues led to the banning of very effective (Freon) refrigerants. Early refrigerator models (from 1916) had a cold compartment for ice cube trays. From the late 1920s fresh vegetables were successfully processed through freezing by the Postum Company (the forerunner of General Foods), which had acquired the technology when it bought the rights to Clarence <b>Birdseye's</b> successful fresh freezing methods.|$|R
500|$|Born in Scugog Island, Ontario, Frise {{moved to}} Toronto at 19 and found {{illustration}} {{work on the}} Toronto Stars Star Weekly supplement. His left hand was severely injured at the Battle of Vimy Ridge in 1917 during World WarI, but his drawing hand was unhurt, and he continued cartooning at the Star upon his return. [...] In 1919 he began his first weekly comic strip, Life's Little Comedies, which evolved into the rural-centred humorous <b>Birdseye</b> [...] in 1923. [...] He moved to the Montreal Standard in 1947, but as the Star kept publication rights to <b>Birdseye</b> Center, Frise continued it as Juniper Junction with strongly similar characters and situations. [...] Doug Wright took over the strip after Frise's sudden death {{from a heart attack}} in 1948, and it {{went on to become the}} longest-running strip in English-Canadian comics history.|$|E
500|$|Frise was unconcerned {{with the}} resale {{value of his}} {{original}} artwork and pursued little licensing of his work, amongst which included product endorsements, products such as jigsaw puzzles, and a <b>Birdseye</b> Center Cabin Park on Lake Scugog, opened in 1940.

5000|$|On release, Famicom Tsūshin scored Aquanaut's Holiday a 24 out of 40. The game won a Japan Software Award in 1996. Critical {{reception}} {{has been}} mixed. USA magazine Next Generation reviewed {{the game as}} an import prior to its release in North America, commenting that, [...] "Seen from a first-person perspective, AH's exotic sea life and realistic landscapes soon have you believing you really are exploring {{the floor of the}} ocean. And though the gaming aspect is a little on the subtle side, it's enjoyable just swimming around." [...] IGN stated that Aquanaut's Holiday does not truly qualify as a game, but instead [...] "a fun and immersive 3D underwater sim of the most relaxing kind". Shawn Sackenheim of Allgame likewise called the game to be a great stress-reliever and complimented its [...] "beautiful" [...] presentation and [...] "rewarding" [...] gameplay model. Victor Lucas of The Electric Playground agreed that the graphics were mostly impressive, but ultimately found the combination of exploration gameplay and atmospheric music extremely boring. NowGamer was also unimpressed, summarizing, [...] "Unless you’ve got more money than sense, our advice is to save your pennies and spend them on a title that truly pushes the PlayStation to its technical limits without relying on the contents of Captain <b>Birdseye’s</b> pantry." ...|$|R
6000|$|Verena {{recognised}} him; she {{had seen}} him the night before at Miss <b>Birdseye's,</b> and she said to her hostess, [...] "Now I must go--you have got another caller!" [...] It was Verena's belief that in the fashionable world (like Mrs. Farrinder, she thought Miss Chancellor belonged to it--thought that, in standing there, she herself was in it)--in the highest social walks it was the custom of a prior guest to depart when another friend arrived. She had been told at people's doors that she could not be received because the lady of the house had a visitor, and she had retired on these occasions with a feeling of awe much more than a sense of injury. They had not been the portals of fashion, but in this respect, she deemed, they had emulated such bulwarks. Olive Chancellor offered Basil Ransom a greeting which she believed to be consummately lady-like, and which the young man, narrating the scene several months later to Mrs. Luna, whose susceptibilities he did not feel himself obliged to consider (she considered his so little), described by saying that she glared at him. Olive had thought it very possible he would come that day if he was to leave Boston; though she was perfectly mindful that she had given him no encouragement at the moment they separated. If he should not come she should be annoyed, and if he should come she should be furious; she was also sufficiently mindful of that. But she had a foreboding that, of the two grievances, fortune would confer upon her only the less; the only one she had as yet was that he had responded to her letter--a complaint rather wanting in richness. If he came, at any rate, he would be likely to come shortly before dinner, at the same hour as yesterday. He had now anticipated this period considerably, and it seemed to Miss Chancellor that he had taken a base advantage of her, stolen a march upon her privacy. She was startled, disconcerted, but as I have said, she was rigorously lady-like. She was determined not again to be fantastic, as she had been about his coming to Miss <b>Birdseye's.</b> The strange dread associating itself with that was something which, she devoutly trusted, she had felt once for all. She didn't know what he could do to her; he hadn't prevented, on the spot though he was, one of the happiest things that had befallen her for so long--this quick, confident visit of Verena Tarrant. It was only just at the last that he had come in, and Verena must go now; Olive's detaining hand immediately relaxed itself.|$|R
6000|$|Verena Tarrant got up {{and went}} to her father in the middle of the room; Olive Chancellor crossed and resumed her place beside Mrs. Farrinder on the sofa the girl had quitted; and Miss <b>Birdseye's</b> visitors, for the rest, settled {{themselves}} attentively in chairs or leaned against the bare sides of the parlour. Verena took her father's hands, held them for a moment, while she stood before him, not looking at him, with her eyes towards the company; then, after an instant, her mother, rising, pushed forward, with an interesting sigh, the chair on which she had been sitting. Mrs. Tarrant was provided with another seat, and Verena, relinquishing her father's grasp, placed herself in the chair, which Tarrant put in position for her. She sat there with closed eyes, and her father now rested his long, lean hands upon her head. Basil Ransom watched these proceedings with much interest, for the girl amused and pleased him. She had far more colour than any one there, for whatever brightness was to be found in Miss <b>Birdseye's</b> rather faded and dingy human collection had gathered itself into this attractive but ambiguous young person. There was nothing ambiguous, by the way, about her confederate; Ransom simply loathed him, from the moment he opened his mouth; he was intensely familiar--that is, his type was; he was simply the detested carpet-bagger. He was false, cunning, vulgar, ignoble; the cheapest kind of human product. That he should be the father of a delicate, pretty girl, who was apparently clever too, whether she had a gift or no, this was an annoying, disconcerting fact. The white, puffy mother, with the high forehead, in the corner there, looked more like a lady; but if she were one, it was all the more shame to her to have mated with such a varlet, Ransom said to himself, making use, as he did generally, of terms of opprobrium extracted from the older English literature. He had seen Tarrant, or his equivalent, often before; he had [...] "whipped" [...] him, as he believed, controversially, again and again, at political meetings in blighted Southern towns, during the horrible period of reconstruction. If Mrs. Farrinder had looked at Verena Tarrant as if she were a mountebank, there was some excuse for it, inasmuch as the girl made much the same impression on Basil Ransom. He had never seen such an odd mixture of elements; she had the sweetest, most unworldly face, and yet, with it, an air of being on exhibition, of belonging to a troupe, of living in the gaslight, which pervaded even the details of her dress, fashioned evidently with an attempt at the histrionic. If she had produced a pair of castanets or a tambourine, he felt that such accessories would have been quite in keeping.|$|R
