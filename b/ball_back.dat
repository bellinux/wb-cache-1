5|$|Buffalo got the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> {{at their}} own 21-yard line and were only able to advance it to their 34-yard line before punting the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Connecticut. UConn cornerback Jasper Howard {{returned}} the ball 26yards to the Bulls' 41-yard line. The Huskies handed the ball to Donald Brown for five straight running plays, advancing {{the ball to the}} Buffalo 19-yard line as the first quarter clock expired. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, UConn held a 7–3 lead and looked to be in position to score more when the second quarter began.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's post-touchown kickoff, NC State {{began its}} second {{possession}} of the game at its 24-yard line after a short kick return. The NC State's second drive of the game was more successful than its first, but as before, the Wolfpack offense {{ground to a halt}} before penetrating too deeply into Tech territory, and State was forced to punt the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Virginia Tech. The Hokie offense began work at its eight-yard line but went three and out and prepared to punt the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to NC State. Tech punter Tony Romero, kicking from the Tech goal line, had his kick blocked by State defender Derrick Taylor. The ball rolled into the Virginia Tech end zone and was recovered by an NC State's Brian Bulluck for a touchdown. The play and extra point tied the game at 77.|$|E
5|$|In the 33rd minute Tommy Smith {{directed}} a high free kick from the centre circle into the penalty area. From Berti Vogts's defensive header, Emlyn Hughes headed the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> into the Borussia penalty area. Vogts this time could only direct his header sideways towards Toshack. Toshack headed a knockdown to Keegan who volleyed {{in for a}} 2–0 lead.|$|E

50|$|Speed glue is an {{adhesive}} used {{to assemble}} table tennis rackets {{in a manner}} to make them hit <b>balls</b> <b>back</b> with increased speed. It is optional; a person may choose to use regular glue instead. Its use in tournaments is currently disputed due to believed toxicity in some speed glues.|$|R
5|$|Louisville {{received}} the post-field goal kickoff, but again went three and out, punting the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Virginia Tech. Louisville did {{not pick up}} a first down in the third quarter, and Tech began yet another drive as time ran out in the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, Tech narrowed the Louisville lead to 17–13.|$|E
5|$|Navy hit paydirt but {{the referee}} found {{something}} illegal {{and called the}} <b>ball</b> <b>back,</b> much {{to the consternation of}} the Cadet rooters. But on the next play George Hayward kicked a field goal, making the score 14 to 11. Just before the game ended a double pass, Bill Cloke to captain Clarence Stone, carried to ball over the Hopkins goal for the 4 points that won the game.|$|E
5|$|Ohio State {{was unable}} to score and gave the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Texas with 13:24 left in the game. Texas was forced to punt. On the Buckeyes' next {{possession}} they drove from their own 30 to the Texas 33 before settling for a sixth field goal attempt by Huston, this one from 50yards out. Huston missed wide left to leave Ohio State still ahead by sixpoints. Texas took over at their own 33with 5:07 left in the game.|$|E

50|$|Server Immunity: If {{after the}} server throws the balls to two {{different}} players, both players choose to throw their <b>balls</b> <b>back</b> to the server, and the server {{does not make}} the catch, they aren't charged with an out, and get the chance to serve again. If the server does make the catch, play continues as usual.|$|R
5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball off the kickoff {{on their own}} 28-yard line. Losing eightyards on their threeplays, Buffalo once again punted the ball to Connecticut. UConn drove to the Buffalo 25-yard line and attempted a 42-yard field goal; the kick by Dave Teggart was blocked. Buffalo got the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> {{with less than a}} minute left in the quarter and completed twopasses, moving the ball 13yards down the field before the quarter expired. The score remained in Connecticut's favor, 24–20.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut fumbled {{the ball}} for the sixth time on the next possession; this time Donald Brown was {{responsible}} for dropping the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, {{but was unable to}} score, punting to <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E
5|$|England {{then started}} their reply, and Lindwall took the new ball and felt {{pain in his}} groin again after {{delivering}} his first ball to Hutton. Despite this, Lindwall persevered through the pain. Seeing that Lindwall was able to bowl through the pain, Bradman tossed the ball to Miller for the second over to see if Miller could bowl. However, Miller threw the <b>ball</b> <b>back,</b> indicating that his body {{would not be able}} to withstand it. This resulted in media consternation that Bradman and Miller had quarrelled.|$|E

5|$|Navy {{received}} {{the ball from}} Washington and began to throw it erratically. After gaining several yards, Ira McKee threw an interception near midfield. On the next play, Fred Abel threw a long pass to George Wilson, who was tackled on the Navy 20-yard line after gaining 30yards. Washington brought out their placekicker, Leonard Ziel, to kick a 32-yard field goal, which would have won them the game. Ziel kicked the ball about a yard short of the right upright, giving the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Navy with the game still tied. A few plays later the game ended in a 1414 tie.|$|E
5|$|Norwich {{got back}} into the game against Chelsea with a goal from Anthony Pilkington but conceded two late goals to finish 1–3 to the visitors. This was {{followed}} up with a 4–1 away defeat by Arsenal. The home fixture against Cardiff City finished in controversy during when Leroy Fer put the ball {{in the back of the}} net when passing the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to goalkeeper David Marshall. This resulted in a melee in which both Norwich and Cardiff were fined £20,000 by the FA for failing to control their players. The game was also notable with Norwich having 31 shots at goal despite the game finishing as a draw.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} play from scrimmage, Zack Bowman intercepted Manning's pass {{intended}} for Rueben Randle at New York's 36-yard line {{and reached the}} 12-yard line, but Jay Cutler threw an incomplete pass to Brandon Marshall on fourth-and-two, giving the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to the Giants. On the eventual drive for the Giants, Tim Jennings intercepted Manning and scored the first touchdown of the night on a 48-yard interception return. The Giants eventually scored on Brandon Jacobs' 4-yard run after an 80-yard drive. On the Bears' next possession, Marshall scored on a 10-yard touchdown catch, which New York answered with Randle's 37-yard touchdown reception. Afterwards, Marshall caught a 3-yard pass to increase the score to 21–14, which was extended by Robbie Gould's 40-yard field goal with two seconds remaining in the half. On the first possession of the second half, Gould scored on a 52-yarder, his twelfth-consecutive 50+-yard field goal, tying Viking Blair Walsh's record. New York later engineered a 91-yard drive, which ended in Jacobs scoring on a 1-yard run. Jacobs ended the night with 106 rushing yards, his first 100-yard rushing game since week fourteen of 2011. After getting the <b>ball</b> <b>back,</b> the Giants reached the Bears' 35-yard line, but with 1:35 to go, Manning's pass to Brandon Myers was overthrown, and was tipped off his fingers towards Jennings for Manning's third interception of the night. The Bears ran out the clock to claim the victory, snap their two-game losing streak and gave the Giants their first 0–6 start since 1976.|$|E

5|$|Pong is a {{two-dimensional}} sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across {{the left or}} right side of the screen. They can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.|$|E
5|$|Rebound is a two-player sports arcade game {{developed}} by Atari, Inc. and released in February 1974. In the game, two players each control paddles {{on either side}} of a volleyball net, with a ball dropped {{from the top of the}} screen. The players bounce the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> and forth across the net with the goal of scoring points by having the ball reach the bottom or side of the other player's half of the screen, with the trajectory of the ball dependent on where it strikes the paddle. The winner is the first player to reach eleven or fifteen points, depending on the game settings.|$|E
5|$|Tech's {{first drive}} began inauspiciously for the Hokies. Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} {{pass on the}} first Tech play, then was sacked for a four-yard loss. Facing third down, Druckenmiller evaded another sack and connected with Oxendine on a 41-yard pass that picked up a first down and pushed Tech into the Nebraska side of the field. Despite the gain, the Hokies were unable to gain another first down as Oxendine ran for one yard before Druckenmiller threw two successive incomplete passes. Virginia Tech punter Jimmy Kibble kicked the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Nebraska, which returned it to its 15-yard line, and the Nebraska offense returned to the field.|$|E

5|$|The {{second half}} of play began with Virginia Tech {{receiving}} the ball, going three and out, and punting the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Louisville. The Cardinals reciprocated by also going three and out and punting the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Virginia Tech. The Hokies began their second drive of the quarter at their one-yard line. Despite beginning deep in their own end of the field, Virginia Tech mounted a successful drive. Tailback Branden Ore and quarterback Marcus Vick alternated rushes, picking up 18yards and a first down. After Vick was sacked by the Louisville defense, he recovered by throwing a 29-yard pass for another first down. Following the pass, Vick and Ore rushed for six consecutive plays, alternating carries at various intervals. Inside the Louisville red zone, however, the Cardinals' defense stiffened and the Tech offense began to falter. After Tech successfully gained a first down on fourth and one, the Hokies were unable to gain another. Tech kicker Brandon Pace was forced to make his second field goal of the game, this one a 28-yarder, to make the game 17–13 with 2:52 remaining in the quarter. The Tech drive began with 11:17 remaining in the quarter and took eight minutes and 25seconds off the clock.|$|E
5|$|Thomas {{had scored}} {{with just one}} minute and 18 seconds to go {{including}} whatever time the referee may have added due to the goal celebration. An actual 38 seconds were played after the ball was kicked off. Liverpool tried one last attack but Thomas managed to intercept and pass the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to Lukic. The final whistle confirmed Arsenal as champions, with the two sides inseparable on points and goal difference meaning the visitors won the title by virtue of having scored eight more goals than Liverpool throughout the season. Arsenal received the Championship trophy after the match.|$|E
5|$|Warner's {{next two}} years were less fruitful. The 1900 {{football}} team went 6–4–1, losing three games to the Big Four, and the 1901 season was a losing one, with Carlisle posting a 5–7–1 record. The following year, the team posted an improved 8–3 record, when Warner began implementing double (lateral) passes. Carlisle's quarterback Jimmy Johnson would make a lateral pass to the halfback running towards the sideline, bringing the defense {{with him as he}} tossed the <b>ball</b> <b>back</b> to the fast-running Johnson.|$|E
