The use of adequate indexes showed as expected, a high faunistic and <b>biocenotic</b> affinity among all sites of the Natural Reserve. Moreover, the values of trophic leve 1 are analogous to the mean values found by others {{in the province of}} Rome. The biotic diversity is low and this result can be explained with predation of the barn owls over the most anthropizated areas out of the Natural Reserve.

Four contrasting sites characterized by different habitats were sampled for fish. Fish were caught by electrofishing from a boat along a river bank over a distance of 500 m.

The dominant species by number included roach, white bream, pike and perch, while the highest biomass was provided by pike, ide, gibel carp and tench. A comparison of the recorded results with earlier data indicated that the ichthyofauna of the Postomia River is currently represented by a greater number of species, which is partly the result of the appearance of aquaculture species, e. g. gibel carp.

The study, conducted in the years 2001 - 2003, allowed to establish that the number of S. lapponum stands had decreased significantly and that its population size in the confirmed stands in the Polesie National Park was substantially lower than 50 years ago. Salix lapponum was a component of different phytocoenoses, but its highest population size and a high degree of development were noted at the sites with the Betulo-Salicetum repentis and Thelypteridi-Phragmitetum communities. The character of the phytocoenoses in which Salix lapponum occurred in greatest numbers may evidence the wide range of tolerance of downy willow with respect to habitat conditions. There is a probability that not only the changes in its habitat conditions, which were noted over the last half-century, had a significant effect on the reduction in the number of stands and in the population size of this species.

For the first time it has been established, that the synchronous migrations of the epilepic diatomaceous algae in the ground thickness bring to the unification of the processes of the photosynthesis, taking place in the surface photic zone, and the subsequent mitosis in the aphotic zone in the depth of 2 - 2, 5 cm in the thickness of the settlement. The obtained data about the species composition and the quantitative development of the benthos microalgae are important for the evaluation of the productivity of the coastal ecosystems and the monitoring of its state. The offered complex methods of the processing and the quantitative count of the benthos microalgae of the loose grounds can be recommended for use in studying the psammophillous microbenthosAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|Aim. This work is {{an attempt}} to {{concretize}} the concept of "life strategy" of species by identifying the mechanisms of strategies in nature and combine the organismal, population and <b>biocenotic</b> aspects of this phenomenon into a single structure. Discussion. The analysis and summary of the literature sources show that the search for reliable indicators of plant life strategies as well as easily measured and identified adaptive traits and reactions should be carried out at the organismal and population-ontogenetic levels. The choice of life strategy indicators should be made taking into account their role in the maintenance of heterogeneity and the lability of coenopopulations. Among the organismic mechanisms of development of life strategy, providing heterogeneity of coenopopulations, we identified biomorphological, age and dimensional differentiation of species of coenopopulations. To population-ontogenetic mechanisms providing lability coenopopulations, we can also refer adaptive variability of seed production, seed and vegetative reproduction, age, vitality, spatial and biomorphological structures, density and number, state of life of coenopopulations, rhythms of phenological development, etc. These mechanisms are closely interrelated and are the result of the implementation of a genetically fixed biological potential of the species variability, under which it is advisable to consider various forms of polyvariance of species development in ontogenesis as well as variability and flexibility of the plant features. Conclusion. Thus, the life strategy of plant species in nature should be viewed as a holistic, integrated and adaptive response to the impact of environmental factors formed due to the close relationship of its adaptive traits and responses, and determining the means of survival, status and functional role in phytocenosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} glacial {{surfaces}} have received much attention as microbial habitats of diverse photoautotrophic and heterotrophic cells. Supraglacial ecosystems are annually covered and uncovered by snow. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the microbial community response to changing environmental conditions in a transect following the receding snow line on the surface of Ecology Glacier (King George Island, Antarctica). Parameters of surface ice and cryoconite holes included chemical composition of ice and sediment, Bacteria diversity by denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), microbial functional diversity (Biolog Ecoplates), and microbial counts (epifluorescence microscopy, colony forming units - CFU). Data demonstrated profound differences between surface ice and cryoconite holes. Changing environmental factors along the transect influenced composition and abundance of the microbiocenosis in both habitat types. Several parameters correlated positively with distance from the glacier edge, including the cell morphotype Shannon Index, chlorophyll a, nitrogen and seston concentrations. Suspended solids content positively correlated with microbial 2 abundance and diversity. Nitrogen and phosphorus were limiting factors of microbial growth as amounts of organic nitrogen and phosphorus positively correlated with the cell numbers, fission rates and photoautotroph contribution. Our findings indicate that microbial community shows a response in terms of abundance and diversity to exposure of the glacial surface as snow-cover melts. To our knowledge this is the first study to recognize a microbial development pattern on a glacier surface in connection with the receding snow line. This may help better understand variability within supraglacial habitats, correct sampling procedures and inform <b>biocenotic</b> development models...|$|R
