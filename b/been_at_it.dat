500|$|Under {{new head}} coach Red Hickey in 1960, the 49ers adopted the shotgun formation. The first {{implementation}} of the shotgun was in week nine against the Colts, with Brodie at quarterback while Tittle nursed a groin injury. The 49ers scored a season-high thirty points, and with Brodie in the shotgun won three of their last four games to salvage a winning season at 7â€“5. Though conflicted, Tittle decided to get into shape and prepare for the next season. He stated in his 2009 autobiography that at times he thought, [...] "The hell with it. Quit this damned game. You have <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> too long anyway." [...] But then another voice within him would say, [...] "Come back for another year and show them you're still a good QB. Don't let them shotgun you out of football!" [...] However, after the first preseason game of 1961, Hickey informed Tittle he had been traded to the New York Giants.|$|E
500|$|The actors' {{performances}} were praised by several critics. Carman thought McCormack and Messing worked [...] "nicely" [...] together, {{and called the}} supporting cast [...] "an asset". Kay Mcfadden of the Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". Robert Laurence of The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote: [...] "Messing and McCormack play wonderfully together, tossing lines {{back and forth as}} if they'd <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> for years, making their relationship quite believable. Sean Hayes, as the flamboyantly gay Jack, adds to the mix. Jack is flighty, temperamental, good-humored and highly likable." [...] A reviewer for USA Today said {{he thought it would be}} nice to see Will have a [...] "full life of his own", and not just serve as a [...] "love-life adviser" [...] to Grace and Jack. [...] "I know it won't happen soon; NBC is so skittish about the so-called Ellen 'gay show' stigma, it's gone to Herculean lengths to avoid mentioning Will's sexuality. But a grace period can only last so long." ...|$|E
