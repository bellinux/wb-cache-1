5|$|In the {{original}} process, MLB held a four-day-long silent auction during which interested MLB teams submitted sealed bids in U.S. {{dollars to the}} Commissioner's Office. After the allotted four days passed, the Commissioner closed the <b>bidding</b> <b>process</b> and notified the posted player's NPB team of the highest bid amount but not who the bidding team was. The NPB team then had four days to either accept or reject the non-negotiable bid amount.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} {{season of the}} IPL, Ganguly was once again given the {{captaincy}} of KKR, after the team ended at the bottom in the second season. The coach John Buchanan was replaced by Dav Whatmore. In 40 matches and 38 innings for KKR Ganguly scored 1,031runs and took eight wickets. In the fourth season of the IPL he was signed by the Pune Warriors India, after being unsold in initial <b>bidding</b> <b>process</b> and he made 50runs of four matches and three innings.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed at the Brazilian move, Argentina and Chile quickly nullified their 1902 pact {{and sought}} dreadnoughts of their own. Argentina's orders, after a {{drawn-out}} <b>bidding</b> <b>process,</b> {{went to an}} American company, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, while Chile's orders, delayed by the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake, went to Armstrong. Since Brazil's relations with Argentina were warming and the country's economic boom was losing steam, the government negotiated with Armstrong to remove the third dreadnought from the contract, but without success. They borrowed the necessary money, and Armstrong laid down Rio de Janeiros keel in March 1910.|$|E
5|$|Chicago has {{had prior}} {{experience}} with Olympic bids. In 1901, {{the city was}} unanimously chosen by the IOC to stage the 1904 Summer Olympics, but the Games were moved to St. Louis {{to coincide with the}} 1904 World's Fair. Chicago also bid for the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics, without success. Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley visited Beijing – host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics – on May 15, 2006, where he collected information on hosting.

40|$|In {{this age}} of global competition, large cities {{increasingly}} desire the Olympics as a mega-event because of its promises of local economic development, catalysis of urban development projects, and unparalleled standing on the global stage. These incentives outweigh the risks and significant costs of staging the Games. Not only does staging the modern Olympiad call for huge investments of money, time, effort, and other resources, so too does the mere chance of hosting the Games. Cities interested in hosting the Olympics must participate in a rigorous and intense competitive bid procedure before the International Olympic Committee (IOC) selects a host city. The <b>bid</b> <b>process</b> itself {{can be just as}} valuable to a bid city as hosting the actual Games themselves. The Olympic <b>bid</b> <b>process</b> has enormous potential as an imaginative exercise in reimagining the city. However, IOC composition, bid procedure, and common urban power structures all, in varying degrees, place demands upon and threaten this potential. The current Washington D. C. 2012 Olympic bid presents an excellent opportunity for the examination of the city's ability to challenge these limitations. As much about the city of Washington as the Olympic <b>bid</b> <b>process,</b> this thesis uses D. C. 's <b>bid</b> <b>process</b> as a means to display the city's multiplicity. Further, the <b>bid</b> <b>process</b> reveals elite forms of control {{at the same time that}} it serves as an important discussion about the future shape of both the city and the region...|$|R

Through a <b>bidding</b> <b>process,</b> a consortium consisting of GMR Group and Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (MAHB) {{was chosen as the}} holder of the 74% stake. In December 2002, Hyderabad International Airport Ltd (HIAL), later renamed GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL), was created as a special purpose entity, into which the State, AAI and GMR–MAHB placed their stakes.|$|E
5|$|In its 2002 {{evaluation}} of Vancouver's bid during the <b>bidding</b> <b>process</b> for the 2010 Games, the Evaluation Commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) highlighted {{the number and}} quality of existing competition and training facilities {{as one of the}} bid's strengths. Of the competition venues that the bid proposed for use during the Games, six required new construction, with the remainder already built in Vancouver and Whistler. The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (VANOC), which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of facilities for the Games, pledged that all new construction of permanent facilities, whether on public or private land, would be funded by the government.|$|E
5|$|Nine cities {{submitting}} bids to {{host the}} 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics were recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The Committee shortlisted five of them—London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, and Paris—from which London eventually prevailed; thus becoming the first city {{to host the}} Olympic Games for a third time. The <b>bidding</b> <b>process</b> for the 2012 Olympics {{was considered one of}} the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC. Paris was seen by some as the front-runner for much of the campaign, but skillful lobbying by London's supporters and an inspirational final presentation by Sebastian Coe led to the success of its bid.|$|E

However, due to the ongoing bankruptcy case, potential ownership changes in the Coyotes organization, {{and the possibility of}} relocation, the NHL decided to reopen bidding to host the game. In the <b>bidding</b> <b>process,</b> 14 teams made bids for All-Star Games or NHL Drafts for the next three years. Out of all the bids, the NHL chose the Carolina Hurricanes to be the new host team and on April 7, 2010, the announcement was made by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and Hurricanes President and General Manager Jim Rutherford.|$|E

Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive <b>bidding</b> <b>process</b> for digital spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian Olympic Committee (COB) chose Rio de Janeiro as its bidding city to {{host the}} 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, during its Annual Assembly on September 1, 2006.

5|$|The Patterson Post Office {{underwent}} several re-locations {{throughout the}} years. After the Lloyd Lumber Company {{moved to a}} larger building along NY311, the post office occupied the smaller structure; both were situated {{on the east side}} of the New York Central tracks. Residents complained that the new location was inadequate, claiming that parking was insufficient at nearby companies, and that walking along a busy road to reach the post office was dangerous. After a <b>bidding</b> <b>process</b> to determine the future location, the office was again moved to a former car service station along Front Street.|$|E
5|$|Toronto won the <b>bidding</b> <b>process</b> to {{host the}} Pan and Parapan American Games {{by a vote of}} the Pan American Sports Organization on November 6, 2009, at the PASO Session held in Guadalajara, Mexico.

5|$|For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, {{the final}} tournament is rotated between confederations, {{allowing}} only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid {{to host the}} tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South Africa in the vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the <b>bidding</b> <b>process</b> for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, Toronto {{initially}} {{planned to}} gain hosting rights for 2012 {{after losing the}} 2008 Olympics <b>bidding</b> <b>process,</b> but because Vancouver landed the 2010 Winter Olympics, the Canadian city cancelled these plans. In the United States, the city of New York was picked by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) over San Francisco, although several other cities submitted candidatures to become the American candidate for the 2012 Olympics; these included Houston, Washington D.C. (in cooperation with nearby Baltimore), Cincinnati, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Seattle and Tampa (in cooperation with nearby Orlando). Several European cities wanted to follow the likes of London, Madrid, Moscow and Paris, and were thus hopeful to gain their NOC's support. Germany chose Leipzig over Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, and Stuttgart, while in Spain, Seville lost out to Madrid. Other referenced cities were Budapest, Milan, Rome, Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, Oslo and Copenhagen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the month}} after the election, members of the Paris 2012 {{delegation}} argued that the London delegation had violated IOC rules. The key points in the accusations were London 2012's abortive athlete incentive initiative and lobbying by then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair. A public statement by IOC President Jacques Rogge dismissed these accusations, stating that the competition had been fair. Another controversy occurred during the <b>bidding</b> <b>process</b> when an undercover investigation by British television series Panorama revealed a corruption scandal associated with IOC member Ivan Slavkov and Olympic agents, who offered to deliver votes from IOC members to any 2012 Olympic bid in return for financial favours. Still recovering {{from the effects of}} the Salt Lake City scandal, the IOC reacted swiftly and punitively toward the rule-breaking individuals.|$|E
