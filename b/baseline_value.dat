25|$|Impedance {{microbiology}} is a rapid microbiological {{technique used}} to measure the microbial concentration (mainly bacteria but also yeasts) of a sample by monitoring the electrical parameters of the growth medium. It is {{based on the fact that}} bacteria metabolism transforms uncharged (or weakly charged) compounds into highly charged compounds thus changing the growth medium electrical properties. The microbial concentration is estimated on the time required for the monitored electrical parameters to deviate from the initial <b>baseline</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

The rate reached its highest point so far, of about 11 cases per 100,000 in {{the decade of the}} 2000s, approximately 14 years after the accident. From 1989 to 2005, an excess of 4,000 children and adolescent cases of thyroid cancer were observed. Nine of these had died as of 2005, a 99% survival rate.|$|E
2500|$|As of August 2013, {{there have}} been more than 40 {{children}} newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer and other cancers in Fukushima prefecture. 18 of these were diagnosed with thyroid cancer, but these cancers are not attributed to radiation from Fukushima, as similar patterns occurred before the accident in 2006 in Japan, with 1 in 100,000 children per year developing thyroid cancer in that year, that is, this is not higher than the pre-accident rate. While controversial scientist Christopher Busby disagrees, claiming the rate of thyroid cancer in Japan was 0.0 children per 100,000 in 2005, the Japan Cancer Surveillance Research Group showed a thyroid cancer rate of 1.3 per 100,000 children in 2005 based on official cancer cases. As a point of comparison, thyroid cancer incidence rates after the Chernobyl accident of 1986 did not begin to increase above the prior <b>baseline</b> <b>value</b> of about 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per year until 1989 to 1991, 3 to 5 years after the accident in both the adolescent and children age groups.

These changes are compared to the <b>baseline</b> <b>values</b> of BAEP set {{at the beginning of the}} procedure. Objective: Evaluate the appropriate time to set <b>baseline</b> <b>values</b> for BAEPs during MVD for hemifacial spasm and its implications on the alarm criteria. Methods: We retrospectively identified 63 patients who had intraoperative monitoring with BAEP during MVD and compared the latency (Lw-V) and amplitude(Aw-V) of wave-V at baseline (before beginning of the procedure) and at dura-opening (before major manipulation) to the changes in Lw-V and Aw-V of BAEPs when the surgeon was alerted. Results: Higher percentages of alerts were communicated to the surgeon when <b>baseline</b> <b>values</b> were set before the beginning of the procedure when compared to <b>baseline</b> <b>values</b> set before major manipulation. Conclusions: <b>Baseline</b> <b>values</b> should be set before major manipulation rather than the beginning of the case. This information will be valuable in reducing false alarms and unnecessary anxiety during surgery...|$|R

40|$|The {{reproductive}} potential of males {{plays an important}} role in the productivity of captive penaeids. Males present a large variability in their {{reproductive potential}}, and thus the selection of appropriate males for reproduction is highly desirable. The present study compares sperm quality at the beginning of the experiment (<b>baseline</b> <b>values)</b> with variations in sperm quality as a result of consecutive spermatophore regenerations. This was done to evaluate possible predictive criteria for optimal sperm quality based on morphological and biochemical criteria in pond-reared Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei males. Sperm quality was similar between left and right spermatophore. Sperm count and proportion of normal sperm increased by 86 and 65 % (P < 0. 05) respectively, from <b>baseline</b> <b>values</b> to third spermatophore regeneration. Proportion of dead sperm progressively decreased with consecutive regenerations, attaining values 33 % lower by the third regeneration, compared to <b>baseline</b> <b>values.</b> This indicates that no decrease in sperm quality occurs in L. vannamei during consecutive regenerations and that the existing spermatophores at stocking of males should be expelled to have higher sperm quality in regenerated spermatophores. Furthermore, this procedure allows selecting individuals with high baseline sperm quality based on significant correlations between baseline and regenerated sperm quality observed in the present work. <b>Baseline</b> <b>values</b> of glucose concentration in the hemolymph were positively correlated to <b>baseline</b> <b>values</b> of sperm count (r = 03, P < 0. 05). In contrast, <b>baseline</b> <b>values</b> of several lipids in the hemolymph were negatively correlated to several traits of sperm quality at first sampling (<b>baseline</b> <b>values)</b> or at first regeneration. These results are discussed in terms of nutritional requirements of males and of possible predictive criteria of sperm quality...|$|R

50|$|When a beam is {{measured}} with a laser beam profiler, {{the wings of the}} beam profile influence the D4σ value more than the center of the profile since the wings are weighted by the square of its distance, x2, {{from the center of the}} beam. If the beam does not fill more than a third of the beam profiler’s sensor area, then there will be a significant number of pixels at the edges of the sensor that register a small <b>baseline</b> <b>value</b> (the background value). If the <b>baseline</b> <b>value</b> is large or if it is not subtracted out of the image, then the computed D4σ value will be larger than the actual value because the <b>baseline</b> <b>value</b> near the edges of the sensor are weighted in the D4σ integral by x2. Therefore, baseline subtraction is necessary for accurate D4σ measurements. The baseline is easily measured by recording the average value for each pixel when the sensor is not illuminated. The D4σ width, unlike the FWHM and 1/e2 widths, is meaningful for multimodal marginal distributions — that is, beam profiles with multiple peaks — but requires careful subtraction of the baseline for accurate results. The D4σ is the ISO international standard definition for beam width.|$|E
