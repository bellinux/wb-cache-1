50|$|On its bottom, the sump {{contains}} an oil intake {{covered by a}} mesh filter which is connected to an oil pump then to an oil filter outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train. The crankcase contains at least one oil gallery (a conduit inside a crankcase wall) to which oil is introduced from the oil filter. The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the oil gallery. The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver it to the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> All <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> are lubricated this way. A single main bearing may provide oil for 0, 1 or 2 <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings.</b> A similar system {{may be used to}} lubricate the piston, its gudgeon pin and the small end of its connecting rod; in this system, the connecting rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> has a groove around the crankshaft and a drilling connected to the groove which distributes oil from there {{to the bottom of the}} piston and from then to the cylinder.|$|R
2500|$|The A4 {{class had}} {{previously}} {{had problems with}} the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> for the middle cylinder, so the big end was fitted with a [...] "stink bomb" [...] of aniseed oil which would be released if the bearing overheated. Shortly after attaining the record speed, the middle big end did overheat and Mallard had to limp onwards to Peterborough. It then travelled to Doncaster for repair. This had been foreseen by the publicity department, who had many pictures taken for the press, in case Mallard {{did not make it}} back to Kings Cross. The (Edwardian period) Ivatt Atlantic that replaced Mallard at Peterborough was only just in sight when the head of publicity started handing out the pictures.|$|E

5000|$|Bigend Saddle (...) is a snow-covered saddle at the {{southwest}} side of Mount Betty in northern Herbert Range, Queen Maud Mountains. The saddle was traversed in December 1929 by the Byrd Antarctic Expedition geological party under Laurence Gould.

50|$|An {{undercut}} crankshaft {{is a form}} of crankshaft for piston engines, {{where the}} overall length of the crankshaft is shortened by overlapping the main bearings of the crankshaft with the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> of the connecting rods.|$|R
50|$|The engine had its {{cylinders}} cast {{together with}} the upper crankcase and featured a four-bearing crankshaft with counterbalancing weights. The <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were flanged over {{the sides of the}} crankshaft to locate the rods against the crank webs, which reduced engine noise.|$|R
50|$|The <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were {{lubricated}} by jets from an {{oil gallery}} in the crankcase, the oil striking the crankshaft webs which were drilled accordingly. Originally the journal diameter was 1.125"; this was later increased to 1.3125". The three bearing engine (from 1936) used a white metal centre bearing.|$|R

50|$|A {{rectangular}} cross-section aluminium casting holds the five main bearings and the bearings {{for the two}} camshafts. This makes the sump below the crankcase independent and its removal does not disturb the engine's crankshaft or its bearings. Either camshaft can be removed sideways at any time through large doors which also give access to the small rock-levers through which the cams operate the pushrods. Another set of detachable doors on each side gives access to each <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b> The aluminium casting forming the crankcase rests on two cast-steel cradles which firmly hold the engine in the chassis.|$|E
50|$|It had rubber mounted twin GP carburettors, {{inclined}} at 49 degrees, with {{an unusual}} float tank system used rather than float bowls. Plain bearings {{were used for the}} <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> and the centre main bearings. The outer main bearings were rollers. One problem cited for the engine is the use of non parallel valves with conventional rockers.|$|R
50|$|In {{more modern}} practice, the {{crankshaft}} and connecting rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> {{in a modern}} automobile engine are made of a replaceable steel shell, keyed to the bearing caps. The inner surface of the steel shell is plated with a coating of bronze which is in turn coated with {{a thin layer of}} Babbitt metal as the bearing surface.|$|R
50|$|Internal combustions engines require {{lubrication}} {{in operation}} that moving parts slide smoothly over each other. Insufficient lubrication subjects {{the parts of}} the engine to metal-to-metal contact, friction, heat build-up, rapid wear often culminating in parts becoming friction welded together e.g. pistons in their cylinders. <b>Big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> seizing up will sometimes lead to a connecting rod breaking and poking out through the crankcase.|$|R
50|$|Engine {{parts were}} {{recovered}} {{and taken to}} the engine overhauler’s workshops for supervised examination and dismantling. The bearings and other internal engine parts {{were found to be}} in order with no signs of overheating or seizure. The engine crankshaft had broken between the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> of the 6th cylinder and the main bearing in the engine casing at the flywheel end. This break exhibited marks characteristic of a fatigue failure. The torque load on the crankshaft of an engine on full power is at its maximum between the last cylinder and the flywheel, the location of the fracture.|$|E

50|$|Koreyvo, Jumo and Napier Deltic engines {{used one}} piston per {{cylinder}} to expose an intake port, {{and the other}} to expose an exhaust port. Each piston is referred to as either an intake piston or an exhaust piston depending on its function in this regard. This layout gives superior scavenging, as gas flow through the cylinder is axial rather than radial, and simplifies design of the piston crowns. In the Jumo 205 and its variants, the upper crankshaft serves the exhaust pistons, and the lower crankshaft the intake pistons. In designs using multiple cylinder banks, such as the Junkers Jumo 223 and the Deltic, each <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> serves one inlet and one exhaust piston, using a forked connecting rod for the exhaust piston.|$|E
50|$|In 1925, a 500 cc {{version with}} linked {{front and rear}} brakes appeared, and the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> were now fed oil through the {{crankshaft}} pin. The old 350 cc was dropped in 1926. For 1928 Rudge motorcycles were fitted with saddle tanks, and 8-inch internal expanding drum brakes. Stanley Glanfield designed a Rudge for dirt racing, marketed from 1928 as the Glanfield Rudge.|$|R
25|$|The Griffon was {{the first}} Rolls-Royce {{production}} aero engine to use a hollow crankshaft as the means of lubricating the main and <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings,</b> providing a more even distribution of oil to each bearing. In another change from convention, one high efficiency B.T.H-manufactured dual magneto was mounted {{on top of the}} propeller reduction casing; earlier Rolls-Royce designs using twin magnetos mounted {{at the rear of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|Oil {{pressure}} {{is an important}} factor in the longevity of most internal combustion engines. With a forced lubrication system (invented by Frederick Lanchester), oil is picked up by a positive displacement oil pump and forced through oil galleries (passageways) into bearings, such as the main <b>bearings,</b> <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> and camshaft bearings or balance shaft bearings. Other components such as cam lobes and cylinder walls are lubricated by oil jets.|$|R
5000|$|When {{building}} a high-performance engine, great {{attention is paid}} to the connecting rods, eliminating stress risers by such techniques as grinding the edges of the rod to a smooth radius, shot peening to induce compressive surface stresses (to prevent crack initiation), balancing all connecting rod/piston assemblies to the same weight and Magnafluxing to reveal otherwise invisible small cracks which would cause the rod to fail under stress. In addition, great care is taken to torque the connecting rod bolts to the exact value specified; often these bolts must be replaced rather than reused. The big end of the rod is fabricated as a unit and cut or cracked in two to establish precision fit around the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> shell. Therefore, the big end [...] "caps" [...] are not interchangeable between connecting rods, and when re{{building a}}n engine, care must be taken to ensure that the caps of the different connecting rods are not mixed up. Both the connecting rod and its bearing cap are usually embossed with the corresponding position number in the engine block.|$|E

The (Edwardian period) Ivatt Atlantic that replaced Mallard at Peterborough was only just in sight when the head of publicity started handing out the pictures.Stoke Bank has a gradient of between 1:178 and 1:200. Mallard, pulling a dynamometer car and six coaches, topped Stoke Summit at 75 mph and accelerated downhill. The speeds {{at the end of each}} mile (1.6 km) from the summit were recorded as: 87½, 96½, 104, 107, 111½, 116 and 119 mph (141, 155, 167, 172, 179, 187 and 192 km/h); half-mile (800 m) readings after that gave 120¾, 122½, 123, 124¼ and finally 125 mph (194, 197, 198, 200 and 201 km/h). The speed recorded by instruments in the dynamometer car reached a momentary maximum of 126 mph.|$|E
5000|$|On 16 November it {{had been}} planned {{to carry out a}} {{demonstration}} flight for a party of 100 MPs, a scheme that had been suggested by Thomson in the expectation that few would wish {{to take advantage of the}} offer; in the event it was oversubscribed. [...] The weather on the day was unfavorable, and the flight was rescheduled. The weather then cleared, and on the following day R101 slipped the mast at 10:33 am to carry out an endurance trial, scheduled to last at least thirty hours. R101 passed over York and Durham before crossing the coast and flying over the North Sea as far north as Edinburgh, where it turned west towards Glasgow. During the night a series of turning trials were made over the Irish Sea, after which the airship was flown south to fly over Dublin (the home town of R101's Captain, Carmichael Irwin) before returning to Cardington via Anglesey and Chester. After some delay in finding Cardington owing to fog R101 was secured to the mast at 17:14, after a flight lasting 30 hr 41 min. The only technical problem encountered during the flight was with the pump for transferring fuel, which broke down several times, although subsequent examination of the engines showed that one was on the point of suffering a failure of the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b>|$|E

50|$|The engine, carried {{forward from}} the 18 h.p. York model of the Sixteen had {{received}} small improvements which increased the engine's output. The engine benefited from improvements to the 12hp engine found in the new Ascot of 1936. The crankshaft is supported on 4 bearings and the main and <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> are of the shell type. The 1938 season engine benefited from higher compression, bigger valves and an aluminium cylinder head with thermostat fitted. These often cracked upon removal.|$|R
50|$|Soon after {{entering}} service, problems were experienced with failing connecting rods, <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> breaking {{up as well}} as cracks developing in the motion girder of the Alligator crossheads. After investigations by SAR engineers with assistance from the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), the crossheads, slide bars and coupling rods were modified. The crossheads were converted to the multiple-bearing type with single guide bars while the three independent coupling rods were replaced with the more conventional single coupling rod with knuckle joints.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{a number}} of issues with the Gresley gear. Because the {{conjugation}} apparatus was mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the valve spindles from the valve gear, as the valve spindles lengthened with the heat of steam in the cylinders the valve timing would be affected, and the gear would need to be removed before it was possible to remove valves for maintenance. However, the B17 Class [...] "Footballer"/"Sandringham" [...] 4-6-0s avoided this particular problem by being designed with the conjugated gear behind, rather than in front of, the cylinders. The main difficulty with this valve gear was that at high speeds, inertial forces caused the long conjugating lever to bend or [...] "whip". This had the effect of causing the middle cylinder to operate at a longer cutoff than the outer cylinders, therefore producing a disproportionate share of the total power output, leading to increased wear of the middle big end. Sustained high speed running could sometimes cause the big end to wear rapidly enough that the increased travel afforded to the middle piston by the increased play in the bearing was enough to knock the ends off the middle cylinder. This happened during the 113 mph run of [...] "Silver Fox". Although the problem could be contained in a peacetime environment with regular maintenance and inspections, it proved to be poorly suited to the rigors of heavy running and low maintenance levels of World War II. This gave rise to big-end problems on the centre cylinder connecting rod on the famous A4 class of streamlined Pacifics and many of these locomotives were fitted with a reduced diameter piston and had the inside cylinder sleeved down as a temporary measure. It should be noted that LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard suffered centre cylinder big-end damage (indicated to the driver by the fracture of a [...] "stink bomb" [...] attached to the bearing, which fractures during overheating of the white metal) during its world record run and was forced to limp back to its depot for repairs afterwards. Gresley's successor at the LNER, Edward Thompson, was critical of this particular valve gear. As well as introducing new two-cylinder designs, he set about rebuilding Gresley locomotives with separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear for each cylinder.Under later British Railways ownership, the application of former Great Western Railway workshop practices for precise alignment of the valve gear and in the manufacture and lubrication of the inside <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> effectively solved the problems.|$|E

The result showed the stress analysis of connecting rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing.</b> The purpose {{is to provide a}} theoretical basis for the actual conditions of connecting rod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing,</b> and to improve the design of the crankshaft structure...|$|E
40|$|The conrod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} components of internal combustion engines; it is usually subjected to high dynamic loads and high sliding velocities between contacting surfaces are often involved. Therefore, the tribological behaviour of the conrod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> is often one of the key elements to engine reliability, and it has been investigated both theoretically and experimentally in several contributions in the pertinent literature [1]. With the ever-increasing quest to improve engine performance, and the consequent increase of the rotational speed and combustion/inertial loads, the cavitation of the lubricant used in conrod big end bearings may play a crucial role in the assessment of bearing durability. To overcome problems related to film cavitation, palliatives such as the reduction of the clearance between the components, the increase of the oil supply pressure and/or the use of harder coating materials have been commonly adopted. However, such simple adjustments do not always represent a valid solution; further investigations are required in order to avoid cavitation damage occurrence. The cavitation damage has been studied for more than a century both theoretically [2 - 5] and experimentally [6, 7], and many attempts have been made to predict or measure the pressure spikes developing in the cavitated areas due to bubble collapse. Although a universally accepted theory seems not to exist, it is clear that the cavitation damage occurs due to the rapid and violent collapse of the vapour bubbles in the proximity of a solid boundary. The aim of the present work is the preliminary evaluation of the damaging effect of the cavitation in a conrod <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearing</b> via elasto-hydrodinamic numerical analyses...|$|E
50|$|Oil {{is drawn}} from the sump by the oil pump and {{delivered}} to the three inner main bearings and to the other bearings within the crank chamber. Oil is led into {{the centre of the}} crankpins by oil scoops which lubricate the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> from inside. The <b>end</b> main <b>bearings</b> and each of the four cylinders receive measured doses of oil through a mechanical automatic lubricator. This lubricator, driven by chain, contains positive pumps to force the oil through each of six feed-pipes. Mounted on the dashboard the lubricator's sight glasses give visual confirmation oil is circulating.|$|R
50|$|A tunnel crankcase, tunnel {{crankshaft}} or disc-webbed crankshaft {{engine is}} a diesel engine where the crankshaft is {{designed so that}} the main bearings (the bearings that support the crankshaft within the crankcase) are enlarged in diameter, such {{that they are now}} larger than the crank webs (the radial arms that link the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> to the main bearings). They thus form the largest diameter of any part of the crankshaft. Rather than a conventional crankcase that has webs across it to support the narrow bearings of a conventional crankcase, the crankcase now has a large tunnel through it, hence the name.|$|R
50|$|When {{describing}} a crankshaft design, {{the number of}} main bearings is generally quoted, {{as the number of}} crank pins is determined by the engine configuration. For example, a crankshaft for an inline six engine will be described as three bearing or four bearing depending on its number of main bearings; The crank pins are not counted in this description. Similarly, when speaking of a crankshaft, the journals are the main bearing journals only. The crank pins are not normally called journals although they form the centre shafts of the <b>big</b> <b>end</b> <b>bearings</b> and are therefore journals in the more general sense.|$|R
