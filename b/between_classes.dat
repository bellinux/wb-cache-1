Hamer {{was interested in the}} film, and thought it an interesting project with possibilities of using the English language in a unique way in the film. Filming took place from September 1948 at Leeds Castle and other locations in Kent, and at Ealing Studios. The themes of class and sexual repression run through the film, particularly love <b>between</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They {{would have a}} strained relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior.

5|$|The family's {{problems}} are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang's only {{pair of shoes}} after taking them to be repaired.

The Chew siblings are frustrated and rendered helpless by the situation until their father inspires Kiat Kun to share his shoes with his sister, trading off <b>between</b> <b>classes</b> so they can both attend school. Unfortunately, this plan brings additional problems: Seow Fang is chastised for wearing oversized shoes to school, while Kiat Kun is repeatedly late as he must wait for his sister to exchange shoes with him.|$|E
5|$|Aggrieved {{persons who}} cannot avail {{themselves}} of the protection afforded by Article 12(2) may try to argue {{that they are a}} member of a group defined by a law in a way that violates Article 12(1). The rational nexus test, also known as the doctrine of reasonable classification, is a three-stage test formulated by the courts to determine if the manner in which a law classifies a group of persons is discriminatory. The equality guaranteed by the provision is a relative and not an absolute concept; it does not require that all persons are treated alike, but rather that all persons in like situations should be treated alike. Consequently, a law that differentiates <b>between</b> <b>classes</b> of persons is valid and constitutional provided that there is some difference in circumstances, and the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the legislative object of the law. If there is no such relationship, the difference is discriminatory and the impugned legislation is unconstitutional and invalid.|$|E

It is argued that these results, especially the differential effects for different groups of children, could have important implications for educational policy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) is {{a linear}} {{solution}} for classification of two classes. In this paper, we propose a variant LDA method for multi-class problem which redefines the <b>between</b> <b>class</b> and within class scatter matrices by incorporating a weight function {{into each of}} them. The aim is to separate classes {{as much as possible}} in a situation that one class is well separated from other classes, incidentally, that class must have a little influence on classification. It has been suggested to alleviate influence of classes that are well separated by adding a weight into <b>between</b> <b>class</b> scatter matrix and within class scatter matrix. To obtain a simple and effective weight function, ordinary LDA <b>between</b> every two <b>classes</b> has been used in order to find Fisher discrimination value and passed it as an input into two weight functions and redefined <b>between</b> <b>class</b> and within class scatter matrices. Experimental results showed that our new LDA method improved classification rate, on glass, iris and wine datasets, in comparison to different versions of LDA. Keywords—Discriminant vectors, weighted LDA, uncorrelation, principle components, Fisher-face method, Bootstarp method. ...|$|R
