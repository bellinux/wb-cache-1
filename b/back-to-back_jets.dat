50|$|Jet {{quenching}} {{was first}} observed at RHIC {{by measuring the}} yields of hadrons with high transverse momentum. These particles are produced via fragmentation of energetic partons. The yields of these high-pT particles in central nucleus-nucleus collisions {{were found to be}} a factor of five lower than expected from the measurements in proton-proton reactions. ALICE has recently published the measurement of charged particles in central heavy-ion collisions at the LHC. As at RHIC, the production of high-pT hadrons at the LHC is strongly suppressed. However, the observations at the LHC show qualitatively new features. The observation from ALICE is consistent with reports from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations on direct evidence for parton energy loss within heavy-ion collisions using fully reconstructed <b>back-to-back</b> <b>jets</b> of particles associated with hard parton scatterings. The latter two experiments have shown a strong energy imbalance between the jet and its recoiling partner (G Aad et al. 2010 and CMS collaboration 2011). This imbalance is thought to arise because one of the jets traversed the hot and dense matter, transferring a substantial fraction of its energy to the medium {{in a way that is}} not recovered by the reconstruction of the jets.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to provide a}} high level {{software}} framework for detecting large problems with the ATLAS detector at the LHC and estimate the jet resolution from the f irst data. The result was the program DiJet, written in C++ by Kent Olav Skjei and Thomas Burgess. DiJet can be run both as a program within Athena (ATLAS software framework) or as a script in AthenaROOTAccess. We have looked at and compared several variables for <b>back-to-back</b> <b>jets</b> using data sets with Monte Carlo dijets, Monte Carlo top and the simulated FDR 2 data. Dijets were chosen due to the high cross section expected at the LHC. It became clear that for real data, one will need to review the dijet selection criteria in order to supress multijet background. DiJet also reconstruct the W mass as a method for estimating hadron resolution. This method requires more data than methods for <b>back-to-back</b> <b>jets</b> do, and was not useful for FDR 2 data. However, based on Monte Carlo dijet and top events we were able to compare jet resolution estimates for the methods for <b>back-to-back</b> <b>jets</b> and the method based on the W mass. As expected, these variables seem to be related. In connection with the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>jets</b> we saw a certain η dependence of transverse energy. The last variables we looked at were missing transverse energy and the vectorial sum over jet momenta. From the latter results, it became apparent that missing transverse energy contains more than just the sum over jet momenta. And it also became clear that the jet reconstruction algorithms themselves create some false missing transverse energy. The position of bad eta and phi regions were found by looking at profile plots of these variables. Based on this we decided to only look at the region - 3 ≤ |η | ≤ 3 due to low statistics in high |η |. We have seen that the methods for estimating jet resolution in this thesis gives half the value of the mass resolution of particles decaying into jets. Based on the results, we seem to have found an asymmetry in ϕ in the results from the jet reconstruction. We did not have the opportunity to investigate the cause of this asymmetry, due to lack of time. The original objective of this thesis was to look at the Express Stream. This {{turned out not to be}} possible due to the decision of not making the Express Stream generally available. In addition, this thesis has been affected by the delay of the LHC schedule, changes in the policy concerning streaming and evolution of the ATLAS software frameworks.

With parameters in the model determined previously from fitting the measured multiplicity density of mid-pseudorapidity charged particles in central collisions and their elliptic flow in mid-central collisions, the calculated higher-order anisotropic flows from the two-particle cumulant method reproduce approximately those measured by the ALICE Collaboration, except at small centralities where they are slightly overestimated. Similar to experimental results, the two-dimensional dihadron correlations at most central collisions show a ridge structure at the near side and a broad structure at the away side.

40|$|The {{standard}} NRQCD power counting {{breaks down}} and the OPE gives rise to color-octet shape functions at the upper endpoint of the photon energy spectrum in radiative Υ decay. Also in this kinematic regime, large Sudakov logarithms appear in the octet Wilson coefficients, ruining the perturbative expansion. Using SCET, the octet shape functions arise naturally and the Sudakov logarithms can be summed using the renormalization group equations. We derive an expression for the resummed octet energy spectrum. The decay of the Υ in the endpoint region is interesting {{for a number of}} reasons. Firstly, it is a way to test Non-Relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [1] in decays, which could be important for extractions of αs [2]. Secondly, in the endpoint region, it is necessary to introduce another effective field theory, Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) [3], due to the jet of collinear particle that is produced in this kinematic region. Finally, CLEO will obtain much more precise data on the first three Υ resonances, so it is timely {{to see if we can}} predict the decay spectrum. The Υ(1 S) decays radiatively about 3 % of the time.

Before discussing this region in particular, it will be useful to review how the calculation is done in general. To calculate the inclusive photon spectrum, it is advantageous to use NRQCD.

It {{gives rise to}} the diffraction dissociation of virtual photons into the <b>back-to-back</b> <b>jets.</b> We find that at large invariant mass M of two jets, M^ 2 ≫ Q^ 2, the transverse momentum of jets comes from the intrinsic transverse momentum of gluons in the pomeron, and the photon-pomeron fusion direcly probes the diffrential gluon structure function of the proton ∂ G(x,q^ 2) /∂ q^ 2 at the virtuality q^ 2 ∼ k^ 2. We present estimates for the jet production cross section, which show the process is easily measurable at HERA.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{production}} of forward di-jets in proton-lead and proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. Such configurations, with both jets produced in the forward direction, impose a dilute-dense asymmetry which allows to probe the gluon density of the lead or proton target at small longitudinal momentum fractions. Even though the jet momenta are always {{much bigger than the}} saturation scale of the target, $Q_s$, the transverse momentum imbalance of the di-jet system may be either also much larger than $Q_s$, or of the order $Q_s$, implying that the small-$x$ QCD dynamics involved is either linear or non-linear, respectively. The small-$x$ improved TMD factorization framework deals with both situation in the same formalism. In the latter case, which corresponds to nearly <b>back-to-back</b> <b>jets,</b> we find that saturation effects induce a significant suppression of the forward di-jet azimuthal correlations in proton-lead versus proton-proton collisions.
