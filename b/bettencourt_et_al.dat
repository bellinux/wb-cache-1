A number of meta-analyses have summarized the empirical research to date and have demonstrated that the effect is replicable and consistent (<b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2001; Buhl 1999; Mullen et al. 1992) and it has been accepted as an important theoretical process in explaining intergroup relations (Hewstone et al. 2002).|$|E

30|$|Arguments from {{complex systems}} theory and from urban {{economics}} emphasize {{the role of}} agglomeration economies in all these processes: the output of socioeconomic processes rises on a per capita basis {{with the size of}} cities. This is interpreted in terms of the possibilities for interaction created by spatial and temporal concentration of people in cities (<b>Bettencourt</b> [2013], Lobo <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2013]). However, even if these conditions are met, the question remains whether cities realize these interactions for good or for ill. Negative consequences of increased human interactivity can also occur, in terms of increases in crime rates, the prevalence of infectious diseases and the proliferation of small-scale informal economic agents. The cities of Côte d’Ivoire, and Abidjan in particular, manifest these various consequences of urbanization: The good and the bad are very much intertwined, as we discuss below. Telecommunications data can help in the determination of not only which cities are involved in this type of growth, but also provide metrics of to what extent agglomeration effects are realized in each place.|$|R

30|$|Generally, {{historical}} and contemporary patterns of national development very much depend on the socioeconomic dynamics that happen inside a nation’s largest cities and in particular {{on the ability of}} these places not only to grow but to realize increases in social interactivity that can lead to larger and more sophisticated economic specialization and interdependence; organizational and technological innovation; and the seizing of latent economies of scale in services and infrastructure (<b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2012]; Jones and Romer [2010]).|$|E
30|$|We coded {{additional}} parameters. We {{are interested}} in overall in-group bias, yet status differences are the most consistent predictor of variability in in-group bias (<b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2001; Buhl 1999; Mullen et al. 1992). If possible, we coded one overall estimate of in-group bias across all other conditions. If not, we coded status of the groups (− 1 lower status, 0 equal status, 1 higher status) in line with Mullen et al. (1992) and Buhl (1999). Overall in-group bias collapsed across status was coded as equal status. If other conditions were included that were intended to experimentally decrease or eliminate in-group bias (e.g., uncertainty reduction, Grieve and Hogg 1999), we did not include those conditions in our coding. If there were multiple dependent variables, we averaged them per sample. In essence, our coding focused on overall estimates of in-group bias, averaging over variations in status, group size and type of dependent variable. If authors reported both in-group bias and out-group derogation, only in-group bias was coded. There was not sufficient information across studies conducted in the various societies to consistently differentiate in-group favouritism from out-group derogation (e.g., <b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2001) or any finer differentiation of socio-structural variables as discussed in SIT research.|$|E
30|$|We {{examined}} in-group bias across 18 societies. The {{overall effect}} was significant and of similar moderate magnitude as in previous meta-analyses (e.g., <b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2001; Mullen et al. 1992). This suggests that in-group bias {{is a relatively}} universal phenomenon. At the same time, {{the magnitude of the}} effect varied systematically across societies. In more uncertainty avoidant contexts, in-group bias increased. This finding supports uncertainty-avoidance theory (Hogg 2000). Identification with groups allows for reduction in uncertainty through allowing individuals to find a sense of who they are, and what to expect of those in and outside of one’s group (but see Fischer 2013).|$|E

30|$|As {{another aspect}} of size effects, it is {{important}} to understand how these network properties change with organizational size. Looking at size scaling is complementary to other analyses, and its use is more common in disciplines outside the social sciences. For example, within biology, there are classic works such as the one by Thompson (1992) that examine how various physiological quantities scale with an animal’s size. Scaling is an established technique in statistical physics, but also in the study of complex systems, as is the case of the scaling of city properties (innovation, production output) with its size (<b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007).|$|E

Eagle et al. argue that the diversity of individual relationships within a community strongly correlates with economic development of communities [5].

However, {{it is also important to}} understand what effects of urbanization are enabled by social interactions, benign or malign (<b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2007]). The recent history of Côte d’Ivoire, which has many parallels with other examples of urbanized Africa and Latin America, indicates that its most recent rapid urbanization is partially the result of conflict and political crises, and less of planned migration to access social and economic opportunity. Abidjan, for example, has grown explosively in population during the last decade of conflict in the region, due to both internally displaced people and refugees from neighboring nations.|$|E

Development is first and foremost the open-ended process of gaining social and economic access to a society at large. For example, recent ethnographic studies in sociology, especially in Latin America (Holston [2008]), have emphasized how new urban migrants living in informal settlements have gradually strived for services and citizenship rights and responsibilities. As a result, large, poor and marginalized fractions of urban populations joined their civic society and formal economies, and gradually raised their socioeconomic status and that of their communities. These processes connect the aggregation of information in human societies to scale, innovation and economic growth (Hayek [1945]; Arrow [1962]; Holston [2008]; <b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [2012]).|$|E

The analysis shows that population size alone does not provide enough information to describe or predict the state of a city as previously proposed, indicating that the expected scaling laws are not corroborated.

30|$|In {{this study}} we explore {{societal}} effects on in-group bias. To derive a measure of in-group bias, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental and correlational studies that reported an index of in-group bias. We {{were not interested in}} more subtle variations in the effect (e.g., <b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2001), but were interested in whether the overall level of in-group bias across conditions or group targets is influenced by more distal macro-contextual variables, independent of the structural relations between the groups within a society. Given the non-specific and broad nature of culture-level dimensions, by not paying attention to finer experimental distinctions or subtleties our approach provides a more conservative estimate of the influence of societal context on this psychological phenomenon. This is also based on pragmatic reasons as it allows us to pool a larger set of studies by focusing on more inclusive criteria. Unfortunately, to date there are not enough studies available across all the societies included in our study that would allow finer coding of structural variables within each society.|$|E

Although the functional roles of proteasome phosphorylation in these processes are largely uncharacterized, increasing evidence indicates that the 26 S proteasome is not a uniform and static complex acting passively as a “cellular trashcan”. Rather, the proteasome itself is fine-tuned by reversible phosphorylation in response to intra- and extra-cellular signals, which can be a prerequisite or feedback mechanism for a wide spectrum of cellular events that depend on proteasome function.|$|R
40|$|Certain {{currents}} in sociology consider society as being composed of autonomous individuals with independent psychologies. Others, however, deem our actions as {{strongly influenced by}} the accepted standards of social behavior. The later view was central to the positivist conception of society when in 1887 Émile Durkheim published his monograph Suicide (Durkheim, 1897). By treating the suicide as a social fact, Durkheim envisaged that suicide rates should {{be determined by the}} connections (or the lack of them) between people and society. Under the same framework, Durkheim considered that crime is bound up with the fundamental conditions of all social life and serves a social function. In this sense, and regardless of its extremely deviant nature, crime events are somehow capable to release certain social tensions and so have a purging effect in society. The social effect on the occurrence of homicides has been previously substantiated (<b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2007; Alves et al., 2013), and confirmed here, in terms of a superlinear scaling relation: by doubling the population of a Brazilian city results in an average increment of 135...|$|E
40|$|More {{than a half}} {{of world}} {{population}} is now living in cities and this number {{is expected to be}} two-thirds by 2050. Fostered by the relevancy of a scientific characterization of cities and for the availability of an unprecedented amount of data, academics have recently immersed in this topic {{and one of the most}} striking and universal finding was the discovery of robust allometric scaling laws between several urban indicators and the population size. Despite that, most governmental reports and several academic works still ignore these nonlineari-ties by often analyzing the raw or the per capita value of urban indicators, a practice that actually makes the urban metrics biased towards small or large cities depending on whether we have super or sublinear allometries. By following the ideas of <b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> [PLoS ONE 5 (2010) e 13541], we account for this bias by evaluating the difference between the actual value of an urban indicator and the value expected by the allometry with the popula-tion size. We show that this scale-adjusted metric provides a more appropriate/informative summary of the evolution of urban indicators and reveals patterns that do not appear in the evolution of per capita values of indicators obtained from Brazilian cities.

30|$|In-group bias (the {{tendency}} to favour one’s own group over other groups) {{has been one}} of the most well-supported psychological findings. The ground-breaking research by Tajfel et al. (1971) demonstrated that in-group bias can occur when group boundaries are completely meaningless, such as when using random letters or inconsequential artistic preferences. This phenomenon has been found to be so robust and stable, that researchers even started investigating potential genetic components (Lewis and Bates 2010). At the same time, both different experimental manipulations and the nature of manipulated groups may increase or decrease the in-group bias (for reviews, see for example <b>Bettencourt</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2001; Brewer 1979; Tajfel 1982; Hewstone et al. 2002; Mullen et al. 1992). What has not been addressed previously is to what extent the larger macro-societal context may also have an influence on in-group bias. It is noteworthy that those structural variables which have been extensively discussed within the classic Social Identity Theory (SIT, Tajfel and Turner 1979, 1986), such as the nature of groups and their mutual relationships, are likely to vary systematically across different societies (Hofstede 1980). These more distal cultural variables have remained largely unexplored in research on in-group bias. Our question returns to the early writings by Tajfel who explicitly stated that group processes need to be understood within the context in which they are occurring and can not be assumed to be ‘universal’ (Tajfel et al. 1971, page 151).|$|E

A diagnosis of ASD seems to have predictive power for PTSD by reducing the number of symptoms required within the dissociative cluster criteria, identifying subsyndromal ASD (Bryant 2011).|$|R
