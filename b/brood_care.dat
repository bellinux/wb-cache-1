5|$|Eusociality {{involves}} cooperative <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> (including <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> of offspring {{from other}} individuals), overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups. Few organisms outside Hymenoptera exhibit this behavior; the only beetle {{to do so is}} the weevil Austroplatypus incompertus. This Australian species lives in horizontal networks of tunnels, in the heartwood of Eucalyptus trees. It is one of more than 300 species of wood-boring Ambrosia beetles which distribute the spores of ambrosia fungi. The fungi grow in the beetles' tunnels, providing food for the beetles and their larvae; female offspring remain in the tunnels and maintain the fungal growth, probably never reproducing. Cooperative <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> is also found in the bess beetles (Passalidae) where the larvae feed on the semi-digested faeces of the adults.|$|E
5|$|Both parents remain {{involved}} in guarding the fry from brood predators {{and engage in}} behaviors to assist feeding such as moving leaves or fin digging (digging up the substrate with their fins). <b>Brood</b> <b>care</b> of eggs, larvae and free-swimming juveniles in the wild can last 4 to 6 weeks, and occurs only once per season {{for the majority of}} females. In contrast, females in aquaria are known to breed many times per year with short intervals of 12 or 13 days between broods, as long as suitable rocks or similar surfaces are available for them to lay their eggs on.|$|E

As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in <b>brood</b> <b>care.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bees may be solitary or {{may live}} in {{various types of}} communities. Sociality, of several {{different}} types, appears to have evolved independently many times within the bees. The most advanced of these are species with eusocial colonies; these are characterised by having cooperative <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive adults, plus overlapping generations. This division of labour creates specialized groups within eusocial societies which are called castes. In some species, groups of cohabiting females may be sisters, {{and if there is}} a division of labour within the group, they are considered semisocial. The group is called eusocial if, in addition, the group consists of a mother (the queen) and her daughters (workers). When the castes are purely behavioural alternatives, with no morphological differentiation other than size, the system is considered primitively eusocial, as in many paper wasps; when the castes are morphologically discrete, the system is considered highly eusocial.|$|E
25|$|Temporal polyethism is not {{adaptive}} {{because of}} maximized efficiency; indeed older workers are actually more efficient at <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> than younger workers in some ant species. Rather it allows workers {{with the lowest}} remaining life expectancy to perform the most dangerous tasks. Older workers tend to perform riskier tasks, such as foraging, which has high risks of predation and parasitism, while younger workers perform less dangerous tasks, such as <b>brood</b> <b>care.</b> If workers experience injuries, which shortens their life expectancies, they will start foraging sooner than healthy workers of the same age.|$|E
50|$|They are subsocial (<b>brood</b> <b>caring)</b> beetles {{that live}} in groups within rotting logs or stumps.

25|$|Ropalidia marginata is an Old World {{species of}} paper wasp. It is primitively eusocial, not showing the same bias in <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> seen in other social insects with greater {{asymmetry}} in relatedness.

The queen does not use physical dominance to control workers; {{there is evidence of}} pheromones being used to suppress other female workers from overtaking queenship.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{the alpha}} female dominates all other {{individuals}} of a colony, laying {{the majority of}} eggs and partaking in differential oophagy. The alpha female devotes {{much of her time}} to social interaction, in comparison to subordinates that are much more involved in foraging and <b>brood</b> <b>care.</b> The clypeus, the yellow region above the mouth, is extremely variable in number, size, and shape of black spots, and this variation correlates to dominance; more dominant individuals have more black spots. The arrival at the nest correlates with the dominance hierarchy. Therefore, individuals that join the nest later are seldom dominant.|$|E

40|$|Alprazolam is {{the most}} {{consumed}} anxiolytic drug. Its adverse effects have roughly been examined. Here we studied its effects on ants used as biological models. Alprazolam reduced the ants food consumption, general activity, locomotion, precision of reaction, response to pheromones, audacity, <b>brood</b> <b>caring,</b> cognition, tactile perception, and middle term memory, though not impacting short term memory. It induced aggressiveness against nesmates. Habituation to alprazolam occurred for locomotion, but not for aggressiveness. Ants developed dependence on it. The effect of alprazolam on locomotion rapidly vanished after weaning. Its effect on aggressiveness rapidly decreased from 4 h to 13 h after weaning, then it slowly vanished in 60 h. The rapid decrease of the drug effects may lead to dependence. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

25|$|The eastern yellow jacket or eastern yellowjacket (Vespula maculifrons) is a wasp {{found in}} eastern North America. Although {{most of their}} nests are subterranean, they are often {{considered}} a pest due to their nesting in recreational areas and buildings.

The specific name maculifrons {{is derived from the}} Latin word macula, which means spot, and frons, which means forehead. This refers to the spots on the head of species, which is another distinguishing characteristic. Like other Vespula species, V. maculifrons is a social wasp. As a result, the species participates in cooperative <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> and division between reproductive and nonreproductive groups.|$|E

The species also consumes aquatic plants so plastic plants or robust plants such as java fern are recommended. [...] Convict cichlids are aggressively territorial during breeding and pairs are best kept alone. <b>Brood</b> <b>care</b> is reduced in aquarium strains. Due to the species' tendency to dig, external filtration is superior to undergravel filter systems.

40|$|Experiments made on ants as {{biological}} models {{revealed that}} a saccharose/sucralose 95. 5 /. 05 mixture increased sugar water consumption, decreased general activity, precision of reaction, audacity, <b>brood</b> <b>caring,</b> cognition and ability in acquiring visual conditioning (short term memory), induced aggressiveness against nestmates, and slightly reduced tactile perception. It may not change the speed of locomotion and did not affect middle and long term memory. The adverse effects {{may be related to}} the strong sugared taste of the mixture (in presence of sugar and the saccharose/sucralose mixture, the ants slightly preferred the mixture) though it contains little sugar, and to the toxic chloropropanols sucralose may produce. When ants consumed again sugar instead of a saccharose/sucralose mixture, their aggressiveness rapidly decreased during eight hours and entirely vanished in 29 hours.

500|$|Breeding is cooperative. During the nest-building {{phase of}} the {{breeding}} season, grey jay breeding pairs are accompanied by a third, juvenile bird. A 1991 field study in Quebec and Ontario found that approximately 65% of grey jay trios included a dominant juvenile from the pair's previous breeding season, and approximately 30% of trios included non-dominant juveniles who had left their parents' territory. Occasionally, two nonbreeding juveniles accompany a pair of adults. The role of juveniles is in allofeeding (food sharing) by retrieving caches and bringing food to younger siblings; however, this is only allowed by the parents during the post-fledgling period. Until then, parents will drive the other birds away from the nest. This may reduce the frequency of predator-attracting visits to the nest when young are most vulnerable. The benefits of juveniles participating in subsequent <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> may include [...] "lightening the load" [...] for the breeding pair, which may possibly increase longevity, reducing the probability of starvation of nestlings, and detecting and mobbing predators near the nest.

2500|$|Temporal polyethism is a {{mechanism}} of task allocation, and is ubiquitous among eusocial insect colonies. Tasks in a colony are allocated among workers {{based on their}} age. Newly emerged workers perform tasks within the nest, such as <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> and nest maintenance, and progress to tasks outside the nest, such as foraging, nest defense, and corpse removal as they age. In honeybees, the youngest workers exclusively clean cells, which is then followed by tasks related to <b>brood</b> <b>care</b> and nest maintenance from about 2–11 days of age. From 11– 20 days, they transition to receiving and storing food from foragers, and at about 20 days workers begin to forage. Similar temporal polyethism patterns {{can be seen in}} primitive species of wasps, such as Ropalidia marginata as well as the eusocial wasp Vespula germanica. Young workers feed larvae, and then transition to nest building tasks, followed by foraging. Many species of ants also display this pattern. This pattern is not rigid, though. Workers of certain ages have strong tendencies to perform certain tasks, but may perform other tasks if there is enough need. For instance, removing young workers from the nest will cause foragers, especially younger foragers, to revert to tasks such as caring for brood. These changes in task preference are caused by epigenetic changes {{over the life of the}} individual. Honeybee workers of different ages show substantial differences in DNA methylation, which causes differences in gene expression. Reverting foragers to nurses by removing younger workers causes changes in DNA methylation similar to younger workers.|$|E

A product made of an extract of Valeriana officinalis L. Humulus lupulus L. Passiflora incarnata L. and Ballota nigra L. easily available in any drugstore, was tested in the same way alprazolam had been. Contrary to alprazolam, this product did not significantly alter the ants? <b>brood</b> <b>caring,</b> cognition, behaviour in front of nestmates, tactile perception, learning and memory. It efficiently calmed the ants which often rested but not fully slept, avoided risky tasks and quietly reacted in a stressing situation. Adaptation occurred for the few adverse effects of this product (large sinuosity of movement, what had an effect on some behaviour). No habituation occurred as for its calming effect and it did not lead to dependence contrary to alprazolam. After its consumption ends, the calming effect of the plant extract slowly vanishes in 29 hours, step by step. In conclusion, this extract appears to be a safe product for reducing anxiousness and should be used preferentially to synthetized compounds which are known to have severe adverse effects. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Hypercholesterolemia is {{nowadays}} one of {{the most}} widespread pathology. It is treated using statins (for instance, simvastatin) which have, however, several harmful effects. Having confirmed such effects working on ants as models, we here used again ants for examining the adverse effects of the natural red yeast of rice, a food complement which contains a statin, the lovastatin. The product used (arterin) slightly increased the ants’ intake of sugar food comparatively with meat intake, slightly decreased their activity, slightly increased their sinuosity of movement, decreased their trail following behaviour, tactile perception, cognition, ability in escaping from an enclosure, as well as their visual and olfactory conditioning and memory. Arterin did not impact the ants’ orientation ability, audacity, <b>brood</b> <b>caring,</b> aggressiveness against nest mates and aliens. Adaptation occurred for some adverse effects, habituation to the physiological impact did not occur, and ants developed no dependence on that food complement. The effects of arterin slowly decreased in 25 hours. On the whole, arterin presented less adverse effects than simvastatin, and those presented were of lower intensity. The red yeast of rice should thus be used preferentially to manufactured statins for treating predominating persons suffering from moderate hypercholesterolemia. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Social insects (ants, bees, wasps and termites) are {{considered}} as prime examples of altruism {{in which individuals}} (workers) forego their own reproduction to help other individuals reproduce. Such a behaviour is favoured by natural selection because the workers rear close kin {{and in doing so}} enhance their inclusive fitness. Results Here I show, however, that this does not generally apply to termite workers which are scarcely investigated. In the basal drywood termite Cryptotermes secundus the 'workers', which form the large majority of a colony, did not stay to raise relatives. There is no <b>brood</b> <b>caring</b> behaviour and they do not engage in costly help. They are large immature offspring that develop into either winged (dispersing) or unwinged (replacement) reproductives and the probability that they did so was unaffected by the number of brood in the nest as a brood addition experiment showed. Conclusion Thus, in contrast to general perception where termite workers {{are considered}} equivalent to workers in Hymenoptera, the 'large immatures' of C. secundus did not behave as workers that help in raising younger siblings. This apparently is not necessary as the colony lives inside its food. These results, which are likely to be typical for wood-dwelling termites, open the possibility that large complex group living can evolve without altruistic helping and that costly altruistic helping by workers in termites evolved only as a second step. </p...|$|R
