40|$|M. Cur. (Psychiatric Nursing) Termination of {{pregnancy}} is now legal in South Africa, bringing with it {{issues that have}} never before had to be addressed. Nobody denies that termination {{of pregnancy}} {{has an effect on}} women, but very few people realise that termination of pregnancy also has an impact on men. The study {{tells the story of a}} few adult <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> who accompanied their partners to the various identified clinics in Gauteng for a termination of pregnancy. The goal of this study was to: Explore and describe how single adult <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> experienced the termination of pregnancy his partner had. Describe guidelines for the advanced psychiatric nurse practitioner to support adult <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> to mobilise their resources and promote their mental health as an integral part of health. The paradigmatic perspective of this study was guided by the Theory for Health Promotion in Nursing (Rand Afrikaans University, Department of Nursing Science, 1999 : 2 - 15), which reflects the focus on the whole person. A functional approach was followed (Botes, 1991 : 2) based on the model for nursing research developed by Botes (1995 : 6). The design of the study utilised is a qualitative, descriptive, exploratory and contextual design (Mouton & Marais, 1994 : 43 - 44, 51) using in-depth, semi-structured, phenomenological interviews as a method of data collection. Field notes were also taken after the completion of each interview, while prior to this permission was obtained from the various identified private clinics in Gauteng where this study was conducted, as well as from the adult <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> who voluntarily participated in this study. The results of this study were tabulated according to categories and themes. The first theme identified the powerlessness the adult <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> experienced related to the inability to have a choice in the process of the termination of pregnancy. The second theme told of the emotional turmoil experienced by the adult <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> related to the impact of the decision on interpersonal and intra-personal relationships. The third theme identified the psychological defence mechanisms the adult <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> used as a way of dealing with the stressful effects of the termination of pregnancy...|$|R

In his later years, after fleeing to America, he works at a gas station. He dies from cancer in 1987, shortly after Amir and Soraya's wedding.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of the so-called bastard children has growth astronomically worldwide.

40|$|The {{absence of}} <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> in South Africa has been {{constructed}} {{as a problem}} for children of both sexes but more so for boy-children. Arguably the dominant discourse in this respect has demonized non-nuclear, female-headed households. Fathers are constructed as either absent or ‘bad’. Thus it has become important to explore more closely how male care-givers have been experienced by groups of men in South Africa. This article examines discourses of fatherhood and fatherlessness by drawing on qualitative interviews {{with a group of}} 29 men who speak about their reported experiences and understandings of being fathered or growing up without <b>biological</b> <b>fathers.</b> Two major and intertwined subjugated discourses about adult men’s experiences of being fathered that counter- balance the prevailing discourses about meaning of fatherhood and fatherlessness became evident, namely, ‘being always there’ and ‘talking fatherhood’. The importance of the experience of fatherhood as ‘being there’, which relates to a quality of time and relationship between child and father rather than physical time together, is illustrated. It is not only <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> who can ‘be there’ for their sons but also social fathers, other significant male role models and father figures who step in at different times in participants’ lives when <b>biological</b> <b>fathers</b> are unavailable for whatever reason. Second, many positive experiences of fathers or father figures that resist a traditional role of authority and control and subscribe to more nurturant and non-violent forms of care, represented as ‘talking’ fathers, are underlined. If we are to better understand the impact of colonial and apartheid history and its legacy on family life in contemporary society, {{there is a need for}} more historically and contextually informed studies on the meaning of fatherhood and fatherlessness.
