"One Tree Hill" [...] {{was absent}} during the {{majority}} of the Zoo TV Tour, only appearing as an extended snippet at the end of [...] "One" [...] at both concerts in New Zealand in 1993. It did not appear again until 24November 2006 in Auckland, New Zealand, on the final leg of the Vertigo Tour. It was considered to close the concert, but tour designer Willie Williams voiced concern as it had not been performed in full since 1990. The song was performed before [...] "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own" [...] in the main set instead. U2 performed it an additional three times on the tour. [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] was absent for {{the majority of}} the U2 360° Tour but was revived in November 2010 for two concerts in New Zealand, where it was dedicated to the miners who died in the Pike River Mine disaster; their names were displayed on the video screen during the song. Dedicating the song, Bono said, [...] "we wrote it for Greg Carroll, whose family are with us tonight. <b>But</b> <b>tonight</b> it belongs to the miners of the West Coast Pike River." [...] U2 played [...] "One Tree Hill" [...] on 25March 2011, in Santiago, Chile, in a duet with Francisca Valenzuela, and they dedicated it to Victor Jara.|$|E
500|$|Chicago Sun-Times praised West's vocal delivery, saying [...] "he rips more hard raps on 'Devil in a New Dress' -- chuckling through lines like, 'We love Jesus / but {{you done}} {{learned a lot}} from Satan / We ain't married / <b>but</b> <b>tonight</b> I need some consummation,' and later chewing through an {{impersonation}} of a preacher, 'Say-tan! Say-tan! Say-tan!'—all over a fluttery, high, quiet-storm soul vocal that's part bedroom allure, part angelic prayer." [...] MTV stated [...] "West's breezy GOOD Fridays release gets a wintertime tune-up with Ross riding shotgun. The Miami Don's majestic contribution comes with a revamped breakdown setting up his slick boats. Still, Yeezy's verse holds up over the Boss's even with the refinement." [...] Dan Vidal of URB stated Ross brought his best to the track, writing that he [...] "steps his tired old coke-rhymes up to intense lyrical portraits on the final version of 'Devil In A New Dress'." [...] Stereogum's Amrit Singh described the production style as a throwback to vintage hip-hop beats, and praised West's extended use of metaphors on the track. AbsolutePunk's Drew Beringer cited the track as an example of West's [...] "penchant for soul", calling the track excellent. AllMusic's Andy Kellman also described the beat as a [...] "throwback soul production", writing that it was [...] "provided by the Smokey Robinson-sampling Bink, it’s as gorgeous as any of West’s own early work, yet it’s marred by an aimless instrumental stretch, roughly 90 seconds in length, that involves some incongruent electric guitar flame-out." ...|$|E

[...] About 40 minutes later, in his acceptance speech, Schwarzenegger said, [...] "Today California has given me the greatest gift of all: You've given me your trust by voting for me.

[...] Dahl {{went on to say}} that both storylines of the episode were the main contributors to the success of the episode.

At Stringtown, Joplin and Alma, officers had wandered into {{encounters with the}} Barrows totally unaware that {{they were about to}} go up against gunmen with vastly superior weaponry—and with no compunction about using it quickly and ferociously. [...] "The poorly armed cops expected to confront small-timers whose firepower was equally limited," [...] writes Jeff Guinn of the earlier confrontations, <b>but</b> <b>tonight's</b> encounter would be [...] "a coordinated assault by well-prepared, well-armed officers aware of exactly who they were up against." ...|$|R
2500|$|Episodes two {{and three}} did not fare as well, critically. Discussing the second episode, Michael Hogan in The Daily Telegraph found the quickened pace invigorating, and found the story gripping. But Neela Debnath at The Independent criticised the writing, concluding, [...] "Sadly, all the {{electric}} tension of episode one has evaporated, instead events are becoming improbable and additional drama seems to be shoehorned in {{for the sake of}} it. ... There's so much going on that it's starting to feel unbelievable." [...] Ross McG at Metro largely agreed with these points, and noted that the courtroom drama seemed bland because it essentially reiterated facts viewers already knew. Ben Skipper at the International Business Times was harsh in his appraisal, calling episode two [...] "Broadchurch first truly bad hour of television." [...] He blasted the plot, particularly the apparent kidnapping of Claire Ripley, the clichéd timing of Beth Latimer going into labour, and legal inconsistencies. He also called Marianne Jean-Baptiste's performance [...] "lacking". The [...] "Bafta-winning detective drama is a heap of old codswallop that makes no sense at all," [...] said Christopher Stevens in the Daily Mail, referencing episode three. [...] "The first episode was shaky. The second was riddled with errors. But the third was beyond all forgiving." [...] There was limited praise for episode three, however. Ben Dowell at Radio Times had high praise for cinematographer John Conroy's work: [...] "The cinematography was beautiful. Broadchurch always looks fabulously bucolic <b>but</b> <b>tonight</b> the lovely summer dawns and countryside was shown off to an even greater degree..." [...] He also lauded Olivia Colman's performance, calling her [...] "once again on top form".|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} is Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's game inning {{home run in}} Game 1 of the 1988 World Series of the 1988 World Series: [...] "All year long, they looked to him to light the fire, [...] and all year long, he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight – with two bad legs: The bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And, with two out, {{you talk about a}} roll of the dice... this is it." [...] Scully made repeated references to Gibson's legs, noting at one point that the batter was [...] "shaking his left leg, making it quiver, like a horse {{trying to get rid of}} a troublesome fly." [...] Gibson worked the count to 3–2 as Mike Davis stole second base; the camera turned at that point to Steve Sax getting ready for his turn at the plate, and Scully reminded the viewers that Sax was waiting on deck, but that the game right now is at the plate. [...] "High fly ball into right field, she i-i-i-is... gone!!" [...] Scully said nothing for over a minute, allowing the pictures to tell the story. Finally, he said, [...] "In a year that has been so improbable... the impossible has happened!" [...] Returning to the subject of Gibson's banged-up legs during a replay, Scully joked, [...] "And, now, the only question was, could he make it around the base paths unassisted?!" [...] "You know, I said it once before, a few days ago, that Kirk Gibson was not the Most Valuable Player; that the Most Valuable Player for the Dodgers was Tinkerbell. <b>But,</b> <b>tonight,</b> I think Tinkerbell backed off for Kirk Gibson. And, look at Eckersley – shocked to his toes!" [...] "They are going wild at Dodger Stadium – no one wants to leave!" [...] As NBC showed a replay of Gibson rounding second base in his home run trot, Scully then made a point to note Eckersley's pitching performance throughout the 1988 season, to put things in perspective. [...] "Dennis Eckersley allowed five home runs all year. And we'll be back." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Chuck Versus the Suburbs" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Steve Heisler of The A.V.

A lot happened over in the suburbs with Chuck, Sarah, Casey and Richter, but first, {{a word about the}} Buy More: those precious Buy More segments that often disappoint. Theyre usually too distracting from the main story line -- and not funny enough to justify it -- and always have zero bearing on future episodes. <b>But</b> <b>tonights</b> worked right up until the end and {{set the stage for a}} lot of wonderful tension."

5000|$|Nick Hogan of TV Overmind {{gave the}} episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5, writing [...] "With {{exception}} to my one little quibble, the finale of Gotham {{proved to be}} a launching point toward the Batman story. It was emotional, it was action-packed and intense, and left little to be desired. I'm already excited for the show to premiere in the fall." [...] Amanda Bell of EW gave the episode a [...] "B" [...] and wrote, [...] "This half of Gothams third season has been filled with so many moving parts that, at times, it's been a bit dizzying to keep track of who wants to kill whom and why. <b>But</b> <b>tonight's</b> two-part finale sews up those dangling threads rather seamlessly and presents a new and, dare I say, optimistic vision for the future of this city." ...|$|R
