50|$|Live <b>blood</b> <b>analysis</b> (LBA), live cell analysis, Hemaview or {{nutritional}} <b>blood</b> <b>analysis</b> {{is the use}} of high-resolution dark field microscopy {{to observe}} live blood cells. Live <b>blood</b> <b>analysis</b> is promoted by some alternative medicine practitioners, who assert that it can diagnose a range of diseases. There is no scientific evidence that live <b>blood</b> <b>analysis</b> is reliable or effective, and it {{has been described as a}} fraudulent means of convincing patients that they are ill and should purchase dietary supplements.|$|R

5000|$|Dark field {{microscopy}} {{is useful}} to enhance contrast in unstained samples, but live <b>blood</b> <b>analysis</b> is not proven to be useful for any of its claimed indications. Two journal articles published in the alternative medical literature found that darkfield microscopy seemed unable to detect cancer, and that live <b>blood</b> <b>analysis</b> lacked reliability, reproducibility, and sensitivity and specificity. Edzard Ernst, professor of complementary medicine at the University of Exeter and University of Plymouth, notes: [...] "No credible scientific studies have demonstrated the reliability of LBA for detecting {{any of the above}} conditions." [...] Ernst describes live <b>blood</b> <b>analysis</b> as a [...] "fraudulent" [...] means of convincing patients to buy dietary supplements. Quackwatch has been critical of live <b>blood</b> <b>analysis,</b> noting dishonesty in the claims brought forward by its proponents.

40|$|Background Point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> is {{considered}} a standard of care in modern air ambulance operations by many professional organisations for clinical assessment and monitoring of patients. Instances where point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> has identified clinically significant abnormalities which then led to clinical intervention are well documented and have been quantified previously in the air ambulance environment. However, results obtained from point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> are not always required for patient care, nor do they always result in any clinical action {{on the part of}} the medical crew. Our question therefore related to the data for a Johannesburg based jet air ambulance service. Methods By means of retrospective case reviews over a one year period, we reviewed the overall frequency of utilisation of point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> on patient transportations within a Johannesburg based jet air ambulance service. We established how often point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> yielded abnormal findings, and how frequently abnormalities detected by point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> resulted in clinical interventions. Results Point-of-care <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> was undertaken in 266 of 334 patients transported (79. 6...|$|R

Acid-base unbalances are respiratory acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is frequently appeared in clinical state. Arterial <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> is {{considered as a}} basic test to {{the intensive care unit}} patient and emergency state. Recently some researches were done, comparing with arterial <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis</b> and venous <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis.</b> Because of venous blood sampling is safer than arterial <b>blood</b> gas <b>analysis,</b> and beside not so different among them for detecting pH, pCO 2, HCO 3, except pO 2 measuring.
