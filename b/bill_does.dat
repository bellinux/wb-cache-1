5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the <b>bill</b> <b>does</b> not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the <b>bill</b> <b>does</b> have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill is deemed to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the <b>bill</b> <b>does</b> not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court.|$|E
5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the <b>bill</b> <b>does</b> not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E

25|$|A new {{same-sex}} marriage bill {{was presented to}} the Chiapan Congress in May 2016. According to Unidos Diferentes Asociación Civil (UDAC), a local LGBT advocacy group, the {{same-sex marriage}} bill has been taken off the agenda several times and not voted upon due to the actions {{of the president of the}} local Congress, Eduardo Ramírez Aguilar. Additionally, UDAC has said that the <b>bill</b> <b>does</b> not address the issue of adoption for same-sex couples.|$|E

25|$|Grayson {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In May 2010, he {{introduced}} the War Is Making You Poor Act. The bill would require the president to fund the wars from the Department of Defense's base budget. The <b>bill</b> <b>does</b> not necessitate an end to the wars or mandate a cut-off date. In addition to the tax cuts, the bill would cut the federal deficit by $15.9 billion.|$|E
25|$|Months pass, and Bill {{develops}} a mutual attraction {{to a student}} named Heather, who has a defect that makes it look like there is a star in her eye. Heather asks her to inspect a mysterious puddle, asking her if she can see what's wrong with her reflection, but <b>Bill</b> <b>does</b> not notice anything except that her face seems wrong somehow. Bill turns around and Heather has left. Within the puddle, a voice proclaims that {{a search for a}} pilot has begun.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} {{generate}} minimal greenhouse gases, yet one critic {{wrote that the}} <b>bill</b> <b>does</b> not sufficiently advocate this clean power source. In response to this criticism, House of Representatives staff members wrote that the electricity generated by nuclear power requires the purchase of far fewer allowances than other forms of electricity generation; that the bill provides various types of financial support to build clean energy generating sources, including nuclear; and that an EPA study indicated that twice as many nuclear plants would be built if the law is passed versus the status quo.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Article 5A was {{inserted}} into the Constitution and Article 22H was amended; these changes clarified the situation by providing different procedures for circumventing or curtailing the President's discretionary power, {{depending on whether the}} Government seeks to do so by way of an ordinary bill or a bill seeking to amend the Constitution. Article 22H deals with attempts to alter the President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Article 5A deals with {{attempts}} {{to alter the}} President's power by amending the Constitution itself. When the provision is brought into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or indirect effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers.

After Bill tells him he should have tried harder on writing his book, Brian responds by yelling that all <b>Bill</b> <b>does</b> is [...] "judge" [...] other people, and demands {{for him to go}} home and [...] "fuck [...] wife in the face", to which Bill agrees.

500|$|Public {{reaction}} varied.

Her public approval ratings {{in the wake of the}} revelations shot upward to around 70percent, the highest they had ever been. In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to [...] "a love that has persisted for decades" [...] and add: [...] "No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way <b>Bill</b> <b>does.</b> Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from June 25, 1910. It states: [...] "Bill Raymond, a convict, sentenced to a long term, {{is on his way}} to prison, in custody of the sheriff. A little girl [...] is a passenger in the same train. She shows that she feels sorry for the man. He in turn appreciates her sympathy. The train is wrecked, and the sheriff, who is handcuffed to Bill, is killed. Bill takes the key of the handcuffs from the pocket of the dead man, frees himself, and is about to escape, when he notices that the little girl, abandoned by her nurse, is lying unconscious in the car, which is now on fire. The convict risks his life to save the child, and carries her out in his arms. He takes her to her nurse and is recognized by a policeman and taken in custody, his chance for freedom lost. The child, who is the daughter of the governor, although <b>Bill</b> <b>does</b> not know it, is restored to her parent. The nurse fears to mention the incident, and the governor does not know how his darling's life was saved. Later the governor goes to the state prison on a tour of inspection, and Nell accompanies him. She has some flowers which she wants to give to the prisoners. In her tour of the prison, she recognizes Bill. She tells her father about it, and he pardons the hero-convict on the spot...." ...|$|E
