Significant numbers of students from Malawi travel to the US for schooling, and the US has active branches of the Peace Corps, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Agency for International Development in Malawi. Malawi maintained close relations with South Africa throughout the Apartheid era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes {{over the use of}} the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid. In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies.

As a starting point, it assumes that donor governments, such as the United States, will not reform their budgetary system regulations to accommodate innovative development finance commitments due to political and budget policy concerns. In general, each option outlined entails important financial, political, and bureaucratic challenges and tradeoffs. In other words, there are no silver bullets.

40|$|With the {{improvement}} of relationship with the western countries after {{the demise of the}} old order regime of President Soekarno, Indonesia received a large volume of foreign aid that {{played a crucial role in}} the recovery of the economy. Indonesia remained a significant recipient of foreign aid through out the 1970 s and 1980 s, especially during the balance of payments crises. In addition to smoothing out balance of payments problems and providing <b>budgetary</b> supports, <b>aid</b> played an important catalyst for policy reforms that are believed to have contributed to the spectacular success of the Indonesian economy. However, no systematic study has been done so far on the effectiveness of foreign aid in Indonesia. This issue has become critical in the wake of the financial crisis of the late 1990 s which turned Indonesia a heavily aid-dependent country as well as the renewed world wide debate on aid effectiveness. This paper, thus, attempts to examine the historical significance and effectiveness of aid flows to Indonesia. It finds that aid did contribute positively to economic growth, but made the government lazy in terms of domestic resource mobilisation. As a result, despite significance progress, Indonesia remained aid-dependent. Foreign aid, economic growth, balance of payments, government fiscal behaviour. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} aimed at {{assessing}} the effects of aid on fiscal behaviour in Indonesia. There are four main findings. First, the inflow of aid is driven primarily {{by the need to}} fill the fiscal gap; that is, aid is demand driven. Second, although project aid is by definition intended for development expenditures, it results in an increase in routine expenditure as well. This suggests that project aid is fungible: it creates extra resources available to increase non-discretionary spending. Third, programme aid tends to increase routine expenditure but not development expenditure; thus, it mainly serves as <b>budgetary</b> support. Fourth, <b>aid</b> flows make the Government of Indonesia fiscally “lazy”. The availability of aid is a disincentive to mobilize domestic revenue through a more efficient and effective taxation system.

40|$|The flypaper effect {{results when}} a dollar of {{exogenous}} grants-in-aid leads to significantly greater public spending than an equivalent dollar of citizen income: Money sticks where it hits. Viewing governments as agents for a representative citizen voter, this empirical {{result is an}} anomaly. Four alternative explanations have been offered. First, it's a data problem; matching grants have been mis-classified as exogenous aid. Second, it's an econometric problem; exogenous aid is correlated with omitted variables leading to a downward bias in estimates of income's effects and an upward bias in estimates of aid's effects. Third, it's a specification problem: the representative citizen either fails to observe lump-sum aid, or sees aid but mis-perceives its impact as an average price effect, or finally, sees and understands <b>aid's</b> <b>budgetary</b> effects but allocates "public" and "private" monies through separate "mental accounts.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the allocation of foreign aid. It intends to investigate the factors influencing the decision of aid donors. What sets this study apart from previous articles on this subject is the use of a disaggregated approach. While previous studies have almost exclusively focused on the total aid flow, this paper divides the total flow into six sub-groups according to the type of <b>aid</b> (<b>budgetary</b> support or sector specific) and to which sector it is dedicated. Using this approach enables us to see if donors make different considerations for different types of aid. Since a rational donor is likely to put different weight on certain factors depending on where the aid funds is going, this approach might be more suitable when evaluating the behavior of donors. Data for 125 recipient countries during 1995 - 2009 is put in panel data form and regressions are run for each of the six sub-groups respectively. The main finding is that there are in fact differences, between sub-groups, in  terms of what factors that influence donors; for example it seems like budgetary support is given mainly to less (relatively) developed country compared to sector specific aid. Hence this paper shows that aid allocation could preferably be studied on a disaggregated level...|$|R

This paper reviews aspects of aid predictability using a newly constructed dataset for eight African countries with longstanding IMF engagement during 1994 - 2004.

40|$|Debate {{about the}} {{effectiveness}} of foreign aid has intensified in recent years, as <b>budgetary</b> pressures on <b>aid</b> have increased in donor countries. Whatever the merits of opposing arguments, the question is: do conventional measures of aid (such as OECD's Net ODA), which lump together grants and loans, accurately reflect true aid flows? The authors analyze the methodological shortcomings of conventional measures of aid and propose a new approach, which measures official aid flows as the sum of grants and the grant-equivalents of official loans (in a new aggregate they call"Effective Development Assistance,"or EDA). They show how results using this conceptually superior measure may differ significantly from conventional aggregates, providing a quite different view on major aid trends. They implement their approach empirically using data on some 40, 000 official loans from the World Bank's DRS database [...] virtually all of the official loans to 133 developing countries from 1975 to 1995. The numerical results underscore several points: 1) The conventional approach has led to systematic overestimates of the concessionality of official loans. This overestimate has increased significantly since the mid- 1980 s. Conventional methods show a rising trend; the new method shows the opposite. 2) Net ODA increasingly overstates the true aid content of official flows, although the divergence between the two approaches is somewhat muted by the rising relative importance of grants over loans in total official flows.

40|$|Abstract Background Context: Acute cough is a {{very common}} symptom {{presentation}} among children in primary care and is usually due to respiratory infection, yet its cost is unknown. An estimate of the cost to healthcare providers and parents would <b>aid</b> <b>budgetary</b> decision-making, and provide an insight into the need for interventions to reduce the burden. Purpose: To estimate the cost per child per episode, and the annual population cost in the UK, of acute cough in pre-school children presenting to primary care. Methods Design : Incidence and prevalence-based cost-of-illness study {{from the perspectives of}} the UK NHS and of parents and caregivers. Setting: 11 general practices in Bristol, UK. Subjects: 121 children without known asthma aged 3 to 59 months presenting {{for the first time with}} an acute (≤ 28 days) cough. Results Mean cost per episode to the NHS: £ 27. 43 (95 % CI: £ 24. 38 – £ 30. 49). Mean cost per episode to parents and carers: £ 14. 77 (£ 4. 90 – £ 24. 65). Annual cost to the NHS in the UK: at least £ 31. 5 m (95 % CI: £ 28. 0 m – £ 35. 0 m). Conclusion The cost burden on the healthcare provider of acute cough in pre-school children is substantial; the majority of this cost arises from consultations with general practitioners. Parents experience some personal cost through travel and expenditure on over-the-counter preparations, and may suffer significantly if loss of earnings is experienced. There is scope for evaluating interventions designed to reduce this burden. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive aid. The aid budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced. The donor agency observes the true performance of the aid recipient with error. The donor agency itself operates under stochastically variables e¢ciency. The aid recipient experiences rent-seeking behaviour. E¤ort in the aid recipient is subject to variable e¢ciency. Finally, adjustment of performance in the aid recipient is costly both in the level of e¤ort, and in the time rate of change in the performance measure. The three core results to emerge from the model are that allocative e¢ciency improves under performance intensity of aid, in the sense that more aid comes to be allocated to aid recipients with good governance. Second, performance intensity of aid generates incentive e¤ects, such that the optimal level of governance in the aid recipient will increase under strengthening performance intensity of aid. Thirdly, improving governance in the aid recipient in turn was shown to lead to increased <b>budgetary</b> allocations to <b>aid</b> in the legislature that allocates aid resources. Performance intensity of aid thus has fundraising e¤ects. Policy slippage also carries impacts, however. The …rst of these is that the e¤ectiveness of the performance intensity of aid appears to depend strongly on the degree of e¢ciency of own e¤ort in the aid recipient country.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an insight into {{budgetary}} practice in UK-based hotel organizations and an update on previous survey work in this area. The research aims to cover a broad range of budgeting issues, including: the process used in setting budgets, monitoring and review of the budgetary processes, and the human aspects of the budgeting process. Design/methodology/approach – This research used a census-based questionnaire of hotel organizations' finance directors. The questionnaire consisted of mainly closed questions, with opportunities for further explanation to be given. Statistical analysis tools included Chi-square tests, Spearman's Rank Coefficient, and ANOVA. Findings – The paper finds that the key reason organizations produce budgets are to aid control, evaluate performance and aid planning. Neither the top-down, bottom-up or combination approaches to budgeting dominated in the UK. The results showed a higher rate of the top-down approach in the UK, compared to previous surveys in other countries. Budgets were generally viewed as the main performance indicator in hotel organizations. There is little use of flexible budgeting, budget committees or budget manuals in the hotel industry. The “human aspects” of budgeting identified some interesting contradictions such as the belief that participation is key in budgeting working, yet there is a lack of participation in practice, most significantly amongst hotel department managers. Originality/value – Limited information as to budgetary practice in hotels has previously been published, particularly related to the UK.
