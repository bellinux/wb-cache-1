40|$|In the {{proposed}} multimodal biometric verification system, {{the system is}} implemented on all levels of fusion strategies (i) fusion prior to matching (sensor level and feature level) and (ii) fusion post matching (score level and decision level), a binding required and a deserving step that outputs a reliable and robust biometric identification and verification systems. We have chosen benchmark databases for our experimentation and considered physiological modalities such as face, palmprint, finger knuckle print, handvein. The performance measures considered here are FAR (False Acceptance Rate) and FRR (False Rejection Rate). Extracting texture features from a well-known texture operator-LPQ (local phase quantization), we have performed sensor level fusion adopting HAAR wavelets, feature level fusion using Z-Score normalization, score level fusion employing simple sum rule and decision level fusion with AND rule. For the implemented biometric recognition system, score level fusion strategy outer performs than the other fusion techniques in terms of EER, yielding good verification rate on all benchmark threshold values (0. 01 %, 0. 1 %, 1 %), with the GAR= 100 % at 1 % FAR. The tabulated results of the experiments are visualized by <b>BAR</b> <b>char...</b>|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the limitations of current Business Intelligence System (BI System) which was needed to re-design its architecture and embed two new modules. These two modules were named as Survey Form and Statistics Report. The survey form has a very dynamic behavior, for example the administrator can generate different types of surveys instantly by drag drop quick functionality of the interface and he can also send that surveys to the users. The user will give the answers of survey questions and send them back to the management of the company where survey form modules helped them to analyze the answers in the form of graphs. This survey form is also providing five different types of scheduling system where administrator can schedule their surveys in five different ways like Once, weekly, Monthly, Quarterly and Yearly. Statistics module has different behaviors. It implemented four different types of reports which are inter-related with each other. These four reports were named as financial report, human resource report, project overview and company overview. The finance report was responsible that it will show the revenue amount and source, from where the company generated this revenue. The second report was belonged to human resource department which was responsible for generating the overall situation of the employees and their projects. For example how many are on holidays, idle, working and going to be free soon. The third report was representing the projects overview of all the projects. This report is responsible for checking the status of all projects and show them in <b>bar</b> <b>char</b> who will show the management that how many projects are completed, going to start or delay and going to finish soon. The fourth and final report was responsible for generating report for the overall company status. This project has been completed successfully. The design, architecture and, implementation of intelligent Survey Form and Statics modules have been implemented and working successfully...|$|E
500|$|The Chittagong Coastal Forest Department {{developed}} the river <b>bars</b> (<b>char</b> in Bengali) {{on the bank}} of the Sonaichhari channel adjacent to the Sitakunda coast into a kilometer-wide coastal mangrove plantation during 1989–90, to reduce the impact of cyclones. Although the site was initially unstable, rapid sediment accretion stabilised the soil, providing the coast with some protection. The cyclone of 1990 smashed about 25% of a [...] sea-wall built using two-ton steel-reinforced concrete blocks, some of which were carried up to [...] inland. In contrast, a mangrove plantation just south of the sea-wall sustained damage to less than 1% of its trees, most of which recovered within sixmonths. The planted mangrove forest that helped Sitakunda to escape as one of the least damaged areas during the devastating 1991 Bangladesh cyclone is under threat from illegal tree-cutting by ship-breakers in the area.|$|R
40|$|Following a brief {{literature}} review, {{results from}} tests involving laser cutting of carbon and glass {{fibre reinforced plastic}} (CFRP and GFRP) composites are presented. The influence of cutting speed, laser beam power and gas pressure on material removal rate (MRR), kerf width and workpiece surface integrity were investigated. Productivity was up to ~ 100 % higher when cutting GFRP compared to CFRP, with a maximum MRR of ~ 8 cm 3 /min achieved when operating at a cutting speed of 1750 mm/min, 2500 W beam power and gas pressure of 5 <b>bar.</b> <b>Charring</b> and melting of the matrix phase was observed in both materials and similarly surface voids/cavities were evident on the CFRP and GFRP samples. Three-dimensional topographic maps also revealed the presence of grooves on the latter, which would explain the significantly higher surface roughness levels obtained (up to ~ 13 µm Ra). Heat affected zones were visible in the majority of CFRP specimens assessed which extended to a depth of ~ 1. 5 mm (depending on the fibre orientation) while only minor damage in terms of fibre protrusion was apparent in corresponding GFRP workpieces. Kerf widths decreased with increasing cutting speed and were typically over 2 times larger in the GFRP material...|$|R
50|$|The East Village plays host {{to several}} of Calgary's oldest {{building}}s. The Simmons Mattress Factory building has been redeveloped to house <b>Char</b> <b>Bar,</b> Phil & Sebastians Coffee Roasters, and Sidewalk Citizen Bakery, and is right along the RiverWalk. The city's oldest running hotel, the King Edward Hotel, built in 1905 has been deconstructed and rebuilt {{as part of the}} National Music Centre. The St. Louis Hotel block has been revitalized and now hosts the headquarters of the Calgary Municipal Land Corporation and a rental venue. The Hillier Block has been restored and is now home to the Calgary Public Library Foundation, ADD-IN, and the New Central Library Discovery Centre {{for the duration of the}} NCL construction project happening next door.|$|R
