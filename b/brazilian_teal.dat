6000|$|My chief {{ambition}} was {{to shoot}} wild duck. My brother shot them in preference to anything else: {{they were so}} much esteemed {{and he was so}} much commended when he came in with a few in his bag that I looked on duck-shooting as the greatest thing I could go in for. Ducks were common enough with us and in great variety; I know not in what country more kinds are to be found. There were no fewer than five species of teal, the commonest a dark brown bird with black mottlings; another, very common, was pale grey, the plumage beautifully barred and pencilled with brown and black; then we had the blue-winged teal, a maroon-red duck which ranges from Patagonia to California; the ringed teal, with salmon-coloured breast and velvet-black collar; the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>teal,</b> a lovely olive-brown and velvet-black duck, with crimson beak and legs. There were two pintails, one of which was the most abundant species in the country; also a widgeon, a lake duck, a shoveller duck, with red plumage, grey head and neck, and blue wings; and two species of the long-legged whistling or tree duck. Another common species was the rosy-billed duck, now to be seen on ornamental waters in England; and occasionally we saw the wild Muscovy duck, called Royal duck by the natives, but it was a rare visitor so far south. We also had geese and swans: the upland geese from the Megellanic Straits that came to us in winter--that is to say, our winter from May to August. And there were two swans, the black-necked, which has black flesh and is unfit to eat, and the white or Coscoroba Swan, as good a table bird as there is in the world. And oddly enough this bird has been known to the natives as a [...] "goose" [...] since the discovery of America, and now after three centuries our scientific ornithologists have made the discovery that it is a link between the geese and swans, but is more goose than swan. It is a beautiful white bird, with bright red bill and legs, the wings tipped with black; and has a loud musical cry of three notes, the last prolonged note with a falling inflection.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, most ducks were {{assigned}} to either the shelducks, the perching ducks, and the dabbling and diving ducks; the latter two were presumed {{to make up the}} Anatinae. However, the perching ducks {{turned out to be a}} paraphyletic assemblage of various tropical waterfowl that happened to evolve the ability to perch well in their forested habitat. Several of these, such as the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>teal,</b> were subsequently assigned to the Anatinae.|$|E

In addition to being generally perching and cavity-nesting, they also have fairly wide, rounded wings, elongated tails, and sometimes also relatively long legs. Many of the species exhibit {{a great deal of}} iridescent coloration in their plumage, even among females, and in a few species nearly the entire body plumage is iridescent. In some of these brilliantly colored forms, such as the comb duck, muscovy duck, and the spur-winged goose, there is a great difference in the sizes of the sexes even though they may be very similar in plumage patterning. In spite of their brilliant plumages, males of {{only a few of the}} species exhibit definite eclipse plumages, probably in part because most of the forms are tropical, with long or irregular breeding seasons. Pair bonding is generally seasonally established in the species that breed in temperate climates, while in the more tropical and seemingly more primitive species the pair bonds are weak and in a few cases apparently even nonexistent. The patterns of the downy young are typically well marked and characterized by white or yellow spots and stripes on a darker background; in many species they are not readily separable from the downy young of dabbling ducks. The two tribes are obviously closely related, and taxonomists are not agreed on which group some species such as the ringed teal, pink-eared duck, and <b>Brazilian</b> <b>teal</b> should be included in. However, to merge the tribes would make a comparatively large tribe and tend to obscure the well-defined differences in the behavior patterns and breeding biologies of these two groups...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} phylogenetic {{relationships}} of four duck genera endemic to South America: <b>Brazilian</b> <b>teal</b> Amazonetta brasiliensis, spectacled duck Speculanas specularis, crested duck Lophonetta specularioides, and four species of steamer ducks Tachyeres patachonicus, T. leucocephalus, T. pteneres, T. brachypterus. Genetic divergence within and among species was compared using population-level {{sampling of the}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region, supplemented with three additional mtDNA genes and six independent nuclear loci from one individual of each species {{and a variety of}} outgroup taxa. The monophyly of these four morphologically divergent South American genera was strongly supported. Within this clade, Amazonetta and Speculanas were supported as sister species in all analyses, but different gene regions yielded conflicting or ambiguous results for Lophonetta and Tachyeres. This lack of resolution resulted from little informative variation in nuclear loci and high levels of homoplasy in the mtDNA control region. Control region sequences from the four Tachyeres species fell into two distinct clades. In one clade, T. patachonicus and T. leucocephalus share a set of closely related haplotypes (50. 6 % sequence divergence); while no identical haplotypes were shared between species, the control region phylogeny was insufficiently resolved to either support or reject reciprocal monophyly. The second clade, 1. 7 % divergent from the first, comprised haplotypes of the Falkland Islands species T. brachypterus and a captive individual of T. pteneres. These distinctive South American ducks likely experienced two bouts of rapi...|$|E
40|$|Delacour and Mayr (1945) {{placed the}} {{perching}} duck tribe after the pochards (Aythyini) and {{adjacent to the}} sea ducks (Mergini), but hybridization evidence (Johnsgard, 1960 a) clearly indicates that the group belongs between the shelducks and the dabbling ducks and closely adjacent to the latter. There is other evidence to support this arrangement. The tracheae of shelducks, perching ducks, and dabbling ducks are all very similar, possessing bullae which in most species are osseous and rounded, and lacking enlargements of the tracheal tube. The downy young of perching ducks and dabbling ducks are very similar, and are usually patterned with dark brown and white or yellow. Woolfenden (1 96 1) has advocated merging the perching ducks and dabbling ducks into a single tribe (Anatini), but although the two groups do tend to overlap in some of their characteristics, I believe that merging them would result in an unduly large and heterogeneous tribe. Such action would, however, resolve {{the problem of the}} tribal allocations of such species as the <b>Brazilian</b> <b>teal</b> and ringed teal. Some species of perching ducks mature in two years, although the smaller species mature their first year. Nearly all perching ducks have metallic coloration on the upper-wing surface. With few exceptions they do not dive well or frequently, and apparently all use their wings when submerging. Most of them dabble for their food, and some also graze. Nearly all species are hole-nesters, and have relatively long incubation periods. As here constituted the tribe contains thirteen species; those included in it by Delacour (1959), plus an additional species, the ringed teal (Anas leucophrys of Delacour), which is here considered to comprise a separate genus (Callonetta) ...|$|E
