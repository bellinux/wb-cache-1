40|$|A {{manufacturer}} of niche market colored crushed glass was {{having problems with}} the durability of colored coatings on glass, especially under conditions of high moisture. Research was conducted to develop an effective organic coating system for coloring clear glass. Previous Coating System The manufacturer was using a <b>butadienne</b> rubbermodified styrene polymer coating for coloring clear glass. The coatings are solvent-soluble, evaporative drying, and maintained a level of translucence, while providing vivid colors. Under high moisture conditions, however, the coatings were flaking off. The manufacturer already had a considerable investment in application equipment for this coating formulation, and {{was pleased with the}} aesthetics. The goal of the project was to find an additive that would improve the durability of the coatings. Adhesion Issues Laboratory analysis revealed that the coatings developed weak molecular binding forces, no covalent chemical bonds, and little mechanical adhesion (for adhesion definitions see ASTM D 907). When the coating was stressed by water immersion, the weak molecular bond forces were overcome, with resultant delamination. The process was accelerated by water of high purity or high temperature. Microscopic examination showed that delamination occurred on both freshly fractured glass faces and original smooth surfaces. Materials: Coupling Agents Interfacial chemical bonds can be established with dramatic increases in bond strength by the use of coupling agents. Chrome complexes, titanates, and silanes have been reported to be effective in establishing interfacial chemical bonds. Eight commercial products were tested...|$|E
