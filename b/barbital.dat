25|$|The first {{barbiturate}} drug, <b>barbital,</b> was synthesized in 1902 by German chemists Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering and {{was first}} marketed as Veronal by Friedr. Bayer et comp. By 1904, several related drugs, including phenobarbital, had been synthesized by Fischer. Phenobarbital {{was brought to}} market in 1912 by the drug company Bayer as the brand Luminal. It remained a commonly prescribed sedative and hypnotic until the introduction of benzodiazepines in the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Barbituric acid {{was first}} {{synthesized}} November 27, 1864, by German chemist Adolf von Baeyer. This {{was done by}} condensing urea (an animal waste product) with diethyl malonate (an ester derived from the acid of apples). There are several stories about how the substance got its name. The most likely story is that Baeyer and his colleagues went to celebrate their discovery in a tavern where the town's artillery garrison were also celebrating the feast of Saint Barbara– {{the patron saint of}} artillerymen. An artillery officer is said to have christened the new substance by amalgamating Barbara with urea. [...] Another story holds that Baeyer synthesized the substance from the collected urine of a Munich waitress named Barbara. No substance of medical value was discovered, however, until 1903 when two German scientists working at Bayer, Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering, discovered that <b>barbital</b> was very effective in putting dogs to sleep. <b>Barbital</b> was then marketed by Bayer under the trade name Veronal.

50|$|Chloral hydrate {{was first}} {{synthesized}} by the chemist Justus von Liebig in 1832 at the University of Giessen. Through experimentation physiologist Claude Bernard clarified that the chloral hydrate was hypnotic {{as opposed to}} an analgesic. It was the first of a long line of sedatives, most notably the barbiturates, manufactured and marketed by the German pharmaceutical industry. Historically, chloral hydrate was utilized primarily as a psychiatric medication. In 1869, German physician and pharmacologist Oscar Liebreich began to promote its use to calm anxiety, especially when it caused insomnia. Chloral hydrate had certain advantages over morphine for this application, as it worked quickly without injection and had a consistent strength. It achieved wide use in both asylums and the homes of those socially refined enough to avoid asylums. Upper and middle class women, well-represented in the latter category, were particularly susceptible to chloral hydrate addiction. After the 1904 invention of <b>barbital,</b> the first of the barbiturate family, chloral hydrate began to disappear from use among those with means. It remained common in asylums and hospitals until the Second World War as it was quite cheap. Chloral hydrate had some other important advantages that kept it in use for five decades despite the existence of more advanced barbiturates. It was the safest available sedative until the middle of the twentieth century, and thus was thus particularly favored for children. It also left patients much more refreshed after a deep sleep than more recently invented sedatives. Its frequency of use made it an early and regular feature in the Merck Manual.|$|E
40|$|Koppanyi, Murphy and Krop (1) {{have shown}} that after the {{intravenous}} injection of <b>barbital,</b> there is {{a sharp decline in}} the <b>barbital.</b> content of the blood, followed by a slow decrease which continues until the <b>barbital</b> entirely disappears. The first de-cline which occurs within the first hour is due to the uptake of <b>barbital</b> by the organs and tissues. It ends when the <b>barbital</b> content of the organs has reached a maximum concentration for the dose administered. The second decline occurs as <b>barbital</b> is eliminated, and is almost entirely absent in nephrectomized animals where the principal path for the excretion of <b>barbital</b> has been made unavailable. This work shall attempt to correlate the disappearance of <b>barbital</b> from the blood with its accumulation in the various or-gans. It should also indicate whether there are certain cells which have a special affinity for barbiturates or whether the amount of barbiturate in a cell is dependent on such physical factors as the efficiency of the circulation, or the relative solubility of the barbiturate in the blood and cell materials.

40|$|In the {{age when}} {{there are so many}} users of {{narcotic}} drugs as at the present, it is rather surprising that nothing definite is known about the concentration of <b>barbital</b> in blood after its administration; and this can be keenly realized if one takes into consideration the fact that <b>barbital</b> {{is one of the most}} frequently used narcotic drugs. This aroused my interest in intiating the study on the <b>barbital</b> concentration in body. I have examined human body repeatedly with the use of Goldschmidt's method and measured the <b>barbital</b> concentration in blood. As the results, it has been found that the <b>barbital</b> concentration in blood reaches its maximum about two hours after its administration, and although it gradually decreases thereafter, it still maintains a relatively high level after twenty-four hours. This point coincides well with that of drugs clinically used for inducing lasting sleep...|$|E
