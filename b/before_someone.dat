25|$|It {{appears from}} {{the title page}} of Johannes Bureus' runic primer that Bureus had some {{understanding}} of the staveless runes in 1611, but {{that this has been}} denied by virtually all runologists. Since Bureus had not succeeded in deciphering the runes, a large poster with the image of two runestones with staveless runes was published in 1624 together with the announcement of a royal reward for the one who could decipher them. It would, however, take half a century <b>before</b> <b>someone</b> found the solution.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most {{important}} work. As his symptoms subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. In the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, patents were considered essential, not only to protect original work, but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas <b>before</b> <b>someone</b> else did—and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent firm in Worcester, who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{function}} of the pusdalyvis is to indicate a simultaneous, but secondary action done by the sentence subject in nominative case (it must be matched according to gender and number with the said subject): Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuodami – We were doing the field works while singing. In this case the present padalyvis participle {{can be used as}} well: Lauko darbus mes dirbome dainuojant, but this time the sentence will mean: We were doing the field works while someone else was singing. A secondary action done previously by the sentence subject can be expressed with adjectival past simple participle: Lauko darbus mes dirbome padainavę – We were doing the field works having sung. When used with the preposition prieš (before), pusdalyvis and padalyvis denote a secondary action in future: Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuodami. – We were doing the field works before singing. Lauko darbus mes dirbome prieš dainuojant. – We were doing the field works <b>before</b> <b>someone</b> else started to sing.|$|E

5|$|In his poetry, Chivers {{made use}} of legends and themes from Native American culture, {{particularly}} the Cherokee, though often with Christian overtones. He was also heavily influenced {{by the work of}} François-René de Chateaubriand and Emanuel Swedenborg. Many of Chivers's poems included themes of death and sorrow, often using images of shrouds, coffins, angels, and reunions with lost loves in the afterlife. Religious conventions at the time made discussion of death popular, as was reflected in poetry. Because of his background as a doctor, Chivers was able to graphically depict the last moments <b>before</b> <b>someone's</b> death.|$|R

25|$|After 1979, the Dhammadayada {{program began}} {{to include a}} {{temporary}} ordination. In Thailand, {{it had been a}} tradition for men to ordain for the monastic rains retreat (vassa) as a rite of passage before becoming adult. These ordinations were becoming shorter, and the temple was trying to reverse this trend. During such a training program at the temple, participants typically started off with rigorous physical training to prepare themselves for the program. When the training started, they kept the eight precepts, slept under mosquito nets in the open air, and meditated for four to eight hours per day. After this preparatory training, they ordained for the remaining period of at least one month. Ordination ceremonies were held at Wat Benchamabophit. The program initially focused on university students, starting with network of friends of Luang Por Dhammajayo and Luang Por Dattajivo. During the period of the temple's construction, the Dhammadayada ordination plan gave training to hundreds of students, who swelled the number of residents in the temple community. For monks who stayed on for longer, ordaining for life was emphasized more than in other temples, though considerable screening took place <b>before</b> <b>someone</b> could do so. For women, a parallel training program was held from 1986 onwards, in which the eight precepts were kept, but the women did not shave their hair in the manner of mae chis or nuns.|$|E

The silhouette appeared {{on the side of a}} building in TriBeCa, with an identical depiction along the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, facing the downtown skyline. The Brooklyn Heights piece was eventually buffed out by the city, requiring chemicals and a high-powered pressure washer. The removal followed a taunt Banksy had directed toward the city on his website. Meanwhile, the sister piece in TriBeCa served as a shrine, people placing flowers next to it and as well as a letter asking no one to touch the painting.

500|$|After the Liberals won the 1938 election, with Playford having {{transferred}} to Gumeracha, Butler sought to tame Playford's aggressive oratory approach towards the LCL cabinet by offering him a ministry. Playford entered the cabinet in March 1938 as the Commissioner of Crown Lands, and held portfolios in Irrigation and Repatriation. The new frontbencher subsequently adopted {{a more moderate}} style of parliamentary conduct. Butler abandoned the Premiership in November to seek election for the federal seat of Wakefield, a Liberal stronghold that had been vacated {{by the death of}} sitting member Charles Hawker in an aviation accident. [...] Despite having been in cabinet for only a few months, Playford was unanimously elected as the new leader of the LCL by his peers, and thus became the 33rd Premier of South Australia. [...] Like Butler, he also served as Treasurer of South Australia.

Wearing a black vest, trousers and a red skinny tie, Brown then leads a mob of kids, teenagers and older residents down the street. As the first chorus nears, Brown begins his first dance sequence with two male dancers. Together, they pull off high mid-air twirls, each seemingly jumping several feet above the ground. Brown then follows a woman down the street, and runs into four female dancers wearing tank tops and suspenders. Together, they perform arm movements, and work in a few hip thrusts. The next scene, Brown is seen at a storefront labeled [...] "Popin Pete's" [...] and continues more dancing with Pete. During the bridge, Brown can be seen wearing a hot pink/salmon-colored blazer, gold chain and, in one shot, carrying a massive shiny boombox. Brown then rallies the crowd from a fire escape just <b>before</b> <b>someone</b> opens a fire hydrant and unleashes a spray of water onto the crowd. In the final scene, Brown is wearing a peach blazer while baring his chest, and performs the last bit of choreography with male and female dancers.
