5|$|In 1832 {{engineer}} James Green advised on {{extending the}} system, and suggested a line with three inclined planes to reach Cwmmawr, further up the Gwendraeth Valley. Although Green had experience with inclined planes on other canals, he underestimated {{the cost and}} could not complete the work. He was sacked in 1836, but the canal company finished the new route the following year. The canal was moderately successful, and shareholders received dividends from 1858. In 1865 the company {{changed its name to}} become the Kidwelly and <b>Burry</b> Port Railway, amalgamated with the company running <b>Burry</b> Port in the following year, and the canal became the <b>Burry</b> Port and Gwendraeth Valley Railway in 1869.|$|E
5|$|No further {{changes were}} made to the canal after the {{extensions}} were completed, and satisfactory levels of traffic were carried. Fifty-two barges were operational in 1835, although their size is unknown. The canal was dredged in 1858, and shareholders began to receive dividends on their investments that same year. Most of the traffic was anthracite coal, which was shipped through <b>Burry</b> Port. Some culm was still shipped through Kidwelly. Major users in 1863 consisted of two collieries at Pwll y Llygod and one at Pontyberem. Success was short-lived, however, as railways started to appear in the region. Faced with the threat of the Carmarthenshire Railway building a branch to Pontyberem, the Canal Company obtained a new Act of Parliament, and became the Kidwelly and <b>Burry</b> Port Railway Company in 1865. The following year, the <b>Burry</b> Port and Gwendreath Valley Railway company was formed, by amalgamating with the <b>Burry</b> Port Harbour Company. (The spelling of Gwendraeth was wrong in the Act of Parliament.) The new company built a railway from <b>Burry</b> Port to Pontyberem, along the towpath over Pinged marsh, and on the bed of the canal elsewhere. This opened in July 1869. An extension to Kidwelly harbour followed in June 1873, and one to Cwmmawr in June 1886.|$|E
5|$|An Act of Parliament dated 10 June 1825 {{created the}} New Harbour Company, with powers {{to build the}} harbour at Tywyn Bach, on the sands near Pembrey. The Act {{included}} powers to build a short section of canal to link with {{the line of the}} Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal. The new harbour was completed in 1832. The community of <b>Burry</b> Port did not exist in 1825, and it was not until 1835 that the name of the company was changed to the <b>Burry</b> Port Company by another Act of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Once the {{construction}} of a new harbour had begun, the Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal Company constructed a tramway from Llanelli to Pwll colliery. Another tramway was built from <b>Burry</b> Port to the coal levels at New Lodge, with a branch to Kilrhos. The company planned to link New Lodge to Pwll in due course, so that there would be a tramway link from <b>Burry</b> Port harbour to Llanelli; the connection was eventually opened on 8 July 1837.|$|E
5|$|Although Carmarthenshire is less frequented as {{a tourist}} {{destination}} than some other counties in Wales, it offers {{a wide range of}} outdoor activities. Much of the coast is fairly flat; it includes the Millennium Coastal Park, which extends for ten miles to the west of Llanelli; the National Wetlands Centre; a championship golf course; and the harbours of <b>Burry</b> Port and Pembrey. Further west are the sandy beaches at Llansteffan and Pendine, and Dylan Thomas' boathouse at Laugharne. Further inland {{there are a number of}} medieval castles, hillforts and standing stones.|$|E
5|$|The wooden Pontnewydd aqueduct, {{which was}} prone to the river flowing over its top, was {{replaced}} by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide more room for the river to flow under it. Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, and {{the banks of the}} Kymer canal were raised by , to allow the water level to be raised. This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to be raised. At the southern end, access to <b>Burry</b> Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835.|$|E

5|$|Llanelli, Ammanford and {{the upper}} parts of the Gwendraeth Valley are {{situated}} on the South Wales Coalfield. The opencast mining activities in this region have now ceased but the old mining settlements with terraced housing remain, often centred on their nonconformist chapels. Kidwelly had a tin-plating industry in the eighteenth century, with Llanelli following not long after, {{so that by the}} end of the nineteenth century, Llanelli was the world-centre of the industry. There is little trace of these industrial activities today. Llanelli and <b>Burry</b> Port served at one time for the export of coal, but trade declined, as it did from the ports of Kidwelly and Carmarthen as their estuaries silted up. Country towns in the more agricultural part of the county still hold regular markets where livestock is traded.|$|E
5|$|The {{newly formed}} company was {{required}} to complete the extension from Pwll y Llygod to Pontyates and {{the first section of}} the Llanelly branch {{to the point where it}} crossed the Ashburnham Canal within six years. Anthony Bower was the engineer, and construction was contracted to Pinkerton and Allen. The canal reached the new aqueduct across the Gwendraeth Fawr in 1815, but little progress was made between then and 1817. Much of the limited capital raised had been spent on attempts to re-open the harbour, with little success. A second Act of Parliament was obtained on 28 May 1818, which extended the time limit for building the canal and removed the requirement to clear the river channels to the harbour. Pinkerton and Allen pressed on with construction, completing the routes to Pontyates and the Ashburnham Canal crossing in 1824, while the company directors asked the engineers John Rennie and Edward Bankes to examine the issue of a suitable harbour. Rennie suggested extending the canal towards what is now <b>Burry</b> Port, and the construction of a new harbour on the sands at Tywyn Bach.|$|E
5|$|Bale reprised {{his role}} as Wayne / Batman {{in the second part}} of Nolan's Batman film series, the sequel of 2005's Batman Begins {{entitled}} The Dark Knight (2008). After its release, the film received highly positive reviews and is considered one of the best films of the 2000s. With more than $1 billion in revenue worldwide, it is the thirteenth highest-grossing film of all time. A year later, he starred in the fourth installment of the Terminator film series, Terminator Salvation (2009) as John Connor. The film was poorly received by most movie critics, however, it was a commercial success. The same year, Bale starred together with Johnny Depp in the critical and commercial success Public Enemies as FBI agent Melvin Purvis. He acted alongside Mark Wahlberg in the biographical sports drama The Fighter (2010) as Dicky Eklund. The film was critically acclaimed and a commercial success. The Fighter earned Bale the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor at the 83rd Academy Awards. In 2012, Bale starred in the third and final installment of Nolan's Batman film trilogy entitled The Dark Knight Rises as Wayne / Batman. As with its prequels, the film received positive acclaim from movie critics. The Dark Knight Rises has earned more than $1 billion worldwide thus becoming the seventh highest-grossing film worldwide and the third highest-grossing film of 2012. For {{his role as}} Michael <b>Burry</b> in the biographical dramedy The Big Short, he was nominated for an Academy Award and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor.|$|E

500|$|The Kidwelly and Llanelly Canal [...] was a {{canal and}} {{tramroad}} system in Carmarthenshire, Wales, built to carry anthracite coal {{to the coast}} for onward transportation by coastal ships. It began life as Kymer's Canal in 1766, which linked pits at Pwll y Llygod to a dock near Kidwelly. Access to the dock gradually became more difficult as the estuary silted up, and an extension to Llanelli was authorised in 1812. Progress was slow, and the new canal was linked to a harbour at Pembury built by Thomas Gaunt in the 1820s, until the company's own harbour at <b>Burry</b> Port was completed in 1832. Tramways served a number of collieries {{to the east of}} <b>Burry</b> Port.|$|E

500|$|After graduation, Davies {{returned}} {{to work in the}} mines, initially at Tumble in the Gwendraeth Valley. In December 1913 he unsuccessfully sought election as miners' sub-agent for the Anthracite Miners' district of the SWMF. When the First World War began in August 1914 he opposed it as capitalist militarism: [...] "History teaches that war invariably brings in its wake a lower standard of morality, a restriction of the liberty of the masses, and a degradation of their social conditions". In 1917 Davies founded and was first chairman of the <b>Burry</b> Port and Gwendraeth Valley Trades and Labour Council. He was initially selected as the Labour candidate for the Llanelli constituency in the 1918 general election, but stood down when the SWMF backed his rival, J. H. Williams.|$|E
