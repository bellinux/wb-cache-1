From the results obtained the browning that occured on the <b>boiled-off</b> <b>silk</b> by the 	action of sunlight can be deduced as follows. It seems that the browning occurs mainly 	by melanin and the like which is produced by the oxidation of tyrosine, i. e. the phenol 	group of tyrosine in the silk becomes active by the absorbtion of ultra-violet rays;on the 	other hand oxygen and moisture which are contained in air {{as well as in}} fibres become 	also active. Here upon the active oxygen and moistue oxidise the activated tyrosine. 	In addition to this other amino acids contained in the silk fibre and such impurities as ca-soap on the fibre can also be oxidised and cause the browning of fibre feebly...|$|E
