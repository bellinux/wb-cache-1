However, in the southwest where soils are exceedingly fertile <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> and the climate is a little more moderate, there is extensive cropping of wheat, barley, rye and potatoes, along with the grazing of large numbers of sheep and cattle. Elsewhere food production, owing to the poor fertility of the podzolic soils and the extremely short growing seasons, is restricted to the herding of reindeer in the tundra—which has been practiced by natives for over 10,000 years. Siberia has the world's largest forests. Timber remains an important source of revenue, even though many forests in the east have been logged much more rapidly than they are able to recover. The Sea of Okhotsk is one of the two or three richest fisheries in the world owing to its cold currents and very large tidal ranges, and thus Siberia produces over 10% of the world's annual fish catch, although fishing has declined somewhat since the collapse of the USSR.|$|E

40|$|Typescript. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii, 1965. Bibliography: leaves 103 - 105 a. [4], vi, 115 l illus. (part col., mounted), tablesMorphological, physical, chemical, and mineralogical {{properties}} of six Black Earth profiles {{from the island}} of Oahu, Hawaii were studied. 1 he probable source of the dark color was also investigated. The {{properties of}} these soils were {{compared with those of}} the <b>Black</b> <b>Earths</b> in other countries. The soils were classified by the new V. S. D. A. Comprehensive Soil Classification System. Dark color, heavy clay texture, granular mulch, and slickensides on the surfaces of parallelepipeds were characteristic of most of the profiles. Hence, they are similar to other <b>Black</b> <b>Earths</b> in morphology. The silt contents and bulk density values shown by the profiles were lower than other <b>Black</b> <b>Earths.</b> The clay contents and, subsequently, the moisture retention at saturation, at moisture equivalent, and at 15 atmospheres were higher. The pH values of the Hawaii <b>Black</b> <b>Earths</b> were similar to those from other countries but the ΔpH values were much higher. Calcium and magnesium status was high. Exchangeable calcium was similar in range and magnitude to other <b>Black</b> <b>Earths,</b> but the exchangeable magnesium was In the higher extreme of the range of this particular group of soils. Organic matter levels, exchangeable sodium and potassium, and cation-exchange-capacity values were comparable to other <b>Black</b> <b>Earths.</b> Total SiO 2 and total Fe 2 O 3 levels suggested that one of the profiles was perhaps a Black Earth intergrade to Red Earths. Montmorillonitic clay was dominant. Kaolinite and halloysite were also components of the colloidal clay fractions. Feldspars dominated the sand fractions, while magnetite, ilmenite, and hematite occupied the greater bulk of the silt fractions. The magnetic opaque minerals in the silt and sand fractions were perhaps the main contributor to the dark color of the soils. Classification of the soils according to the categories prescribed by the 7 th Approximation was not very satisfactory. A modification of the scheme using the same principles was proposed...|$|E

30|$|Finally, it is {{noteworthy}} that no evidence on the use of <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> (black shale and black chalk) has been found to-date in murals and wall paintings.

30|$|The <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> from Piedmont {{are related}} to {{deposits}} which occur in Boca and Vicoforte. The former occur within Pleistocene deltaic-lagoon and fluvial deposits; the black earth comes from clayey-rich lignite and turf horizons which are in {{the lower part of}} the sequence. The latter deposits occur in marsh and lacustrine environment which correspond to the sub-aerial weathering of the Triassic calcareous-dolomitic formation [10].|$|E
30|$|Terminology used {{to define}} <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> is general, vague and unclear {{with regard to the}} {{correspondence}} between the name of the pigment used in different epochs and its specific mineralogical and chemical composition. Furthermore, no distinction is reported in distinguishing organic and inorganic sources. Here, French, Spanish, German and Italian treatises and modern and contemporary literature have been consulted to understanding the use of this uncommon black pigment in different pictorial techniques. Polarizing Light Microscopy (PLM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analytical techniques are used to characterize both the raw materials collected in Veneto and Piedmont (Italy) and the <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> available on Italian and German markets. Results indicate that the studied materials are clay minerals rich compounds, in which the colouring fraction is due to the presence of carbonaceous matter and amorphous iron oxides. Depending on the microstructure, black shale and black chalk were identified. The properties of these materials when used in a fresco and a secco techniques are generally very good, as reported in the written sources, even if fading is observed when replicas were exposed in outdoor environment.|$|E
30|$|Indications {{concerning}} the possible use of black painting raw materials occur in north-eastern Italy near Verona, {{where it is}} well known that earth pigments have been exploited since ancient times. According to Federici [9], “black earth” from San Giovanni Ilarione is a black coloured marl - due to the presence of carbonaceous matter - which is associated with basaltic rocks. During the 1940 s three local mine owners exploited <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> and sold these as pigment to numerous local paint factories.|$|E

30|$|It {{seems that}} the final colour is {{strongly}} dependent on these parameters. Regarding grain size, the best results were obtained when the finest fraction extracted with dry and wet methods was used; in fact tinting strength of carbon-based pigments is dependent on particle size [1]. Naturally, the product available on the market gave very good results because its grain size and homogeneity have been carefully controlled industrially. Another important factor is the partial instability of the raw materials in air and sunlight as reported in Table  4. This behaviour was also noted in the case of charcoal black as carbon-based pigments produced by combustion may contain tarry material which can bleeds [2]. Finally, the collected <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> turned grey or faded when mixed with alkaline media such as lime and caseinates; this behaviour was not observed with commercially available <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> with similar mineralogical and chemical composition. On the other hand, good permanence was observed {{in the case of a}} fresco painting technique. An adequate discussion on this issue would require an in-depth analysis of the composition of the C-based fraction and of possible impurities which seem to have an active role in the stability of some black pigments with alkaline media [1].|$|E
30|$|Carbon-based {{pigments}} are a {{group of}} dark-colored materials that are classified according to the starting material and the manufacturing process. They are composed by some form of elemental carbon and four groups may be distinguished: graphite, flame carbons, chars, and cokes [1 – 3]. On the other hand, <b>black</b> <b>earths</b> containing amorphous carbonaceous materials, such as Vandyke brown and Cassel earth have also been used as pigments. These humic-earth materials are composed of complex mixtures of natural organic substances derived from animal and vegetable sources with varying proportions of mineral matter [4].|$|E

30|$|OM {{revealed}} that {{this area of}} paint was applied wet-into-wet (see Fig.  4 a, b), which indicated that these carnation colors were modeled in successive layers while the paint was still wet. Hence, the sample seemingly comprised about five layers, namely a red layer, a dark red-brown paint, an orange–brown paint layer, dark brown paint and a final orange–brown paint layer (Fig.  4 b). These red to dark brown blended paint layers contained mixtures of calcium, lead white, iron- and silica-rich earths and/or manganese-based brown earths and small amounts of organic red lake. The usage of distinct pigment mixtures containing calcite, lead white, carbon <b>black,</b> <b>earths</b> and vermilion in various proportions {{as well as the}} wet-into-wet application of the carnation colors thus corresponded to the young Van Dyck’s modus operandi.|$|E
