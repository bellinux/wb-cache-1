40|$|M. A. (Clinical Psychology) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2005 This {{study focused}} on the psychosocial effects and coping {{mechanisms}} of <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> in the Mafikeng area {{following the death of}} their spouses. A descriptive research design was used in collecting data. A sample of forty-eight <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> aged between twenty-five and seventy years was randomly selected {{for the purpose of this}} study. A questionnaire was administered to the sample. This questionnaire contained both open-ended and close-ended questions. Beck's Depression Inventory was also used in the collection of data to assess the level of depression if any. A descriptive statistical analysis of data was used to analyse the collected data. The findings indicated that most <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> experience psychological problems such as loneliness and depression due to withdrawal. There was also an indication that most <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> experienced social problems like being discriminated against and rejection by friends, relatives as well as neighbours due to the stigma associated with widowhood. However, there is an indication that some <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> do experience a positive perception from their employers and have a positive relationship with their in-laws. This study also confirmed that some <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> use inappropriate coping mechanisms such as withdrawal from the societal activities in fear of humiliation in dealing with their widowhood. Some resort to religion as another way of coping with their loss. The majority of older widows considered remarriage as a poor option while younger widows considered remarriage as viable. The grip on widows by traditional rituals is also diminishing especially among young, successful and educated widows. Having undertaken this study the implication is that <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> are mainly stigmatized in the society in which they live. They are even humiliated through restrictions that are put before them. For instance, performance of rituals and customs. Some of those who are employed experience a negative perception from both their employers and their colleagues because of the stigma. However. there still some <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> who still enjoy the moral support of their in-laws, employers and also that of their colleagues. Master...|$|R

5|$|Although the 'kātĕpo' was {{reported}} to the Linnean Society as early as 1855, the spider was formally described as Latrodectus katipo by L. Powell in 1870. Spiders of the genus Latrodectus have a worldwide distribution and include all of the commonly known widow spiders: the North American <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider (Latrodectus mactans), the brown widow (Latrodectus geometricus), and the European <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus). The katipo's closest relative is the Australian redback spider (Latrodectus hasseltii) Latrodectus katipo and L. atritus (black katipo) were previously thought to be two separate species, but {{research has shown that}} they are a single species, L. katipo, with colour variation that is clinal over latitude and correlated with mean annual temperature. The katipo is so closely related to the redback that it was at one stage thought to be a subspecies, with the proposed name Latrodectus hasseltii katipo. Further research has shown that the katipo is distinct from the redback, having slight structural differences and striking differences in habitat preference, and it remains its own species. The katipo's family Theridiidae has a large number of species both in New Zealand and worldwide and are commonly known as tangle-web spiders, cobweb spiders or comb-footed spiders.|$|E

5|$|During {{the entire}} period of 1970–74, FRELIMO {{intensified}} guerrilla operations, specialising in urban terrorism. The use of landmines also intensified, with sources stating {{that they had}} become responsible for two {{out of every three}} Portuguese casualties. During the conflict, FRELIMO used a variety of anti-tank and anti-personnel mines, including the PMN (<b>Black</b> <b>Widow),</b> TM-46, and POMZ. Even amphibious mines were used, such as the PDM. Mine psychosis, an acute fear of landmines, was rampant in the Portuguese forces. This fear, coupled with the frustration of taking casualties without ever seeing the enemy forces, damaged morale and significantly hampered progress.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Johansson debuted on Broadway in {{a revival}} of A View from the Bridge, which won her a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress. Later that year, she began portraying <b>Black</b> <b>Widow</b> in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She voiced an {{intelligent}} computer operating system in the 2013 comedy-drama Her, and played an alien in the 2013 science fiction film Under the Skin, {{as well as a}} woman with psychokinetic abilities in the 2014 science fiction action Lucy.

50|$|The Ventura <b>Black</b> <b>Widows,</b> a women's tackle {{football}} Tier 3 team, {{was founded}} in 2008 by Ahmad Newton of Los Angeles, CA. Originally {{a member of the}} National Women’s Football Association (NWFA), they became independent when the league folded later that same year. Shortly after, an up-start league, the WFA, invited the Ventura <b>Black</b> <b>Widows</b> to join. Due to the Black Widows' small roster, the team decided to play 8-on-8. After two independent seasons, the <b>Black</b> <b>Widows</b> were invited to join the Women’s Spring Football League in 2010. During their tenure in the WSFL, the VBW won two Southwest Division titles: taking the first one in 2011 and the second in 2013. The next year saw them join the Independent Women's Football League (IWFL) where they continue their active membership.|$|R

5|$|Johansson {{learned some}} Russian {{from a former}} teacher {{on the phone for}} her role of <b>Black</b> <b>Widow</b> in The Avengers (2012), another entry from the MCU. The film {{received}} positive reviews and broke many box office records, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide. For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards. Later that year, Johansson portrayed the actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's Hitchcock, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. Roger Ebert believed that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor.|$|E
5|$|The {{specific}} {{variant of}} the vertebrate toxin found in the redback was cloned and sequenced in 2012, and {{was found to be}} a sequence of 1180 amino acids, with a strong similarity to the equivalent molecule across the Latrodectus mactans clade. The syndromes caused by bites from any spiders of the Latrodectus genus have similarities; there is some evidence there is a higher incidence of sweating, and local and radiating pain with the redback, while <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> envenomation results in more back and abdominal pain, and abdominal rigidity is a feature common with bites from the west coast button spider (Latrodectus indistinctus) of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when it approaches the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E
