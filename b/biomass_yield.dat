In our experiences, we achieved an adequate establishment and biomass production, and assumed a rank of <b>biomass</b> <b>yields</b> {{until the end of}} the life cycle that is usually accepted to be about 15 years in many other studies in United States, Argentina and Eastern Europe where tall wheatgrass is extensively cultivated in marginal areas for sheep livestock production. Using our experimental plots and statistical information for economic inputs costs, we built 5 different scenarios per region considering a large range of <b>biomass</b> <b>yields</b> of tall wheatgrass. The analysis included a comparison with annual grasses economic costs calculated for a wide range of <b>biomass</b> <b>yields</b> of a previous study. We estimated GHG emissions savings for tall wheatgrasses and used our previous study (which had GHG emissions savings as well).

In a wide range of yields, the results suggest that marginal areas might present a better performance with tall wheatgrass compared to annual winter grasses (cereals whole plant cuttings), thus producing <b>biomass</b> <b>yields</b> with higher GHG savings and lower economic costs at the farm level. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

50|$|Lachancea kluyveri is {{a budding}} yeast related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or baker's yeast, the model {{organism}} intensively used in biochemistry, genetics and cell biology. In 2003 it was {{transferred from the}} genus Saccharomyces to the genus Lachancea named for Canadian mycologist and yeast biologist Marc-André Lachance. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and L. kluyveri have several fundamental differences that warrant genomic comparisons. First, like most cell types, L. kluyveri resorts to fermentation (degrading sugars {{in the absence of}} oxygen) only when oxygen is limiting. S. cerevisiae, on the other hand, prefers to carry out fermentation even in the presence of oxygen. This means that L. kluyveri makes a more efficient use of glucose for energy production. Therefore, L. kluyveri provides a contrasting model {{to one of the most}} unusual features of S. cerevisiae. Second, L. kluyveri has a simpler genome organization than S. cerevisiae: it appears to have become a species before the whole genome duplication that occurred in the Saccharomyces lineage. As a result, its genome is smaller (about 9.5 million base pairs) than that of S. cerevisiae with fewer duplicated genes. Additionally, L. kluyveri is becoming more widely used as a model organism and for industrial applications, such as the production of proteins, since its <b>biomass</b> <b>yield</b> is greater than that of S. cerevisiae due to more efficient use of glucose.|$|E

Our primary goal was to understand whether patterns in plant community composition and the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) were related to productivity as evidenced by dormant season <b>biomass</b> <b>yield.</b> FQI is an objective measure of how closely a plant community represents that of a pre-European settlement community. Our research was conducted in planted fields of native tallgrass prairie species, and provided a gradient in floristic quality index, species richness, species diversity, and species evenness in south-central Wisconsin during 2008 and 2009. We used a network of 15 randomly located 1 m 2 plots within each field to characterize the plant community and estimate <b>biomass</b> <b>yield</b> by clipping the plots {{at the end of each}} growing season.

Previous studies have indicated the potential for higher total biomass production from maize genotypes with delayed shoot maturation, which accumulate more stover at the expense of grain yield. However, genetic variation for total <b>biomass</b> <b>yields</b> or their response to nitrogen has not been characterized extensively among maize hybrids with delayed shoot maturation. The objective {{of this study was to}} directly compare total <b>biomass</b> <b>yields</b> among a diverse group of maize hybrids where shoot maturation was delayed in two ways: either by crossing genetically diverse temperate-adapted inbreds with photoperiod-sensitive inbreds of largely tropical origin, or by overexpression of the maize Glossy 15 gene in different temperate-adapted hybrids. Biomass and nitrogen accumulation in stover and grain were evaluated for these genotypes in field trials on nitrogen-limiting (no supplemental fertilizer) or nitrogen-sufficient soils (200 kg N fertilizer per hectare).

Results indicated that chemical composition, <b>biomass</b> <b>yield,</b> and specific methane yield of Pennisetum hybrid were significantly influenced by harvest period and cutting frequency. The contents of total solids, volatile solids, carbon, cellulose, lignin and starch increased with a prolonged harvest period, whereas the nitrogen and {{crude protein content}} decreased.

On-farm switchgrass field scale trials, which were initiated to obtain economic production information for switchgrass grown as a bioenergy crop in the northern Plains, provided information on establishment year stands and post-establishment year yields and stands both within and across fields and {{were used to determine}} if a stand threshold exists for switchgrass grown as a biomass energy crop. Switchgrass was seeded in 10 cropland fields, ranging in size from 3 to 9. 5 ha, in Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota in 2000 and 2001. The fields were selected to be representative of their region and eligible for the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Twelve sites within each field were geo-referenced, and switchgrass stand frequency was measured at each sample site. <b>Biomass</b> <b>yields</b> were estimated in late summer at the same within field sites using a clipped quadrant. Fields with low initial switchgrass stand frequencies showed a linear relationship between initial switchgrass stands and second year stands and <b>biomass</b> <b>yields.</b> Results from the 10 field, three-state study indicated that establishment year stand frequency level of 40 % or greater, determined by a frequency grid, can be considered an establishment year stand threshold for establishment success and subsequent post-planting year <b>biomass</b> <b>yields</b> for switchgrass. An establishment year stand frequency of 25 % would be adequate for a switchgrass conservation planting in which no harvests would be planned for several years...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of 10 selected poplar cultivars from the Aigeiros and Tacamahaca sections in short felling cycles for energy purposes and to compare the <b>biomass</b> <b>yields</b> of these cultivars. Additional aims were to preliminarily identify a suitable cycle length and preliminarily evaluate the sprouting capacity of various cultivars under the climatic conditions of northern Poland.|$|R
