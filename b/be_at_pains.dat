60|$|Winterbourne stopped, {{with a sort}} of horror, and, it must be added, {{with a sort of}} relief. It was as if {{a sudden}} {{illumination}} had been flashed upon the ambiguity of Daisy's behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read. She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to respect. He stood there, looking at her--looking at her companion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely, he himself must have been more brightly visible. He felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding Miss Daisy Miller. Then, as he was going to advance again, he checked himself, not from the fear that he was doing her injustice, but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism. He turned away toward the entrance of the place, but, as he did so, he heard Daisy speak again.|$|E
60|$|You {{have seen}} {{something}} of the same heartlessness in his conduct when he discovered the faithlessness of La Binet although that is belied by the measures he took to avenge himself. His subsequent contempt of the woman I account to be born of the affection in which for a time he held her. That this affection was as deep as he first imagined, I do not believe; {{but that it was}} as shallow as he would almost <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to make it appear by the completeness with which he affects to have put her from his mind when he discovered her worthlessness, I do not believe; nor, as I have said, do his actions encourage that belief. Then, again, his callous cynicism in hoping that he had killed Binet is also an affectation. Knowing that such things as Binet are better out of the world, he can have suffered no compunction; he had, you must remember, that rarely level vision which sees things in their just proportions, and never either magnifies or reduces them by sentimental considerations. At the same time, that he should contemplate the taking of life with such complete and cynical equanimity, whatever the justification, is quite incredible.|$|E
60|$|The {{questions}} {{flow from}} the beguiled but puzzled admirer, and their tenor sufficiently expresses the claim I make for the admirable artist when I say that his truth is interfused with poetry. He spurns the literal and yet superabounds in the characteristic, and if he makes the strange familiar he makes the familiar just strange enough to be distinguished. Everything is so human, so humorous and so caught in the act, so buttoned and petticoated and gartered, {{that it might be}} round the corner; and so it is--but the corner is the corner of another world. In that other world Mr. Abbey went forth to dwell in extreme youth, as I need scarcely <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to remind those who have followed him in Harper. It is not important here to give a catalogue of his contributions to that journal: turn to the back volumes and you will meet him at every step. Every one remembers his young, tentative, prelusive illustrations to Herrick, in which there are the prettiest glimpses, guesses and foreknowledge of the effects he was to make completely his own. The Herrick was done mainly, if I mistake not, before he had been to England, and it remains, in the light of this fact, a singularly touching as well as a singularly promising performance. The eye of sense in such a case had to be to a rare extent the mind's eye, and this convertibility of the two organs has persisted.|$|E

6000|$|I think I may assert, {{without the}} least partiality, {{that it is}} a {{treatise}} wholly devoid of wit or learning, under the most violent and weak endeavours and pretences to both. That it is replenished throughout with bold, rude, improbable falsehoods, and gross misinterpretations; and supported by the most impudent sophistry and false logic I have anywhere observed. To this he hath added a paltry, traditional cant of [...] "priestrid" [...] and [...] "priestcraft," [...] without reason or pretext as he applyeth it. And when he raileth at those doctrines in Popery (which no Protestant was ever supposed to believe) he leads the reader, however, by the hand, to make applications against the English clergy, and then he never faileth to triumph, as if he had made a very shrewd and notable stroke. And because the court and kingdom seemeth disposed to moderation with regard to Dissenters, more perhaps than is agreeable to the hot unreasonable temper of some mistaken men among us; therefore under the shelter of that popular opinion, he ridiculeth all that is sound in religion, even Christianity itself, under the names of Jacobite, Tackers, High Church, and other terms of factious jargon. All which, if it were to be first rased from his book (as just so much of nothing to the purpose) how little would remain to give the trouble of an answer! To which let me add, that the spirit or genius, which animates the whole, is plainly perceived to be nothing else but the abortive malice of an old neglected man,[8] who hath long lain under the extremes of obloquy, poverty and contempt; that have soured his temper, and made him fearless. But where is the merit of being bold, to a man that is secure of impunity to his person, and is past apprehension of anything else? He that hath neither reputation nor bread hath very little to lose, and hath therefore as little to fear. And, as it is usually said, [...] "Whoever values not his own life, is master of another man's;" [...] so there is something like it in reputation: He that is wholly lost to all regards of truth or modesty, may scatter so much calumny and scandal, that some part may perhaps be taken up before it fall to the ground; because the ill talent of the world is such, that those who will <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> enough to inform themselves in a malicious story, will take none at all to be undeceived, nay, will be apt with some reluctance to admit a favourable truth.|$|E

5000|$|Daisy Miller {{arrives in}} Frederick Winterbourne's staid world {{the way that}} an angel arrives at an Annunciation, as both promise and challenge. From their first meeting at Vevey, to the story's {{dramatic}} conclusion in Rome, Winterbourne's interest in Daisy is subject to constant censure from his carefully [...] "exclusive" [...] aunt, Mrs Costello, and her forensically respectable social circle: the girl is [...] "not nice," [...] they say, she is overly familiar with her family's courier, she has been observed in inappropriate situations with dubious young [...] "gentlemen" [...] and Winterbourne would clearly do well to distance himself, before the inevitable scandal unfolds.At first sight, it seems that Winterbourne is genuinely torn between romantic attachment and his suffocating social milieu - and that might have made for an engaging, but not uncommon study of love versus convention; however, James' keen observation reveals something deeper than that, for even as he protests his aunt's attacks on Daisy's character (yes, she is uncultivated, he admits, {{but she is not}} the reprobate for which the entire world has decided to mistake her) he is less disappointed than relieved when a nocturnal encounter with the girl and her suitor, Giovanelli, appears to prove Mrs Costello right: [...] "Winterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror; and, it must be added, with a sort of relief. It was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of Daisy's behaviour and the riddle had become easy to read. She was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to respect."

40|$|Liberal egalitarianism {{can offer}} two {{distinct}} {{perspectives on the}} morality of secession from a liberal state. One is permissive. The other is quite restrictive. This essay offers a defence of the latter variant, which is often called Just-Cause theory. On this view, secession can only be morally justified {{as a means to}} rectify past grievances {{on the part of the}} secessionist group. Secession must have a just cause. If none can be found, then the territorial sovereignty of a state that upholds liberal democratic rule cannot be thwarted. According to the rival position – Choice-theory – secession can be justified even in the absence of any injustice. This more permissive view on state breaking is expected to follow from valuing freedom of political association. I demonstrate how both approaches can be developed from central commitments of liberal egalitarian morality. These commitments often come into conflict. And the case of political divorce is no exception. A liberal theory of secession must therefore <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to come up with the best possible balancing of important, yet incongruous, commitments. In that respect, I argue that the Just-Cause approach represents the best overall liberal egalitarian theory of secession...|$|E
40|$|Sociology, hybrids {{and social}} reality: {{the case of}} nuclear waste The {{continuing}} technological transformation of nature means that sociology’s traditional vision of a sharp divide between nature and society is becoming ever harder to defend. Starting from Bruno Latour’s critique of modernity, and Nikolas Rose’s explorations of political power beyond the state, this article presents a framework for analysing the expanding wealth of hybrids of nature and society surrounding us today, and the problems of government they pose. These hybrids confront us {{with the need to}} rethink sociology’s conception of ‘the social’. With Latour’s help, the interplay of nature and society can be understood as subject to technical mediation, opening the way for studies of the varying arrangements through which different configurations of nature and society are produced. Rather than alternative social constructions of nature, what sociologists should <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to analyse and question are different programmes and strategies for bringing together natural and social forces in durable combinations. In the article, the geological disposal of nuclear waste serves as a useful example for exploring the fruitfulness of the analytical framework put forward. This complex undertaking constitutes just one component in a larger field of technoscientific endeavour that has irrevocably transformed nature while simultaneously re-making society. Addressing this case, we seek to reveal the promise of a sociology that does not bound ‘the social’ in advance, but rather makes the co-production of technology and society one of its most important objects of study.

40|$|During 1997 – 8, 1998 – 9 and 1999 – 2000 an {{educational}} project involving {{the rescue of}} an archaeological site {{dating back to the}} Neolithic was run in the municipality of Sant Quirze del Vallès (Catalonia, Spain) with the participation of the secondary schools of Sant Quirze del Vallès (IES Sant Quirze) and Barbera ̀ del Vallès (IES La Romànica). The project was designed with two objectives in mind: first, to test the implementation of a real research project led by professionals in the field with baccalaureate pupils and, second, to develop positive attitudes towards valuing archaeological heritage through understanding the historical significance of the site and the involvement of young people in its recovery for the municipality. Keywords Educational methodologies; archaeological heritage; local landscape; Spanish education system. All too often, searching for a wider world into which to expand, almost all disciplinary approaches fall into a narrow focus on their own interests and priorities.

40|$|This thesis {{will seek}} to examine the {{parallel}} which it will argue exists between the theorising of artistic inspiration and the resulting conception of {{the figure of the}} artist in the works of Joyce and Nietzsche. Recent critical work on the relationship between Joyce and Nietzsche has tended to focus exclusively on the question of influence. In ‘The Struggle against Meta (Phantasma) -Physics: Nietzsche, Joyce and the “Excess of History”’, for example, drawing his reading in particular from The Use and Abuse of History, Joseph Buttigieg gives a broad account of Nietzsche’s conception of history, but, in effect, uses his reading of Nietzsche to simply augment his reading of Joyce, arguing that his conception of the ‘postmodern’ Nietzsche can ‘illuminate and give depth’ to the works of the ‘modernist’ Joyce. In The Aesthetics of James Joyce, Jacques Aubert discusses what he calls the ‘Nietzschean overtones’ of Joyce’s work. Aubert focuses on what he argues is Hegel’s crucial influence on Joyce and appears to align Nietzsche, and Nietzsche’s influence on Joyce, with what he allusively refers to as ‘post-Hegelian’ or ‘Neo-Hegelian’ philosophy, though it is never clear precisely what he intends these to denote. In ‘Beyond Truth and Freedom: The New Faith of Joyce and Nietzsche’, Joseph Valente gives an illuminating account of Joyce and Nietzsche’s mutual rejection of metaphysics, but focuses exclusively on the later Joyce and Nietzsche. Again, Valente frames his argument specifically in terms of an influence, drawing on an idiosyncratic reading of the concept of the ‘superman’ and identifying Stephen Stephen as ‘recognizably Zarathustrian’. The central problem with the critical approach these accounts share in common, which concerns itself with the question of influence, is that it obliges itself to attribute a detailed and philosophically thoroughgoing reading of Nietzsche’s works to Joyce, one not always necessarily in evidence in the criticism itself. It must thus <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> to stretch available biographical information on Joyce’s reading of Nietzsche, as well as examples drawn from Joyce’s texts, in order to fit a partial, incomplete or inaccurate characterisation of Nietzsche’s thought; threatening to transform Joyce into some kind of ‘Nietzschean’ and Nietzsche into some kind of anticipatory ‘Joycean’. By contrast, then, this thesis {{will seek to}} set aside the problematic question of influence from the outset, instead seeking to examine the mutually illuminating parallel which it will argue exists between the theorising of artistic inspiration and the resulting conception of the figure of the artist in the works of Joyce and Nietzsche. It will argue that this parallel has mutually illuminating consequences for an understanding of both Nietzsche and Joyce’s relationships to metaphysics and, through this, to Romanticism. It will be the task of this thesis to explain the way in which both Nietzsche and Joyce retain the key terms of Romantic accounts of artistic inspiration, whilst rejecting the metaphysical claims at stake in them...|$|E
40|$|My task is {{to address}} the {{question}} of how the scientific community views the public understanding of science and whether {{there needs to be a}} re-conceptualization of the challenge to foster the public understanding of science, and also whether there is a need to re-examine assumptions. I am compelled to begin by acknowledging a debt to an important book, Inarticulate Science, written by Edgar Jenkins and his colleagues at Leeds. Inarticulate Science is an outstanding contribution on the concept of the public understanding of science and I think of my contribution today on this topic as a footnote. My perspective is somewhat different in that I have school settings in mind rather than adult learning (also see Lewenstein, 1992). I want {{to address the question}} of how the science community should think about the public understanding of science with respect to what happens in schools; and by school I mean K- 12 school plus the undergraduate science education of non science university majors. Also, I make my remarks from a cultural perspective in that I think it is important to think about how scientific ideas contribute to and influence the worldviews we construct for ourselves. Specifically, I am interested in science as an aspect of different systems of meaning that people construct for making sense of their worlds: 2 ̆ 2 An aspect 2 ̆ 2 of meaning because science is not the entire ball game except for a few people who chose to elevate science to the level of metaphysics; 2 ̆ 2 different systems 2 ̆ 2 because even among scientists there are differences as to how science is used in the construction of meaning. I also want to preface my remarks by noting that I am of course speaking from my experiences as an American science educator. What is happening in the USA, however, does not appear to be unique (see Gaskell, 1996; Sjøberg, 1996). For example, several industrial nations including Norway are involved in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (National Research Council, 1996) for what appear to be the same reasons. UNESCO is promoting Project 2000 + which has a parallel form in the USA. The slogan 2 ̆ 2 Science for All 2 ̆ 2 can be heard worldwide; but, I also think that given the enormous size of the American scientific and education establishments along with publishing interests that what happens in the USA can hardly go unnoticed or unfelt. Nonetheless I will <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>pains</b> not to appear overly Yankee-centric. The structure of my remarks will be as follows. I begin with a celebration of science but then move on to discuss what concerns the scientific community has about the public. From here I address the key problematic element within the scientific community itself, the epistemology of scientific positivism. This epistemology creates considerable difficulties for the community of science within the public square. Finally, I begin with the end. Let me say at the onset where I am headed. Yes, the science community does need to re conceptualize the challenge and re-examine its assumptions about the public understanding of science. The science community 2 ̆ 7 s historic perspective on the public is grounded in the legitimate interests of science; but, the promotion of the public understanding of science needs to be grounded in the public 2 ̆ 7 s legitimate interests in science. The distinction between the prepositions 2 ̆ 2 of 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 in 2 ̆ 2 is crucial and I owe this insight to physicist Martin Eger (1989). Eger 2 ̆ 7 s distinction is similar to Ziman 2 ̆ 7 s (1984, 1991, 1992) science insiders and outsiders, which was also adopted by Jenkins (1992) and Layton et al (1993) ...|$|E
