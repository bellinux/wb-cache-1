5|$|Northallerton was {{formerly}} a parliamentary borough. Its first representatives were John le Clerk and Stephen Maunsell, who were {{elected to the}} parliament of King Edward I in 1298, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> reason or other no subsequent return was made until 1640, when the privilege was again resumed by order of the House of Commons. From 1640 to 1885 The town formed the parliamentary borough of Northallerton, returning two Members of Parliament until 1832, and one thereafter. Following the Great Reform Act of 1832, boundaries were extended to include neighbouring Brompton and Romanby and its representation {{was reduced to a}} single member. In 1885 the constituency was abolished and was absorbed into the Richmond division of the North Riding. The serving member for Richmond constituency is the Conservative, Rishi Sunak, who has held the seat since 2015 when he succeeded former party leader and Foreign Secretary William Hague. In modern times it has been an ultra-safe seat for the Conservative Party with them having held it continually since 1929.|$|E
5|$|Prussia {{tried to}} take {{opportunity}} of the Russian Empire's wars with the Ottoman Empire and Sweden and move the weak Commonwealth into its sphere of influence. Some factions in the Commonwealth deemed {{this as an opportunity}} to shake free from decades of Russian control. That said, Prussia did not expect much from the alliance, not even that it would pass. When the treaty was first proposed to the Great Sejm by Prussian ambassador Ludwig Heinrich Buchholtz on 13 October 1788, Prussians expected that it would cause long and fruitless debate which only outcome would be to ensure the weakening of Russian (and to a lesser degree, Austrian) position in Poland. Overall, for Prussia, the alliance with Poland was only one of several potential options; <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> Polish politicians it became a new, and increasingly, only available strategy. The reception of Prussian proposal by the Sejm exceeded their expectations, and it has significantly strengthened the Patriotic Party. For the next year or so, Prussians decided to delay taking any clear action, keeping their options open. Buchholtz was also reprimanded for allowing things to go too far, and another Prussian diplomat, Girolamo Lucchesini, was sent to Warsaw to aid him.|$|E

5|$|Two gaps {{opened up}} in the Union line: the {{commander}} of the 71st Pennsylvania ordered his men to retreat when the Confederates came too close to the Angle; south of the copse of trees, the men of the 59th New York (Hall's brigade) inexplicably bolted for the rear. In the latter case, this left Captain Andrew Cowan and his 1st New York Independent Artillery Battery to face the oncoming infantry. Assisted personally by artillery chief Henry Hunt, Cowan ordered five guns to fire double canister simultaneously. The entire Confederate line to his front disappeared. The gap vacated by most of the 71st Pennsylvania, however, was more serious, leaving only a handful of the 71st, 268 men of the 69th Pennsylvania, and Cushing's two 3-inch rifled guns to receive the 2,500 to 3,000 men of Garnett's and Armistead's brigades as they began to cross the stone fence. The Irishmen of the 69th Pennsylvania resisted fiercely in a melee of rifle fire, bayonets, and fists. Webb, mortified that the 71st had retreated, attempted to bring the 72nd Pennsylvania (a Zouave regiment) forward, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> reason they did not obey the order, so he had to bring other regiments in to help fill the gap. During the fight, Lt. Cushing was killed as he shouted to his men, three bullets striking him, the third in his mouth. The Confederates seized his two guns and turned them to face the Union troops, but they had no ammunition to fire. As more Union reinforcements arrived and charged into the breach, the defensive line became impregnable and the Confederates began to slip away individually, with no senior officers remaining to call a formal retreat.|$|E

25|$|Collecting {{for most}} people is a choice, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> {{it can be a}} compulsion, sharing {{characteristics}} with obsessive hoarding. When collecting is passed between generations, it might sometimes be that children have inherited symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Collecting can sometimes reflect a fear of scarcity, or of discarding something then later regretting it. Certain patterns of collection are common among people who have lived through poverty or war.|$|E

Old Alresford and New Alresford often played each other, the latter usually winning, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> fixtures they put out a joint team.|$|E

25|$|For example: A person seeks donations. That {{person may}} find another person willing to donate a {{substantial}} sum.

25|$|Deployed 800 {{yards from}} the French, these cannons were {{commanded}} by Reisner, Archduke John's chief of artillery. The artillery barrage soon caused serious casualties in the vulnerable French squares. As some French troops began to shrink from the heavy fire, couriers raced off to get help. Quickly, Eugène ordered twenty guns belonging to Broussier and Lamarque across the river. When the cannons arrived, the French formed their own 24-gun battery {{in front of the}} infantry and replied to Reisner's bombardment. Wolfskeel asked for some infantry to be sent forward from the Piavisella line, <b>but</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> reason no help arrived.|$|E
