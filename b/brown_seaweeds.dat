500|$|The {{marine waters}} around the {{province}} are considered boreal, or sub-Arctic, in nature. [...] A {{great deal of}} the coastline is rock-strewn, allowing an extensive variety of plant and animal life to thrive. The leading plants of the shoreline are the large <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds,</b> such as bladder, forked and knotted Wracks, and winged and sugar kelps, though there are also a number of red and green seaweeds present. Common animals of the seashore region include barnacles, [...] tortoiseshell limpet, common periwinkle, blue mussels, sea anemones, sea slugs, sea urchins, starfish, and rock crabs. The deeper waters are home to a variety of fish, such as Atlantic cod, sculpins and cunners, halibut, haddock, sharks, and marine mammals, such as dolphins, porpoises, and whales. Whales seen off Newfoundland include Pilot whales, minkes, sei whales, fin whales and humpbacks. Harp and hooded seals are usually found in the spring, giving birth to their young on coastal ice floes.|$|E

40|$|Twenty-four {{lactating}} Holstein cows {{were used}} to determine the production response to the inclusion of <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed</b> in the basal diet during summer heat stress. Cows were blocked by lactation number, days in milk, and energy-corrected milk and then allotted to either a control or control + <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed</b> diet. Cattle on the <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed</b> diet were fed 4 ounces per cow per day for 7 days, and then 2 ounces per cow per day for 14 days, {{before the start of the}} experiment. All cattle were housed in a tie-stall barn, fed individually, and milked twice daily. Cows fed <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed</b> produced more (P< 0. 01) milk (77. 6 vs 73. 8 lb) and milk protein than controls did. But the addition of <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed</b> did not reduce respiration rates, rectal temperature, or rear-udder skin temperature. This indicated a similar heat-stress response for treated and control cows. Other studies have shown a reduction in respiration rates and body temperature when stressed cattle were fed <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed.</b> Further investigation is necessary to determine the factors that resulted in the observed milk and milk-protein responses in this study...|$|R

50|$|The {{processes}} for {{the manufacture of}} sodium alginate from <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> fall into two categories: 1) Calcium alginate method and, 2) Alginic acid method. The chemistry of the processes used to make sodium alginate from <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> is relatively simple. The difficulties of the processes arise from the physical separations which are required, such as the need to filter slimy residues from viscous solutions or to separate gelatinous precipitates which hold large amounts of liquid within the structure and which resist filtration and centrifugation.|$|E

50|$|Sargassum muticum, {{commonly}} known as Japanese wireweed, is a large <b>brown</b> <b>seaweed</b> of the genus Sargassum. It is an invasive seaweed with high growth rate (until 10 cm per day during spring). It has an efficient dispersion thanks to its floats.|$|R
50|$|Seaweeds can be {{classified}} into three broad groups based on pigmentation: brown, red and green. These broad groups are the Phaeophyceae, Rhodophyceae and Chlorophyceae, respectively. <b>Brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> are usually large, and range from the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera that is often 20 m long, to thick, leather-like seaweeds from 2-4 m long, to smaller species 30-60 cm long. None of the usual seaweeds for alginate production are cultivated. They cannot be grown by vegetative means, but must go through a reproductive cycle involving an alternation of generations. This makes cultivated <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> too expensive {{when compared to the}} costs of harvesting and transporting wild seaweeds. The only exception is for Laminaria japonica, which is cultivated in China for food but the surplus material is diverted to the alginate industry in China.|$|E

The latter uses carbon monoxide to inflate its pneumocysts, and this would be toxic to the worm.|$|E
50|$|These brain-like <b>brown</b> <b>seaweeds</b> can {{be found}} growing on rock or as {{epiphytes}} on other seaweeds {{in the mid to}} low intertidal. Individuals can grow to ~15 cm in diameter.
