40|$|Abstract: Turkey has {{the largest}} <b>borate</b> {{reserves}} {{in the world and}} Argentina is in third place. Both countries have calcium and sodium <b>borate</b> deposits where colemanite, ulexite and borax are the principal minerals. We present here a comparison of the main <b>borate</b> deposits interlayered in continental Miocene volcaniclastic rocks of the Anatolian plateau (Turkey) and those of the Puna high plateau (Argentina). The main <b>borate</b> deposits of Turkey are at Emet, Bigadiç, Kestelek and K›rka. Emet is {{in the western part of}} the Kütahya province. In Emet, a sedimentary lacustrine sequence rich in tuffaceous materials hosts the colemanite section. There are limestones and marl layers at the base and top of the <b>borate</b> section. Arsenic minerals (realgar and orpiment) are very abundant and spatially related to the <b>borates,</b> indicating a common genetic origin. The principal <b>borate</b> mineral is colemanite with minor ulexite, hydroboracite, meyerhofferite, and rarer species such as veatchite-A, tunellite, teruggite and cahnite. Colemanite occurs as nodules of different sizes, agglomerated in thick beds. Bigadiç has <b>borates</b> interbedded with tuffs, clay and limestone layers. The <b>borate</b> minerals are formed in two distinct zones, lower and upper, separated by thick tuff beds. Colemanite and ulexite predominate in both <b>borate</b> zones. Other <b>borates</b> include howlite, probertite and hydroboracite in the lower zone, and inyoite, meyerhofferite, pandermite (priceite), terschite, hydroboracite, howlite, tunellite and rivadavite in the upper <b>borate</b> zone...|$|R

Although <b>borates</b> have been exploited from other sources, three minerals from non-marine evaporites now form the major commercial sources of <b>borate</b> – borax, colemanite and ulexite. These major commercial deposits are associated with Neogene volcanism in tectonically active extensional regions at plate boundaries.

40|$|Borate-modified {{oriented}} strandboard (OSB) was manufactured using zinc {{and calcium}} <b>borate</b> to provide resistance to Formosan Subterranean Termites (FSTs). Mechanical, physical, and biological {{properties of the}} product were evaluated. It was shown that static bending properties of the OSB were affected little at the room condition by the added <b>borate.</b> The internal bond strength was, however, generally smaller at the higher <b>borate</b> loading levels. Thickness swelling (TS) under the 24 -hour water soaking increased with increased <b>borate</b> content, especially for calcium <b>borate.</b> Part of the <b>borate</b> leached out under the water soaking condition due to the glueline washing and decomposition of the <b>borate</b> to form less water-soluble boric acid. The use of <b>borate</b> with a smaller particle size helped reduce TS and leaching rate significantly. Laboratory no-choice termite tests indicated that both zinc and calcium <b>borate</b> modified OSB resisted FSTs well. Thus, termite resistant OSB with required mechanical and physical performance could be successfully developed using southern wood species. This technology will allow more OSB producers to manufacture chemically modified OSB to meet increasing market demands...|$|R

50|$|The Gamma Ray Spectrometer {{was a small}} {{cylinder}} {{which was}} mounted {{on the end of}} one of the three 2.5 m radial booms extending from Lunar Prospector. It consisted of a bismuth germanate crystal surrounded by a shield of <b>borated</b> plastic. Gamma rays striking the bismuth atoms produced a flash of light with an intensity proportional to the energy of the gamma ray which was recorded by detectors. The energy of the gamma ray is associated with the element responsible for its emission. Due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, multiple passes were required to generate statistically significant results. At nine passes per month, it was expected to take about three months to confidently estimate abundances of thorium, potassium, and uranium, and 12 months for the other elements. The precision varies according to element measured. For U, Th, and K, the precision is 7% to 15%, for Fe 45%, for Ti 20%, and for the overall distribution of KREEP 15% to 30%. The <b>borated</b> plastic shield was used in the detection of fast neutrons. The GRS was designed to achieve global coverage from an altitude of approximately 100 km and with a surface resolution of 150 km.|$|E

50|$|For the {{construction}} of CUORE, the collaboration followed several procedures to minimize radioactive contamination that can cause the detectors to register background events at energies close to the energy released in neutrinoless double beta decay. The crystals were grown by the Shanghai Institute of Ceramics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences with strict radiopurity requirements. The crystals are {{held in place by}} PTFE support in towers constructed from oxygen-free high thermal conductivity copper and were assembled under nitrogen inside gloveboxes in cleanrooms. Copper, lead, ancient low-radioactivity Roman lead, and <b>borated</b> polyethylene are used to shield the detectors. Coincidence algorithms are also used to reject events that caused multiple channels to trigger, such as would be caused by an incoming cosmic ray muon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Borate</b> ions (commonly {{supplied}} as boric acid) {{are used}} in biochemical and chemical laboratories to make buffers, e.g. for gel electrophoresis of DNA and RNA, such as TBE buffer (<b>borate</b> buffered tris-hydroxymethylaminomethonium) or the newer SB buffer or BBS buffer (<b>borate</b> buffered saline) in coating procedures. <b>Borate</b> buffers (usually at pH 8) are also used as preferential equilibration solution in dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) based crosslinking reactions.|$|R
50|$|LB buffer {{containing}} lithium <b>borate</b> {{is similar}} to sodium <b>borate</b> and has all of its advantages, but permits use of even higher voltages due to the lower conductivity of lithium ions as compared to sodium ions. However, lithium <b>borate</b> is somewhat more expensive.|$|R

50|$|Boron {{has been}} used in BPSG, the {{insulator}} in the interconnection layers of integrated circuits, particularly in the lowest one. The inclusion of boron lowers the melt temperature of the glass providing better reflow and planarization characteristics. In this application the glass is formulated with a boron content of 4% to 5% by weight. Naturally occurring boron is 20% 10B with the remainder the 11B isotope. Soft errors are caused by the high level of 10B in this critical lower layer of some older integrated circuit processes. Boron-11, used at low concentrations as a p-type dopant, does not contribute to soft errors. Integrated circuit manufacturers eliminated <b>borated</b> dielectrics by the time individual circuit components decreased in size to 150 nm, largely due to this problem.|$|E
50|$|The reactor design {{incorporates}} advanced technologies, {{together with}} several proven positive features of Indian pressurised heavy water reactors (PHWRs). These features include pressure tube type design, low pressure moderator, on-power refueling, diverse fast acting shut-down systems, {{and availability of}} a large low temperature heat sink around the reactor core. The AHWR incorporates several passive safety features. These include: Core heat removal through natural circulation; direct injection of emergency core coolant system (ECCS) water in fuel; {{and the availability of}} a large inventory of <b>borated</b> water in overhead gravity-driven water pool (GDWP) to facilitate sustenance of core decay heat removal. The emergency core cooling system (ECCS) injection and containment cooling can act (SCRAM) without invoking any active systems or operator action.|$|E
50|$|Versioning note: The SLCS is {{a system}} that is never meant to be {{activated}} unless all other measures have failed. In the BWR/1 - BWR/6, its activation could cause sufficient damage to the plant that it could make the older BWRs inoperable without a complete overhaul. With the arrival of the ABWR and (E)SBWR, operators {{do not have to be}} as reluctant about activating the SLCS, as these reactors have a reactor water cleanup system (RWCS) which is designed to remove boron - once the reactor has stabilized, the <b>borated</b> water within the RPV can be filtered through this system to promptly remove the soluble neutron absorbers that it contains and thus avoid damage to the internals of the plant.|$|E

Ulexite and probertite also occur in the area, 'although t eir {{distribution}} {{is different from that}} of the Mg and K <b>borates.</b> Other evaporite minerals in the spring vicinity include halite, thenardite, ugsterite, gypsum-anhydrite, hexahydrite, and bloedite.

Miner'al associations observed at the Eagle Borax spring, and at many other <b>borate</b> deposits worldwide, can be explained by the chemical fraetionation f borate-precipitating waters during the course of evaporative concentration.

40|$|Despite {{the lack}} of a {{convenient}} radioisotope of boron, it is possible to measure unidirectional fluxes of <b>borate</b> between cellular systems and their external medium.

The method was applied to compartmental analysis of <b>borate</b> with intact plants of Lemna minor L. Four compartments were suggested. Three of them apparently correspond to the three classical ones: free space (including easily dissociable <b>borate</b> monoesters), cytoplasm, and vacuole. The fourth one was interpreted as corresponding to very stable <b>borate</b> diesters in the cell walls. The method allows the determination of the <b>borate</b> capacities of the various compartments and of the <b>borate</b> unidirectional fluxes between the different compartments, at <b>borate</b> flux equilibrium.
