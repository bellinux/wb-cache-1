5|$|The city {{forms an}} {{autonomous}} commune (commune autonome) of the Central African Republic which {{is surrounded by}} the Ombella-M'Poko prefecture. With an area of , the commune is the smallest high-level administrative division in the country, but the highest in terms of population. The city consists of eight urban districts (arrondissements), 16 groups (groupements) and 205 neighbourhoods (quartiers). As {{the capital of the}} Central African Republic, <b>Bangui</b> acts as an administrative, trade, and commercial centre. It is served by the <b>Bangui</b> M'Poko International Airport. The National Assembly, government buildings, banks, foreign enterprises and embassies, hospitals, hotels, main markets and the Ngaragba Central Prison are all located here. <b>Bangui</b> manufactures textiles, food products, beer, shoes and soap. Its Notre-Dame Cathedral is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of <b>Bangui.</b> The city is also home to the University of <b>Bangui,</b> inaugurated in 1970.|$|E
5|$|The {{colony of}} Ubangi-Shari {{received}} its autonomy in 1958 as the Central African Republic and this became independent from France in 1960. In 1970, President Jean-Bédel Bokassa inaugurated the University of <b>Bangui.</b> He established the national airline Air Centrafrique {{the following year}} and ordered the construction of two new luxury hotels in <b>Bangui.</b> With tensions mounting between <b>Bangui</b> and Paris {{as a result of}} Bokassa's uncontrollable expenditures, western banks refused to lend him any more money. Relations with the French worsened still further in April 1974, when Brigette Miroux's body was discovered in a hotel room in <b>Bangui.</b> It was reported in the French media that she had been Bokassa's mistress and that he was responsible for her murder. As a result, Bokassa banned imports of French newspapers and assumed control of the Agence France-Presse office in <b>Bangui.</b> By 1975, <b>Bangui</b> had a population of 300,723.|$|E
5|$|The {{old town}} of <b>Bangui</b> has {{retained}} its colonial town planning with wide boulevards leading towards central market square. Attractions in <b>Bangui</b> include Boganda Museum, <b>Bangui</b> Zoo, and the Presidential Palace, formerly the Bokassa Palace. Notre-Dame Cathedral is {{the seat of}} the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of <b>Bangui.</b> Boganda Museum (Musée de Boganda) has displays of traditional musical instruments, weapons, rural architectural features, ancient hunting tools, pottery, and also many religious antiques. It has a collection of bark cloth, the material used to cover Bokassa's bed.|$|E

5|$|There is no state-prescribed {{religion}} in the country. The religious groups in the urban centre of <b>Bangui,</b> {{in the order of}} their population representation, are the Christians which form the majority, Animists following ancient beliefs, and Muslims. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception under the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese of <b>Bangui</b> is located in <b>Bangui,</b> as is the Church of Fatima. The archdiocese was established as the Apostolic Prefecture of Oubangui Chari on 8 May 1909. Pope John Paul II visited <b>Bangui</b> in August 1985. The seat of the archbishop is Notre-Dame Cathedral in <b>Bangui.</b> Islam is the last in the order of religious beliefs with about 20,000 Muslims in <b>Bangui.</b> However, prior to sectarian violence in the country, more than 100,000 Muslims lived in the capital. The late president Bokassa converted to Islam as a political compulsion under the guidance of the then Libyan President Gaddafi. He also assumed the Muslim name of Sala Eddine Ahmed Bou Kassa, but it was short-lived as he wanted a cathedral to be built in <b>Bangui.</b> The Church of Fatima and Notre Dame D'Afrique are located in KM 5.|$|E
5|$|In May 1996, about 200 {{soldiers}} of the Central African Republic mutinied in <b>Bangui,</b> demanding salary increases and the abdication of Ange-Félix Patassé. In the aftermath, the renegades plundered and killed more than 50 people. Following this, the French troops stationed in the country suppressed the rebellion and restored the dictatorial power. After being elected, President Patassé announced a national unity government in early 1997. The Patassé government, the opposition parties, and religious groups signed the <b>Bangui</b> Agreements in January 1997 which were a series of measures designed to reconcile competing political factions, reform and strengthen the economy. The same year, the rebel troops refused a military base in <b>Bangui</b> and in June a new revolt broke out.|$|E
5|$|A general {{hospital}} {{is located in}} {{the eastern side of the}} city. Modern health care facilities exist only in <b>Bangui</b> but are poor, providing only minimal care. Wealthier citizens make use of private clinics. The risk of catching HIV in the city is reportedly high, and many truck drivers stopping in the city for sexual services pose a major risk of spreading the disease to other parts of the country. The risk of catching malaria in <b>Bangui</b> and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E
50|$|The circumscriptions of Chad {{took the}} name of {{departments}} {{and many of them}} were merged, while two departments, Logone (united with the Mayo-Kebbi) and Chari-Bangoran (Moyen-Chari and N'Délé) were separated from Chad and placed directly under <b>Bangui's</b> administration.|$|R

50|$|Government {{authorities}} sentenced four {{residents of}} <b>Bangui's</b> Miskine suburb {{to more than}} 10 {{years in prison for}} the 2005 killing of a woman they accused of being a witch. Although courts have tried, convicted, and sentenced some persons for crimes committed against suspected witches in the past, violence against these individuals continued.|$|R
5|$|After the Central African Republic {{attained}} {{independence in}} 1960, developmental activities began, and the urbanization of <b>Bangui</b> ensued. This {{is evidenced by}} the population growth from 279,800 in 1975 to 427,435 in 1988 to 524,000 by 1994. and to 652,000 in 2001. Apart from the ethnic people of the country, the city is also home for a minority group of Greek, Portuguese and Yemeni traders, and also has a small community of French people. The <b>Bangui</b> resident community includes diamond traders from western Africa and Chad, traders from many African countries, and refugees from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bangui</b> has a rich music {{tradition}} and showcases the country's music. Its musicians also perform {{in many countries}} abroad. The <b>Bangui</b> band groups were influenced by Zokela in the 1980s. The innovative music is based on dance bands who have adopted the Congolese music with electronic support. The music is rhythmic and blends with the Congolese rumba (soukous), which was influenced by son cubano, cha-cha-cha, and merengue. Popular Central African music groups or dance bands who perform in the city are Musiki, Zokela, Makembe, Cool Stars, Cannon Stars, and Super Stars. Bokassa, during his tenure as President, established a music recording studio in <b>Bangui</b> and employed musicians to sing his praise with songs extolling his qualities as an emperor and to develop his cult image among his people.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bangui</b> {{has been}} the scene of intense rebel {{activity}} and destruction during decades of political upheaval, including the current rebellion. As a result of political unrest, the city was named in 1996 {{as one of the}} most dangerous in the world.|$|E
50|$|Her {{husband was}} a long-time Central African {{political}} reformer, who founded what eventually became the Patriotic Front for Progress party. She too supported {{the work of the}} FPP, and stood in the Central African general election, 2005 and was elected as a deputy for <b>Bangui's</b> fifth district with 37.32 percent in the 8 May runoff. In the same election, her husband lost his seat. After being named to the National Assembly of the Central African Republic, she was named as a Central African representative to the Pan-African Parliament. In January 2015, she praised the peacekeeping efforts in Rwanda, saying that while she has lived in the Central African Republic for 30 years, she never forgets that she came from Rwanda. She is the coordinator of the non government organisation Les Flamboyants, which seeks to prevent violence against women and children.|$|R
5|$|Football (soccer) is also popular. Both men {{and women}} from <b>Bangui</b> and {{throughout}} the country have participated in the Olympic Games since 1968 as well as in many international events. The locals also organize boat races with hundreds of participants on the Ubangi River, which is a significant attraction.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{holidays}} in <b>Bangui</b> are festivals related to the Christian and Muslim faiths and {{are the same as}} those observed {{in other parts of the}} world. National holidays include independence day and the birthdays of Boganda and several other national heroes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bangui</b> is the {{transport}} {{hub of the}} Central African Republic. As of 1999, eight roads connected the city to other main towns in the country, Cameroon, Chad and South Sudan; of these, only the toll roads are paved. During the rainy season from July to October, some roads are impassable. The road network in the city emanates from the Palace de la Republique.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bangui</b> {{serves as}} an administrative, trade, and {{commercial}} centre. During the Second World War the country became wealthier as exports of rubber, cotton, coffee, uranium and diamonds increased. After the war, the employment of local people in mainstream administration {{led to the development}} of the country's infrastructure, which increased trade while slowing the national movement for independence.|$|E
5|$|In March 1981, {{widespread}} violence {{took place}} in <b>Bangui</b> following elections, after Operation Caban led the French to drop Bokassa (who had begun to call himself Emperor Bokassa I), and replaced him with David Dacko. Opponents of the President met in <b>Bangui</b> and were forced to flee the country. After returning voluntarily to <b>Bangui</b> {{in the autumn of}} 1986, Bokassa went on trial. Initially faced with the death penalty, in February 1988 he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment. His successor was General André Kolingba, army chief of staff of Decko’s army, who took over control from the local French military on 1 September 1981 under the pretext that the country was heading towards civil war. Although he attempted to combat corruption and control the national economy, he was unable to achieve his reforms. By the middle of the 1980s the country’s economic situation had deteriorated as 80% of the revenue went towards meeting the salaries of the staff. Under pressure from France and other western countries, Kolingba restored democracy in the country in 1991 with a multiparty government but elections could be held only three years later in August 1994. During the elections, Ange-Félix Patassé was elected to the post of president. Since he was from northern CAR, the southern group of Kolingba started a rebellion during 1996.|$|E
5|$|In late 2012, the Séléka {{coalition}} {{rebelled against}} his autocratic rule {{and entered the}} city. After capturing Bria, Sibut, and other important towns, {{they were on the}} verge of capturing Damara, the last strategic town before <b>Bangui.</b> France and the US refused to support the president and neighbouring countries reinforced the Central African Multinational Force (Fomac).|$|E
5|$|M'ba {{helped get}} him a job in customs on 24 March 1931. First {{appointed}} to Libreville from 1931 to 1935, he was transferred to <b>Bangui</b> in 1935 and then to Brazzaville in 1936, where he co-founded {{a branch of the}} Mutuelle Gabonaise with a brother of politician Louis Bigmann. He was {{also a member of the}} Association des fonctionnaires, an organization which was dominated by two other soon-to-be politicians: René-Paul Sousatte and Jean Rémy Ayouné.|$|E
5|$|Several {{periodicals}} {{and three}} daily newspapers are published in Bangui: E le Songo, the country's first newspaper, began publication in 1982. The other main newspapers are Le Novateur, Le Citoyen and L’Echo de Centrafrique. Most of the country's institutions have offices in <b>Bangui,</b> including French ones such as Électricité de France (EDF).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} hotels up to {{international}} standards. The Ledger Plaza <b>Bangui</b> {{on the outskirts}} {{claims to be a}} five-star hotel, and has an outdoor swimming pool and tennis court. The National Hotel was established in 1970 with 30 rooms. Also of note are the Golf Palace Hotel, the Hotel du Centre with 72 rooms, JM Residence, the Oubangui Hotel, established in 1985, and Hotel Somba with 23 rooms.|$|E
5|$|Bangui’s artisans’ {{market has}} {{traditional}} wares representing the art products from {{different regions of}} the country. Handicrafts include woven mats and baskets, wooden utensils of simple design, carved stools, pottery, musical instruments, tanned skins, and wood products. The balafon, similar to a xylophone, is made out of the horns of animals. Innovative designs include butterfly wings stuck with gum on paper, and ebony and hardwood carvings of wood from the tropical region. Artwork also covers carved animals and human figures. The crafts center in <b>Bangui</b> provides training to about 100 students in artistic crafting in leather, ivory and ebony wares.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, <b>Bangui</b> {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, rampant corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|During David Dacko's {{presidency}} from 1960 to 1966, {{there was}} {{a significant increase in the}} production of diamonds. This occurred when the monopoly of the French concessionary companies was ended with a law allowing local citizens to dig for diamonds. After Dacko set up a diamond cutting factory at <b>Bangui,</b> diamonds became the country's leading export. But by the end of his five year's tenure, rampant corruption and financial indiscipline had resulted in workers being left unpaid and civil unrest ensued. Bokassa then seized power in a military coup in 1966.|$|E
5|$|In January 2013, {{the rebels}} {{terminated}} their operations, {{hoping for a}} negotiated settlement. Following a ceasefire and a power-sharing agreement, Séléka and Bozizé agreed to honour the rebel's demands {{for the release of}} rebel prisoners and the expulsion of foreign troops from the country. The agreement allowed Bozizé to complete his term in office and to include members of Séléka in a new government. It was also agreed that fresh elections would be held in 2016. The agreement was not honoured and the rebels captured <b>Bangui</b> on 23 March 2013, forcing Bozizé to flee the capital.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{stations}} {{operating in}} <b>Bangui</b> include Radio Centrafrique, Radio Nehemie, Radio Notre-Dame, Radio Voix de la paix, Radio Ndeke Luka, RFI, Radio Voik de la grace, Radio Linga FM, Africa no.1, and Tropic FM. BBC World Service {{is the only}} English broadcasting station that is heard in the city on 90.2 FM, as all other local channels broadcast in either French and/or Sango. For reliable news, the channel of UN run Radio Ndeke Luka is on 100.8 FM.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years, Boganda {{was adopted by}} Catholic missionaries. As a boy he {{attended}} the school opened at Mbaiki (the administrative centre for the Lobaye prefecture) by the post's founder, Lieutenant Mayer. From December 1921 to December 1922, he spent {{two hours a day}} with Monsignor Jean-Réné Calloch learning how to read, while spending the rest of his time performing manual labour. On 24 December, he was received into the church under the name Barthélemy, in honour of one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ who was believed to have worked as Christian missionary in Africa. Father Gabriel Herrau sent Boganda to the Catholic School of Betou and then to the school of the Saint Paul Mission at <b>Bangui,</b> where he completed his primary studies under Mgr Calloch, whom he would consider his spiritual father. The missionaries there, encouraged by his intellectual promise and pious demeanour, helped him continue secondary studies at small seminaries in Brazzaville and Kisantu (under Belgian Jesuits) before he moved on to the great seminary at Yaoundé. On 17 March 1938, fulfilling an ambition he had had since age twelve, he was ordained and became the first Roman Catholic priest native to Oubangui-Chari, as the colony was then called. He ministered at <b>Bangui,</b> Grimari and Bangassou, and in 1939, his bishop denied his request to join the French Army. He was needed at home, as many Frenchmen involved with the church had been recalled to the metropole to fight in World War II, during which he served in a number of missions.|$|E
5|$|The Central African Republic is {{situated}} {{just north of}} the Equator with daily temperatures normally reaching at least 30 degrees Celsius. <b>Bangui,</b> close to the Equator in the south of the country is slightly hotter and wetter than the northern regions. It has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen: Aw) with dry winters. While the warm season is from 23 January to 18 March, the cold season lasts from 20 June to 27 August, when rainfall is frequently accompanied by thunderstorms. The city is bordered by thick tropical rainforests along the river banks. Several of its neighbourhoods are in low-lying areas prone to recurrent flooding. Severe rains in June and July 2009 left 11,000 people homeless.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, {{the two had}} a major {{argument}} over the country's budget, as Banza adamantly opposed Bokassa's extravagant spending. Bokassa moved to Camp de Roux, where he felt he could safely run the government without {{having to worry about}} Banza's thirst for power. In the meantime, Banza tried to obtain a support base within the army, spending much of his time in the company of soldiers. Bokassa recognized what his minister was doing, so he sent military units most sympathetic to Banza to the country's border and brought his own army supporters as close to the capital as possible. In September 1967, he took a special trip to Paris, where he asked for protection from French troops. Two months later, the government deployed 80 paratroopers to <b>Bangui.</b>|$|E
5|$|Boganda {{was born}} into a family of {{subsistence}} farmers, and was adopted and educated by Roman Catholic Church missionaries. In 1938, he was ordained as the first Roman Catholic priest from Oubangui-Chari. During World War II, Boganda served in a number of missions and after was persuaded by the Bishop of <b>Bangui</b> to enter politics. In 1946, he became the first Oubanguian elected to the French National Assembly, where he maintained a political platform against racism and the colonial regime. He then returned to Oubangui-Chari to form a grassroots movement in opposition of French colonialism. The movement led to the 1949 foundation of the Movement for the Social Evolution of Black Africa (MESAN), which became popular among villagers and the working class. Boganda's reputation was slightly damaged when he was laicized from the priesthood after marrying Michelle Jourdain, a parliamentary secretary. Nonetheless, he continued to advocate for equal treatment and civil rights for blacks in the territory well into the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|He {{played a}} crucial role at the {{beginning}} of internal autonomy (1956–1958), although the relatively conservative Boganda remained sympathetic to French interests and still did not advocate immediate independence. For Boganda, the 1956 election, in which he took 89% of the vote against another Oubanguian, was an uncontested speaker's platform with which the colonial administration had come to terms; the French had realised that opposing him would be dangerous and sought to accommodate him. That year he agreed to European representation on election lists in exchange for the financial support of French business leaders, and on 18 November, was elected as the first mayor of <b>Bangui.</b> On 31 March 1957, MESAN won all seats in the Territorial Assembly election; on 18 June, Boganda was elected president of the Grand Council of French Equatorial Africa (a forum he used to broadcast his views on African unity) and in May was appointed vice-president of the Oubangui-Chari Government Council (the French governor was still its president).|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{after the}} French Fourth Republic began to {{consider}} granting independence {{to most of}} its African colonies, Boganda met with Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle to discuss terms for the independence of Oubangui-Chari. De Gaulle accepted Boganda's terms, and on 1 December, Boganda declared {{the establishment of the}} Central African Republic. He became the autonomous territory's first Prime Minister and intended to serve as the first President of the independent CAR. He was killed in a mysterious plane crash on 29 March 1959, while en route to <b>Bangui.</b> Experts found a trace of explosives in the plane's wreckage, but revelation of this detail was withheld. Although those responsible for the crash were never identified, people have suspected the French secret service, and even Boganda's wife, of being involved. Slightly more than one year later, Boganda's dream was realized, when the Central African Republic attained formal independence from France.|$|E
