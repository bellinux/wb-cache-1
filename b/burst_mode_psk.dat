5000|$|<b>Burst</b> <b>mode</b> (alternatively burst-mode) is {{a generic}} {{electronics}} term referring to any {{situation in which}} a device is transmitting data repeatedly without going through all the steps required to transmit each piece of data in a separate transaction. The usual reason for having a <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> capability, or using <b>burst</b> <b>mode,</b> is to increase data throughput. The steps left out while performing a <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> transaction may include A: waiting for input from another device; B: waiting for an internal process to terminate before continuing the transfer of data; or C: transmitting information which would be required for a complete transaction, but which {{is inherent in the}} use of <b>burst</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the <b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> {{operation}} is proposed as an efficiency enhancement technique for RF power ampliﬁers. The {{essence of the}} <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> {{operation is}} to modulate the amplitude of the envelope signal {{into a series of}} pulses such that the width of the signal burst or the total amount of pulses are varied according to the envelope. The phase information is still contained by the timing of the pulses. This work presents an introduction of the <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> operation and the efficiency of <b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> RF power ampliﬁers is brieﬂy analyzed. The improvement on the efficiency with a wideband load and a narrow band ﬁlter are both illustrated. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed <b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> operation, a PCB-mounted <b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> PA using a LDMOS transistor has been fabricated. Measurements show a peak efficiency of 78 % and 28. 5 dBm output power and an efficiency of 49. 5 % at 6 dB power back-off. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper we}} {{proposed}} advanced <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> control technique {{to reduce the}} standby power consumption of the switch mode power supply (SMPS). To reduce the standby power consumption, most of the converter use <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> or skip mode control technique. However Conventional standby mode control techniques have some problems such as audible noise and poor regulation. In proposed techniques, basically, the <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> control technique is employed to reduce the fundamental switching frequency while limiting the peak drain current. But, in proposed technique, to improve the regulation characteristic, burst period of the proposed technique is shorter {{than that of the}} conventional <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> technique. And also, to reduce the switching loss increase due to the short burst period, burst switching signal of the proposed technique is partially skipped. By using proposed advanced <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> control technique, calculated standby power is 0. 695 W while standby power of the conventional <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> control is 1. 014 W. </span...|$|R

In <b>burst</b> <b>mode,</b> the rate of fire can equal that of the fully automatic mode, which is useful in close range situations.|$|R
40|$|<b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> {{operation}} is proposed as an eﬃciency improving technique for power ampliﬁers. The core {{idea is to}} modulate the amplitude of the envelope signal {{into a series of}} square wave pulses such that the width of the signal burst or the total amount of pulses are varied according to the envelope. The phase information is still contained by the timing of the pulses. This work presents the eﬃciency and linearity analysis of <b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> RF PAs. In addition, the eﬃciency performance is compared when the <b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> RF PA is connected to a wideband load or a narrowband ﬁlter. It is shown that <b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> PAs are more eﬃcient than the conventional Class B PAs. To achieve an even more favorable eﬃciency, a transmission line is inserted between the output of the switching RF PA and the ﬁlter to improve the ﬁlters impedance characteristic. Additionally, the eﬃciency and linearity of the <b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> PA with and without transmission line has been studied and simulated thoroughly. To demonstrate the validity of the eﬃciency formulas and linearity considerations, a PCB-mounted <b>Burst</b> <b>Mode</b> PA using a LDMOS transistor was fabricated. Measurements show a peak eﬃciency of 78 % and 28. 8 dBm of output power. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> is {{normally}} employed {{as an intermediate}} fire mode between semi-automatic and fully automatic, although some firearms lack a [...] "full auto" [...] capability and use a <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> instead. For instance, the M16A4 (the standard-issue service rifle of the USMC) has, {{in addition to the}} semi-automatic <b>mode,</b> a three-round <b>burst</b> <b>mode,</b> which replaced the fully automatic mode of the previous M16A1 and A3 models. The reason for this replacement was the massive waste of ammunition and very poor performance of soldiers who fired their rifles in fully automatic mode during the Vietnam War.|$|R

50|$|<b>Burst</b> <b>mode</b> {{is often}} used in {{military}} firearms {{to limit the number}} of rounds fired due to the inaccuracy of fully automatic fire. In the US M16/M4 rifles for example, the <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> is 3 rounds. The trigger once pulled and held, results in 3 rounds being fired. The gun will not fire again until the trigger is released and then pulled again. There are suggestions that fully automatic fire has no genuine benefit and has been restricted or banned in combat due to being a waste of ammunition. The US M4 Carbine is now the main combat rifle of the US armed forces and has been available until recently in semi-automatic and <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> of 3 rounds only.|$|R

40|$|<b>Burst</b> <b>mode</b> {{has been}} {{implemented}} in many spaceborne SAR instruments, such as Radarsat- 1 / 2 SAR, Envisat ASAR and ALOS PALSAR, to achieve very wide swath coverage, {{which is the}} so called ScanSAR. Envisat ASAR also applies burst technique to its AP (Alternating Polarization) mode. Conventional SAR interferometry uses strip-map mode data, whereas, in our study, {{we try to make}} <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> to strip-map mode interferometry possible, which will potentially provide many more choices of interferometry. Mixed-mode interferometry will highly improve the availability of current SAR dataset inventory, and therefore will be helpful for burst disaster monitoring, {{especially in the case of}} lacking suitable data. However, acquisitions of different modes can not be readily used for interferometry. Also to be considered is the improvement of coherence of the interferometric pair. In this paper, we propose a complete process to solve these problems. <b>Burst</b> <b>mode</b> raw data is focused using the Full-Aperture Algorithm [1]. An interferometric pair comprised of PLR (Polarimetry mode, belonging to strip-map mode) and WB 1 (Wide observation <b>mode,</b> belonging to <b>burst</b> <b>mode)</b> mode of PALSAR is chosen to implement this process. The second problem is first analyzed theoretically and then solved by replacing the corresponding echo-lines with zero-lines. The resulting interferogram shows satisfactory fringes.

50|$|In {{automatic}} firearms, <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> or <b>burst</b> fire is {{a firing}} mode enabling the shooter {{to fire a}} predetermined number of rounds, usually two or three rounds on hand held weapons and over 100 on anti-aircraft weapons, with a single pull of the trigger. This firing mode is commonly used in submachine guns and carbines. Other types of firearms, such as machine pistols (e.g., the Beretta 93R) may also have a <b>burst</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{topology}} of PON, {{the transmission}} modes for downstream (that is, from OLT to ONU) and upstream (that is, from ONU to OLT) are different. For the downstream transmission, the OLT broadcasts optical signal {{to all the}} ONUs in continuous mode (CM), that is, the downstream channel always has optical data signal. However, in the upstream channel, ONUs can not transmit optical data signal in CM. Use of CM would result {{in all of the}} signals transmitted from the ONUs converging (with attenuation) into one fiber by the power splitter (serving as power coupler), and overlapping. To solve this problem, <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> (BM) transmission is adopted for upstream channel. The given ONU only transmits optical packet when it is allocated a time slot and it needs to transmit, and all the ONUs share the upstream channel in the time division multiplexing (TDM) mode. The phases of the BM optical packets received by the OLT are different from packet to packet, since the ONUs are not synchronized to transmit optical packet in the same phase, and the distance between OLT and given ONU are random. Since the distance between the OLT and ONUs are not uniform, the optical packets received by the OLT may have different amplitudes. In order to compensate the phase variation and amplitude variation in a short time (for example within 40 ns for GPON), <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> clock and data recovery (BM-CDR) and <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> amplifier (for example <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> TIA) need to be employed, respectively. Furthermore, the BM transmission mode requires the transmitter to work in <b>burst</b> <b>mode.</b> Such a <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> transmitter is able to turn on and off in short time. The above three kinds of circuitries in PON are quite different from their counterparts in the point-to-point continuous mode optical communication link.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Awidely tunable <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> digital {{coherent}} receiver {{is implemented}} in a 112 Gb/s DP-QPSK WDM system. The re-ceiver performance is validated in a 24 -channel WDM test-bed using a commercially available DS-DBR laser {{as the local}} oscil-lator. It is demonstrated that the wavelength tunable laser can switch {{to any one of}} the 24 -channels in less than 130 ns, thus en-abling the dynamic reception of 5 s optical bursts. The perfor-mance of the DS-DBR local oscillator laser is commensurate with <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> coherent reception when differential decoding is em-ployed and the parallel DSP implementation does not impair the polarization and frequency tracking performance of a digital co-herent receiver under <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> operation. The worst case re-configuration time of the <b>burst</b> <b>mode</b> receiver, which is a combi-nation of the laser switching time and the CMA convergence time, is less than 410 ns when switching from a single channel to any other channel in the WDM grid. It is shown that the variation in reconfiguration time is dependent on the convergence time of the CMA equalizer, which is adversely affected by certain input states of polarization.
