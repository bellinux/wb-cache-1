5|$|Hansa served {{abroad for}} the first nine years of her career in the German navy. In 1884, it was found that her iron hull was badly corroded, which {{rendered}} the ship unfit for further active service. She was therefore removed from active duty and used for a variety of secondary roles. From 1884 to 1888, she served as a guard ship in Kiel, where she also trained engine and <b>boiler</b> <b>room</b> personnel. In 1888, she was stricken from the naval register and used as a barracks ship in Kiel. She was moved to Mönkeberg in 1905, where she continued to train <b>boiler</b> <b>room</b> personnel, until 1906 when she was sold to ship-breakers and dismantled for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Still the Commissioners prevaricated, daunted by the {{potential}} costs, estimated by Robert Stevenson at £63,000.

40|$|The paper investigates {{parameters}} of {{noise and vibration}} distribution in the territory of residential area depending on the structural materials and power of independent heat supply systems. Rooftop <b>boiler</b> <b>rooms</b> are decentralized heat supply systems in buildings. Today, residential areas are strongly affected by noise and vibrations. Adverse effects are isolated by buildings materials, protective shields and floating floors. Rooftop <b>boiler</b> <b>rooms</b> located in Tyumen city were investigated within this research. Structures of rooftop <b>boiler</b> <b>rooms</b> were analyzed. Acoustic analysis results and the {{parameters of}} {{equivalent continuous sound level}} are presented. An option for improvement of rooftop <b>boiler</b> <b>rooms</b> structures is suggested. Comparison of capital investments in construction and installation activities is carried out.

5|$|Assiniboine {{returned}} to Canada in June and was briefly {{used as a}} troop transport before a <b>boiler</b> <b>room</b> fire on 4 July effectively ended her career. She was paid off on 8 August and placed on the disposal list. Whilst on tow to the breakers in Baltimore, she ran aground near East Point, Prince Edward Island. Attempts to get her off failed, and she was left to rust until eventually being broken up in place in 1952.|$|E
5|$|Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} smoke {{on the horizon}} and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} while the two British cruisers turned {{to cut off the}} two Austrian destroyers. Aquila opened fire at 08:15 at long range, but inflicted no damage before she was immobilised by a hit at 08:32 that detonated inside her central <b>boiler</b> <b>room</b> and severed her main steam pipe. The Austrian ships managed to disengage before the cruisers could close the distance.|$|E
5|$|Kronprinz saw limited duty {{during the}} Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. Engine {{troubles}} aboard the ship, {{along with the}} two other armored frigates in her squadron, prevented operations against the French blockade. Only two sorties in which Kronprinz participated were conducted, both of which {{did not result in}} combat. The ship served in the subsequent Imperial Navy until she was converted into a training ship for <b>boiler</b> <b>room</b> personnel in 1901. The ship was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E

5|$|After her {{overhaul}} {{was completed}} in June 1944, the ship resumed her former duties in the Skagerrak, although the repairs required after another <b>boiler</b> <b>room</b> fire in August necessitated lengthy repairs in Oslo. She was damaged after colliding with the mole in Frederikshavn, Denmark, on 18 November and became operational again on 7 January 1945. Theodor Riedel remained in Southern Norway and Denmark until the ships there were ordered into the Baltic {{to assist with the}} evacuation of the Hel Peninsula on 5 May. After unloading the refugees in Copenhagen, she made another voyage to Hela and returned to Copenhagen on 7 May. The crew surrendered in Kiel three days later.|$|E

5|$|The Georgia School of Technology {{opened in}} the fall of 1888 with two {{building}}s. One building (now Tech Tower, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a foundry, forge, <b>boiler</b> <b>room,</b> and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both the mind and the hands, though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 <b>boiler</b> <b>room,</b> a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5|$|Destined {{to carry}} wheat and {{phosphate}} fertilizer, both ships sailed initially from New Orleans for St John's in October1941, {{to take on}} cargoes of wheat bound for Ireland. Since insurers such as Lloyd's of London charged higher premiums for ships not in convoy, the Irish Oak and the Irish Pine were painted war-time camouflage in preparation for sailing in-convoy. Irish Pine joined Convoy SC56 and arrived in Dublin on 11December1941. In contrast, Irish Oak experienced a number of serious mishaps and setbacks: Chief Engineer R. Marsh, of Dublin, {{suffered a heart attack}} and was hospitalised in New Orleans; another engineer, O’Keefe of Dún Laoghaire, was severely burned in a <b>boiler</b> <b>room</b> blow-back and hospitalised in StJohn; and a locally recruited Greek replacement engineer caused difficulties, was reported to the Canadian authorities by the captain, and jailed.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} her repairs she ran aground outside Vladivostok on 13 October {{and was not}} ready for sea until February 1905. The Russians took this opportunity to reinforce her armament with six more 6-inch guns mounted on her upper deck, protected by lightly armoured casemates. Her armament was rearranged as well with her foremost six-inch guns moved from their casemates to the forecastle and the rearmost six-inch guns moved forward. Room for these changes was made by removing many of her lighter guns; she retained only nineteen 75mm and two 37mm guns. She also received several Barr and Stroud rangefinders at this time. While testing her new Telefunken radio equipment on 24 May she struck a mine near her forward <b>boiler</b> <b>room.</b> She was {{able to return to}} Vladivostok for repairs, but took no further part in the war.|$|E
5|$|Napier {{assisted}} in the evacuation of British and Commonwealth troops from the island of Crete in late May, following the successful Axis invasion. On one such occasion the vessel embarked 296 soldiers, three women, one Greek and one Chinese civilian, ten sailors, two children and a dog. Returning to Alexandria, the destroyer came under attack but arrived unscathed. Two days later Napier was less fortunate; having taken 705 soldiers on board, she was targeted on her return journey by a formation of twelve German dive-bombers. The ship was struck twice by bombs and suffered damage to the stern, the engine room and <b>boiler</b> <b>room.</b> One of the aircraft was shot down and a further three damaged. Although no allied casualties were sustained and the destroyer arrived safely in Alexandria, she spent the next two-and-a-half months in Port Said under repair.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels that initially acted as storage facilities for both the Company's property and also the luggage of passengers.

5|$|The Bucknill Committee, {{which had}} been set up to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted <b>boiler</b> <b>room</b> flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E
