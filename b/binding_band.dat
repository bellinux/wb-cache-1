40|$|Abstract Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a {{zoonotic}} pathogen {{of which}} {{several species of}} animal were reported as reservoirs. Swine stands out as the major reservoir for HEV infection in humans, {{as suggested by the}} close genetic relationship of swine and human virus and cross-species infection of HEV. Up to now, the mechanism of cross-species infection of HEV from swine to humans is still unclear.

We have analyzed non-interacting bosons, weakly interacting bosons using Bogoliubov method, and strongly interacting bosons through a renormalized Hamiltonian approach valid for number of bosons per site {{less than or equal}} to unity.

The growth of condensate fraction of non-interacting bosons is found to be very close to that of free bosons.

Interestingly, AFHbs exhibit a peroxidase activity {{higher than that}} observed for mammalian and temperate fish Hbs, thus suggesting that a partial hemichrome state in tetrameric Hbs does not protect them from peroxidation as previously proposed (2).

(4) This valence hybrid states prompted us to test a FeSOD activity, that is as low as human Hb.

Because YCBCO is a polar material, self-consistent treatment of the long range Coulomb interaction leads to a transfer of charge between the film surfaces, and {{to the formation of}} surface states.

Results: Sixty-two subjects participated: 12 with confirmed occupational asthma/rhinitis (ORA+), 40 asymptomatic exposed (ORA 2), and 10 controls. Of the confirmed subjects, 83 % had a positive SPT to obeche. There was a 100 % recognition by ELISA in symptomatic subjects vs. 30 % and 10 % in asymptomatic exposed subjects and controls respectively (p, 0. 05). Two new proteins were purified, a 24 kDa protein identified as a putative thaumatin-like protein and a 12 kDa gamma-expansin. Both showed allergenic activity in vitro, with the putative thaumatin being the most active, with 92 % recognition by ELISA and 100 % by basophil activation test in ORA+ subjects. Cross-reactivity due to CCD was ruled out in 82 % of cases. Conclusions: Two proteins of obeche wood were identified and were recognized by {{a high percentage of}} symptomati...|$|R
40|$|The {{attachment}} of Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{to human}} respiratory mucus represents {{an important step}} in the development of lung infection, especially in cases of cystic fibrosis. For this purpose, microtiter plate adhesion assays have been developed and have suggested that nonpilus adhesins of P. aeruginosa are the most important ones for binding to human respiratory mucins. In order to characterize these mucin-binding adhesins, outer membrane proteins (OMP) from two adhesive strains, 1244 -NP and PAK-NP, and their poorly adhesive rpoN mutants, 1244 -N 3 and PAK-N 1, were prepared by a mild extraction with Zwittergent 3 - 14. Mucin-binding adhesins were detected after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotting of the OMP on nitrocellulose replicas, using human bronchial mucins labeled with 125 I. The binding properties of these OMP with lactotransferrin, another glycoprotein abundant in respiratory mucus, were also studied. Radiolabeled mucins detected four bands at 48, 46, 28, and 25 kDa with strain PAK-NP. With the nonmucoid strain 1244 -NP, five bands were observed at 48, 46, 42, 28, and 25 kDa. The bands at 48 and 25 kDa were also visualized by radiolabeled lactotransferrin. These bands were partially or completely displaced by nonradiolabeled respiratory mucin glycopeptides but not by tetramethylurea, suggesting that they recognized carbohydrate sites. In contrast, the poorly adhesive strains showed weakly <b>binding</b> <b>bands.</b> These results demonstrate that outer membranes from two different nonpiliated P. aeruginosa strains express multiple adhesins with an affinity for human respiratory mucins and/or lactotransferrin...|$|R
