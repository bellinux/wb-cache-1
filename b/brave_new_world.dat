25|$|Huxley wrote <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> {{while living}} in Sanary-sur-Mer, France, in the four months from May to August 1931. By this time, Huxley had already {{established}} himself as a writer and social satirist. He was a contributor to Vanity Fair and Vogue magazines, and had published a collection of his poetry (The Burning Wheel, 1916) and four successful satirical novels: Crome Yellow (1921), Antic Hay (1923), Those Barren Leaves (1925), and Point Counter Point (1928). <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> was Huxley's fifth novel and first dystopian work.|$|E
25|$|In {{the decades}} since the {{publication}} of Nineteen Eighty-Four, there have been numerous comparisons to the Aldous Huxley's novel <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> <b>World,</b> which had been published 17 years earlier, in 1932.

However, members of the ruling class of Nineteen Eighty-Four use brutal force, torture and mind control to keep individuals in line, but rulers in <b>Brave</b> <b>New</b> <b>World</b> keep the citizens in line by addictive drugs and pleasurable distractions.|$|E

Lowland South American groups are not bearers of distinctive traits to be inventoried and classified, but organized totalities responding to specific social rules, laws, and constraints. Interest in the particular, therefore, results from an appreciation of the necessity of accurate scholarship, no less than <b>brave</b> <b>new</b> <b>worlds</b> of theory, as Rivière's work on the dialectical relationship between cosmological schemas and forms of social organization demonstrates.|$|R
