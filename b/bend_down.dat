5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult {{survival}} probability, and an unusually long lifespan {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey for the big cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles can also be a threat to giraffes when they <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s clubs {{began to}} create {{strongly}} individual strips, and in 1975 Leeds United, who had changed their traditional {{blue and gold}} colours to all white in the 1960s to mimic Real Madrid, became the first club to design shirts which could be sold to fans {{in the form of}} replicas. Driven by commercial concerns, other clubs soon followed suit, adding manufacturers' logos and a higher level of trim. In 1973, German team Eintracht Braunschweig signed a deal with local alcohol producer Jägermeister to display its logo on the front of their shirts. Soon almost all major clubs had signed such deals, and the cost to companies who sponsor large teams has increased dramatically. In 2008 German club FC Bayern Munich received €25 million in sponsorship money from Deutsche Telekom. However Spanish clubs FC Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao refused to allow sponsors' logos to appear on their shirts as recently as 2005. Until 2011 Barcelona refused paying sponsors in favour of wearing the UNICEF logo on their shirts while donating €1.5 million to the charity per year. Players also began to sign sponsorship deals with individual companies. In 1974 Johan Cruijff refused to wear the Dutch national team's strip as its Adidas branding conflicted with his own individual contract with Puma, and was permitted to wear a version without the Adidas branding. Puma had also paid Pelé $120,000 to wear their boots and specifically requested that he <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> and tie his laces {{at the start of the}} 1970 FIFA World Cup final, ensuring a close-up of the boots for a worldwide television audience.|$|E
5|$|The Anthony Roll was {{originally}} {{a set of}} three separate vellum rolls. It exists today {{in the form of}} a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches). After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace à Dieu, Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, there are no plans to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls. The second roll, British Library Additional MS 22047, is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.|$|E

25|$|Grace was 50 {{years and}} 320 days old {{on the last}} day of the first Test. It says a lot about The Champion that he was still worth his place as a batsman. But he could no longer <b>bend</b> <b>down,</b> so his fielding was poor, and the Nottinghamshire crowd jeered and heckled him for it every time a ball went past him at point. Grace himself put it to the {{selection}} committee that he should be dropped for the second Test, and after some debate this is what happened. Only one man has played Test cricket at a greater age. He is Wilfred Rhodes, who coincidentally made his debut in the first Test.|$|E
25|$|The old fleurs-de-lis, {{especially}} the ones {{found in our}} first kings' sceptres, have a lot less in common with ordinary lilies than the flowers called flambas , or irises, from which the name of our own fleur-de-lis may derive. What gives some colour of truth to this hypothesis that we already put forth, {{is the fact that}} the French or Franks, before entering Gaul itself, lived for a long time around the river named Leie in the Flanders. Nowadays, this river is still bordered with an exceptional number of irises —as many plants grow for centuries in the same places—: these irises have yellow flowers, which is not a typical feature of lilies but fleurs-de-lis. It was thus understandable that our kings, having to choose a symbolic image for what later became a coat of arms, set their minds on the iris, a flower that was common around their homes, and is also as beautiful as it was remarkable. They called it, in short, the fleur-de-lis, instead of the flower of the river of lis. This flower, or iris, looks like our fleur-de-lis not just because of its yellow colour but also because of its shape: of the six petals, or leaves, that it has, three of them are alternatively straight and meet at their tops. The other three on the opposite, <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> so that the middle one seems to make one with the stalk and only the two ones facing out from left and right can clearly be seen, which is again similar with our fleurs-de-lis, that is to say exclusively the one from the river Luts whose white petals <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> too when the flower blooms.|$|E

When he ordered Bachman to <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> on his knees, Bachman refused and was executed by Möngke's brother Bujek. Möngke also engaged in hand-to-hand combat during the Mongol invasion of Rus'. While his cousins, Shiban and Büri, went to Crimea, Möngke and Kadan, a son of Ögedei, were ordered to reduce the tribes in the Caucasus. The Mongols captured the Alan capital Maghas and massacred its inhabitants. Many chiefs of the Alans and Circassians surrendered to Möngke. After the conquest of Europe, Möngke would bring them back to Mongolia. He also participated in the Siege of Kiev (1240). Möngke was apparently taken by the splendor of Kiev and offered the city surrender, but his envoys were killed. After Batu's army joined Möngke's soldiers, they sacked the city. He also fought alongside Batu at the Battle of Mohi. In the summer of 1241, before the premature end of the campaign, Möngke returned home after his uncle Ögedei recalled him in the winter of 1240–41. However, Ögedei died.|$|E

The leaves grow in crowded clusters {{at the ends}} of the branches, and may droop slightly at the tips and <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> from the bases when old. They are thick and have an indistinct midrib. The fine nerves are more or less equal and parallel. The upper and lower leaf surfaces are similar.|$|E
500|$|The attitude/thrust {{control system}} {{consisted}} of a large ring situated outside of the main disk, shaped roughly like a rounded triangle with the flat surface on the [...] "inside." [...] Viewing the craft from the side, the control flap is almost invisible, appearing in its neutral position to blend into the profile. The pilot's controls moved the ring {{in relation to the}} rest of the craft, affecting the airflow moving outward from the center of the craft. Vertical lift could be increased by moving the entire ring down, which would produce more airflow over its upper surface, which would then <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> over this surface toward the ground. Tilting the ring resulted in asymmetric thrust for directional control.|$|E

500|$|A giraffe rests by lying {{with its}} body {{on top of}} its folded legs. To lie down, the animal kneels on its front legs and then lowers {{the rest of its}} body. To get back up, it first gets on its knees and spreads its hind legs to raise its hindquarters. It then {{straightens}} its front legs. With each step, the animal swings its head. In captivity, the giraffe sleeps intermittently around 4.6 hours per day, mostly at night. It usually sleeps lying down, however, standing sleeps have been recorded, particularly in older individuals. Intermittent short [...] "deep sleep" [...] phases while lying are characterised by the giraffe bending its neck backwards and resting its head on the hip or thigh, a position believed to indicate paradoxical sleep. If the giraffe wants to <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> to drink, it either spreads its front legs or bends its knees. Giraffes would probably not be competent swimmers as their long legs would be highly cumbersome in the water, although they could possibly float. When swimming, the thorax would be weighed down by the front legs, making it difficult for the animal to move its neck and legs in harmony or keep its head above the surface.|$|E

2500|$|To {{maintain}} a philosophical balance, {{the argument for}} [...] "raw feels" [...] needs to be set {{side by side with}} the claim above. Viewing sensations as [...] "raw feels" [...] implies that initially they have not yet—to carry on the metaphor—been [...] "cooked", that is, unified into [...] "things" [...] and [...] "persons", which is something the mind does after the sensation has responded to the blank input, that response driven by motivation, that is, initially by pain and pleasure, and subsequently, when memories have been implanted, by desire and fear. Such a [...] "raw-feel" [...] state has been more formally identified as [...] "non-epistemic". In support of this view, the theorists cite a range of empirical facts. The following can be taken as representative. There are brain-damaged persons, known as [...] "agnosics" [...] (literally [...] "not-knowing") who still have vivid visual sensations but are quite unable to identify any entity before them, including parts of their own body. There is also the similar predicament of persons, formerly blind, who are given sight for the first time—and consider what it is a newborn baby must experience. A German psychologist of the 19th century, Hermann von Helmholtz, proposed a simple experiment to demonstrate the non-epistemic nature of qualia: his instructions were to stand in front of a familiar landscape, turn your back on it, <b>bend</b> <b>down</b> and look at the landscape between your legs—you will find it difficult in the upside-down view to recognize what you found familiar before.|$|E
