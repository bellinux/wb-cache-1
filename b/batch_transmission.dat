Transmission design {{plays a key role in}} leveraging the benefits of CRNs. In this paper, we propose an efficient <b>batch</b> <b>transmission</b> scheme for the data transmission in multi-channel CRNs with practical lossy channels. The proposed scheme exploits the dynamic spectrum opportunities by combining opportunistic routing strategy with network coding based multi-channel transmission. We derive network performance measures of the scheme in terms of batch delay, which provide better insights into the data transmission capability than packet based link delay analysis. Our analyses, validated by simulations, show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms others, reducing batch delay by up to 60 %. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Efficient data {{transmission}} in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) {{is critical for}} cognitive radio (CR) users {{to communicate with each}} other in an opportunistic manner. Even with successful access to required channels, the transmission could still suffer from failures due to channel fading. In this paper, we propose a random linear coded scheme for efficient {{data transmission}} in multi-channel CRNs under practical fading channel conditions. We develop theoretical analysis and derive general form solutions for the batch delay associated with the proposed scheme. We also use our theoretical model to analyze the performances of two multi-channel automatic repeat request (ARQ) based schemes. Simulation results validate the analysis and show that the coded scheme outperforms the ARQ based schemes in terms of <b>batch</b> <b>transmission</b> delay.

However, direct application of current MACs leads to high protocol overhead and significant throughput degradation. In this paper, we propose ADCA 1, a high-performance MAC that works with high-capacity physical layer. ADCA exploits two ideas of adaptive <b>batch</b> <b>transmission</b> and opportunistic selection of high-rate hosts to simultaneously reduce overhead and improve aggregate throughput. It seeks to provide high-rate hosts temporal {{fair share of the}} channel similar to the single-rate IEEE 802. 11, and low-rate hosts proportional temporal fairness in long term.

40|$|Bundle authentication, which {{ensures the}} {{authenticity}} {{and integrity of}} bundles, is critical in space Delay/disruption-Tolerant Networks (DTNs). When bundle fragment services are needed, the previous solutions directly using digital signatures suffer from heavy computational costs and bandwidth overheads. This paper addresses the issue of fragment authentication for Bundle Protocol by exploiting erasure codes and the <b>batch</b> <b>transmission</b> characteristic of DTNs. Erasure codes are adopted to allow all the fragments of a bundle to equally share only one signature, to tolerate high delays as well as unexpected loss of connectivity. Following this generic idea, we present two approaches, {{both of which are}} effective in filtering inauthentic fragments as early as possible. The first one takes a surprisingly low bandwidth overhead, while it makes all received fragments of a bundle to be removed when there is an inauthentic one, because of its failure in locating the inauthentic fragments. Considering this defect, we present an improved scheme which is able to detect inauthentic fragments thanks to a special hash chain and then only remove these inauthentic ones. The performance simulation demonstrates that both our schemes significantly reduce bandwidth overheads and computational costs as compared to the prior works...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} AMCM, a traffic-adaptive multichannel MAC protocol {{that increases}} the capacity of wireless network by enabling multiple concurrent transmissions on orthogonal frequency channels using a single halfduplex transceiver. AMCM {{is based on the}} IEEE 802. 11 MAC but provides fine-grain, asynchronous coordination among locally interfering nodes for channel negotiation. By incorporating load-awareness, channel availability awareness and <b>batch</b> <b>transmissions,</b> our window-based approach achieves high channel utilization under varying load, while avoiding the control-window saturation problem as the number of channels increases. For single-hop scenarios, we show that, at low load, AMCM is comparable to IEEE 802. 11 MAC, while under high load, AMCM delivers almost N × improvement gain over IEEE 802. 11 MAC protocol, where N is the number of channels. AMCM also outperforms existing multi-channel MAC protocols [8, 11] by 100 % and 150 % respectively under high load at a lower hardware cost and complexity.

Web++ selects a server which is available and that is expected to provide the fastest response time. Furthermore, Web++ guarantees data delivery, provided that at least one server containing the requested data is available. After detecting a server failure, Web++ client requests are satisfied transparently to the client by another server. Furthermore, the Web++ architecture is flexible enough for implementing additional performance optimizations. We describe implementation of one such optimization, <b>batch</b> resource <b>transmission,</b> whereby all resources embedded in an HTML page that are not cached by the client are sent to the client in a single response. Web++ is built on top of the standard HTTP protocol and does not require any changes either in existing Web browsers, or the installation of any software on the client side. In particular, Web++ clients are dynamically downloaded to Web browsers as signed Java applets. We implemented a Web++ prototype; performance experiments indicate that Web++ system with 3 servers improves the response time perceived by clients on average by 36. 6 %, and in many cases by as much as 59 %, when compared with the current Web performance.

Wireless video streaming applications are characterized by their bandwidth-intensity, delay-sensitivity, and loss-tolerance.

Through randomization at the ingress routers and <b>batch</b> scheduling of <b>transmission</b> requests at the links, it ensures that a fraction of transmissions from each ingress–egress connection consistently experience low blocking probability at every hop.

The growth kinetics were studied using a particle-free flux. The deposition results suggest that HS− ions formed through the thiourea hydrolysis reaction are the dominant sulfide ion source responsible for the CdS deposition rather than thioura itself that had been widely discussed in almost all of the previous literature. This finding could not be observed previously by a conventional CBD batch setup because all the reactant solutions were sequentially pulled into the reaction beaker and mixed all at once.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{primary goal}} of this thesis is to {{synthesize}} titanium dioxide nanorods using a continuous flow microreactor. Titania powder, {{one of the most}} important particulate materials is used for many purposes owing to its excellent optical properties of a high refractive index leading to high hiding power and whiteness of titania paint, high chemical stability, and relatively low production cost. Particularly, one-dimensional inorganic nanostructures (rods, wires and tubes) of TiO₂ attract both relevant theoretical and technological interest, because they reveal a wide range of electrical and optical properties that depend on both size and shape. In our research, the growth of anatase TiO₂ nanorods was carefully controlled at low reaction temperature (around 100 °C) with oleic acid as a surfactant preventing hydrolysis of titania nuclei in undesired sites. Hinder hydrolysis of titanium alkoxide has been engaged and manipulated by means of a strategy that relies on the chemical modification of the titania precursor (Titanium tetraisopropoxide and Oleic acid) by the carboxylic acid, and on the use of suitable catalysts (trimethylamino-N-oxide dehydrate, TMAO) to promote crystallization in a continues flow microreactor. The X-ray diffraction and raman spectroscopy analysis show that TiO₂ produced from the microreactor matched with the products from the <b>batch</b> synthesis. Scanning <b>Transmission</b> electron Microscope (TEM) and High Resolution TEM images show that TiO₂ nanoparticles were rod shape, and Fourier transform of the HRTEM image indicates that mineral form of TiO₂ corresponds to the standard TiO 2 anatase diffraction pattern.

The continuous flow microreactor can produce TiO₂ nanorods much faster (about 40 to 50 min of residence time) than a batch reactor (with reaction time around 24 hr), and the quality of the TiO₂ nanorods from the microreactor is as good as the nanorods from the conventional batch reactor...|$|R

40|$|This project {{considered}} {{the use of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a biosorbent for the removal and recovery of a range of metals from contaminated waters. S. cerevisiae, as a biosorbent, has the potential to provide a cost effective, selective and highly efficient purification system. Initial studies focused on metal accumulation by an immobilized baker's S. cerevisiae biosorbent. The parameters affecting metal uptake were investigated, these included metal concentration, time and solution pH. Metal uptake was rapid. Gold and cobalt reached saturation within 5 min of contact with the biosorbent in batch reactors. Copper, zinc, nickel, cadmium and chromium reached saturation within 30 min of contact. Metal accumulation was pH dependent and was generally unaffected at a solution pH ≥ 4, and was substantially decreased at pH ≤ 2. The exception was gold which was preferentially accumulated at a solution pH of 2. The immobilized baker's yeast accumulated metals with maximum binding capacities in the order of gold > cadmium > cobalt > zinc > copper > chromium > nickel. A rapid method to assess metal recovery was developed. Bioaccumulated metal was efficiently recovered using dilute mineral acids. Copper recovery of ≥ 80 % was achieved by decreasing the solution pH of the reaction mixture to 2 with the addition of nominal quantities of HCl, H₂SO₄ or RNO₃. Adsorption-desorption over 8 cycles had no apparent adverse effect on metal uptake or recovery in <b>batch</b> reactors. <b>Transmission</b> electron microscopy showed no evidence of damage to cells used in copper adsorption-desorption investigations. Biosorption columns were investigated as bioreactors due to their application potential. The metals investigated were effectively removed from solution. At a saturation threshold, metal uptake declined rapidly. Most metals investigated were desorbed from the columns by eluting with 0. 1 M HCl. Initially recoveries of copper, cobalt and cadmium were as high as 100 %. Desorbed copper, zinc, cadmium, nickel and cobalt were concentrated in 10 to 15 ml of eluent, representing up to a 40 fold decrease in solution volume. Cadmium, nickel and zinc uptake increased with the second application to the columns. Initial accumulation of gold and chromium was 42. 2 μmol/g and 28. 6 μmol/g, however, due to the low recoveries of these two metals, a second application was not investigated. Copper was applied to a single column for 8 consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. Uptake increased from an initial 31. 3 μmol/g to 47. 8 μmol/g at cycle 7. The potential for selective metal recovery was demonstrated using two biosorption columns in series. Copper was accumulated and recovered most efficiently. Zinc, cobalt and cadmium were displaced to the second column. Copper bound preferentially to zinc at a ratio of 6 : 1. Copper bound preferentially to cobalt at a ratio of 4 : 1. Cadmium was only displaced at a ratio of 2 : 1. The successful transfer of the bioremediation technology from the laboratory to an industrial application has yet to be realized. Bioremediation of a Plaatjiesvlei Black Mountain mine effluent, which contained copper, zinc, lead and iron, was investigated in this project. The removal of the metals was most effective at pH 4. A combined strategy of pH adjustment and bioremediation using immobilized S. cerevisiae decreased the copper concentration by 92. 5 %, lead was decreased by 90 % and zinc was decreased by 60 %. Iron was mostly precipitated from solution at pH ≥ 4. An ageing pond at the mine with conditions such as; pH, water volume and metal concentration, which were more conducive to biological treatment was subsequently identified. The investigation indicated a possible application of the biomass as a supplement to chemical remediation. The metal removal capability of a waste brewer's yeast was subsequently investigated. A yeast conditioning step increased metal uptake up to 100 % and enhanced reproducibility. Metal removal from solution was rapid and pH dependent. The metals were efficiently removed from solution at pH ≥ 4. Uptake was substantially inhibited at pH ≤ 3. The waste brewer's yeast accumulated metals with maximum binding capacities in the order of copper (25. 4 μmol/g) > lead (19. 4 μmol/g) > iron (15. 6 μmol/g) > zinc (12. 5 μmol/g). No correlation between cell physiology and metal uptake was observed. Uptake of the four metals was confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The interference of lead, zinc and iron on copper uptake by the waste brewer's yeast, and the interference of copper on the uptake of lead, zinc and iron was investigated. Maximum copper uptake was not decreased in the presence of lead. The Bmax remained constant at approximately 25 μmol/g. The dissociation constants increased with increasing lead concentrations. Lead bioaccumulation was significantly decreased in the presence of copper. The type of inhibition was dependent on the initial copper concentrations. Zinc had a slight synergistic effect on copper uptake. The copper Bmax increased from 30. 8 μmol/g in a single-ion system to 34. 5 μmol/g in the presence of 200 μmol/l of zinc. Zinc uptake was severely inhibited in the presence of copper. The maximum uptake and dissociation constant values were decreased in the presence of copper, which suggested an uncompetitive inhibition. The affinity of copper was substantially higher than zinc. The presence of higher levels of copper than zinc in the yeast cells was confirmed by energy dispersive microanalysis. Copper uptake was decreased in the presence of iron, with the copper Bmax being decreased from 25. 4 μmol/g in a single-ion system to 20. 1 μmol/g in the presence of 200 μmol/l iron. Iron Bmax values remained constant at 16. 0 μmol/g. Combined biosorption and EDXA results suggested the iron bound at a higher affinity than copper to the cell wall. Total copper removal was higher as larger quantities of copper were deposited in the cell cytoplasm. Metal removal from the Plaatjiesvlei effluent by free cell suspensions of the waste brewer's yeast was satisfactory. Copper levels were decreased by 96 %, iron by 42 %, lead 25 % and zinc 2 %. Waste brewer's yeast is a cheap source of biomass in South Africa, and could potentially provide the basis for the development of an innovative purification system for metal-contaminated waters. ...|$|R
