25|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{increasing}} the number of teams would increase the validity of team comparisons in conferences, which do not compete with one another during the regular season; teams typically only play three or four non-conference games, as the result of pre-determined schedules. BCS proponents view the possibility of expanded competitive post-season opportunities as negative. The primary delivery of this objection is a slippery slope argument rhetorically known as bracket creep. Implementation of a playoff system, proponents object, would lead to other, more serious consequences, such as the diminished value of the regular season, diminished value of the bowl tradition, or damage to the collegiate academic calendar year. Critics, including Republican congressman Joe Barton, have <b>been</b> <b>quick</b> to respond to these red herrings, noting that teams from non-AQ conferences are already excluded from the national championship and their inclusion would only improve the meaningfulness of the regular season.|$|E

500|$|Training as an air cadet at RAAF Point Cook near Melbourne, Hughes learnt {{to fly in}} de Havilland Moths before {{progressing}} to Westland Wapitis in {{the middle}} of the year. A practical joker who bridled under RAAF discipline, his euphoria during his first solo on 11March 1936 was such that he [...] "went mad, whistled, sang and almost jumped for joy".

The website forecast that Edge of Tomorrow would gross [...] in North America and [...] in other territories. TheWrap said that the studio focused on theatrical releases in other territories where Cruise [...] "remains a major force" [...] in drawing audiences.

2500|$|Sixteen Danish {{soldiers}} {{died in the}} invasion, {{but after}} two hours the Danish government surrendered, believing that resistance was useless and hoping to work out an advantageous agreement with Germany. The flat territory of Jutland was a perfect area for the German army to operate in, and the surprise attack on Copenhagen had made any attempt to defend Zealand impossible. The Germans had also <b>been</b> <b>quick</b> to establish control over the bridge across the Little Belt, thus gaining access to the island of Funen. Believing that further resistance would only result in the futile loss of still more Danish lives, the Danish cabinet ultimately decided to bow to the German pressure [...] "under protest". The German forces were technologically sophisticated and numerous; the Danish forces comparatively tiny and used obsolete equipment; partially {{a result of a}} pre-war policy of trying to avoid antagonizing Germany by supplying the army with modern equipment. Even stiff resistance from the Danes would not have lasted long. Questions have been raised around the apparent fact that the German forces did not seem to expect any resistance, invading with unarmored ships and vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|Flashman's {{portrait}} (unnamed, {{but with}} unmistakable background and characteristics) {{hangs in the}} home of the protagonist of The Peshawar Lancers, an alternative history novel by S. M. Stirling: the family claims to have had an ancestor who held Piper's Fort, as Flashman did; the protagonist claims his sole talents are for horsemanship and languages and has an Afghan in his service named [...] "Ibrahim Khan" [...] (cf. Ilderim Khan); late in the book, he plays with Elias the Jew on a [...] "black jade chess set" [...] matching the description of the one Flashman stole from the Summer Palace in Flashman and the Dragon; the book's chief antagonist is named Ignatieff. Another allusion to Flashman by Stirling occurs in his short story [...] "The Charge of Lee's Brigade", which appeared in the alternative history anthology Alternate Generals (1998, ed. by Harry Turtledove). Here, Sir Robert E. Lee is a British general in the Crimean War who orders an officer, obviously Flashman (Cherrypicker trousers, rides like a Comanche in battle), {{to take part in a}} better-planned Charge of the Light Brigade. Flashman dies in the attack, demonstrating some courage despite what Lee perceives only as nervousness. So, in this version Flashman again ends up a hero.
