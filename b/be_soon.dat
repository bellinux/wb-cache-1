5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Los Angeles, California, Levine began his musical career in 1994, when he co-founded the {{alternative}} rock band Kara's Flowers, {{of which he was}} the lead vocalist and guitarist. The band split up after their only album, The Fourth World (released in 1997), which did not gain popularity. In 2001, the group was reformed – with guitarist James Valentine joining the line-up – and began a new musical chapter, changing their name to Maroon 5. In 2002, the band released their first album, Songs About Jane, which went multi-platinum in the US. Since then, they have released five more albums: It Won't <b>Be</b> <b>Soon</b> Before Long (2007), Hands All Over (2010), Overexposed (2012), V (2014) and Red Pill Blues (2017). As part of Maroon 5, Levine has received three Grammy Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, two American Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award and a World Music Award.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it was rumoured that, {{following}} the armistice, all French troops would <b>be</b> <b>soon</b> returned by the Germans. From {{the autumn of}} 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that {{a disproportionate number of}} prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes.|$|E

5|$|By early May, 1st Airborne Division {{had been}} brought up to strength, albeit mainly with inexperienced replacements. 4th Parachute Brigade had been disbanded and its battalions merged with those of 1st Parachute Brigade in the {{aftermath}} of the Battle of Arnhem. It was replaced by 1st Independent Polish Parachute Brigade. The Norwegian Parachute Company was also attached to the 1st Airborne Division. However, on 4 May, Urquhart was ordered to despatch 1st Independent Polish Brigade to Dunkirk, and to detach 1st Parachute Brigade from the division; one of the brigade's battalions would immediately be transported to Denmark for occupation duties, with the rest of the Brigade remaining in Britain as a reserve formation. At the same time the rest of the division was warned that it would <b>be</b> <b>soon</b> be transported by air to Norway as part of the occupation force, with the Special Air Service Brigade being temporarily attached to the division to replace 1st Parachute Brigade. Urquhart informed Thorne that the division could be ready for deployment in 48 hours, far less time than Thorne and his staff had expected. When it entered Norway, the division would be responsible for maintaining law and order in the areas it occupied, ensuring that German units followed the terms of their surrender, securing and then protecting captured airfields, and finally preventing the sabotage of essential military and civilian structures. To achieve this, the division would be formed of three brigades: 1st Airlanding Brigade, Special Air Service Brigade and an ad hoc Artillery Brigade formed from divisional troops.|$|E

William Mahone on the Turnpike, and Anderson's other brigades and Jackson's arriving units on the Plank Road. At about the same time, Hooker ordered his men to advance on three roads to the east: two divisions of Meade's V Corps (Griffin and Humphreys) on the River Road to uncover Banks's Ford, and the remaining division (Sykes) on the Turnpike; and Slocum's XII Corps on the Plank Road, with Howard's XI Corps in close support.

He regrets his acts of rage and fury, and decides to perform penance to atone for the killings in his past. He starts meditating on the form of Rāma. With Sahasrārjuna killed and Paraśurāma putting down his weapons, Rāvaṇa's might is unchallenged and he terrorizes the whole earth – he lifts the Kailāsa mountain, torments the eight Diggajas, wins the kingdom of Indra and terrorizes everybody who performs Dharma. Unable to bear the menace of Rāvaṇa, Pṛthvī {{takes the form of}} a cow and goes weeping to the Sumeru mountain. Brahmā has a discussion with Pṛthvī and Śiva. Brahmā then goes to Sāketaloka to see Sītā and Rāma. He eulogizes Rāma in 31 verses (10.56–10.86), beseeching him to take an Avatāra to slay Rāvaṇa. Rāma assures him that he will <b>be</b> <b>soon</b> born as Rāma with his three Viṣṇu Aṃśas – the Viṣṇu in Kṣīrasāgara as Bharata, the Viṣṇu in Vaikuṇṭha as Lakṣmaṇa and Viṣṇu in Śvetadvīpa as Śatrughna. When Brahmā returns assured, Rāma requests Sītā to also take an Avatāra after his Avatāra. He then decides to be born as the son of Kausalyā in Ayodhyā.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the release}} of It Won't <b>Be</b> <b>Soon</b> Before Long, music critics commented on the {{original}} version of the song, which does not include guest vocals by Rihanna. Jerome Blakeney for BBC wrote that [...] "If I Never See Your Face Again", along with another It Won't <b>Be</b> <b>Soon</b> Before Long track [...] "Makes Me Wonder", were [...] "monster weapons of mass-marketing aimed at the feet and riding on swathes of string-drenched, synth-crunching disco." [...] A reviewer for IGN was complimentary of 'If I Never See Your Face Again', writing {{that it is hard}} to resist listening to the song. The reviewer also noted that Levine appeared to adopt a vocal style reminiscent of techniques employed by Justin Timberlake, writing [...] "Like Justin Timberlake it's all about the high pitched tenor falsetto and some sinewy grooves." ...|$|E
