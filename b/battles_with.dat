5|$|English {{folklore}} {{developed over}} many centuries. Some {{of the characters}} and stories are present across England, but most belong to specific regions.

6000|$|... "That's {{as it may}} be. The same {{complaint}} {{which you}} make of me for <b>battling</b> <b>with</b> another clergyman of our own church, the Mohammedan would make against me for <b>battling</b> <b>with</b> the error of a priest of Rome. Yet, surely, {{you would not be}} inclined to say that I should be wrong to do <b>battle</b> <b>with</b> such as him. A pagan, too, with his multiplicity of gods, would think it equally odd that the Christian and the Mohammedan should disagree." ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1410s several Fellows of Oriel {{took part in}} the {{disturbances}} accompanying Archbishop Arundel's attempt to stamp out Lollardy in the University; the Lollard belief that religious power and authority came through piety and not through the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, John Wycliffe, had been head of Balliol. Disregarding the Provost's authority, Oriel's Fellows fought bloody <b>battles</b> <b>with</b> other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor's servants when they attacked his house, and were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.|$|E

Five massive armies were launched in Syria from different routes in June 636 to recapture it.|$|E

5|$|Rather {{than using}} a turn-based battle system like {{contemporaneous}} role-playing games, Secret of Mana features real-time <b>battles</b> <b>with</b> a power bar mechanic. The game {{has a unique}} Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions {{in the middle of}} battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop {{in and out of the}} game at any time.

5|$|The Magyars, {{settled in}} the Pontic-Caspian steppe by the 830s, began a westward {{migration}} after their defeat {{by a coalition of}} Pechenegs and Bulgarians in about 895. They crossed the Carpathian Mountains, invading the surrounding area. Gelou is a local ruler described in the Gesta Hungarorum as an opponent of the invading Magyars. Anonymus did not write about Simeon I of Bulgaria, Svatopluk I of Moravia or other opponents known from contemporary sources, instead chronicling Magyar <b>battles</b> <b>with</b> local rulers (including Gelou, Menumorut and Salan) not mentioned in other primary sources.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata {{describes}} Vishnu {{holding a}} gada and a chakra, possibly indicating two-armed images of Vishnu.
