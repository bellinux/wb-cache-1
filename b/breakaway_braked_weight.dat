25|$|On any {{bike with}} only rear wheel braking, the maximum {{deceleration}} is {{significantly lower than}} on a bike equipped with a front brake. As a vehicle <b>brakes,</b> <b>weight</b> can be transferred towards the front wheel {{and away from the}} rear, decreasing the amount of grip the rear wheel has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases rear wheel braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard.|$|R
50|$|By way of example, when {{a vehicle}} accelerates, a weight {{transfer}} {{toward the rear}} wheels can occur. An outside observer might witness this as the vehicle visibly leans to the back, or squats. Conversely, under <b>braking,</b> <b>weight</b> transfer {{toward the front of}} the car can occur. Under hard braking it might be clearly visible even from inside the vehicle as the nose dives toward the ground (most of this will be due to load transfer). Similarly, during changes in direction (lateral acceleration), weight transfer to the outside of the direction of the turn can occur.|$|R

Development commenced with the largest virtual crash modelling program Holden has ever undertaken. Emphasis was placed on considering the range of impact scenarios that occur in real world accident situations and differing occupant criteria. Safety technologies were benchmarked along with the world’s leading luxury brands and major engineering programs delivered a stiffer body structure and vastly increased usage of advanced strength steels. Multiple load corridor strategies for frontal, side and rear impacts improve passenger compartment integrity. They are complemented by an improved multi-point airbag sensing system and an adaptive restraint system which includes dual stage front airbags, thorax side impact airbags, curtain airbags and front seat active head restraints as standard equipment. Structurally optimised crush zones absorb crash energy and other occupant protection features include a steering column ride-down mechanism and <b>breakaway</b> <b>brake</b> pedal.|$|R

5000|$|As a car {{approaches}} {{the end of}} a straightaway, the downforce generated by the body of the car should increase the sprung weight until the coil springs compress until they bind and the suspension can no longer travel (hence the name). [...] The goal of coil bind is to keep the air dam (or splitter if applicable) {{at the front of the}} car as low to the ground as possible to create an area of low pressure under the car. The result is similar to ground effects. Under <b>braking,</b> <b>weight</b> transfer causes more weight to shift forward as the vehicle decelerates. This helps to maintain the low-pressure area below the car by keeping the front of the car low to the ground. While coil bind setups do yield faster lap times, the cars are more sensitive to turbulence generated by nearby cars.|$|R

50|$|The use of four-coupled wheels for a fast express {{was unusual}} by this time, as the Atlantic arrangement, a four-coupled tender {{locomotive}} with a four-wheel leading bogie for high-speeds, had by now largely {{been replaced by}} the larger Pacific. One exception was the US Hiawatha , a 4-4-2 of the same period. US track loadings were higher though, and this locomotive had a driving axle loading twice that of the Hungarian design. With the relatively short range of 250 km required, the Class 242 could afford to be a tank locomotive, even though this reduced the water and fuel capacity available. Avoiding the weight of a tender, and a large fuel capacity, further reduced the axle loading. A modern feature required by these increased speeds, and the lack of <b>braking</b> <b>weight</b> in the locomotive itself, was improved continuous braking throughout the train, by compressed air brakes to the Knorr system.|$|R
5000|$|Stopping is a {{considerable}} source of inefficiency. Modern electric trains like the Shinkansen (the Bullet Train) use regenerative braking to return current into the catenary while they brake. A Siemens study indicated that regenerative braking might recover 41.6% of the total energy consumed. The Passenger Rail (Urban and Intercity) and Scheduled Intercity and All Charter Bus Industries Technological and Operational Improvements - FINAL REPORT states that [...] "Commuter operations can dissipate {{more than half of}} their total traction energy in braking for stops." [...] and that [...] "We estimate head-end power to be 35 percent (but it could possibly be as high as 45 percent) of total energy consumed by commuter railways." [...] Having to accelerate and decelerate a heavy train load of people at every stop is inefficient despite regenerative braking which can recover typically around 20% of the energy wasted in <b>braking.</b> <b>Weight</b> is a determinant of braking losses.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Male {{subjects}} are invariably {{used to study}} the physiological determinants of middle distance running performance. Studies that do include females have examined only the aerobic contribution to middle distance running performance. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate aerobic, anaerobic and muscle function factors that could be used to predict middle distance running performance in female runners. This study was performed at an altitude of 1800 m. Eleven middle distance female runners aged 18 - 20 were selected for the study. Aerobic capacity was assessed by measuring the maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max), running velocity at maximal oxygen consumption (vVO 2 max), running economy (RE) and onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA). The blood lactate curve of each subject was constructed by relating the oxygen consumption, to the plasma lactate concentrations. Anaerobic capacity was determined by measuring the maximum accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD) on a treadmill. Muscle function was assessed by having the subjects cycle as fast as possible against changing <b>brake</b> <b>weights</b> ranging from heavy to light using a Monark cycle ergometer.

40|$|Abstract: Generally, field {{performance}} of elastomeric track pad components has been poor, {{especially for the}} medium to heavy tonnage tracked vehicles, which are operated on the hilly cross-country course. The service life of these track pad, is affected {{not only by the}} terrain and environmental conditions but also by the speed, cornering, <b>braking,</b> <b>weight</b> of the vehicle, and the track tread design. In this research, modulus, tearing energy, and the rate of crack propagation of vulcanizates are evaluated by changing base materials to improve the service time of track pad. By increasing the contents of carbon black, modulus, tearing energy, and fatigue crack growth resistance of vulca-nizates improved. Compared with the NR vulcanizate, the HNBR vulcanizate had a higher value of tearing energy. The rate of crack propagation of vulcanizates using smaller size carbon black was slower than that using larger size carbon black. When the HNBR was blended with the ZSC, the tearing energy of the vulcanizates was a little reduced because of the high modulus but the crack propagation rate was reduced significantly. In the relation between the crack propagation rate and the strain energy release rate, though up to 100 % strain were applied to specimens, the slope on the log scale (β) varied between 1. 72 and 2. 3 with the kind of elastomer...|$|R
50|$|<b>Brake</b> release <b>weight</b> is {{the weight}} of an {{aircraft}} {{at the start of}} a runway, just prior to brake release for take-off. This is the ramp weight minus any fuel used for taxiing. Major airports may have runways that are about 2 miles (3 km) long, so merely taxiing from the terminal to the end of the runway might consume up to a ton of fuel. After taxiing, the pilot lines up the aircraft with the runway and puts the brakes on. On receiving take-off clearance, the pilot throttles up the engines and releases the brakes to start accelerating along the runway in preparation for taking off.|$|R

40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the physics of}} weight transfer. You will often hear instructors and drivers say that applying the <b>brakes</b> shifts <b>weight</b> {{to the front of}} a car and can induce oversteer. Likewise, accelerating shifts weight to the rear, inducing understeer, and cornering shifts weight to the opposite side, unloading the inside tires. But why does weight shift during these maneuvers? How can weight shift when everything is in the car bolted in and strapped down? Briefly, the reason is that inertia acts through the center of gravity (CG) of the car, which is above the ground, but adhesive forces act at ground level through the tire contact patches. The e#ects of weight transfer are proportional to the height of the CG o# the ground. A flatter car, one with a lower CG, handles better and quicker because weight transfer is not so drastic as it is in a high ca...|$|R
