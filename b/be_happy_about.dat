500|$|After {{the match}} Henrik Larsson {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he was disappointed to have scored two goals in the final and still come away with a runners up medal. Larsson stated that there was nothing to <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> the outcome of the final. He told BBC Sport, [...] "I've said before, I'd much rather not score and be able to lift the UEFA Cup, than to score twice and finish up on the losing side. There's nothing to <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about,</b> but now we have to find a way to lift ourselves for the league game on Sunday." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Schumacher {{admitted}} to having mixed feelings after the race, having been in second position until the race's last laps. The Mercedes driver stated: [...] "I would obviously have loved to finish there [...] and be on the podium again. But {{even if it did}} not work out in the very end, we can <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> the result and the big fight we put in." [...] Kobayashi, placed second at the restart, shared similar feelings to Schumacher about finishing in a lower position: [...] "Originally I qualified 13th so then it is not bad to finish seventh, {{but on the other hand}} I started second after the long red flag and looking from there the result is disappointing." ...|$|E
500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like it matters. The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about.</b> You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2010, it was {{reported}} that Phil would develop an addiction to crack cocaine after his troubled personal life leads to depression. The report followed the news that Lucy Benjamin was to return for a single episode, reprising her role as Lisa, the mother of Phil's daughter Louise (Brittany Papple). In the storyline, Phil gains custody of Louise after she is dropped off in Walford by an unseen person, however, Peggy eventually returns Louise to Lisa after Phil punches his mother in the face. A spokesperson for the show said [...] "Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life – she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline {{is going to be an}} explosive episode in the Mitchells' history." [...] Phil also loses his son Ben (Charlie Jones), who makes a temporary departure from the show in order for the part to be recast. Subsequently, Phil becomes addicted to crack cocaine. Producers worked closely with drug and alcohol charities, including Addaction and DrugScope. Viewers never see Phil take drugs to make sure the episodes are suitable for all audiences. Martin Barnes, chief executive of DrugScope, commented: [...] "If EastEnders sensitively reflect the impact that drug use has on Phil, it could help." [...] The storyline also sees Phil become more violent. McFadden explained: ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2010, it was {{reported}} that Lisa would return for a single episode later in the year in a bid to retrieve Louise from Phil, who gained custody of her earlier in the year. Benjamin said of her return: [...] "I'm really looking forward to returning to EastEnders for this episode. It will be great to see some familiar faces and work alongside old friends again." [...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood commented [...] "Lucy's character Lisa was responsible for one of the biggest cliffhanger episodes in EastEnders, so it's a real treat to have her back on screen," [...] while a spokesperson for the show added [...] "Lisa Fowler was a major part of Phil's life– she knows him as well as anyone, so she won't <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> him looking after his daughter. With their history, you know that this storyline {{is going to be an}} explosive episode in the Mitchells' history." [...] The episode was broadcast on 5 August 2010. Discussing her brief return, Benjamin said, [...] "What I liked about doing this storyline was that it did explain where Lisa had been. When I was watching it, I was thinking 'Where's her mother? Where is Lisa? It's just ridiculous'. But it does make sense. She is mentally unstable and she does have times like that and the little girl is old enough to make her own decisions and say, 'I want to live with my dad now'. So she had to let her go. I liked that I was able to come back and defend myself because Lisa was kind of being slaughtered in the Square for being a rubbish mum!" ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{evening and}} growing dark {{when the storm}} ended, but the light next morning {{revealed}} the damage we had suffered. Pumpkins, gourds, and water-melons were cut to pieces, {{and most of the}} vegetables, including the Indian corn, were destroyed. The fruit trees, too, had suffered greatly. Forty or fifty sheep had been killed outright, and hundreds more were so much hurt that for days they went limping about or appeared stupefied from blows on the head. Three of our heifers were dead, and one horse--an old loved riding-horse with a history, old Zango--the whole house was in grief at his death! He belonged originally to a cavalry officer who had an extraordinary affection for him--a rare thing in a land where horseflesh was too cheap, and men as a rule careless of their animals and even cruel. The officer had spent years in the Banda Oriental, in guerilla warfare, and had ridden Zango in every fight in which he had been engaged. Coming back to Buenos Ayres he brought the old horse home with him. Two or three years later he came to my father, whom he had come to know very well, and said he had been ordered to the upper provinces and was in great trouble about his horse. He was twenty years old, he said, and no longer fit to be ridden in a fight; and of all the people he knew there was but one man in whose care he wished to leave his horse. I know, he said, that if you will take him and promise to care for him until his old life ends, he will be safe; and I should <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> him--as happy as I can be without the horse I have loved more than any other being on earth. My father consented, and had kept the old horse for over nine years when he was killed by the hail. He was a well-shaped dark brown animal, with long mane and tail, but, as I knew him, always lean and old- looking, and the chief use he was put to was for the children to take their first riding-lessons on his back.|$|E
