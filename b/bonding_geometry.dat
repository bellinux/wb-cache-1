5000|$|The {{concept of}} ionic radii {{is based on}} the {{assumption}} of a spherical ion shape. However, from a group-theoretical point of view the assumption is only justified for ions that reside on high-symmetry crystal lattice sites like Na and Cl in halite or Zn and S in sphalerite. A clear distinction can be made, when the point symmetry group of the respective lattice site is considered, which are the cubic groups Oh and Td in NaCl and ZnS. For ions on lower-symmetry sites significant deviations of their electron density from a spherical shape may occur. This holds in particular for ions on lattice sites of polar symmetry, which are the crystallographic point groups C1, C1h, Cn or Cnv, n = 2, 3, 4 or 6. A thorough analysis of the <b>bonding</b> <b>geometry</b> was recently carried out for [...] pyrite-type compounds, where monovalent chalcogen ions reside on C3 lattice sites. It was found that chalcogen ions have to be modeled by ellipsoidal charge distributions with different radii along the symmetry axis and perpendicular to it.|$|E
5000|$|To further {{distinguish}} the electron energy {{differences between the}} two non-bonding orbitals, orbital mixing can be further performed between the 2p (3a1) orbital on oxygen and the antibonding 4a1 orbital since they are of the same symmetry and close in energy level. Mixing these two orbitals affords two new sets of orbitals as shown in the right boxed in red. Significant mixing of these two orbitals results in both energy changes and changes {{in the shape of the}} molecular orbital. There’s now significant sp hybridization characterization that’s previously not present in the simple MO diagram. Consequently, the two nonbonding orbitals are now at different energies, providing the four distinct energy levels consistent with the PES. Alternatively, instead of mixing the 3a1 nonbonding orbital with the 4a1 antibonding orbital, one can also mix the 3a1 nonbinding orbital with the 2a1 bonding orbital to produce a similar MO diagram of [...] This alternative [...] MO diagram can also be derived by performing the Walsh diagram treatment via adjusting <b>bonding</b> <b>geometry</b> from linear to bent shape. In addition, these MO diagrams can be generated from bottom up by first hybridizing the oxygen 2s and 2p orbitals (assume sp2 hybridization) and then mixing orbitals of same symmetry. For simple molecules, pictorially generating their MO diagram can be achieved without extensive knowledge of point group theory and using reducible and irreducible representations.|$|E

This sample contains ammonium ions preferentially located in the sodalite cages at site 1 '. These ions reorient with 120 or 180 Deg jumps around fixed axes through the N atom. This corresponds to a <b>bonding</b> <b>geometry</b> in which the ammonium ion interacts via 3 or 2 H atoms with the lattice O atoms. Addnl., a reorientation around a fixed axis through 2 H atoms of the ammonium ion may occur.

This model predicts that the heavy atom hydrogen bond coordinate	q 2 	 =	 r 1 + r 2 {{is a function of}} the proton coordinate q 1 = (r 1 – r 2), where r 1 and r 2 represent the OH and the HO distances.

40|$|We examine {{theoretically}} {{the effects}} of the <b>bonding</b> <b>geometries</b> at the gold-thiol interfaces on the inelastic tunneling spectra of propanedithiolate (PDT) molecules bridging gold electrodes and show that inelastic tunneling spectroscopy combined with theory can be used to determine these <b>bonding</b> <b>geometries</b> experimentally. With the help of density functional theory, we calculate the relaxed geometries and vibrational modes of extended molecules each consisting of one or two PDT molecules connecting two gold nanoclusters. We formulate a perturbative theory of inelastic tunneling through molecules bridging metal contacts in terms of elastic transmission amplitudes, and use this theory to calculate the inelastic tunneling spectra of the gold-PDT-gold extended molecules. We consider PDT molecules with both trans and gauche conformations bound to the gold clusters at top, bridge and hollow bonding sites. Comparing our results with the experimental data of Hihath et al. [Nano Lett. 8, 1673 (2008) ], we identify the most frequently realized conformation in the experiment as that of trans molecules top-site bonded to both electrodes. We find the switching from the 42 meV vibrational mode to the 46 meV mode observed in the experiment to be due to the transition of trans molecules from mixed top-bridge to pure top-site <b>bonding</b> <b>geometries.</b> Our results also indicate that gauche molecular conformations and hollow site bonding did not contribute significantly to the experimental inelastic tunneling spectra. For pairs of PDT molecules connecting the gold electrodes in parallel we find total elastic conductances close to twice those of single molecules bridging the contacts with similar bonding conformations and small splittings of the vibrational mode energies for the modes that are the most sensitive to the molecule-electrode <b>bonding</b> <b>geometries.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 8 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: significant text overlap with arXiv: 1103. 2378; [URL]...|$|R
