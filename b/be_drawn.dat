5|$|Finally, the {{coefficients}} of the polynomials need not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from integers, real numbers {{or even the}} complex numbers. For example, {{the coefficients}} may <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> from a general field, such as the finite fields GF(p) described above. The corresponding conclusions about the Euclidean algorithm and its applications hold even for such polynomials.|$|E
5|$|If {{edges are}} {{required}} to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> as straight line segments, rather than arbitrary curves, then some graphs need more crossings than they would when drawn with curved edges.|$|E

5|$|After {{the final}} result, Miller refused to endorse McEwen, though McEwen tried to soothe {{feelings}} by introducing H.R. 5727 in the House {{to name the}} dam and locks on the Ohio River near Gallipolis after Miller. Miller carried an unsuccessful legal challenge to the redistricting to the United States Supreme Court, insisting district lines should <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> on a politically neutral basis.|$|E
5|$|An arc diagram or linear {{embedding}} places vertices of a graph along a line, {{and draws}} {{the edges of}} the graph as semicircles either above or below this line, sometimes also allowing edges to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> on segments of the line. This drawing style corresponds to a book embedding with either one page (if all semicircles are above the line) or two pages (if both sides of the line are used), and was originally introduced as a way of studying the crossing numbers of graphs. Planar graphs that do not have two-page book embeddings may also <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in a similar way, by allowing their edges to be represented by multiple semicircles above and below the line. Such a drawing is not a book embedding by the usual definition, but has been called a topological book embedding. For every planar graph, it is always possible to find such an embedding in which each edge crosses the spine at most once.|$|E

5|$|Atlético de Kolkata, and the ISL in general, were {{initially}} announced with a mixed reception among football fans in Kolkata.

50|$|Teams {{from the}} same {{confederation}} <b>were</b> not <b>drawn</b> into the same group, therefore Egypt <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> into Group B. Also as result, Italy and Spain <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into different groups.|$|R
5|$|The {{opening and}} ending scenes <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> by Mizushima; the scene {{involving}} {{the debut of}} the film's villain <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Soichi Masui; the middle section of the film <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Shingo Kaneko; Edward Elric's return to his homeworld <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Masahiro Ando; action scenes <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> by Shinji Aramaki; and the battle between Wrath and Gluttony <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Yutaka Nakamura. Mizushima was repeatedly harassed by the head employees at Aniplex to speed up work on the storyboards.

Seven hundred of the film's animated frames had to be redone with only two weeks to the film's release.|$|R

A variety of free carbenes can be isolated and are stable at room temperature. Other free carbenes are not stable and are susceptible to intermolecular decomposition pathways.|$|E

5|$|Smithers' {{devotion to}} Mr. Burns was {{inspired}} from how numerous Fox executives {{and staff members}} acted towards Barry Diller. The idea for Smithers' ambiguous sexual orientation came from Sam Simon, who proposed that Smithers should be gay, but little attention should <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> to it. Smithers' first name (Waylon) was derived from that of puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{disagreed}} {{about how}} the European map should look, and how borders would <b>be</b> <b>drawn,</b> following the war.
