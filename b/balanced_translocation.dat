25|$|PGD is {{available}} for {{a large number of}} monogenic disorders—that is, disorders due to a single gene only (autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X-linked)—or of chromosomal structural aberrations (such as a <b>balanced</b> <b>translocation).</b> PGD helps these couples identify embryos carrying a genetic disease or a chromosome abnormality, thus avoiding diseased offspring. The most frequently diagnosed autosomal recessive disorders are cystic fibrosis, Beta-thalassemia, sickle cell disease and spinal muscular atrophy type 1. The most common dominant diseases are myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease; {{and in the case of}} the X-linked diseases, most of the cycles are performed for fragile X syndrome, haemophilia A and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Though it is quite infrequent, some centers report PGD for mitochondrial disorders or two indications simultaneously.|$|E
2500|$|Translocation Down {{syndrome}} can be de novo; that is, not inherited but {{occurring at}} the time of an individual's conception, or may be inherited from a parent with a <b>balanced</b> <b>translocation.</b> The <b>balanced</b> <b>translocation</b> figure shows a 14/21 translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 14 and 21, where the other chromosomes are not shown. The individual has two copies of everything on chromosome 14, and two copies of all of the material on the long arm of chromosome 21 (21q). The derivative chromosome 21, which contains only heterochromatin, is lost; thus, the individual only has one copy of the material on the short arm of chromosome 21 (21p), but this appears to have no discernible effect. Individuals with this chromosomal arrangement have 45 chromosomes and are phenotypically normal. During meiosis, the chromosomal arrangement interferes with normal separation of chromosomes.

40|$|Many solid tumors exhibit {{characteristic}} gene fusions, {{which are}} reflected by <b>balanced</b> <b>translocations</b> at the cytogenetic level.

In Wilms tumor (WT, nephroblastoma) no fusions genes or recurrent <b>balanced</b> <b>translocations</b> have been described thus far. To screen for cryptic <b>balanced</b> <b>translocations,</b> we have analyzed 17 renal neoplasms, histopathologically classified as WT, {{by a combination of}} G-banding, multicolor FISH, and subtelomeric FISH. This approach revealed several submicroscopic chromosomal aberrations and three different seemingly <b>balanced</b> <b>translocations,</b> resulting in a heterozygous deletion of HACE 1, an EWSR 1 /ERG fusion, and an EWSR 1 /FLI 1 fusion, respectively. As EWSR 1 rearrangements are known to be a characteristic of Ewing tumors (ET), our findings illustrate the diagnostic problems regarding small cell kidney tumors and strongly argue for the need of adjuvant diagnostic techniques in this group of neoplasms. In summary, our genomic screening approach proved efficient in finding structural chromosomal aberrations. The fact that no recurrent translocations were found in the WTs of this study argues against the presence of a frequent pathognomonic translocation in this disease entit...|$|R

A pilot study was done in which 16 consecutive cases of ALL were analyzed and followed-up {{for a period of}} 1 year. Diagnosis of ALL was established after subjecting blood/bone marrow aspirate samples to morphological examination, immunophenotyping, and detection of fusion transcripts by multiplex reverse transcription (RT) -PCR using HemaVision kit. Results were analyzed by correlating with morphology, immunophenotype, and response to therapy. Epi-Info statistical software was used. 43 % (seven cases) showed <b>balanced</b> <b>translocations,</b> with all seven cases being B-ALL and t(9; 22) being the most common.

A cytogenetic investigation in 50 couples with a history of two or more spontaneous abortions is referred to in this study.

50|$|People with Emanuel {{syndrome}} typically {{inherit the}} der(22) chromosome from an unaffected parent. The parent carries a chromosomal rearrangement between chromosomes 11 and 22 called a <b>balanced</b> <b>translocation.</b> No genetic material is gained or {{lost in a}} <b>balanced</b> <b>translocation,</b> so these chromosomal changes usually do not cause any health problems. As this translocation is passed to the next generation, it can become unbalanced. Individuals with Emanuel syndrome inherit an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 11 and 22 {{in the form of}} a der(22) chromosome. These individuals have two normal copies of chromosome 11, two normal copies of chromosome 22, and extra genetic material from the der(22) chromosome. As a result of the extra chromosome, people with Emanuel syndrome have three copies of some genes in each cell instead of the usual two copies. The excess genetic material disrupts the normal course of development, leading to intellectual disability and birth defects. Researchers are working to determine which genes are included on the der(22) chromosome and what role these genes play in development.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a {{malignancy}} of the terminally-differentiated B {{cells and}} accounts for 10 % of all hematological malignancies. Chromosome 1 aberrations are frequently described, the short arm being preferentially involved in deletions {{and the long}} arm in gains. The abnormalities were identified in the bone marrow of 37 MM patients by conventional cytogenetics. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to confirm {{the presence of the}} abnormalities and to better characterize them. Chromosome 1 abnormalities were grouped into 4 categories: <b>balanced</b> <b>translocations,</b> deletions, amplifications and jumping translocations (JT). Breakpoints involved in <b>balanced</b> <b>translocations</b> were randomly distributed. The smallest region of overlap for deletions was 1 p 11 → 1 p 21 (present in 27 % of the patients) and for gains 1 q 31 → 1 qter (present in 54 % of the patients).

5000|$|Cri du chat {{syndrome}} {{is due to}} a partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome number 5, also called [...] "5p monosomy" [...] or [...] "partial monosomy." [...] Approximately 90% of cases result from a sporadic, or randomly occurring, de novo deletion. The remaining 10-15% are due to unequal segregation of a parental <b>balanced</b> <b>translocation</b> where the 5p monosomy is often accompanied by a trisomic portion of the genome. These individuals may have more severe disease than those with isolated monosomy of 5p. A recent study suggests {{this may not be the}} case where a trisomy of chromosome 4q is involved.|$|E

The falling cost for whole exome sequencing may replace DNA microarray technology for candidate gene evaluation.

Therefore, the traditional G-banding analysis should be primarily performed for the specimens collected by D&C in the setting of RPL. If, however, the quality of specimens is poor for the G-banding analysis due to spontaneous discharge, array-CGH supplemented with STR analysis can be a powerful technique for cytogenetic evaluation of miscarriage, since STR analysis allows for the detection of triploidy and part of tetraploidy as well as maternal contamination.|$|R
