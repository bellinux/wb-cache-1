5|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach had {{introduced}} him to Conte {{as a way of}} providing him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - which he took <b>by</b> <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> few drops of liquid under his tongue. Conte had helped develop a type of anabolic steroid called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him that all the substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E

5|$|Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle {{has one of}} {{the best}} {{developed}} senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds <b>by</b> <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.|$|E

5|$|Calcium, {{along with}} its {{congeners}} magnesium, strontium, and barium, was first isolated by Humphry Davy in 1808. Following the work of Jöns Jakob Berzelius and Magnus Martin af Pontin on electrolysis, Davy isolated calcium and magnesium <b>by</b> <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> mixture of the respective metal oxides with mercury(II) oxide on a platinum plate which {{was used as the}} anode, the cathode being a platinum wire partially submerged into mercury. Electrolysis then gave calcium–mercury and magnesium–mercury amalgams, and distilling off the mercury gave the metal. However, pure calcium cannot be prepared in bulk by this method and a workable commercial process for its production was not found until over a century later.|$|E
5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as {{a reference to the}} following legend: Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who was superior, a fiery pillar—linga (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi <b>by</b> <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|E

25|$|Many puzzles {{in these}} games involve {{gathering}} and using items from their inventory. Players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply real-world extrinsic knowledge about objects in unexpected ways. For example, <b>by</b> <b>putting</b> <b>a</b> deflated inner tube on a cactus {{to create a}} slingshot, which requires a player to realize that an inner tube is stretchy. They may need to carry items in their inventory for a long duration before they prove useful, and thus it is normal for adventure games to test a player's memory where a challenge can only be overcome by recalling a piece of information from earlier in the game. There is seldom any time pressure for these puzzles, focusing more on the player's ability to reason than on quick-thinking.|$|E
