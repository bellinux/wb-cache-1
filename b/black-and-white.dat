5|$|The sujet (syuzhet), or the {{presentation}} of the film, is structured with two timelines: one in color and one in <b>black-and-white.</b> The color sequences are alternated with <b>black-and-white</b> sequences. The latter are put together in chronological order. The color ones, though shown forward (except for the very first one, which is shown in reverse), are ordered in reverse. Chronologically, the <b>black-and-white</b> sequences come first, the color sequences come next.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{theories}} {{as to how}} the three races of white-winged fairywren could have evolved. The first suggests that <b>black-and-white</b> plumage is an ancestral condition and, following separation of the three populations, blue-and-white plumage evolved in the mainland species. The second hypothesis suggests that <b>black-and-white</b> plumage evolved convergently on the two separate islands. The third suggests that <b>black-and-white</b> plumage evolved once from the blue-and-white ancestral condition, and later the mainland species re-evolved blue plumage.|$|E

5|$|He is {{responsible}} for describing one subspecies of <b>black-and-white</b> ruffed lemur (Varecia variegata), the southern <b>black-and-white</b> ruffed lemur (V. v. editorum) in 1952; one subspecies of toque macaque (Macaca sinica), the highland toque macaque (M. s. opisthomelas) in 1942; one subspecies of red slender loris (Loris tardigradus), the Horton Plains slender loris (L. t. nycticeboides) in 1942; and two subspecies of grey slender loris (Loris lydekkerianus), the highland slender loris (L. l. grandis) in 1932 and the dry zone slender loris (L. l. nordicus) in 1933.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, media mogul Ted Turner {{announced}} he would begin colourising <b>black-and-white</b> motion pictures {{to make them more}} pleasing to audiences watching his cable networks. The announcement generated extensive controversy. Touring Turner's colourisation facilities {{as a member of the}} Directors Guild, Wise learned that Turner was colourising The Haunting. Wise was able to prevent the colourisation by pointing to his contract, which stated the picture could only be in <b>black-and-white.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the platinotype {{printing}} process, photographers make fine-art <b>black-and-white</b> prints using platinum or palladium salts. Often {{used with}} platinum, palladium provides {{an alternative to}} silver.|$|E
5|$|The Hustler {{received}} nine Academy Award nominations. The film won two, for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, <b>Black-and-White</b> (Harry Horner and Gene Callahan) and Best Cinematography, <b>Black-and-White</b> (Eugen Schüfftan). The {{film was}} also nominated for Best Picture and Newman {{was nominated for}} Best Actor in a Leading Role. Gleason and Scott were both nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role; Scott refused the nomination. Laurie was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Rossen received nominations for Best Director and, with Carroll, for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of <b>black-and-white</b> ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in <b>black-and-white</b> ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} animated {{version of}} the tale is a silent, <b>black-and-white</b> release by director Herbert M. Dawley in 1924.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} shot in Ansco Color, developed by Agfa, but released in <b>black-and-white.</b> The colour negative still {{exists in the}} archives.|$|E
5|$|The red ruffed lemur and the <b>black-and-white</b> ruffed lemur were {{formerly}} {{recognized as}} subspecies, Varecia variegata rubra and Varecia variegata variegata respectively. In 2001 both were elevated to species status, {{a decision that}} was later supported by genetic research. Three subspecies of <b>black-and-white</b> ruffed lemur, which had been published decades earlier, were also recognized as variegata, editorum, and subcincta, although studies have not been entirely conclusive.|$|E
5|$|The sleeve {{front cover}} used a <b>black-and-white</b> still from The Man Who Fell to Earth, in which Bowie, as the {{character}} Thomas Jerome Newton, {{steps into the}} space capsule that will return him to his home planet. Bowie had insisted on the cropped <b>black-and-white</b> image as he felt that in the original coloured full-size image the sky looked artificial; when Rykodisc reissued Bowie's catalogue in the early 1990s the colour version was used. The back cover showed Bowie sketching the Kabbalah Sephirot with chalk—something {{he had been doing}} on the set of the film.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{recognised}} subspecies of Malurus leucopterus. Both black-plumaged forms {{have been called}} <b>black-and-white</b> fairywren.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a smooth}} {{transition}} from the <b>black-and-white</b> sequence 22 to color sequence A and it occurs during {{the development of a}} Polaroid photograph.|$|E
5|$|Alcids are superficially {{similar to}} {{penguins}} {{due to their}} <b>black-and-white</b> colors, their upright posture {{and some of their}} habits, however they are only distantly related to the penguins and are able to fly.

5|$|Another major {{influence}} {{in his work}} was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the <b>black-and-white</b> revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The <b>black-and-white</b> revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T.A.Richardson and James Harrison and {{it came to be}} developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of <b>black-and-white.</b> Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.|$|E
5|$|Art {{direction}} for the album is credited to Frank Olinsky, Billy Corgan, and Corgan's then-girlfriend and frequent collaborator Yelena Yemchuk. The artwork for the album and its singles consisted almost entirely of <b>black-and-white</b> photographs shot by Yemchuk, many of which featured model Amy Wesson.|$|E
5|$|Auks are seabirds {{which are}} superficially similar to {{penguins}} with their <b>black-and-white</b> colours, their upright posture {{and some of}} their habits, but the living species are able to fly. There are about 23 species worldwide, four of which are rare vagrants in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Austrian actor Carl Möhner played Captain Ernst Lindemann in the 1960 <b>black-and-white</b> British war film Sink the Bismarck! The {{film was}} based on the novel The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck by C. S. Forester.|$|E
5|$|Churche's Mansion is a timber-framed, <b>black-and-white</b> Elizabethan mansion {{house at}} {{the eastern end of}} Hospital Street in Nantwich, Cheshire, England. The GradeI listed {{building}} dates from 1577, {{and is one of the}} very few to have survived the Great Fire of Nantwich in 1583.|$|E
5|$|Documentary {{photography}} {{has also}} flourished outside the press. As an example, Jette Bang (1914–1964) {{was fascinated by}} Greenland and the Greenlanders. From 1936, she took over 12,000 <b>black-and-white</b> photographs {{of the country and}} its inhabitants, showing how close to nature people lived.|$|E
5|$|Enterprises' episodes {{were usually}} junked because their rights {{agreements}} with the actors and writers to sell the programmes abroad had expired. With many broadcasters around the world now switching to colour transmission, it was not deemed worthwhile extending agreements to sell the older <b>black-and-white</b> material.|$|E
5|$|Generally films {{produced}} in the Indies dealt with traditional stories or were adapted from existing works. The early films were silent, with Karnadi Anemer Bangkong (Karnadi the Frog Contractor; 1930) generally considered the first talkie; later films would be in Dutch, Malay, or an indigenous language. All were <b>black-and-white.</b>|$|E
5|$|Illustrated with sepia {{drawings}} {{rather than}} the traditional <b>black-and-white</b> pictures found in most children’s books of the day, the book, which received the 1942 Caldecott Medal for its illustrations, has continued to garner praise years after its first publishing.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, BBC archive {{specialist}} James Insell {{established the}} Colour Recovery Working Group, an online project {{to find new}} ways of restoring <b>black-and-white</b> telerecordings to colour. In 2008, Reverse Standards Conversion inventor Richard Russell, developed a technique involving the use of chroma dots embedded in the <b>black-and-white</b> signal to recreate the missing color. This technique was initially used as part of the recolouring process on episode 3 of Planet of the Daleks; the chroma dot process was used alongside a computer-based colourisation process to match together the differing qualities of colour recovery. The process was then used on an entire episode of Dad's Army, showing {{that it was possible to}} use it on entire recordings.|$|E
5|$|Laurence Olivier's 1948 moody <b>black-and-white</b> Hamlet won Best Picture and Best Actor Oscars, and is still, , {{the only}} Shakespeare film {{to have done}} so. His {{interpretation}} stressed the Oedipal overtones of the play, and cast 28-year-old Eileen Herlie as Hamlet's mother, opposite himself, at 41, as Hamlet.|$|E
5|$|Levine {{alerted the}} new Film and Videotape Library's archive selector, Sue Malden, who paid her own visit to Villiers House and found every {{remaining}} Jon Pertwee episode (albeit as a 16mm <b>black-and-white</b> telerecording), {{except for two}} from his final season: Death to the Daleks and Invasion of the Dinosaurs, Episodes 1.|$|E
5|$|Making {{comparisons}} to a magazine, Beyoncé further elaborated that the record was a double album {{and that it}} had two covers. The <b>black-and-white</b> cover artworks for the standard, deluxe and platinum editions of I Am... Sasha Fierce were all shot by German photographer Peter Lindbergh.|$|E
5|$|Phalacrocoracidae is {{a family}} of medium to large coastal, {{fish-eating}} seabirds that includes cormorants and shags. Plumage coloration varies, with the majority having mainly dark plumage, some species being <b>black-and-white</b> and a few being colorful.|$|E
5|$|Selenium {{is used in}} the toning of {{photographic}} prints, and it is sold as a toner by numerous photographic manufacturers. Selenium intensifies and extends the tonal range of <b>black-and-white</b> photographic images and improves the permanence of prints.|$|E
5|$|Several early 1970s colour serials, {{starring}} Jon Pertwee, {{were retained}} only as <b>black-and-white</b> film prints. In {{addition to the}} motion issue shared by all telerecorded episodes, for years the loss of colour presented a major challenge for restoration.|$|E
5|$|Some of the tele{{recorded}} Pertwee episodes also {{survive on}} NTSC colour videotapes, recorded over-air on consumer hardware. In the early 1990s, an early {{form of the}} Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low-resolution colour signal from these sources with the high-resolution <b>black-and-white</b> signal from the <b>black-and-white</b> film recordings. In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour: Doctor Who and the Silurians, Terror of the Autons, and The Dæmons. Off-air NTSC colour tapes were also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death, but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.|$|E
5|$|The Coens {{referenced}} the noir tradition {{again with}} The Man Who Wasn't There (2001); a <b>black-and-white</b> crime melodrama set in 1949, {{it features a}} scene apparently staged to mirror the one from Out of the Past pictured above. Lynch's Mulholland Drive (2001) continued in his characteristic vein, making the classic noir setting of Los Angeles the venue for a noir-inflected psychological jigsaw puzzle. British-born director Christopher Nolan's <b>black-and-white</b> debut, Following (1998), was an overt homage to classic noir. During the new century's first decade, {{he was one of}} the leading Hollywood directors of neo-noir with the acclaimed Memento (2000) and the remake of Insomnia (2002).|$|E
