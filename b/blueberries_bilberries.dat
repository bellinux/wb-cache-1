Besides anthocyanins and other products of the phenylpropanoid and flavonoid pathways, these berries also contain other metabolites of interest, such as carotenoid derivatives, vitamins and flavor compounds. Recently, new information has been achieved on the mechanisms related with developmental, environmental and genetic factors involved in the regulation of secondary metabolism in Vaccinium fruits. Especially light conditions and temperature are demonstrated to have a prominent role on the composition of phenolic compounds. The present review focuses on the studies on mechanisms associated with the regulation of key secondary metabolites, mainly phenolic compounds, in Vaccinium berries. The advances in the research concerning biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in Vaccinium species, including specific studies with mutant genotypes in addition to controlled and field experiments on the genotype x environment (GxE) interaction, are discussed.

Six berry extracts (wild <b>blueberry,</b> <b>bilberry,</b> cranberry, elderberry, raspberry seed, and strawberry) and a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) were studied. The extracts and uptake of their constituents by HaCaT were studied using a multi-channel HPLC-CoulArray approach. Antioxidant activity of the extracts was determined by ORAC. Cranberry, elderberry and raspberry seed samples were observed to possess comparable ORAC values. The antioxidant capacity of these samples was significantly lower than that of the other samples studied. The ORAC values of strawberry powder and GSPE were higher than cranberry, elderberry or raspberry seed but significantly lower than the other samples studied. Wild <b>bilberry</b> and <b>blueberry</b> extracts possessed the highest ORAC values. Each of the berry samples studied significantly inhibited both H 2 O 2 as well as TNF alpha induced VEGF expression by the human keratinocytes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Berry {{fruit is}} known for its high {{contents}} of various bioactive compounds. The latter constitute of anthocyanins, flavonols and flavanols and posses high antioxidative activity. The highly dynamic antioxidant system can be evaluated in vitro and in vivo in several model organisms. These measurements represent a good approximation of the real potential of bioactive compounds in the cells of higher eucarions. The aim of the study was thus to determine in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity of different berry juices, which reportedly contain high amounts of phenolics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Five different berry species were collected from several locations in central Slovenia and juice was extracted from each species separately. Juice was assessed for their in vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity. Phenolic profiles of berries were determined {{with the use of a}} HPLC/MS system, in vitro antioxidant activity with the DPPH radical scavenging method and in vivo antioxidative activity using Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The highest diversity of individual phenols was detected for bilberry juice. The highest in vitro antioxidant capacity was determined for blackcurrant juice. A decrease in intracellular oxidation compared to control was observed in the following order: blackcurrant < chokeberry = <b>blueberry</b> < <b>bilberry.</b> The results indicate important differences in antioxidant activity of berry juices between in vitro and in vivo studies. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: In addition to the total content of phenolic compounds entering the cells, a key factor determining antioxidative activity of berry juices is also the ratio between the compounds. Where high content levels of anthocyanins and very low content levels of flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids were measured a lower intracellular oxidation has been detected. Specifically, intracellular oxidation increased with higher consumption of hydroxycinnamic acids and lower consumption of anthocyanins in the cells. Antioxidative activity also increased when the consumption of analyzed phenols was rather low...|$|R

In the present study, in order to study the effects of antioxidants on neuroinflammation, microglial phenotypes were evaluated in rats fed with diets containing <b>bilberries,</b> <b>blueberries,</b> or crowberries at 1 and 4 weeks following striatal injection of 6 -hydroxydopamine. The dopamine innervation was visualized using antibodies raised against tyrosine hydroxlase (TH) in the striatum and in the globus pallidus. One week post-lesion, the expression of Iba 1 -positive cells, a general microglial marker, was significantly increased in the striatum of all animals fed with antioxidant-enriched diets compared to control-diet fed animals, while the diameter of the TH-negative zone was similar in all animals. At four weeks post-lesion, the Iba 1 -positive microglia was significantly reduced in animals fed with antioxidant-enriched diets. The diameter of the TH-negative zone was significantly reduced in animals fed bilberry and crowberry. The expression and distribution of ED 1 -positive cells was similar to that of Iba 1 -positive cells found in the lesioned areas. A cell division marker Ki 67 revealed that few microglia were proliferating in crowberry-treated animals. Otherwise dividing cells were associated with blood capillary cells. Although the antioxidant level should be equal in the entire brain, no regeneration was found in globus pallidus, suggesting the mechanism promoting regeneration in the striatum is not effective in the globus pallidus.

40|$|The {{research}} in our laboratory involves {{the study of}} nutraceuticals, which are foods claimed to have a medicinal effect on human health. Powdered samples of <b>bilberry,</b> <b>blueberry,</b> black currant and lingonberry were provided from Natural Newfoundland Nutraceuticals (NNN Inc., Markland Newfoundland). Whole berries were also collected. For the analysis, various solvent extractions of the berry samples were conducted. The extract solutions were analyzed using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for compound detection. Two distinct elution regions for anthocyanins and flavonols were obtained with near base line separation of different compounds. For proper identification of these compounds, two standards (delphinidin- 3 -glucoside and cyanidin- 3 -galactoside) were run to obtain a standard retention peak with MS value. LC-MS analysis revealed that various polyphenolic compounds, such as flavonoids (e. g. anthocyanins and flavonols), are present in these species of berries. In addition, our analysis revealed that <b>bilberry</b> and <b>blueberry</b> extracts appear to contain a greater array of antioxidant compounds when compared to black currant and lingonberry extracts. We have also conducted some quantitative analysis in order to compare compounds from native Newfoundland berries to those detected in these species from other regions. The bilberry extract was examined for neuroprotection by applying them to cultured rat brain cortical cells. Cells were injured using an in vitro model of trauma. High levels of lactate were measured after injury, showing that cells were unhealthy. When extracts {{were added to the}} cells 15 minutes before injury lactate levels dropped significantly. Aging experiments showed that up to day 17 cell cultures demonstrated no significant death of neurons, but by day 20 there was a dramatic loss of neurons. For glial cells, proliferation was noticed by day 17, but by day 20 there was no significance further change in glial cells. Extracts were added on days 17, 18 and 19 in vitro. By counting neurons and glia on day 20 it was found that no noticeable effect was shown on the glia and neurons with the addition of the extracts. Therefore, bilberry extracts appear to have a more prominent effect on trauma than on aging in cell cultures...|$|R
