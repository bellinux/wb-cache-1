[...] Also, Jeffrey's shooting star and marsh marigold grow {{close to the}} lake shore. [...] In the moist riparian area near the lake's outlet, there are Gorman's buttercup, yellow monkeyflower, Lewis monkey flower, arrowleaf groundsel, and false asphodel.

50|$|Habenaria, {{commonly}} called <b>bog</b> <b>orchids,</b> are a far ranging genus of orchids in the subtribe Orchidinae. There are approximately 800-1000 species of Habenaria, native to every continent except Antarctica, in both tropical and temperate zones.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the predominant pinyon-juniper-sagebrush habitat, there are permanent and seasonal streams and the eponymous meadow with wetter-habitat vegetation such as Jeffrey pines, willows, stream and <b>bog</b> <b>orchids,</b> and the remnant trees of the old commercial apple orchard. In 2011 the Eastern Sierra Land Trust secured a conservation easement to protect 104 acres of the Swall Meadows meadow area (location of the historic homesite), for the continued benefit of the migrating mule deer. A number of other conservation easements have been completed in Swall Meadows since the ESLT organization was founded in 2001.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{ecological}} sites, most {{of which}} are within the borders of the National Forests, e.g. ‘Łąki’, ‘Wzdłuż Ilanki’, ’Przy Ilance’, ‘Wokół Jeziora Popienko’ (the habitat of <b>Bog</b> <b>Orchid).</b>|$|E
50|$|Western {{blanket bog}} and {{heathland}} {{are the most}} common vegetation of Connemara National Park. The boglands are situated in the wet low lying environments whereas the blanket bog exists within the drier mountain atmosphere. Purple moorgrass is the most bountiful plant, creating colorful landscapes throughout the country side. Carnivorous plants {{play an important role in}} the park's ecosystem, the most common being sundew and butterworts trap. Bogs hold very little nutrients so many plants obtain their energy from the digestion of insects. Other common plants include lousewort, bog cotton, milkwort, <b>bog</b> asphodel, <b>orchids</b> and <b>bog</b> myrtle, with a variety of lichens and mosses.|$|R
5000|$|Since the North Branch Land Trust {{has been}} conserving lands {{there has been}} a total of 53 {{properties}} and 10,831 acres, across eight counties in the Northeastern region of Pennsylvania conserved. [...] That does not include the 1,250 acres that the North Branch owns completely. In these counties, countless properties have environmental treasures that are nearly extinct. Such as spring seeps, vernal pools, acidic shrub swamps, rare red spruce swamps, and an extremely rare glacial kettle bog. [...] This all consumes one property, Bear Creek Camp in Luzerne County. There are other lands conserved with special and biologically significant features such as the Macialek property, and Kuryloski Woods. In 2010 NBLT conserved 3,000 acres in Luzerne County. This property, named after {{the fact that it was}} sold for only half it’s worth, Mocanaqua Tract was preserved to save the rare cranberry <b>bog</b> and <b>orchids</b> that grow on this property. [...] Like most of the lands conserved by the NBLT this property also has a trail system that the public may use at any time.|$|R

50|$|The {{nature reserve}} {{encompasses}} two lakes, Tihu and Vanajõe, Õngu mire and {{an area of}} old-growth forest. The lakes form an important habitat for sea trout; the fish spawn in fresh water. The area is also a habitat for several unusual or threatened plants and insects, such as <b>bog</b> <b>orchid,</b> coralroot orchid, large white-faced darter and lilypad whiteface.

50|$|Rice Creek is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area that {{features}} a large, high-quality wetland complex of conifer swamps, fens, and sedge meadows along a two-mile stretch of Rice Creek. The creek contains dense, lush beds of emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation, including wild rice. White cedar, balsam fir, black spruce, and tamarack are the dominant trees in the conifer swamp. Several stands of old-growth hemlock/hardwood forest {{can be found in}} the site, each with a supercanopy of large white pine. Two fens, fed by groundwater seepages and of exceptional floristic diversity, are found near the creek. Overall, the site supports a high concentration of rare plants and animals. At least seven species of orchid are found here: showy lady slipper, heart-leaf twayblade, swamp pink, striped coralroot, blunt-leaf orchid, northern <b>bog</b> <b>orchid,</b> and boreal <b>bog</b> <b>orchid</b> (Platanthera dilatata). Other notable plant species include: bog arrowgrass, naked miterwort, marsh cinquefoil, purple clematis, and downy willowherb (Epilobium strictum). Notable animal species present include: barred owl, gray jay, pine siskin, winter wren, and bog copper.|$|E
50|$|The {{vascular}} plants {{characteristic of}} raised bogs (an {{example is the}} Bog of Allen) include: common heather, cross-leaved heath, bell heather, bogbean, hare's-tail cottongrass, common cottongrass, bog-rosemary, common cranberry, bog asphodel, bog myrtle, Pedicularis sylvatica, round-leaved sundew, oblong-leaved sundew, great sundew, royal fern, species of Utricularia, Juncus squarrosus, common tormentil, black bogrush, <b>bog</b> <b>orchid,</b> Euphrasia scottica, heath bedstraw, green-ribbed sedge, little green sedge, black crowberry, moor matgrass, soft rush, northern firmoss and wolf's-foot clubmoss.|$|E
5000|$|The Kettle Lake Bog rests {{directly}} {{to the south of}} the carriage house. The Kettle Lake Bog Garden is partially enclosed by curved brick walls with built-in benches. In the center is a depression once used as a fishpond, but was partially filled with quartz gravel and was transformed into a bog. Cranberry, Pitcher plant, Peat, [...] Sphagnum moss and <b>Bog</b> <b>orchid</b> are some of the plants that fill the current garden.|$|E
50|$|Common meadow wildflowers include Jeffrey's {{shooting}} star, elephanthead, Gorman's buttercup, alpine asters, American alpine speedwell, Indian paintbrush, small-flowered paintbrush, {{high mountain}} cinquefoil, Gray's ligusticum, green false hellebore, swamp laurel, and white <b>bog</b> <b>orchid</b> (Habenaria dilatata). Also, Jeffrey's shooting star and marsh marigold grow {{close to the}} lake shore. In the moist riparian area near the lake's outlet, there are Gorman's buttercup, yellow monkeyflower, Lewis monkey flower, arrowleaf groundsel, and false asphodel. Oregon saxifrage lives {{in some of the}} boggy areas around the lake.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} a Y-shaped {{drainage}} system running {{from east to}} west. The two arms of the stream display a large and unusual contrast in water chemistry. Water in the northern arm is acidic, while water in the southern arm is moderately high in calcium and moderately alkaline. Immediately downstream from the confluence, water is intermediate in composition, becoming increasingly acidic as it flows downstream. The wetland surrounding the northern branch of the stream supports acid-loving wetland plants; golden bog-moss is abundant in this area. The wetland around the southern branch supports wetland plants that thrive in alkaline conditions; it is dominated by black bog-rush, which forms tussocks. Rare plants on the site include Dorset heath, and, around a series of pools, bog sedge and the rare <b>bog</b> <b>orchid</b> (Hammarbya).|$|E
