30|$|To {{establish}} metastatic {{breast cancer}} model, Balb/c mice were inoculated with 4 T 1 luc cells via intracardiac injection. 4 T 1 luc cells were grown to 70 – 80  % of confluence in T- 75 flasks, treated with × 1 trypsin/EDTA, washed, and suspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) at 5 [*]×[*] 105 per milliliter. The cells were kept on ice and delivery was completed within 1  h after harvesting. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane {{and placed on}} a sterile drape with limbs secured and chest swabbed with 70  % ethanol. A 0.3 -cm <b>3</b> <b>syringe</b> (29 G <b>needle)</b> containing 5 [*]×[*] 104 4 T 1 luc cells in 0.1  ml DPBS was inserted slowly into the chest in the second intercostal space directly into the left ventricle. Proper placement in the left ventricle was indicated by blood flow into the syringe, and the cells were delivered slowly (approximately 30  s for 0.1  ml). Once complete, the needle was withdrawn by pulling straight out quickly, and the animal was placed on a heating pad and monitored until awake and ambulatory.|$|R

30|$|PVA {{solutions}} {{were prepared}} by dissolving PVA in acetic acid aqueous solution at 90 °C with constant stirring {{for at least}} 4  h. The electrospinning setup (Kato Tech, Kyoto, Japan) {{used in this study}} consists of a syringe with a flat-end metal needle (1.20 -mm inner diameter, NN- 1838  N, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), a syringe pump for controlled the feeding rate, a grounded cylindrical stainless steel mandrel, and a high-voltage DC power supply. In a typical electrospinning process, PVA solution was transferred into a syringe and delivered to the tip of the <b>syringe</b> <b>needle</b> by the <b>syringe</b> pump at a constant feed rate (1.0  ml/h). A 12 -kV positive voltage was applied to the PVA solution via the stainless steel <b>syringe</b> <b>needle.</b> The subsequently ejected polymer fiber was collected on the rotating cylindrical stainless steel mandrel, which was rotated during the electrospinning process (150  rpm).

40|$|Although needlestick and sharps {{injuries}} (NSI) {{represent a}} major hazard in nursing practice, most studies rely on officially reported data and none have yet been undertaken in tropical environments. Therefore, {{we conducted a}} cross-sectional NSI survey targeting all nurses within a tropical Australian hospital, {{regardless of whether they}} had experienced an NSI or not. Our overall response rate was 76. 7 %. A total of 39 nurses reported 43 NSI events in the previous 12 months. The most common causative device was a normal <b>syringe</b> <b>needle,</b> followed by insulin <b>syringe</b> <b>needles,</b> i. v. needles or kits and blood collection needles. Half of the nurses' NSI events occurred beside the patient's bed: drawing up medication was the most common reason. Nurses working in the maternity/neonatal wards were only 0. 3 times as likely to have experienced an NSI as their counterparts in the medical or surgical wards.

40|$|AIM: To {{observe the}} clinic effects and {{complication}} of Ahmed glaucoma valve(AGV) implantation in refractory glaucoma {{by using the}} 23 G <b>syringe</b> <b>needle</b> direct puncture the sclerotic tunnel. METHODS: Forty-four cases(44 eyes) of refractory glaucoma underwent AGV implantation by useing the 23 G <b>syringe</b> <b>needle</b> direct puncture the sclerotic tunnel. The intraocular pressure(IOP), visual acuity, and complication of post-operation were contrasted with those of pre-operation. RESULTS:The success rate was 84. 1 %, the mean preoperative IOP in research group was 52. 1 ± 10. 1 mmHg, and the last follow up mean IOP was 15. 6 ± 6. 9 mmHg. Compared with the preoperative visual acuity, 11 eyes increased, 27 eyes had no changes and 6 eyes decreased. The main post-operative complications included shallow anterior chamber(4 eyes), choroidal detachment(3 eyes), drainage tube shift(1 eye), hyphema(6 eyes), drainage tube blockage(1 eye), expulsive choroidal hemorrhage(1 eye), and fiber wrap of drainage tray(5 eyes). CONCLUSION: AGV implantation by direct puncture the sclerotic tunnel is feasible and easy. It avoids of making sclerotic petal and the xenogenic sclera transplanting, simplified the operation technique, prevent the leakage of around tube. The shallow anterior chamber rate is lower.
