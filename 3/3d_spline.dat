Unlike the {{standard}} finite element method, this method employs B- <b>3</b> <b>spline</b> function for interpolation {{in one direction}} and local Hermite cubic polynomial in the other direction. The general form of displacement function is given as their product. Extensive numerical examples on right plates and shells were well documented by Cheung et al.

The input dataset used for each interpolation method (except for the Kriging’s method) has 96 samples and corresponds to the day 15 - 07 - 2011 (from the midnight to the midnight) of the photovoltaic field located in Moie (An). We first cancelled both singular samples and subset of data from the original dataset, and then performed the reconstruction.
