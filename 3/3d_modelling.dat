5|$|Inspired by Matchbox toys {{he played}} with as a child, Posehn {{decided to make the}} size of the game sprites {{resemble}} toys. Posehn contacted his friend, Tim Calvin, to assist with designing and creating the vehicle sprites. Though Calvin was a practising dentist at the time, he also had experience with <b>3D</b> <b>modelling.</b> He rendered 3D models on a computer and reduced them to the desired size. Different views were obtained by rotating the models along a single axis. Calvin added colour to the sprites to meet the production staff's specifications; most required black, white, red, and blue, as well as four shades of colours like green and brown. Calvin eventually felt the rendering process was a waste of resources and attempted to create sprites on the pixel level himself without 3D models. The developers, however, preferred the sprites created from the models over Calvin's freestyle ones.|$|E
5|$|During production, Tabata {{and the new}} {{development}} staff used experience from a failed attempt to develop an eighth-generation console sequel to Type-0 when handling the new hardware. While using Luminous Studio for games other than XV was considered during production, the engine's technology manager Julien Merceron advised against it until it has been proven and released in a finished form. While CGI cutscenes created by dedicated Square Enix subsidiary Visual Works were present throughout its lifetime, there were far fewer than originally planned in the final game. The team instead relied on real-time cutscenes as much as possible, except for scenes with a scale too great to use real-time graphics. The transition to next-generation hardware enabled the team to better realize their original vision for the game, as conveyed in the original reveal trailer. Visual Works also {{worked closely with the}} team during development of <b>3D</b> <b>modelling</b> systems, due to their previous experiences with such technology in cutscene development.|$|E

An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for prototypes, small batch series or unique and personalized designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include Polyamide, steel and wax (latter for further processing).

In general, there is strong evidence to suggest that the FF <b>3</b> <b>model</b> outperforms the CAPM. The relative merit of the FF <b>3</b> <b>model</b> is highlighted by its ability to capture information related to Personal Consumption, Retail Sales, CPI, PPI, Factory Orders, Leading Indicators, Construction Spending, Housing Starts, and New Home Sales. An attribution analysis of the relative performance of SMB and HML equity factors indicate that both factors, in isolation, equally account for macroeconomic surprises.

40|$|Objective: One {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the head kinematics of the Q <b>3</b> <b>model.</b> Another objective is to evaluate the effect on head kinematics of increased thoracic spine flexibility; more humanlike mass distribution; and more humanlike body geometry in the Q <b>3</b> <b>model.</b> The evaluations were based on the head kinematics of children deduced from real crashes and on new data of mass distribution and updated body dimensions for 3 -year-olds. Methods: The head kinematics of the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> was evaluated by comparing the Q <b>3</b> <b>model's</b> head displacement response with the deduced response of 3 -year-old children in real crashes. To do so, data from crashes were collected. The data were used to develop the mathematical vehicle and restraint system models (MADYMO, TASS, the Netherlands). Three crashes involving 3 -year-old children in frontal impacts were reconstructed. The models were run 35 times each (one model per crash), each time with a different setting to each of the variables for which the exact value was not known. Examples of those variables include crash pulse, initial dummy position, and initial seat belt position. Two versions of the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> were used: one that correlated with the Q 3 ATD and one that was modified regarding anthropometry and thoracic flexibility. The basis for the updated anthropometry was new data regarding characteristic dimensions and mass distribution collected at a Swedish hospital. Results: In the anthropometry study, 26 children were measured. The main differences between the average of the measured children and the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> were found in the mass distribution of the torso and thighs: the Q 3 's pelvis was too heavy and the thorax, abdomen/lumbar spine, and thighs were too light. Another difference was identified in the buttock-knee length. Two of the 3 reconstructed crashes had confirmed head impacts. The Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> responded with head kinematics that reflected the deduced courses of events for the real children in one of 3 crashes (the one without head impact). The modified Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> reflected the real children in 2 of 3 crashes. Conclusions: In high-severity, straight frontal crashes, the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> predicted non-head impact adequately. However, in oblique frontal crashes, the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> did not sufficiently predict the head impacts. The modified Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> predicted the head impacts better than the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> did. Greater flexibility of the thorax and redistributed mass made a positive difference regarding the head kinematics...|$|R
