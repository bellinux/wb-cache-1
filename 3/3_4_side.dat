40|$|Despite {{increasing}} {{investments in}} pharmaceutical R&D, {{there is a}} continuing paucity of new drug approvals. Drug discovery {{continues to be a}} lengthy and resource-consuming process {{in spite of all the}} advances in genomics, life sciences, and technology. Indeed, it is estimated that about 90 % of the drugs fail during development in phase 1 clinical trials 1 and that it takes billions of dollars in investment and an average of 15 years to bring a new drug to the market 2. Meanwhile, there is an ever-growing effort to apply computational power to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of drug discovery. Traditional computational methods in drug discovery were focused on understanding which proteins could make good drug targets, sequence analysis, modeling drugs binding to proteins, and the analysis of biological data. With the attention on translational research in recent years, a new set of computational methods are being developed which examine drug-target associations and drug off-target effects through system and network approaches. These new approaches take advantage of the unprecedented large-scale highthroughput measurements, such as drug chemical structures and screens <b>3,</b> <b>4,</b> <b>side</b> effect profiles 5, 6, transcriptional responses after drug treatment 7, 8, genome wide association studies 9, and combined knowledge 10, 11.

40|$|BACKGROUND:Herpes zoster or, {{as it is}} {{commonly}} called, 'shingles' is a neurocutaneous disease characterised by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV), {{the virus that causes}} chickenpox, which is latent in the dorsal spinal ganglia when immunity to VZV declines. It is an extremely painful condition which can often last for many weeks or months, impairing the patient's quality of life. The natural aging process is associated with a reduction of cellular immunity which predisposes to herpes zoster. Vaccination with an attenuated form of VZV activates specific T cell production, therefore avoiding viral reactivation. A herpes zoster vaccine with an active virus has been approved for clinical use among older adults by the Food and Drug Administration and has been tested in large populations. OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in older adults. METHODSSearch methods: We searched the following sources for relevant studies: CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7, MEDLINE (1948 to July week 1, 2012), EMBASE (2010 to July 2012), LILACS (1982 to July 2012) and CINAHL (1981 to July 2012). We also reviewed reference lists of identified trials and reviews for additional studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing zoster vaccine with placebo or no vaccine, to prevent herpes zoster in older adults (mean age > 60 years). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently collected and analysed data using a data extraction form. They also carried out an assessment of risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS:We identified eight RCTs with a total of 52, 269 participants. Three studies were classified at low risk of bias. The main outcomes on effectiveness and safety were extracted from one clinical trial with a low risk of bias. Four studies compared zoster vaccine versus placebo; one study compared high-potency zoster vaccine versus low-potency zoster vaccine; one study compared refrigerated zoster vaccine versus frozen zoster vaccine; one study compared live zoster vaccine versus inactivated zoster vaccine and one study compared zoster vaccine versus pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (pneumo 23). Confirmed cases of herpes zoster were less frequent in patients who received the vaccine than in those who received a placebo: risk ratio (RR) 0. 49 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 43 to 0. 56), with a risk difference (RD) of 2 %, and number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 50. Analyses according to age groups indicated a greater benefit in participants aged 60 to 69 years, RR 0. 36 (95 % CI 0. 30 to 0. 45) and in participants aged 70 years and over, RR 0. 63 (95 % CI 0. 53 to 0. 75). Vaccine-related systemic adverse effects were more frequent in the vaccinated group (RR 1. 29, 95 % CI 1. 05 to 1. 57, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) = 100). The pooled data risk ratio for adverse effects for participants with one or more inoculation site adverse effect was RR 4. 51 (95 % CI 2. 35 to 8. 68), and the NNTH was 2. 8 (95 % CI 2. 3 to <b>3.</b> <b>4).</b> <b>Side</b> effects were more frequent in younger (60 to 69 years) than in older (70 years and over) participants. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:Herpes zoster vaccine is effective in preventing herpes zoster disease. Although vaccine benefits are larger in the younger age group (60 to 69 years), this is also the age group with more adverse events. In general, zoster vaccine is well tolerated; it produces few systemic adverse events and injection site adverse effects of mild to moderate intensity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Herpes zoster is a {{reactivation}} of {{varicella-zoster virus}} (VZV). Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) occurs in approximately 9 % to 13 % {{of patients with}} herpes zoster. The precise definition of post-herpetic neuralgia is controversial {{and there is little}} information about the blood levels of antioxidant vitamins in patients with post-herpetic neuralgia. Hence, this study compared the antioxidant profiles including retinol, α-tocopherol, lycopene, α-carotene, β-carotene and vitamin C in 38 patients with post-herpetic neuralgia lasting longer than 3 months in comparison with those of 39 healthy controls. Numeric rating scales were used in evaluating pain at the first visit to our pain clinic. Our analysis illustrated that retinol, α-tocopherol, lycopene and β-carotene between patients with post-herpetic neuralgia and controls were not significantly different. The contents of α-carotene in patients with PHN (4. 5 ± 4. 3 μg/dL) were significantly lower than in controls (5. 5 ± 3. 7 μg/dL) (p< 0. 05). The contents of vitamin C were also significantly lower in patients (4. 6 ± 3. 1 μg/mL) than in controls (13. 4 ± 6. 0 μg/mL) (p< 0. 001). An inverse linear regression between numeric rating pain scale and serum vitamin C was noted. (p< 0. 001) We, therefore, investigated the analgesic effect of intravenous ascorbate in patients with PHN. This study was conducted as comparative, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in outpatients consulting Pain clinic at Chi-Mei hospital during 2003. Twenty-four patients assigned to one of the two parallel treatment groups to receive intravenous 500 ml normal saline infusion with or without ascorbate (50 mg/kg, maximum dose: 2. 5 g per day). Every patient received intravenous administration three times on day 1, 3 & 5 with infusion rate of 100 - 150 mL/hr. Every patient was requested to answer a questionnaire which included numeric rating pain scale, global impression of change on day 7, sleep interference, side effects. Efficacy was judged on the following two parameters: change from baseline in pain intensity on numeric rating pain scale (NRS) and global impression of change. The change in average daily pain score from baseline day 1 to day 7 showed a mean change of 3. 0 for patients treated with intravenous ascorbate vs. 0. 64 for placebo group. (p< 0. 001) Percent of patients treated with ascorbate (61. 5 %) showed significantly higher than placebo patients (9. 1 %) in moderate to much improvement in patients' global impression of change. And patients' global impression of change in patients treated with ascorbate also showed significantly greater (p< 0. 05) than placebo patients. There was one each in each group who complained of worse painful after intravenous infusion twice and didn't receive the third infusion. No other patients suffered any side effects. Our results showed that intravenous ascorbate is effective in partial relieving the pain of PHN. The results suggest that supplement of vitamin C to patients with post-herpetic neuralgia may boost plasma & CSF antioxidant defense and facilitate neuroprotection and pain modulation. 中 文 摘 要 帶狀皰疹是水痘-帶狀皰疹病毒再活化造成的疾病，其中約 9 ~ 13 % 病患罹患帶狀皰疹後神經痛的後遺症。帶狀皰疹後神經痛仍未有一致性定義，其病理致病機轉至今未明，且帶狀皰疹後神經痛患者血中抗氧化維生素資料甚少。本研究採定義皮膚發疹後，超過三個月患者仍感受持續疼痛者為帶狀皰疹後神經痛。研究 38 名帶狀皰疹後神經痛患者與 39 名健康自願者，血中抗氧化維生素(含維生素A,維生素E,茄紅素, α、β胡蘿蔔素與維生素C) 對照比較，同時採用數字評估疼痛指數，進行帶狀皰疹後神經痛患者血中抗氧化維生素與數字疼痛指數相關性分析。分析發現：健康自願者與帶狀皰疹後神經痛患者的血中維生素A,維生素E,茄紅素與β胡蘿蔔素，無顯著不同，但帶狀皰疹後神經痛患者血中α胡蘿蔔素： 4. 5 ± 4. 3 μg/dL; 健康自願者： 5. 5 ± 3. 7 μg/dL， (p< 0. 05) 。帶狀皰疹後神經痛患者血中維生素C： 4. 6 ± 3. 1 μg /mL; 健康自願者： 13. 4 ± 6. 0 μg /mL (p< 0. 001) 。兩種抗氧化維生素皆明顯偏低，尤其帶狀皰疹後神經痛患者血中維生素C與疼痛指數，呈有意義負相關 (p< 0. 001) 。 因此 2003 年我們於奇美醫院，採雙盲、治療－控制組設計，探討經靜脈點滴補充維生素C對帶狀皰疹後神經痛患者的止痛效果。 24 位病患隨機採二種之一種注射液， 500 mL 生理食鹽水加或不加維生素C，(50 mg/kg, 且每人每日最高劑量: 2. 5 g) 。每位病患於第一、三、五日注射前與第七日均需回答問卷，問卷含數字疼痛指數評估，第七天時的整體印象改變評估和睡眠改善評估，副作用報告。止痛有效性依據數字疼痛指數改變數目與第七天時的整體疼痛印象改變評估為評量。 第一天到第七天的數字疼痛指數改變數字比值，維生素C治療組與對照組為 3. 0 比 0. 64 (p< 0. 001) 。第七天時的整體疼痛印象改變評估值， 61. 5 % 維生素C治療組病患報告中或大幅進步，但僅有 9. 1 % 對照組病患報告中或大幅進步，整體疼痛印象改變評估值，維生素C治療組大於對照組(p< 0. 05) 。無病患有重大不良副作用。 本研究指出罹患帶狀皰疹後神經痛病患補充維生素C，可強化病患血中與脊髄液中抗氧化能力、促進神經元保護與減緩疼痛。Contents Abstract in Chinese……………………………………………………………………. … 5 Abstract…………………………………………………………………………………. …. 6 Abbreviation lists…………………………………………………. ……………… [...] …… 8 Part I. 1.

After calculating the U Value for a system, the results can be used to demonstrate how to evaluate the energy consumption for a specific system in a specific location, and compare these results relative to different configurations. This paper details that mechanically fixed systems demonstrate good initial performance, but the aging of gaskets results in shrinkage. Furthermore, compression set of the gaskets allows additional air and water infiltration, rendering the system even less effective. Gasket joint systems also allow additional exposure to the elements of the middle of the aluminum system which further decreases the energy efficiency.

The results suggested that the α-Si <b>3</b> N <b>4</b> powders partly transformed into β-SiAlON and partly dissolved into oxide glass to form oxynitride glass. Thus, composites of glass/β-SiAlON-ceramic formed in the seam of joints. Due to the capillary action of the porous Si <b>3</b> N <b>4</b> ceramic, the molten glass solder infiltrated into the porous Si <b>3</b> N <b>4</b> ceramic <b>side</b> during the joining process and formed the “infiltration zone” with a thickness of about 400 μm, which contributed to the heterogeneous distribution of the RE–Si–Al–O–N glasses in the porous Si <b>3</b> N <b>4</b> substrate. In-situ formation of β-SiAlON in the seam resulted in a high bonding strength. The maximum bending strength of 103 MPa and 88 MPa was reached for the porous Si <b>3</b> N <b>4</b> /dense Si <b>3</b> N <b>4</b> joints using Y–Si–Al–O–N and Yb–Si–Al–O–N glass solders, respectively...|$|R
