2500|$|The Alexandra Dock {{was built}} {{to the west of}} the final section of the drain in the early 1880s. Research on the {{original}} Hull Dock had shown that around 1.25 million tons of mud were deposited in the dock each year, as a result of the muddy water of the Humber entering the dock for 2 to <b>3</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> each high tide. In order to mitigate the high cost of dredging to remove this material, the water levels in the [...] dock were maintained by pumping fresh water from the Holderness Drain. Pumps capable of pumping 14.5 million cubic feet (410 Ml) per day were installed, resulting in significant savings in the cost of operating the dock. Pumping from the drain increased again in 1913, when the newly constructed King George V Dock opened, and again required clean water. For Holderness Drainage, this provided the benefits of pumping without the cost.|$|E
2500|$|They {{chose to}} pitch their idea to Harrison {{using their own}} software, rather than PowerPoint, which allowed for bullet point {{information}} as in standard presentations, but also for live, controllable movement of game characters. By their own admission, the pitch was vague and they had deliberately toned down the creative aspect of the game—which they felt may have appeared as [...] "weird" [...] for a console game—for fear of negative reception of their pitch by Sony. They presented the prototype purely as a playable game, and only briefly mentioned the user created content aspect; Evans relates that Harrison actually {{picked up on the}} creative side, and had asked them why they had chosen not to explore this element further. The meeting, which had been scheduled to last 45 minutes, eventually lasted <b>3</b> <b>hours</b> <b>at</b> the end of which, Sony agreed to fund the project for six months. After some further development, the team were asked to present what they had done to Sony in what Healey describes as a [...] "Dragons' Den style scenario". Following this, Sony gave them a deal to develop LittleBigPlanet for the PlayStation 3 in exchange for exclusivity and ownership of the intellectual property.
