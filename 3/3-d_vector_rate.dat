The motion <b>vector</b> <b>rate</b> vs. DFD variance performance of RC-BMA employing size KxK blocks is shown to be superior to that of the conventional Minimum Distortion Block Matching Algorithm (MD-BMA) employing size 2 Kx 2 K blocks. Constraining of the entropy or conditional entropy of motion vectors in RC-BMA results in smoother and more organized motion vector fields with respect to those output by MD-BMA. The motion <b>vector</b> <b>rate</b> of RC-BMA can also be fine tuned to a desired level for each frame by adjusting a single parameter.

The accurate temporal reuse-aware link <b>rate</b> <b>vectors</b> are also determinable, {{and the number of}} vectors remains the same. The column generation must therefore end, since the number of link <b>rate</b> <b>vectors</b> is limited. Due to Carathéodory's theorem, there is a high probability that the master problem will converge before all the link <b>rate</b> <b>vectors</b> have been generated. The moment no new link <b>rate</b> <b>vector</b> can increase the capacity supply, the column generation converges.|$|R

However, there is no existing research on the regulation between effective loading of NPs and targeted delivery of macrophages. Here, we investigated the important parameters of intracellular NP quantity and the <b>vector</b> migration <b>rate.</b> Macrophage loading capacity was obtained by comparing the uptake quantity of varisized NPs, and the delivery ability of loaded cells was determined by measuring <b>vector</b> migration <b>rates.</b> We observed a positive correlation between the size of NPs and directed macrophage migration. Our findings suggest that the molecular mechanism of migration <b>vector</b> <b>rate</b> regulation involved increased expression levels of colony-stimulating factor- 1 (CSF- 1) receptor and integrin induced by 100 -nm and 500 -nm particles. The ability of macrophages uptake to varisized NPs showed the opposite trend, with the increased <b>vector</b> <b>rate</b> of cell migration influenced by NPs.

40|$|Background: Efficient malaria {{vector control}} {{requires}} knowledge of spatio-temporal vector dynamics. We have classified village groups {{according to the}} biting rate profiles of both Anopheles coluzzii and An. gambiae, the major malaria vectors in these villages. Mosquitoes were captured by human bait in 28 South Benin villages during 2009. Both An. coluzzii and An. gambiae counts in each village were standardized to focus on changes in the <b>vector</b> biting <b>rate</b> over time. Latent class trajectory modeling, allowing for random intercept at the village level, was adjusted to standardized values. The villages could be classified into two groups with distinct <b>vector</b> biting <b>rate</b> profiles (continuous/transient). This classification helped creating a map of <b>vector</b> biting <b>rates</b> in the area. The biting rate profiles {{were found to be}} significantly correlated with mean rainfall, altitude, average number of larval sites, and average normalized difference vegetation index. In highly malaria-prone regions, knowledge of <b>vector</b> biting <b>rate</b> profiles is important to improve vector control interventions. A similar methodology may be applied to study the biting rate profiles of other vector-borne infections...|$|R

Given the current queue state, QPS allocates a data <b>rate</b> <b>vector</b> {{such that the}} expected <b>rate</b> <b>vector</b> averaged over all fading states {{is proportional to the}} current queue state vector {{as well as on the}} boundary of the ergodic BC capacity region. One well known throughput optimal policy for a fading BC is Maximum Weight Matching Scheduling (MWMS), which maximizes the inner product of the queue state <b>vector</b> and achievable <b>rate</b> <b>vector.</b> Simulation results for Poisson packet arrivals and exponentially distributed packet lengths demonstrate that QPS provides a significant decrease in average queuing delay compared to MWMS.

30|$|The {{problem of}} {{determining}} an optimal parameter setup at the physical {{layer in a}} multiuser, multiantenna downlink is considered. An aggregate utility, which is assumed {{to depend on the}} users' rates, is used as performance metric. It is not assumed that the utility function is concave, allowing for more realistic utility models of applications with limited scalability. Due to the structure of the underlying capacity region, a two step approach is necessary. First, an optimal <b>rate</b> <b>vector</b> is determined. Second, the optimal parameter setup is derived from the optimal <b>rate</b> <b>vector.</b> Two methods for computing an optimal <b>rate</b> <b>vector</b> are proposed. First, based on the differential manifold structure offered by the boundary of the MIMO BC capacity region, a gradient projection method on the boundary is developed. Being a local algorithm, the method converges to a <b>rate</b> <b>vector</b> which is not guaranteed to be a globally optimal solution. Second, the monotonic structure of the rate space problem is exploited to compute a globally optimal <b>rate</b> <b>vector</b> with an outer approximation algorithm. While the second method yields the global optimum, the first method is shown to provide an attractive tradeoff between utility performance and computational complexity.|$|R

To extend Faust capabilities to domains such as spectral processing, we introduce here a multirate extension of the core Faust language.

This interplay between <b>vectors</b> and <b>rates</b> is made possible in the language static semantics {{by the introduction of}} dependent types.

Monitoring <b>vector</b> contact <b>rates</b> on particularly susceptible and perhaps more exposed avian nestlings may provide an advanced indication of local WNV amplification. To test this hypothesis we monitored WNV infection and <b>vector</b> contact <b>rates</b> among nestlings occupying nest boxes (primarily Eastern bluebirds; Sialia sialis, Turdidae) across Henrico County, Virginia, USA, from May to August 2012. Observed host-seeking rates were temporally variable and associated with absolute vector and host abundances. Despite substantial effort to monitor WNV among nestlings and mosquitoes, we did not detect the presence of WNV in these populations. Generally low vector-nestling host contact rates combined with the negative WNV infection data suggest that monitorin...|$|R
