One high density subset is called the primary circle and essentially consists of patches with a line separating a light and a dark region. In this paper, we apply the techniques of Carlsson et al. to range <b>patches.</b> <b>By</b> enlarging to 5 × 5 and 7 × 7 patches, we find core subsets that have the topology of the primary circle, suggesting a stronger connection between optical patches and range patches than was found by Lee, Pedersen, and Mumford...|$|R

40|$|In {{eukaryotic}} chemotaxis, {{the mechanisms}} connecting external {{signals to the}} motile apparatus remain unclear. The role of the lipid phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (PIP 3) has been particularly controversial. PIP 3 has many cellular roles, notably in growth control and macropinocytosis as well as cell motility. Here we show that PIP 3 is not only unnecessary for Dictyostelium discoideum to migrate toward folate, but actively inhibits chemotaxis. We find that macropinosomes, but not pseudopods, in growing cells are dependent on PIP <b>3.</b> PIP <b>3</b> <b>patches</b> in these cells show no directional bias, and overall only PIP 3 -free pseudopods orient up-gradient. The pseudopod driver suppressor of cAR mutations (SCAR) /WASP and verprolin homologue (WAVE) is not recruited {{to the center of}} PIP <b>3</b> <b>patches,</b> just the edges, where it causes macropinosome formation. Wild-type cells, unlike the widely used axenic mutants, show little macropinocytosis and few large PIP <b>3</b> <b>patches,</b> but migrate more efficiently toward folate. Tellingly, folate chemotaxis in axenic cells is rescued by knocking out phosphatidylinositide 3 -kinases (PI 3 -kinases). Thus PIP 3 promotes macropinocytosis and interferes with pseudopod orientation during chemotaxis of growing cells...|$|R

We present a more unified non-contact approach where the fiducials are projected light patterns and the patch scanner is software based, in that the cameras and digital projectors are off the shelf general purpose technologies. We combine the patch depth acquisition with digital color photography, each having different pixel resolutions. We evaluate the manual merging of the captured patch data and present a new point reduction method based on voxel grid mapping.

40|$|Caribbean {{coral reefs}} {{have had an}} 80 % {{decrease}} in live coral cover {{over the last several}} decades and the effect of white-band disease on Acropora species was a major contributor. The loss of Acropora resulted in a decrease of reef rugosity and habitats for fish and reef invertebrates. This paper examines the record of stressors today and in pre-human staghorn communities to examine possible changes. Acropora cervicornis fragments, estimated to be 250 - 750 years old, were collected from recently exposed earthquake scarps on patch reefs in the South Water Caye Marine Reserve, Central Belize. Skeletal records of stressors included damsel fish chimneys, clubbed and eroded tips representing fireworm predation, and resheeting over dead tissue presumably killed by snail predation or disease. These results were compared to similar data from live A. cervicornis colonies on 18 nearby patch reefs. A. cervicornis comprised most of the subfossil assemblage, but makes up only 1 % of the live coral cover today. It is replaced on <b>patch</b> reefs today <b>by</b> <b>branching</b> corals with much less topographic relief such as Agaricia tenuifolia (21 %), Porites porites (16 %) and Millipora complinata (fire coral, 15 %). Damselfish impacts did not change from the pre-human baseline, but the incidence of fireworm predation and disease had both more than doubled. Increased biological stressors on A. cervicornis may result from a loss of fireworm and snail predators such as large fish and lobsters. An increase in fishing regulations in South Water Cay Marine Reserve may be necessary for the reestablishment of thriving staghorn coral communities...|$|R

For a monoatomic step, the &RADIC; 3 x &RADIC; <b>3</b> <b>patch</b> grows uniformly (at the same level) over the upper and lower terrace resulting in a wandering of the step, while higher steps are splitted into two levels due to the formation of high and low Ag-covered areas.
