5|$|There is a {{small power}} station {{comprising}} three Cummins B and C series diesel engines, offering an approx 150 kVa <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> supply {{to most of the}} island buildings. Waste heat from the engine jackets is used for a district heating pipe. There are also plans to collect the waste heat from the engine exhaust heat gases to feed into the district heat network to improve the efficiency further. The Power is normally switched off between 0000 and 0630.|$|E
5|$|When the {{generator}} building first went into operation, it housed two Westinghouse horizontal generators originally rated at 6,600 volts, operating at 225 rpm and producing <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> 60 cycle AC. They were driven by turbines. The voltage was {{stepped up to}} 100,000 volts using three delta-connected oil-cooled transformers of 3,000 kilowatt capacity. These were regulated with oil switches, and the transformers and switch gear were housed in {{the south end of}} {{the generator}} building.|$|E
5|$|Once {{construction}} on Phase 2 of the Second Avenue Subway, which runs from 105th Street to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, is completed, {{it is expected}} that construction will then take place on Phase <b>3.</b> <b>Phase</b> 3 would extend the Second Avenue Subway south from the provisions for the line to continue further south on Second Avenue. The tracks would diverge from the tracks that continue to the BMT 63rd Street Line running south on Second Avenue. There is currently a large provisional cavern, or bellmouth, for this line. The line would continue down Second Avenue to Houston Street, where the third phase would end. However, no funding has been committed to this phase. After Phase 3, a new T service will operate from 125th Street to Houston Street.|$|E

Each house was provided with proper sanitation using contributions from UNICEF Bangladesh and HFH Great Britain. These transitional shelters were designed to be built by volunteers and unskilled workers in about eight hours on an area that had been prepared by families. This shelter provides a strong and cyclone-resistant core structure to protect residents from severe weather. Extensions to the home when the family has the financial means can be done by adding walling to the existing structure.|$|E

50|$|The {{operation}} of a synchronous motor {{is due to the}} interaction of the magnetic fields of the stator and the rotor. Its stator winding, which consists of a <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> winding, is provided with a <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> supply, and the rotor is provided with a DC supply. The <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> stator winding carrying <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> currents produces <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> rotating magnetic flux (and therefore a rotating magnetic field). The rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field and rotates along with it. Once the rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field, the motor is said to be in synchronization. A single-phase (or two-phase derived from single phase) stator winding is possible, but in this case the direction of rotation is not defined and the machine may start in either direction unless prevented from doing so by the starting arrangements.|$|E
