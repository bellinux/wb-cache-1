According to another report in September 2005, the sidewalks were completely blocked for safety reasons and the city's Council decided the reconstruction and widening {{at the earliest}} possible moment. Subsequently, the funding of the 40 million Euro has been guaranteed. The <b>3-phased</b> reconstruction (north side, south side, road surface) began on April 16, 2007 and should be completed in April 2010 (later delayed to July 2011). After the reconstruction the bridge is 10 meters wider than before (26.80 meters in total).Until the completion the whole traffic (cars and tram) was contracted to the two central lanes. Pedestrians and cyclists had {{to use one of}} the closed road lanes (depending on the reconstructed bridge side).|$|R
25|$|As well as {{requiring}} both {{line and}} neutral {{inputs and outputs}} (or, full <b>3-phase),</b> many GFCI/RCBO devices require a functional earth (FE) connection. This serves to provide both EMC immunity and to reliably operate the device if the input-side neutral connection is lost but live and earth remain.|$|E
25|$|The High Alpha (angle of attack) Research Vehicle was an American {{modified}} McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet used by NASA in a <b>3-phase</b> program investigating {{controlled flight}} at high angles of attack using thrust vectoring, {{modifications to the}} flight controls, and with actuated forebody strakes. The program lasted from April 1987 to September 1996.|$|E
25|$|The car's <b>3-phase</b> AC {{induction}} {{electric motor}} produced 137 brake horsepower (102kW) at 7000 rpm. Like electric trains and all vehicles {{with an electric}} motor (and unlike a car powered by an internal combustion engine), the EV1 could deliver its full torque capacity throughout its power band, producing 110 pound-feet (149 newton-meters) of torque anywhere between 0 and 7000 rpm, allowing the omission of a manual or automatic gearbox. Power was delivered to the front wheels through a single-speed reduction integrated transmission.|$|E
25|$|The N class {{feature a}} {{frame and body}} locally designed, but with {{imported}} Electro-Motive Division technology in the prime mover, generator and control unit, along with locally produced components such as the bogie frames by Bradford Kendall. The class {{was the first in}} the world to use the EMD D43 traction motor, similar to but smaller than that used in the C and G classes. Head end power is provided by a separate engine unit in a special compartment located at the number 1 end of the locomotive behind the electrical cabinet. The 240kW generator provides 415V <b>3-phase</b> AC power for train lighting, air conditioning and other carriage requirements.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the NXEA franchise, Angel Trains {{opted to}} use off-lease Class 317/7 unit 317722 as a {{test-bed}} unit and engaged Bombardier Transportation to rebuild it as a pre-series unit with new traction equipment. The DC motors, traction electronics and thyristors were removed, though the original transformer remained in place. The original bogies were modified to accept new AC motors, and <b>3-phase</b> converters fitted. Regenerative braking was also fitted. Because AC motors are more reliable than DC ones and require significantly less maintenance, this should potentially bring significant cost savings. The work has the potential to extend the life of the Class 317 by up to 20 years. Angel Trains and Bombardier will evaluate the performance of the unit compared to a conventional Class 317.|$|E
25|$|Union Rotorua {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / {{electric}} machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822kW for a motor propeller speed of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a reduction gearbox. The generator output 6.6kV <b>3-phase</b> at 50Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous A.C. motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision {{was made in the}} interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning moment arm. In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need a power supply, a {{dangerous}} condition can arise if the neutral wire is broken or switched off {{on the supply side}} of the RCD, while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for <b>3-phase)</b> must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|E
25|$|The diesel {{alternator}} {{sets for}} the carriages provided <b>3-phase</b> 415-volt alternating current power. Only 1 phase {{was required for}} operation, so the other two phases were available for backup or for load-sharing across other carriages - useful because the ACN and BN cars required 28kW to operate and the BRN, with its additional functions, 40kW. To accommodate the extra load, the ACN and BN were upgraded midway through construction to a 35kVA supply, and the programming reworked so that the BRN would not power adjacent cars. If all alternators were off, then the cars {{was able to take}} power from an external 240vAC power supply. Around the same time as these modifications were made, the alternator set supports were modified to reduce vibration, and the radiator fan motors' thermal overload switches were moved to reduce unnecessary tripping. At the end of the modifications, the system was organised so that in event of a power failure, the batteries mounted under the carriages would automatically reroute all power to the lights at the ends of the train to protect from oncoming traffic. Those lights could function for over ten hours, at the expense of air-conditioning and other functions. The first six cars had plastic fuel pipes near the alternator units, but that was changed from car 7 onwards.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{electrification}} systems take AC {{energy from}} a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and {{converted to a}} DC voltage {{to be used by}} traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be <b>3-phase</b> AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to <b>3-phase</b> AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? [...] And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? [...] Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). [...] Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. [...] Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.|$|E
