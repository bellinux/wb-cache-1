5000|$|... 1981 the Riga-22 was released. At {{first it}} had a Š-62 engine, then {{starting}} from 1984 Riga-22 was equipped with a V-50 engine. First V-50 models had no external differences from the Š-62, but the internals were redesigned. It had a similar looking, but, better clutch. The only identical parts were plastic friction discs. Instead of 2 friction discs, the V-50 had 3 friction discs, and the gearbox in V-50 had ball bearings, instead of plain bearings. It had a new, and more modern electronic ignition, and the fuel tank was redesigned. The new V-50 engine was also used. Riga-22 was produced until 1989.1986 was a turn-around year for Riga. Deteriorating quality and engine problems made the need of a new model apparent. So in 1986 the new Riga Delta was introduced. The engine {{is in no way}} resembles its predecessor. The frame is completely changed. It has a new fuel tank, with only [...] "Delta" [...] written on it. Replaced the front and rear lamps and ignition. The Deltas were available in three colours pea-green, brick red and beige. Deltas also featured <b>3</b> <b>gear</b> gearbox.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Tractor {{drivers are}} {{continuously}} exposed to whole body vibration during driving that, this may cause disorders {{in the system}} of musculoskeletal, nervous, circulatory and occupational diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate exposed to whole body vibration among tractor driver.. Material and Method: In this study, whole-body vibration parameters such as root mean square (rms) of acceleration, total equivalent acceleration, vibration dose value (VDV) and crest factor (CF) were separately compared in three directions (x, y, and z), in 3 Massey Ferguson Model 165 Tractor it was done during 3 different modes of transport (without trailer, with empty trailer and with a trailer load of soil), plowing the land and loading trailer in working conditions with various gear according to the guidelines of ISO 2631 standard.. Result: The results showed that in all measuring points, exposure to whole body vibration was higher than permissible level and the risks of disorders exist. Exposure to vibration were as with empty trailer (43. 11 m/s 2). The maximum of crest factor was obtained for transportation mode of empty trailer with <b>3</b> <b>gear</b> (10. 7), then plowing (7. 35) and loading soil(6. 50). The maximum of vibration dose value was eventuated for transportation mode with empty trailer with 4 gear (189. 92 m/s 1. 75) and <b>3</b> <b>gear</b> (108. 15 m/s 1. 75). In all measuring modes exposure with vibration in Y direction was greater than X and Z axes.. Conclusion: This study shows that the need to provide intervention, controlling and managing measures to eliminate or reduce exposure to whole body vibration among tractor drivers its necessary. And, preventing main disorder Including musculoskeletal disorders, discomfort and early fatigue is of circular importance. More studies are also necessary to identify the sources of vibration among various of tractors...|$|E
40|$|For {{realizing the}} {{investigations}} 20 motorcycles of different producers were chosen and made available. Noise measurements according to EEC - directive 78 / 1015 /EWG, 87 / 56 /EWG, modifications {{of the research}} institution of noise and vibration in Aachen and own proposals have been conducted. The experiences made in practice and the measures taken by us following was found out: especially motorcycles with high power and high performance rating revolution within the measure distance don't accelerate corresponding their real power and therefore reach relatively low noise emission. For finding a better registration of such motorcycles following modification of the directive will be recommended: Motorcycles with a displacement over 175 ccm [and a power of more than 0, 2 KW/kg empty weight] should drive into the measure distance in the 2. gear with at least 50 % of the highest power engine revolution and higher speed, as this revolution won't be reached by 50 km/h, drive in the <b>3.</b> <b>gear</b> with a speed of 60 km/h into the measure distanceSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 8908 (93 - 116) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E

50|$|The AEGs were {{developed}} in Japan and the Japanese company Tokyo Marui is credited with creating the original gearbox system. In a Tokyo Marui AEG, the motor drives a train of <b>3</b> <b>gears</b> mounted inside a gearbox, which then loads a pump piston against a spring. Once the spring is released, it pushes the piston plunger forward through the pump cylinder to propel a pellet resting within the chamber forward through the barrel {{and out of the}} muzzle. Many manufacturers have now more or less replicated this basic model, adding reinforced parts or minor improvements.|$|R

40|$|Background: Mobile bottom fishing, such as {{trawling}} and dredging, is {{the most}} widespread direct human impact on marine benthic systems. Knowledge of the impacts of different gear types on different habitats, the species most sensitive to impacts {{and the potential for}} habitats to recover are often needed to inform implementation of an ecosystem approach to fisheries and strategies for biodiversity conservation. This knowledge helps to identify management options that maximise fisheries yield whilst minimising negative impacts on benthic systems. Methods/Design: The methods are designed to identify and collate evidence from experimental studies (e. g. before/after, control/impact) and comparative studies (spanning a gradient of fishing intensity) to identify changes in state (numbers, biomass, diversity etc.) of benthic biota (flora and fauna), resulting from a variety of mobile bottom fishing scenarios. The primary research question that the outputs will be used to address is: “to what extent does a given intensity of bottom fishing affect the abundance and/or diversity of benthic biota?” Due to the variety of gear and habitat types studied, the primary question will be closely linked with secondary questions. These include: “how does the effect of bottom fishing on various benthic biota metrics (species, faunal type, trait, taxon etc.) vary with (1) gear type and (2) habitat, and (<b>3)</b> <b>gear</b> type-habitat interactions?” and (4) “how might properties of the community and environment affect the resilience (and recovery potential) of a community to bottom fishing?...|$|E
