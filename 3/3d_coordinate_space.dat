In this method, {{we do not}} require neither artificial markers nor sensors, but natural feature points on arbitrary multiple planes. We assign a <b>3</b> D <b>coordinate</b> system for each plane independently. For each coordinate system, the projection matrix is computed in order to relate the coordinate system to the input images. Then, all the <b>3</b> D <b>coordinates</b> are integrated into a projective <b>3</b> D <b>coordinate</b> <b>space</b> that is defined by two reference images. Such integration can reduce errors in registration of a virtual object {{with the real world}} coordinate. For demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method, some experiments for overlay of virtual objects into image sequences taken with a handy video camera are performed. Accuracy evaluation by the number of planes via a synthesized image sequence is also performed, which indicates that the integration of a number of planes reduces the registration error. Additionally, comparison of proposed method with one of related work is performed. Our approach can contribute to image generation applicable to movie, sports casting, TV show, and so on...|$|R

However, in our approach, we are restricted to using a monocular vision system.

40|$|It {{remains a}} {{challenge}} to efficiently extract spatialtemporal information from skeleton sequences for 3 D human action recognition. Although most recent action recognition methods are based on Recurrent Neural Networks which present outstanding performance, one of the shortcomings of these methods is the tendency to overemphasize the temporal information. Since 3 D convolutional neural network(3 D CNN) is a powerful tool to simultaneously learn features from both spatial and temporal dimensions through capturing the correlations between three dimensional signals, this paper proposes a novel two-stream model using 3 D CNN. To our best knowledge, {{this is the first}} application of 3 D CNN in skeleton-based action recognition. Our method consists of three stages. First, skeleton joints are mapped into a <b>3</b> D <b>coordinate</b> <b>space</b> and then encoding the spatial and temporal information, respectively. Second, 3 D CNN models are seperately adopted to extract deep features from two streams. Third, to enhance the ability of deep features to capture global relationships, we extend every stream into multitemporal version. Extensive experiments on the SmartHome dataset and the large-scale NTU RGB-D dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms most of RNN-based methods, which verify the complementary property between spatial and temporal information and the robustness to noise.

40|$|The large-scale/long-time {{transport}} of inertial particles of arbitrary mass density under gravity is investigated {{by means of}} a formal multiple-scale perturbative expansion in the scale-separation parametre between the carrier flow and the particle concentration field. The resulting large-scale equation for the particle concentration is determined, and is found to be diffusive with a positive-definite eddy diffusivity. The calculation of the latter tensor is reduced to the resolution of an auxiliary differential problem, consisting of a coupled set of two differential equations in a (6 + 1) -dimensional <b>coordinate</b> system (<b>3</b> <b>space</b> <b>coordinates</b> plus <b>3</b> velocity <b>coordinates</b> plus time). Although expensive, numerical methods can be exploited to obtain the eddy diffusivity, for any desirable non-perturbative limit (e. g. arbitrary Stokes and Froude numbers). The aforementioned large-scale equation is then specialized to deal with two different relevant perturbative limits: i) vanishing of both Stokes time and sedimenting particle velocity; ii) vanishing Stokes time and finite sedimenting particle velocity. Both asymptotics lead to a greatly simplified auxiliary differential problem, now involving only <b>space</b> <b>coordinates</b> and thus easy to be tackled by standard numerical techniques. Explicit, exact expressions for the eddy diffusivities have been calculated, for both asymptotics, for the class of parallel flows, both static and time-dependent. This allows us to investigate analytically the role of gravity and inertia on the diffusion process by varying relevant features of the carrier flow, as e. g. the form of its temporal correlation function. Our results exclude a universal role played by gravity and inertia on the diffusive behaviour: regimes of both enhanced and reduced diffusion may exist, depending on the detailed structure of the carrier flow.

Similar to widely used general barcoding technology, the structural information of individual compounds is encoded as a specifics pattern of their C,H correlation signals. Software-based recognition of these patterns enables the structural identification of the compounds and their discrimination in mixtures. Using the triterpenes from various Actaea (syn. Cimicifuga) species as a test case, heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) barcodes were generated {{on the basis of}} their structural subtypes from a statistical investigation of their 3 ̆b 4 H and 3 ̆b 4 C data in the literature.

After dereplication, a differential analysis of heteronuclear single-quantum correlation (HSQC) spectra even allowed for the discovery of a new triterpene. The 2 D barcoding concept has potential application in a natural product discovery project, allowing for the rapid dereplication of known compounds and as a tool in the search for structural novelty within compound classes with established barcodes. 9 2014 American Chemical Society.
