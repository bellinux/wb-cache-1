30|$|Nowadays, the {{scaling down}} (known as ‘More Moore’) of devices {{is coming to}} an end.

The <b>3</b> <b>D</b> <b>integration</b> is based {{on the use of the}} semiconductor volume to connect both sides of a silicon wafer [1, 2].

40|$|In this thesis, {{we discuss}} <b>3</b> d- <b>3</b> <b>d</b> {{correspondence}} between Chern-Simons theory and three-dimensional N = 2 superconformal field theory. In the <b>3</b> d- <b>3</b> <b>d</b> correspondence proposed by Dimofte-Gaiotto-Gukov information of abelian flat connection in Chern-Simons theory was not captured. However, considering M-theory configuration giving the <b>3</b> d- <b>3</b> <b>d</b> correspondence and also other several developments, the abelian flat connection {{should be taken}} into account in <b>3</b> d- <b>3</b> <b>d</b> correspondence. With help of the homological knot invariants, we construct <b>3</b> <b>d</b> N = 2 theories on knot complement in 3 -sphere for several simple knots. Previous theories obtained by Dimofte-Gaiotto-Gukov can be obtained by Higgsing of the full theories. We also discuss the importance of all flat connections in the <b>3</b> d- <b>3</b> <b>d</b> correspondence by considering boundary conditions in <b>3</b> <b>d</b> N = 2 theories and 3 -manifold...|$|R
40|$|This paper studies various {{properties}} of amplitudes in <b>3</b> <b>d</b> super Yang Mills theory. First we explain how {{to obtain the}} amplitudes of <b>3</b> <b>d</b> super Yang Mills theories from 4 d super Yang Mills theories and obtain their helicity structure. Next, we use a <b>3</b> <b>d</b> BFCW recursion relation {{to show that the}} tree amplitudes and loop integrands of maximal <b>3</b> <b>d</b> super Yang Mills have dual conformal covariance (although not invariance, so that the amplitudes themselves are not dual conformal). Finally, we argue that the one-loop amplitudes of maximal <b>3</b> <b>d</b> super Yang-Mills can be reduced to scalar box diagrams and evaluate these diagrams using dimensional regularization. We find that the one-loop MHV amplitudes vanish and the one-loop non-MHV amplitudes are finite.

40|$|We study knots in <b>3</b> <b>d</b> Chern-Simons {{theory with}} complex gauge group SL(N,C), {{in the context}} of its {{relation}} with <b>3</b> <b>d</b> N= 2 theory (the so-called <b>3</b> d- <b>3</b> <b>d</b> correspondence). The defect has either co-dimension 2 or co-dimension 4 inside the 6 d (2, 0) theory, which is compactified on a 3 -manifold M̂. We identify such defects in various corners of the <b>3</b> d- <b>3</b> <b>d</b> correspondence, namely in <b>3</b> <b>d</b> SL(N,C) Chern-Simons theory, in <b>3</b> <b>d</b> N= 2 theory, in 5 d N= 2 super Yang-Mills theory, and in the M-theory holographic dual. We can make quantitative checks of the <b>3</b> d- <b>3</b> <b>d</b> correspondence by computing partition functions at each of these theories.
