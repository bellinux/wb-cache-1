50|$|In 2007, POV-Ray {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Moray, an interactive <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> program long used with POV-Ray. However, as of December 2016, Moray development is stalled.|$|E
5000|$|Free and {{open-source}} <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> {{programs like}} Blender, OpenSCAD, and FreeCAD are preferred <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> programs in general for the RepRap community but, virtually any CAD or 3D modeling {{program can be}} used with the RepRap, {{as long as it is}} capable of producing STL files.(slic3r also supports [...]obj and [...]amf files). Thus, content creators make use of any tools they are familiar with, whether they are commercial CAD programs, such as SolidWorks and Autodesk AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk 123D Design, Tinkercad, or SketchUp along with the libre software.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>3-d</b> <b>models</b> greatly {{assists in}} the {{construction}} of paper models, with video game models being the most prevalent source. The video game or source in question will have to be loaded into the computer. Various methods of extracting the model exist, including using a model viewer and exporting it into a workable file type, or capturing the model from the emulation directly. The methods of capturing the model is often unique to the subject and the tools available. Readability of file formats including propriety ones could mean that a model viewer and exporter is unavailable outside of the developer. Using other tools that capture rendered <b>3-d</b> <b>models</b> and textures are often the only way to obtain them. In this case, the designer may have to arrange the textures and the wire frame model on a 3D program, such as 3DS MAX, Metasequoia, or Blender before exporting it to a papercraft creating program, such as Dunreeb Cutout or Pepakura Designer by Tama software. From there the model is typically refined to give a proper layout and construction tabs that will affect the overall appearance and difficulty in constructing the model.|$|R
5000|$|The {{developers}} {{describe the}} game's genre as [...] "RTS vs. RPG" [...] - [...] the game {{can be played}} as an action role-playing game with a solo hero unit or as a traditional base-building real-time strategy game. The game engine uses a 3-D world map with 2-D unit sprites, although larger units and the heroes are fully <b>3-d</b> <b>models.</b> The small units are sprites to save processing power as there can be upwards of several hundred present in large battles. Heroes of Annihilated Empires features four playable races and twelve neutral races. The game supports up to 7 players via LAN or Internet.|$|R
2500|$|The second {{approach}} is to embed the higher-dimensional objects in three-dimensional space, using methods analogous {{to the ways in}} which three-dimensional objects are drawn on the plane. For example, the fold out nets mentioned in the previous section have higher-dimensional equivalents. Some of these may be viewed at [...] One might even imagine building a model of this fold-out net, as one draws a polyhedron's fold-out net on a piece of paper. Sadly, we could never do the necessary folding of the 3-dimensional structure to obtain the 4-dimensional polytope because of the constraints of the physical universe. Another way to [...] "draw" [...] the higher-dimensional shapes in 3 dimensions is via some kind of projection, for example, the analogue of either orthographic or perspective projection. Coxeter's famous book on polytopes (Coxeter, 1948) has some examples of such orthographic projections. Other examples may be found on the web (see for example [...] ). Note that immersing even 4-dimensional polychora directly into two dimensions is quite confusing. Easier to understand are <b>3-d</b> <b>models</b> of the projections. Such models are occasionally found in science museums or mathematics departments of universities (such as that of the Université Libre de Bruxelles).|$|R
50|$|Rutherford + Chekene began {{implementing}} <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> {{to produce}} building information models (BIM) in 2005. R+C has developed more than $3 billion in construction using BIM created with Revit, Tekla and other software.|$|E
50|$|With CADDS4 Tailored {{packages}} {{were available}} for CAD drafting, CAM (computer-aided manufacturing), <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling,</b> piping and plant design, printed circuit board layout, instrument panel design, and many other applications. During this period, they {{also contributed to the}} development of the IGES standard for CAD/CAM data exchange, along with Applicon and other competitors.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Tom Chandler, a <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> {{specialist}} from Monash University in Melbourne {{was invited}} to Norton as a senior visiting fellow. The aim of the fellowship was to introduce architecture and science students to specialised animation and modeling techniques {{and allow them to}} learn to digitally render their own heritage using 3-D techniques.|$|E
5000|$|The first NSU {{cars were}} the single {{cylinder}} 3-wheeled Sulmobil, first produced in 1905. At {{the same time}} NSU produced the NSU-Pipe 34 PS and NSU-Pipe 50 PS under licence from the Belgian firm of Pipe. Two further Pipe models were to follow, {{and a range of}} NSU-specific <b>3-</b> and 4-wheeled <b>models.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another MVF protein, MurJ, {{functions}} as a peptidoglycan biosynthesis protein. [...] A <b>3-d</b> structureal <b>model</b> shows that MurJ contains a solvent-exposed cavity within {{the plane of the}} membrane. MurJ has 14 TMSs, and specific charged residues localized in the central cavity are essential for function. This structural homology model suggests that MurJ {{functions as}} an essential transporter in PG biosynthesis. Based on an in vivo assay, MurJ acts as a flippase for the lipid-linked cell wall precursor, polyisoprenoid-linked disaccharide-peptapeptide. There is controversy about the role of this porter and FtsW/RodA which on the basis of an in vitro assay, were thought to be flippases for the same intermediate.|$|R
50|$|William Latham (born 1961) is a British {{computer}} artist, most {{known as}} {{the creator of the}} Organic Art product as well as for creating album covers and artwork for the dance group The Shamen. Latham is the founder of the company Computer Artworks which released the Organic Art product through Time Warner Interactive. Latham has authored a book called Evolutionary Art and Computers together with Stephen Todd, published 1992, based on their work at the IBM(UK) Scientific Centre in Winchester, generating <b>3-d</b> computer <b>models</b> or organic life forms, using genetic algorithm based techniques to mutate base forms into artistic creations. Since 2007, Latham has been Professor of Computing at Goldsmiths, University of London.|$|R
50|$|Structural {{control on}} vein {{mineralization}} {{has long been}} recognized in the Coeur d’Alene District. However, using these observations in developing predictive exploration models has proven difficult. With the advent of <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> software the integration of structure, stratigraphy and geochemistry into a three-dimensional model for use in exploration has been facilitated and is being carried out at Coeur Silver Valley.|$|E
50|$|Phyo {{attended}} Ewha and Yonsei Universities {{and studied}} international business, graduating in 1987 and 1989, respectively. She then graduated from Cornell University with a dual bachelor's in human ecology design and business management, and a minor in nutritional sciences in 1990. She then did some post-graduate work in social psychology, <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> and simulation, computer art, fine art and sculpting at SUNY Buffalo, finishing in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Weber Institute {{is divided}} into three academies technology, which consist of classes like webpage design, drafting, digital arts, ditigal graphics, photography, multimedia, <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling,</b> and more {{recently}} video game design. Health has like courses like health class and biology. Automobile deals with cars, repairing them or modefing them. In addition to these academies, Weber also has the freshman academy in which freshman take general courses before choosing any of the previous academy.|$|E
5000|$|Large outboards {{are usually}} {{bolted to the}} transom (or to a bracket bolted to the transom), and are linked to {{controls}} at the helm. These range from 2-, <b>3-</b> and 4-cylinder <b>models</b> generating 15 to 135 horsepower suitable for hulls up to 17 ft in length, to powerful V6 and V8 cylinder blocks rated up to [...], with sufficient power to be used on boats of 37 ft or longer.|$|R
50|$|Under the Voluntary Agreement, {{participating}} {{retailers and}} suppliers will voluntarily commit to achieving targets set {{out by the}} NEA, including retiring stock of energy inefficient models and introducing more <b>3-</b> and 4-tick <b>models,</b> so that energy efficient models form at least 50% of their model range after six months, and 60% of their model range after one year. Signatories also voluntarily commit to promote energy efficient appliances, as well as improve the availability and affordability of energy efficient appliances available in their stores.|$|R
50|$|Henry Dietrich Fernandez (1950-2009) was a Senior Lecturer in the Departments of Architecture and Interior Architecture for the Rhode Island School of Design. Fernandez {{received}} his BA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1973, and {{nine years later}} his M.Arch from Harvard University in 1982 and his Ph.D. from University of Cambridge in 2003. He served as faculty at Tufts University, University of Cambridge, Harvard’s GSD, and the Warburg Institute in London and joined the RISD Architecture faculty in 1992 and Interior Architecture faculty in 1998. After that time he taught a variety of architectural history courses. An inveterate traveler, Dr. Fernandez led several Wintersession travel courses and served as coordinator of 2008 RISD’s Summer Studio in Denmark. He was the recipient of numerous grants and awards including a Samuel Kress Research and Teaching Fellowship, RISD Professional Development Fund grant, and a Getty Foundation Grant. He received a Scott Opler Foundation grant in 2003 for his “Reconstructing Renaissance Rome” project in which he {{and a team of}} RISD alumni used <b>3-d</b> computer <b>modeling</b> and animation to recreate pre-Renaissance structures adjacent to the Vatican which had been leveled {{during the course of a}} 1930s Fascist urban renewal project. Although an ebullient expert on Vatican politics and its influence on design history, Fernandez researched and taught subjects ranging from Derrida to Alvar Aalto. Dr. Fernandez died on September 2, 2009. He is survived by his wife Dr. Caroline P. Murphy.|$|R
50|$|In Saturn's Rings {{is a large}} format {{movie about}} Saturn made {{exclusively}} from real photographs taken by spacecraft. Director Stephen van Vuuren used more than 7.5 million photographs and numerous film techniques to create the effect of flying through space around Saturn and among its rings. CGI and <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> were not used in any capacity to create the realistic feel van Vuuren wanted for the viewer's experience. Most of the photos were taken by various major space missions.|$|E
50|$|King is {{interested}} in and inspired by ancient cultures’ use of light in architecture and monuments, particularly how light and mathematics were used to further understand planetary movement and the Earth’s relation to the larger universe. King brings a futuristic aesthetic to these timeless pursuits, creating high-tech, tensile structures designed and engineered using state-of-the-art <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> software, all {{to interact with the}} Sun much in the same way artists and astronomers have for thousands of years.|$|E
50|$|The {{office has}} been trying to change the usual design {{paradigm}} since its foundation. The office tries to develop a radical design truth a realistic approach. Their Ideal is to work with complex shapes coming out of a complex process in which the architects mix different mediums such as models, <b>3-d</b> <b>modeling,</b> parametric tools, sketches and drawings in order to create an unexpected design. The philosophy of the office can be summarised with their 1980s manifesto “Architecture must blaze:”.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{proposed}} methods {{to detect the}} body gesture. Some literature differentiates 2 different approaches in gesture recognition: a 3D model based and an appearance-based. The foremost method makes use of 3D information of key elements of the body parts {{in order to obtain}} several important parameters, like palm position or joint angles. On the other hand, Appearance-based systems use images or videos to for direct interpretation. Hand gestures have been a common focus of body gesture detection, apparentness methods and <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> methods are traditionally used.|$|E
5000|$|Today, manual {{drafting}} {{has been}} largely replaced by computer-aided drafting (CAD). A steel detailer using computer-aided methods creates his drawings on a computer, using software specifically designed for the purpose, and printing out his drawings on paper only when they are complete. Many detailers would add another classification for those using <b>3-D</b> <b>Modeling</b> applications specifically designed for steel detailing, as the process {{for the production of}} drawings using these applications is markedly different from a 2-D drafting approach. The detailer literally builds the project in 3D before producing detailed shop drawings from the model.|$|E
5000|$|Doyle is {{currently}} an instructor and {{co-chair of the}} Digital Arts Department at Berkeley City College. In 2010 then Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates and the Berkeley City Council recognized Doyle and the Berkeley City College’s Digital Arts Club (DAC) for [...] "its talent, creativity, and its many years of artistic contributions to Bay Area galleries and exhibits.". His most recent work delves {{into the realm of}} both 3-D realism and 3-D non-objective abstraction. In 2017 he released a new series titled [...] "New Abstracts" [...] employing the use of <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> and color fields to create an illusion of 3-dimensional space.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, {{began working}} for Direct to Brain, {{one of the}} leading 3-D video {{production}} studios in Europe, doing character design, storyboarding, scene design, graphic design and artistic supervision of <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling.</b> Among his clients included hip hop/reggae group 99 Posse’s “Stop the Train” (for BGM Records), “Kitchen Tools” for Virgin Records, and “Per me per sempre” (“For Me Always”) for BGM. In November and December that year, Bianchi did work for Fantasy Flight Games’s role-playing game Dragonstar. He also painted a poster for the Scuola Internazionale di Comics in Florence, illustrated Vision Divine’s album Send Me an Angel, and taught a second illustration course at the Accademia di Belle Arti in Carrara.|$|E
50|$|Product {{visualization}} involves visualization {{software technology}} for the viewing and manipulation of 3D models, technical drawing and other related documentation of manufactured components and large assemblies of products. It is {{a key part of}} product lifecycle management. Product visualization software typically provides high levels of photorealism so that a product can be viewed before it is actually manufactured. This supports functions ranging from design and styling to sales and marketing. Technical visualization is an important aspect of product development. Originally technical drawings were made by hand, but with the rise of advanced computer graphics the drawing board has been replaced by computer-aided design (CAD). CAD-drawings and models have several advantages over hand-made drawings such as the possibility of <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling,</b> rapid prototyping, and simulation.|$|E
50|$|Specialized {{software}} {{may be used}} {{to combine}} traditional medium effects and photorealistic effects. <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> software may be exclusively for, include features for, or include the option of 3rd party plugins for rendering 3-D models with 2-D effects (e.g. cartoons, illustrations) for hyperrealistic effects. Other 2-D image editing software {{may be used to}} trace photographs or rotoscope animations from film. This allows artists to rapidly apply unique styles to what would be purely photorealistic images from computer generated imagery from 3-D models or photographs. Some styles of hyperrealism may require motion visual effects (e.g. geometrically accurate rotation, accurate kinetics, simulated organic growth, lifelike motion constraints) to notice the realism of the imagery. Software may be used {{to bridge the gap between}} the imagination and the laws of physics.|$|E
50|$|Engaging {{in solar}} and heliospheric science, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) mission is {{intended}} to study of the solar atmosphere, and in particular, of the interface between the photosphere and corona. The IRIS mission will accomplish this by tracing the flow of energy and plasma through the chromosphere and transition region into the corona using spectrometry and imaging. IRIS {{is designed to provide}} significant new information to increase the understanding of energy transport into the corona and solar wind and provide an archetype for all stellar atmospheres. The unique instrument capabilities, coupled with state of the art <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling,</b> will fill a large gap in our knowledge of this dynamic region of the solar atmosphere. The mission will extend the scientific output of existing heliophysics spacecraft that follow the effects of energy release processes from the sun to Earth. The IRIS mission launched June 27, 2013.|$|E
50|$|In {{the area}} of 3-D modelling, Dr. Huang has worked on the {{identification}} of three-dimensional motion {{and the structure of}} rigid objects given multiple images in which corresponding features can be identified. This work has been important for the compression of television images, for the development of image standards, and for research into human and computer vision. Dr. Huang has also worked on the <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling,</b> analysis, and synthesis of images of the human face, hands, and body. The initial motivation behind this research was to support low bitrate 3-D model-based video coding for video phone and teleconferencing. The idea was that if a 3-D model of the user could be transmitted and reconstructed at the receiving end, it would then be sufficient to extract and send movement information to drive the 3-D model and regenerate the video sequence. Tools developed for this type of scenarios are applicable to many other problems as well, including virtual space conferencing with avatars, and electronic games.|$|E
5000|$|Murata's {{digitally}} animated kinetic sculpture [...] "Melter 3-D" [...] captivated {{visitors to}} the Frieze New York Art Fair in May 2014. As reported in the New York Times, For technical magic, nothing beats Takeshi Murata's [...] "Melter 3-D." [...] In a room lit by flickering strobes, a revolving, beachball-size sphere seems made of mercury. A hypnotic wonder, {{it appears to be}} constantly melting into flowing ripples." [...] Murata created this illusion by projecting digital animation onto a rotating sphere, with the spinning of the sphere synchronized with the blinking of a strobe light. This makes it a form of 3D-zoetrope. According to Liz Stinson, writing in Wired:Murata was able to take the same principles used centuries ago to create repeating zoetrope animations, and add some high-tech gloss. He started by designing the object on his computer with <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> software. The looping melting effect you see is the result of syncing the spinning of the sphere with the blinking of the strobe. [...] "It's the same concept as old cylindrical zoetropes, where you look through the slits to see the animation," [...] says Murata. [...] "But in a 3-D zoetrope, the slits are replaced with strobe lights, and drawings or photographs can become objects." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{organizing}} {{committee for the}} 2009 championships in Liberec met in Oslo with the {{organizing committee}} of the 2011 championships on 20 April 2009 to discuss lessons learned. In the presentation was a comprehensive and frank analysis of the critical areas of Liberec's organization. Key success factors were detailed and lessons learned were elaborated, including several recommendations to both the 2011 championships and the organizing committee for the 2013 championships in Val di Fiemme, Italy. Besides the 2009, 2011 and 2013 organizing committees in attendance, other attendees included the Norwegian Ski Federation, the European Broadcasting Union television, FIS, and the APF marketing partners. At a coordination group meeting in Oslo on 3-4 September 2009, construction progress was shown on the ski jumps at Holmenkollen and Midstuen along with the renovations for the cross-country stadium and tracks. Given current construction, the organizing committee states that World Cup events will go as planned for March 2010 to serve as test events for the 2011 championships. As of September 2009, the organizing committee employed 20 people while host broadcaster NRK are taking advantange of the <b>3-D</b> <b>modeling</b> for perfect camera angles for the event that {{will take place in}} February-March 2011. On 23 December 2009, the organizing committee announced that Statoil, an energy company based in Stavanger, will be joining Aker Solutions, Intersport, and Swedish-based Craft as a sponsor to the championships.|$|E
