25|$|It turns out, however, {{that only}} one of the four classes of {{solutions}} can be realized in practice. Given a pair of corresponding image coordinates, three of the solutions will always produce a <b>3D</b> <b>point</b> which lies behind {{at least one of the}} two cameras and therefore cannot be seen. Only one of the four classes will consistently produce 3D points which are in front of both cameras. This must then be the correct solution. Still, however, it has an undetermined positive scaling related to the translation component.|$|E

50|$|In practice, {{however, the}} {{coordinates}} of image points cannot be measured with arbitrary accuracy. Instead, {{various types of}} noise, such as geometric noise from lens distortion or interest point detection error, lead to inaccuracies in the measured image coordinates. As a consequence, the lines generated by the corresponding image points do not always intersect in 3D space. The problem, then, {{is to find a}} <b>3D</b> <b>point</b> which optimally fits the measured image points. In the literature there are multiple proposals for how to define optimality and how to find the optimal <b>3D</b> <b>point.</b> Since they are based on different optimality criteria, the various methods produce different estimates of the <b>3D</b> <b>point</b> x when noise is involved.|$|E
