40|$|C-reactive protein (CRP), was {{recently}} {{reported to be}} closely associated with poor renal function in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), but whether CRP is pathogenic or a mere biomarker in AKI remains largely unclear. Impaired autophagy is known to exacerbate renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). We examined whether the pathogenic role of CRP in AKI is associated with reduction of autophagy. We mated transgenic rabbit CRP over-expressing mice (Tg-CRP) with two autophagy reporter <b>mouse</b> lines, Tg-GFP-LC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> (LC <b>3)</b> and Tg-RFP-GFP-LC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> (RG-LC <b>3)</b> respectively to generate Tg-CRP-GFP-LC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> (PLC <b>3)</b> and Tg-CRP-RFP-GFP-LC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> (PRG-LC <b>3).</b> AKI was induced by IRI. Compared with LC <b>3</b> <b>mice,</b> PLC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> developed more severe kidney damage after IRI. Renal tubules were isolated from LC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> at baseline for primary culture. OKP cells were transiently transfected with GFP-LC 3 plasmid. CRP addition exacerbated lactate dehydrogenase release from both cell types. Immunoblots showed lower LC- 3 II/I ratios {{and higher levels of}} p 62, markers of reduced autophagy flux, in the kidneys of PLC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> compared to LC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> after IRI, and in primary cultured renal tubules and OKP cells treated with CRP and H 2 O 2 compared to H 2 O 2 alone. Immunohistochemistry showed much fewer LC- 3 punctae, and electron microscopy showed fewer autophagosomes in kidneys of PLC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> compared to LC <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> after IRI. Similarly, CRP addition reduced GFP-LC 3 punctae induced by H 2 O 2 in primary cultured proximal tubules and in GFP-LC 3 plasmid transfected OKP cells. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, rescued impaired autophagy and reduced renal injury in vivo. In summary, it was suggested that CRP be more than mere biomarker in AKI, and render the kidney more susceptible to ischemic/oxidative injury, which is associated with down-regulating autophagy flux...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a profound lack of habituation in 129 P <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> compared to the habituating, but initially more anxious, BALB/c mice. The present study investigated whether this non-adaptive phenotype of 129 P <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> is primarily based on anxiety-related characteristics. Methods To test this hypothesis and extend our knowledge on the behavioural profile of 129 P <b>3</b> <b>mice,</b> {{the effects of the}} anxiolyticdiazepam (1, 3 and 5 [*]mg/kg) and the putative anxiolytic metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu 5 R) antagonist 2 -methyl- 6 -(phenylethynyl) pyridine (MPEP, 3, 10 and 30 [*]mg/kg) treatment on within-trial (intrasession) habituation, object recognition (diazepam: 1 [*]mg/kg; MPEP 10 [*]mg/kg) and on the central-nervous expression of the immediate early gene c-Fos (diazepam: 1 [*]mg/kg; MPEP 10 [*]mg/kg) were investigated. Results Behavioural findings validated the initially high, but habituating phenotype of BALB/c mice, while 129 P <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> were characterized by impaired intrasession habituation. Diazepam had an anxiolytic effect in BALB/c mice, while in higher doses caused behavioural inactivity in 129 P <b>3</b> <b>mice.</b> MPEP revealed almost no anxiolytic effects on behaviour in both strains, but reduced stress-induced corticosterone responses only in 129 P <b>3</b> <b>mice.</b> These results were complemented by reduced expression of c-Fos after MPEP treatment in brain areas related to emotional processes, and increased c-Fos expression in higher integrating brain areas such as the prelimbic cortex compared to vehicle-treated 129 P <b>3</b> <b>mice.</b> Conclusions These results suggest that the strain differences observed in (non) adaptive anxiety behaviour are at least in part mediated by differences in gamma-aminobutyric acid- A and mGluR 5 mediated transmission. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Caspase- 3 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{downstream}} enzymes activated in the apoptotic pathway. In caspase- <b>3</b> deficient <b>mice,</b> loss of cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion cells coincide closely with hearing loss. In contrast with the auditory system, details of the vestibular phenotype have not been characterized. Here we report the vestibular phenotype and inner ear anatomy in the caspase- 3 deficient (Casp <b>3</b> -/-) <b>mouse</b> strain. Results Average ABR thresholds of Casp <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice</b> were significantly elevated (P Casp <b>3</b> +/- <b>mice</b> and Casp <b>3</b> +/+ <b>mice</b> at <b>3</b> months of age. In DPOAE testing, distortion product 2 F 1 -F 2 was significantly decreased (P Casp <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice,</b> whereas Casp <b>3</b> +/- and Casp <b>3</b> +/+ <b>mice</b> showed normal and comparable values to each other. Casp <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice</b> were hyperactive and exhibited circling behavior when excited. In lateral canal VOR testing, Casp <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice</b> had minimal response to any of the stimuli tested, whereas Casp <b>3</b> +/- <b>mice</b> had an intermediate response compared to Casp <b>3</b> +/+ <b>mice.</b> Inner ear anatomical and histological analysis revealed gross hypomorphism of the vestibular organs, in which the main site was the anterior semicircular canal. Hair cell numbers in the anterior- and lateral crista, and utricle were significantly smaller in Casp <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice</b> whereas the Casp 3 +/- and Casp <b>3</b> +/+ <b>mice</b> had normal hair cell numbers. Conclusions These results indicate that caspase- 3 is essential for correct functioning of the cochlea as well as normal development and function of the vestibule. </p...|$|R

40|$|Frontotemporal {{dementia}} (FTD) {{is characterized}} by cognitive and behavioral changes and, in a significant subset of patients, Parkinsonism. Histopathologically, FTD frequently presents with tau-containing lesions, which in familial cases result from mutations in the MAPT gene encoding tau. Here we present a novel transgenic <b>mouse</b> strain (K <b>3)</b> that expresses human tau carrying the FTD mutation K 369 I. K <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> develop a progressive histopathology that is reminiscent of that in human FTD with the K 369 I mutation. In addition, K <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> show early-onset memory impairment and amyotrophy {{in the absence of}} overt neurodegeneration. Different from our previously generated tau transgenic strains, the K <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> express the transgene in the substantia nigra (SN) and show an early-onset motor phenotype that reproduces Parkinsonism with tremor, bradykinesia, abnormal gait, and postural instability. Interestingly, motor performance of young, but not old, K <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> improves upon L-dopa treatment, which bears similarities to Parkinsonism in FTD. The early-onset symptoms in the K <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> are mechanistically related to selectively impaired anterograde axonal transport of distinct cargos, which precedes the loss of dopaminergic SN neurons that occurs in aged mice. The impaired axonal transport in SN neurons affects, among others, vesicles containing the dopamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. Distinct modes of transport are also impaired in sciatic nerves, which may explain amyotrophy. Together, the K <b>3</b> <b>mice</b> are a unique model of FTD-associated Parkinsonism, with pathomechanistic implications for the human pathologic process...|$|R

Although salivary agglutinin titers were only slightly greater in C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice</b> than those of C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice,</b> serum agglutinin titers and immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels were consistently higher (two- to fourfold) in C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice.</b> The appearance of anti-horse erythrocyte plaque-forming cell responses in spleens of immunized animals was followed {{by an increase in}} salivary anti-horse erythrocyte agglutinin activity. Peak levels of both responses were attained after approximately 3 weeks of immunization. Differences in immune responsiveness between C <b>3</b> H <b>mouse</b> strains were also evident at the cellular level since splenic IgA anti-horse erythrocyte plaque-forming cell responses in fed C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice</b> were twofold higher than those in similarly treated C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice.</b> This higher response pattern was also observed when C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice</b> manifested threefold higher splenic IgM and IgA plaque-forming cell responses to intragastrically administered sheep erythrocytes.

These results have set the basis for the identification of a low molecular weight PTX 3 -derived molecule that recapitulates the FGF-trap activities of PTX 3 and exhibits promising therapeutic potential for FGF-dependent tumors...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} a potential role of stromelysin- 1 (MMP- 3) in development of adipose tissue, 5 week old male MMP- <b>3</b> deficient <b>mice</b> (MMP- <b>3</b> (-/-)) and wild-type (MMP- 3 (+/+)) controls were kept {{on a high}} fat diet (HFD) for 15 weeks. MMP- <b>3</b> (-/-) <b>mice</b> were hyperphagic and gained more weight than the MMP- <b>3</b> (+/+) <b>mice.</b> At the time of sacrifice, the body weight of the MMP- <b>3</b> (-/-) <b>mice</b> {{was significantly higher than}} that of the MMP- <b>3</b> (+/+) <b>mice,</b> as was the weight of the isolated subcutaneous (SC) and gonadal (GON) fat deposits. Significant adipocyte hypertrophy was observed in the GON but not in the SC adipose tissue of MMP- <b>3</b> (-/-) <b>mice.</b> Fasting plasma glucose and cholesterol levels were comparable in both genotypes, whereas triglyceride levels were significantly lower in MMP- <b>3</b> (-/-) <b>mice.</b> Staining with an endothelial cell specific lectin revealed a significantly higher blood vessel density and larger total stained area in the GON adipose tissues of MMP- <b>3</b> (-/-) <b>mice.</b> Thus, in a murine model of nutritionally induced obesity, MMP- 3 impairs adipose tissue development, possibly by affecting food intake and/or adipose tissue-related angiogenesis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{difference}} in the interaction of two kinds of liver non-parenchymal cells (NPC), i. e., NPC isolated from endotoxin sensitive C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mouse</b> and endotoxin resistant C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mouse,</b> and liver parenchymal cells (PC) under the existence of endotoxin. PC and NPC were isolated from each mouse. By the co-culturing of PC with NPC, the change in 3 H-leucine incorporation into PC was studied in the presence or absence of endotoxin. In addition, the effect of tumor necrosis factor α(TNF-α), interleukin 1 β(IL- 1 β) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6), on 3 H-leucine incorporation into PC was studied. The results are summarized as follows; 1. When PC isolated from C 3 H/HeN or C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mouse</b> was co-cultured with C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mouse</b> NPC, <b>3</b> H-leucine incorporation into each strain PC increased in the absence of endotoxin and decreased in the prsence of endotoxin. 2. When PC isolated from C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mouse</b> or C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mouse</b> was cocultured with C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mouse</b> NPC, no change was detected in 3 H-leucine incorporation into each strain PC with or without endotoxin. 3. When the supernatant obtained from the culture media of C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mouse</b> NPC with endotoxin was added to PC of C 3 H/HeN or C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mouse,</b> <b>3</b> H-leucine incorporation into each strain PC was decreased. The result seemed to be almost the same as the results when co-cultured with C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mouse</b> NPC. 4. With the addition of TNF-α to the media, the result in 3 H-leucine incorporation into PC was similar that in control. These incorporation increased by the addition of IL- 1 β, and decreased by the addition of IL- 6. These results suggest that the supernatant, induced by the reaction with C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mouse</b> NPC and endotoxin, decreased 3 H-leucine incoporation into PC. The result in the same experiment with C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mouse</b> NPC suggested the deficiency of these effect in C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mouse.</b> Of the three wellknown cytokines, the decrease of 3 H-leucine incorporation into PC was observed only in addition of IL- 6...|$|R
40|$|Klebsiella pneumoniae {{has been}} {{isolated}} from liver abscesses {{in patients with}} leukaemia or diabetes. The resistance of Klebsiella infection in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -hyporesponsive mice is unclear. Female C 3 H/HeJ and C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice,</b> 6 – 8 weeks old, were intraperitoneally (i. p.) injected with K. pneumoniae. The results showed that C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice</b> were 24 times more susceptible [lethal dose 50 % (LD 50) 250 colony-forming units] than C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice</b> to K. pneumoniae infection. C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice,</b> uninfected or infected with K. pneumoniae, had higher liver interleukin (IL) - 10 levels and IL- 10 mRNA levels than C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice.</b> Previously, pretreatment with IL- 1 β and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) protected C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice</b> from lethal bacterial infection. Therefore the effects of pretreatment with IL- 1 β and TNF-α or antimurine IL- 10 antibody i. p. 1 hr before this infection in both strains of C <b>3</b> H <b>mice</b> were examined. Pretreatment with TNF-α or anti-IL- 10 antibody enhanced the survival of both strains of mice. TNF-α, in combination with IL- 1 β, enhanced the survival and bacterial clearance better than single pretreatment in C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice.</b> Anti-IL- 10 antibody increased bacterial clearance and significantly reduced liver cytokine mRNA levels in C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice</b> more {{than it did in}} the controls during infection.

40|$|The role of cholesteryl ester {{transfer}} protein (CETP) in {{the development}} of atherosclerosis is still undergoing debate. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of human CETP expression on atherosclerosis in APOE* 3 -Leiden (E <b>3</b> L) <b>mice</b> with a humanized lipoprotein profile. E <b>3</b> L <b>mice</b> were crossbred with human CETP transgenic mice. On a chow diet, CETP expression increased plasma total cholesterol (TC) (+ 43 %; P < 0. 05). To evaluate the effects of CETP on the development of atherosclerosis, mice were fed a Western-type diet containing 0. 25 % cholesterol, leading to 4. 3 -fold elevated TC levels in both E 3 L and CETP. E <b>3</b> L <b>mice</b> (P < 0. 01). On both diets, CETP expression shifted the distribution of cholesterol from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) toward very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) /low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Moreover, plasma of CETP. E <b>3</b> L <b>mice</b> had reduced capacity (- 39 %; P < 0. 05) to induce SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux from Fu 5 AH cells than plasma of E <b>3</b> L <b>mice.</b> After 19 weeks on the Western-type diet, CETP. E <b>3</b> L <b>mice</b> showed a 7. 0 -fold increased atherosclerotic lesion area in the aortic root compared with E <b>3</b> L <b>mice</b> (P < 0. 0001). CETP expression in E <b>3</b> L <b>mice</b> shifts the distribution of cholesterol from HDL to VLDL/LDL, reduces plasma-mediated SR-BI-dependent cholesterol efflux, and represents a clear pro-atherogenic factor in E <b>3</b> L <b>mice.</b> We anticipate that the CETP.

40|$|The steroid {{receptor}} coactivator- 3 (SRC- 3), {{also known}} as AIB 1, ACTR, p/CIP and NCOA 3, is a transcriptional coactivator for nuclear receptors and certain other transcription factors. SRC- 3 is widely expressed and plays important physiological functions and pathogenic roles in breast and prostate cancers. SRC- 3 knockout (SRC- <b>3</b> -/-) <b>mice</b> display genetic background-dependent embryonic lethality and multiple local and systemic abnormalities. Since both the partial lethality and the systemic effects caused by global SRC- 3 knockout interfere with downstream investigation of tissue-specific function of SRC- 3, we have generated floxed SRC- 3 (SRC- <b>3</b> f/f) <b>mice</b> with conditional alleles carrying loxP sites in introns 10 and 12 by a gene-targeting strategy. The two SRC- <b>3</b> f/f <b>mouse</b> lines (A and B) are indistinguishable from wild type mice. To test if deletion of the floxed exons 11 and 12 for SRC- 3 nuclear receptor interaction domains and disruption of its downstream sequence for transcriptional activation domains would inactivate SRC- 3 function, SRC- <b>3</b> f/f <b>mice</b> were crossbred with EIIa-Cre mice to generate SRC- <b>3</b> d/d <b>mice</b> with germ line deletion of the floxed SRC- 3 gene. Both lines of SRC- <b>3</b> d/d <b>mice</b> exhibited growth retardation and low IGF-I levels, which {{was similar to that}} observed in SRC- <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice.</b> The line A SRC- <b>3</b> d/d <b>mice</b> showed normal viability, while line B SRC- <b>3</b> d/d <b>mice</b> showed partial lethality similar to SRC- <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice,</b> probably due to variable distributions of genetic background during breeding.

40|$|The {{difference}} in susceptibility to {{urinary tract infection}} between C 3 H/HeJ and C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice</b> was tested for with gram-negative strains differing in lipopolysaccharide composition. Recently, impaired clearance of Escherichia coli from the kidney of C 3 H/HeJ compared to C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice</b> was shown to be correlated with the LPS low responsiveness. In this study, a {{difference in}} clearance from the kidneys of C 3 H/HeJ and C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice</b> was found only with lipopolysaccharide-containing bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria, e. g., Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Streptococcus agalactiae, were recovered in essentially equal numbers from the kidneys of mice of both strains. In contrast, of the lipopolysaccharide-containing strains used, all persisted in higher numbers in the kidneys of C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice</b> than in the kidneys of C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice.</b> Variations in the O side chain did not eliminate this difference. E. coli Hu 734 O 75 +K 5 + and the rfb- mutant O 75 -K 5 + remained in similar numbers in C <b>3</b> H/HeJ <b>mice,</b> although O 75 -K 5 + was eliminated more rapidly in C <b>3</b> H/HeN <b>mice.</b> The core structure {{did not affect the}} differential persistence in the two mouse strains.

The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the effects of the absence or constitutive physiological overexpression of UCP 3 on whole body energy metabolism, glucose tolerance and muscle triglyceride content. Congenic male UCP 3 -/-, wildtype, and UCP <b>3</b> tg overexpressor <b>mice</b> were fed a 10 % fat diet for 4 or 8 months following weaning. UCP <b>3</b> tg <b>mice</b> had lower body weights and were less metabolically efficient than wildtype or UCP <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice,</b> but were not hyperphagic. UCP <b>3</b> tg <b>mice</b> had smaller epididymal white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue (BAT) depots, however there were no differences in muscle weights. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests revealed that both UCP 3 tg and UCP <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice</b> were protected from development of impaired glucose tolerance and were more sensitive to insulin. 2 -deoxy-D-[1 - 3 H]-glucose tracer studies showed increased uptake of glucose into BAT and increased storage of liver glycogen in UCP <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice.</b> Assessments of intramuscular triglyceride (IMTG) revealed decreases in quadriceps of UCP <b>3</b> tg <b>mice</b> compared to wildtype and UCP <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice.</b> When challenged with a 45 % fat diet, UCP <b>3</b> -/- <b>mice</b> showed increased accumulation of IMTG compared to wildtype mice, which in turn had greater IMTG than UCP <b>3</b> tg <b>mice.</b> Results are consistent with a role for UCP 3 in preventing accumulation of triglyceride in both adipose tissue and muscle...|$|R
