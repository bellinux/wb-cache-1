2500|$|In radio, multiple-input and multiple-output, or MIMO (pronounced [...] or [...] ), is {{a method}} for {{multiplying}} the capacity of a radio link using multiple transmit and receive antennas to exploit multipath propagation. MIMO has become {{an essential element of}} wireless communication standards including IEEE 802.11n (Wi-Fi), IEEE 802.11ac (Wi-Fi), HSPA+ (3G), WiMAX (4G), and Long Term Evolution (4G). More recently, MIMO has been applied to power-line communication for <b>3-wire</b> installations as part of ITU G.hn standard and HomePlug AV2 specification.|$|E
2500|$|For {{three-phase}} at utilization voltages a {{four-wire system}} {{is often used}}. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (<b>3-wire)</b> primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used {{so there is no}} need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as [...] "two phase". A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110V between the two conductors for running the tools.|$|E
2500|$|Conical {{micrometer}} anvils, specifically {{suited to}} {{resting on the}} sides of the thread, are made for various thread angles, with 60° being the most common. Mics with such anvils are usually called [...] "thread mics" [...] or [...] "pitch mics" [...] (because they directly measure the pitch diameter). Users who lack thread mics rely instead on the [...] "3-wire method", which involves placing 3 short pieces of wire (or gauge pins) of known diameter into the valleys of the thread and then measuring from wire to wire with standard (flat) anvils. A conversion factor (produced by a straightforward trigonometric calculation) is then multiplied with the measured value to infer a measurement of the thread's pitch diameter. Tables of these conversion factors were established many decades ago for all standard thread sizes, so today a user need only take the measurement and then perform the table lookup (as opposed to recalculating each time). The <b>3-wire</b> method is also used when high precision is needed to inspect a specific diameter, commonly the pitch diameter, or on specialty threads such as multi-start or when the thread angle is not 60°. [...] Ball-shaped micrometer anvils can be used in similar fashion (same trigonometric relationship, less cumbersome to use). Digital calipers and micrometers can send each measurement (data point) as it occurs to storage or software through an interface (such as USB or RS-232), in which case the table lookup is done in an automated way, and quality assurance and quality control can be achieved using statistical process control.|$|E

50|$|A {{polyphase}} system must provide a defined direction of phase rotation, so mirror image voltages do not count towards the phase order. A <b>3-wire</b> system with two phase conductors 180 degrees apart is still only single phase. Such systems are sometimes described as split-phase.|$|E
50|$|Some {{instruments}} provide three crosshairs {{which allow}} stadia {{measurement of the}} foresight and backsight distances.

5000|$|A {{technique}} used in recording studios is to interconnect all the metal chassis with heavy conductors like copper strip, then {{connect to the}} building ground wire system at one point; this {{is referred to as}} [...] "single-point grounding".

50|$|SWER’s main {{advantage}} is its low cost. It {{is often used}} in sparsely populated areas where {{the cost of building}} an isolated distribution line cannot be justified. Capital costs are roughly 50% of an equivalent two-wire single-phase line. They can cost 30% of <b>3-wire</b> three-phase systems. Maintenance costs are roughly 50% of an equivalent line.|$|E
50|$|When used in {{its most}} common application, for {{conversion}} of an alternating current (AC) input into a direct current (DC) output, it {{is known as a}} bridge rectifier. A bridge rectifier provides full-wave rectification from a two-wire AC input, resulting in lower cost and weight as compared to a rectifier with a <b>3-wire</b> input from a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding.|$|E

The negative pole continued to run a further 26 kilometers at -266 kV line to a similar station at Willesden in North London.|$|E

5000|$|A {{general-purpose}} micrometer (flat anvil and spindle) is used over a set {{of three}} wires that rest on the thread flanks, and a known constant is subtracted from the reading. (The wires are truly gauge pins, being ground to precise size, although [...] "wires" [...] is their common name.) This method is called the <b>3-wire</b> method. Sometimes grease is used to hold the wires in place, helping the user to juggle the part, mic, and wires into position.|$|E
50|$|Most Japanese {{dwellings}} {{are connected}} to the nation's power grid by using <b>3-wire</b> system with standard phase-neutral voltage of 100 V. 100 V AC outlets are located throughout the home for general use. Few 200 V outlets may also exist for connecting induction heating stove or large air conditioner. The line frequency is 50 Hz in eastern Japan, and 60 Hz {{in the western part of}} the country. Circuit breakers of 30 to 60 amperes is typical for most electrical distribution boards.|$|E
50|$|SWER also {{reduces the}} largest {{cost of a}} {{distribution}} network, the number of poles. Conventional 2-wire or <b>3-wire</b> distribution lines have a higher power transfer capacity, but can require 7 poles per kilometre, with spans of 100 to 150 metres. SWER's high line voltage and low current also permits the use of low-cost galvanized steel wire (historically, No. 8 fence wire). Steel's greater strength permits spans of 400 metres or more, {{reducing the number of}} poles to 2.5 per kilometre.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} 1930 Lackawanna 3 kV DC electrification {{was converted}} in 1984 to 25 kV 60 Hz, {{as part of}} the re-electrification of the Morris & Essex Lines which the then-Montclair Branch was grouped with at the time. The 2002 extension of electrification to Great Notch together with the Montclair Connection is similar in construction, except that hot-dip galvanized steel poles are used; many of these poles are painted dark green for esthetic reasons, in contrast with the old Lackawanna poles which are painted dark red. Catenary construction is uniform throughout; compound (<b>3-wire)</b> with a zigzag horizontal profile, but without self-tensioning, just like on most sections of the M&E lines.|$|E
5000|$|A cheater plug, AC ground lifter or three-prong/two-prong adapter is an adapter {{that allows}} a NEMA 5-15P grounding-type plug (three prongs) to connect to a NEMA 1-15R non-grounding {{receptacle}} (two slots). [...] They are needed to allow appliances with <b>3-wire</b> power cords to plug into legacy ungrounded (two slot) receptacles found in older buildings. The use of such an adapter avoids the need to replace receptacles, but is potentially hazardous if the grounding tab is not connected to electrical ground. A safer and more reliable alternative identified in the US and Canadian electrical codes is to replace the outlet with a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) breaker outlet. These adapters are illegal in some jurisdictions, in particular throughout Canada.|$|E
5000|$|Three-prong plugs do not {{fit into}} the older, two-prong {{receptacle}}s. [...] When used as intended, the ground pin of the <b>3-wire</b> receptacle is {{to be connected to}} the grounded cover screw, or to an external ground. In 1969 Underwriters Laboratories mandated three-prong plugs on major appliances for safety. At that time, only half of the receptacles in US homes were three-prong. Wiring in most homes did not include a grounding wire. The screws and outlet boxes were either connected to the neutral, or connected to nothing. Only in rare jurisdictions where non-metallic cable was prohibited and armored cable required (and still in good condition), do cheater plugs work as intended. In 1971, the US National Electrical Code (NEC) required grounded receptacles in all locations of the home (effective January 1, 1974).|$|E
5000|$|Ball {{micrometers}} have ball-shaped (spherical) anvils. They {{may have}} one flat and one ball anvil, {{in which case}} they are used for measuring tube wall thickness, distance of a hole to an edge, and other distances where one anvil must be placed against a rounded surface. They differ in application from tube micrometers in {{that they may be}} used to measure against rounded surfaces which are not tubes, but the ball anvil may also not be able to fit into smaller tubes as easily as a tube micrometer. Ball micrometers with a pair of balls can be used when single-tangential-point contact is desired on both sides. The most common example is in measuring the pitch diameter of screw threads (which is also done with conical anvils or the <b>3-wire</b> method, the latter of which uses similar geometry as the pair-of-balls approach).|$|E
50|$|Wartime sets {{generally}} {{required a}} 6 V or 12 V supply, and batteries were charged {{by a small}} petrol-engined charging set (generator) of 300 W, often the 'Chorehorse' type. When in use, this generator was carried {{out of the vehicle}} on a carrying frame and placed on the ground outside. The vehicle's own engine and lighting batteries were separate. Some vehicles were fitted with additional radio charging dynamos driven from a gearbox PTO. Later in the war, 24 V vehicles began to appear, firstly US-supplied armoured vehicles, further complicating the wireless supply considerations. In the case of the 19 set, a composite power supply that allowed 12 V, two-wire 24 V and <b>3-wire</b> (i.e. 0 - 12 - 24 V) systems was introduced. This power supply also contained a vibrator type HT section so that the receiver section of the set could be run more economically.|$|E
5000|$|LSOs grade {{the pass}} {{and write a}} comment, in shorthand, {{for use in the}} LSO-Pilot debrief. An example comment might read, [...] "High, a little {{overshooting}} start, fly through down on comeback in the middle, low in close to at the ramp. Fair-2" [...] -meaning the aircraft was high {{at the start of the}} approach and was slightly overshot the landing area centerline. As the pilot corrected to centerline, he did not add enough power so he flew through the glideslope from high to low. The LSO likely would have given the pilot a signal at this time to add power. For the last portion of the approach, the aircraft remained below glideslope (but was on centerline because of the lack of a comment), touching down prior to the target <b>3-wire.</b> The pilot caught the 2 wire, and received a grade of [...] "fair".|$|E
5000|$|The A and B wires of an {{analogue}} {{phone line}} {{appear in a}} structured cabling system usually on the centre pins of the 8P8C connector (pins 4 and 5; the blue/white TIA/EIA-568 pair 1 in Cat5 cables). In most other countries, those two wires are {{all that is needed}} to connect an analogue telephone. In the UK, however, many telephones expect the 25 Hz ring signal on a third wire. But such a <b>3-wire</b> interface is not the symmetric interface needed for balanced twisted-pair transmission lines, and therefore prone to electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with nearby other wiring. Therefore, the capacitor that separates the bell signal from the A/B wires should be located close to the telephone. Any bell wire provided by the master socket is therefore not connected to the structured cabling, and the telephone is plugged at the other end into the structured cabling via a line adapter unit (LAU) / Mod-Tap / Molex that contains the capacitor needed to create the separate bell signal. Different types of LAUs are on the market: ...|$|E
