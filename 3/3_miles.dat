40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{relationship}} between treadmill time, maximal oxygen consumption and pace characteristics of the 1. 5 and <b>3</b> <b>mile</b> runs and to compare the distances and pace characteristics as predictors of aerobic capacity. Subjects were 70 college aged males, ages 18 to 25, enrolled in jogging and conditioning classes at North Texas State University. Three tests were administered: the 1. 5 <b>mile</b> run, the <b>3</b> <b>mile</b> run and the Bruce treadmill test. The data were analyzed using correlations and factor analysis. Conclusions of the investigation were (1) the 1. 5 and <b>3</b> <b>mile</b> runs are valid measures of aerobic capacity, (2) the <b>3</b> <b>mile</b> run does not significantly increase the correlation between VO 2 max and endurance runs and (3) pacing characteristics are evident in the 1. 5 and <b>3</b> <b>mile</b> runs...|$|R

5|$|At dawn on August 9, 1st Cavalry Division {{learned of}} the North Korean crossing. North Korean {{infantry}} had gathered on Hill 268, also known as Triangulation Hill, which was <b>3</b> <b>miles</b> (4.8km) southeast of Waegwan and 10 miles (16km) northwest of Taegu. The hill was important for its proximity to lines of communication, as the main Korean north-south highway and the main double-track Seoul-Pusan railroad skirted its base. 1st Cavalry Division counterattacked the North Korean gathering to force them back across the river, but their initial assault was repelled. The next morning, August 10, air strikes and artillery barrages rocked Hill 268, devastating the North Koreans, who withdrew back behind the river.|$|E
5|$|Crawley {{lies within}} the Sussex Weald, {{an area of}} highly {{variable}} terrain, so that many microclimates of frost hollows, sun traps and windswept hilltops will be encountered over a short distance. During calm, clear periods of weather this allows for some interesting temperature variations, {{although most of the}} time, when mobile westerly airstreams persist, the weather is typically Oceanic {{like the rest of the}} British Isles. Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, although more recently the Met Office has also published data for its nearby weather station at Charlwood. Both weather stations are about <b>3</b> <b>miles</b> north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Then the Roman army {{began its}} march north, {{following}} the coastal road. 300 horse under John the Armenian were detached as an advance guard some <b>3</b> <b>miles</b> (4.5km) {{in front of}} the main army, while the 600 Huns covered the army's left flank. Belisarius himself with his bucellarii led up the rear, to guard against any attack from Gelimer, who was known to be in the vicinity. The fleet followed the army, sailing along the coast. The first town they encountered was Syllectum, which was captured by a detachment under Boriades by a ruse. In an attempt to sow division among the Vandals, Belisarius gave a letter written by Justinian and addressed to the Vandal nobles to a captured Vandal messenger, in which the emperor claimed to be campaigning on behalf of the legitimate king Hilderic against the usurper Gelimer. As the messenger was too afraid to deliver the letter, this ploy came to nothing.|$|E
