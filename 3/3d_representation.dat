5|$|Tales of Graces {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and a battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment traversed by foot. On the field maps, various skits between the characters can be viewed. They involve animated character portraits, subtitles, and full voice acting. Skits concern anything from character development to side details. The battle screen is a <b>3D</b> <b>representation</b> of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} installments in the Tales series, Tales of Symphonia consists {{primarily of}} three major areas: an overworld field map, town and dungeon maps, and a battle screen. The overworld map is a 3D model, featuring a scaled-down {{version of the}} game's fictional world which the player travels through to reach the game's locations. As with preceding games in the series, the world map can be traversed by foot, on the party's quadrupedal pet Noishe, and on flying vehicles known as Rheairds. On field maps, characters are directed across realistically scaled environments. The battle screen is a <b>3D</b> <b>representation</b> of an area, in which the player commands the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies.|$|E

Our {{point of view is}} to regard the three strand braid group B_ 3 as a subgroup of LB_ 3 and study the problem of extending B_ <b>3</b> <b>representations.</b> We introduce the notion of a standard extension and characterize B_ <b>3</b> <b>representations</b> admiting such an extension. In particular we show, using a classification result of Tuba and Wenzl, that every irreducible B_ <b>3</b> <b>representation</b> of dimension at most 5 has a (standard) extension. We show that this result is sharp by exhibiting an irreducible 6 -dimensional B_ <b>3</b> <b>representation</b> that has no extensions (standard or otherwise). We obtain complete classifications of (1) irreducible 2 -dimensional LB_ <b>3</b> <b>representations</b> (2) extensions of irreducible 3 -dimensional B_ <b>3</b> <b>representations</b> and (<b>3)</b> irreducible LB_ <b>3</b> <b>representations</b> whose restriction to B_ 3 has abelian image...|$|R

5|$|Tales of Xillia {{consists}} {{primarily of}} two major areas: the field map and the battle screen. The field map is a realistically scaled 3D environment where the player character traverses and interacts with non-player characters, items, or mob avatars. On the field map, character interactions between the party can also be viewed {{in the form of}} a sketch story; these sketch stories are referred to as skits and consist of animated portraits and voice acting. When coming into contact with a mob avatar, the environment switches to the battle screen, a <b>3D</b> <b>representation</b> of an area in which the player commands the characters in battles against the CPU-controlled mobs.|$|E

Representations of the Sudoku puzzles varied from a n 2 matrix to a n 3 matrix, as well as a combination of both. This study shows that (1) a sequential approach has better best case times but poor worst case behaviour, and a n <b>3</b> <b>representation</b> does not beneﬁt over a n 2 representation; (2) a greedy heuristic approach has superior worst case times but worse best case, and n <b>3</b> <b>representations</b> sees great beneﬁts over n 2 representations.

2500|$|Rendering is the {{generation}} of a 2D image from a 3D model by means of computer programs. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information as {{a description of the}} virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image file. The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs. The term [...] "rendering" [...] may be by analogy with an [...] "artist's rendering" [...] of a scene. Though the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a <b>3D</b> <b>representation</b> stored in a scene file are outlined as the graphics pipeline along a rendering device, such as a GPU. A GPU is a device able to assist the CPU in calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the rendering equation. The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output.|$|E

40|$|The gauge {{invariant}} and anomaly-free 331 {{model is}} studied with R_ξ gauges {{in order to}} see which of the right-handed singlet between the case (i), assigning the bosonic singlet to the counterpart of 3 and <b>3</b> ̅ <b>representations,</b> and the case (ii), assigning fermionic siglet to the counterpart of the left-handed <b>3</b> <b>representation</b> and assigning the antifermionic singlet to that of the left-handed 3 ̅ representaion, should be assigned in physics but not mathematics to the counterparts of the left-handed fundamental <b>3</b> <b>representation</b> and the left-handed complex conjugate <b>3</b> ̅ <b>representation.</b> It is shown that through an effect on the Yukawa interaction of the transformation property of the singlet it depends on the choices of the case (i) or the case (ii) whether the anomaly coefficients even after the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) vanish or not, and the coefficients vanish only in the case (ii) but do not in the case (i). Furthermore, it is pointed out that the BRS invariance after the SSB holds for the case (ii) and (i-b) of two possibilities in the choice for the mass eigenstates in the case (i) and thus the BRS invariance does not necessarily ensure renormalizability of the theory though the inverse of it holds.

40|$|Despite the now-ubiquitous {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) maps, photorealistic three-dimensional (<b>3</b> D) <b>representations</b> {{of cities}} (e. g., Google Earth) have gained much attention by scientists and public users as another option. However, {{there is no}} consistent evidence on the influences of 3 D photorealism on pedestrian navigation. Whether 3 D photorealism can communicate cartographic information for navigation with higher effectiveness and efficiency and lower cognitive workload compared to the traditional symbolic 2 D maps remains unknown. This study aims to explore whether the photorealistic <b>3</b> D <b>representation</b> can facilitate processes of map reading and navigation in digital environments using a lab-based eye tracking approach. Here we show the differences of symbolic 2 D maps versus photorealistic <b>3</b> D <b>representations</b> depending on users’ eye-movement and navigation behaviour data. We found that the participants using the <b>3</b> D <b>representation</b> were less effective, less efficient and were required higher cognitive workload than using the 2 D map for map reading.
