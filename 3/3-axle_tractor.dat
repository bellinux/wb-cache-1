50|$|A semi end dump is a {{tractor-trailer}} combination {{wherein the}} trailer itself contains the hydraulic hoist. In the US a typical semi end dump has a <b>3-axle</b> <b>tractor</b> pulling a 2-axle trailer with dual tires, in the EU trailers often have 3 axles and single tires. The key {{advantage of a}} semi end dump is a large payload. A key disadvantage {{is that they are}} very unstable when raised in the dumping position limiting their use in many applications where the dumping location is uneven or off level.|$|E
50|$|A semi bottom dump or {{belly dump}} is a <b>3-axle</b> <b>tractor</b> pulling a 2-axle trailer with a clam shell type dump gate {{in the belly}} of the trailer. The key {{advantage}} of a semi bottom dump is its ability to lay material in a windrow, a linear heap. In addition, a semi bottom dump is maneuverable in reverse, unlike the double and triple trailer configurations described below. These trailers may be found either of the windrow type shown in the photo, or may be of the cross spread type, with the gate opening front to rear instead of left and right. The cross spread type gate will actually spread the cereal grains fairly and evenly from the width of the trailer. By comparison, the windrow type gate leaves a pile in the middle. The cross spread type gate, on the other hand, tends to jam and may not work very well with coarse materials.|$|E
50|$|A {{side dump}} truck (SDT) {{consists}} of a <b>3-axle</b> <b>tractor</b> pulling a 2-axle semi-trailer. It has hydraulic rams which tilt the dump body onto its side, spilling the material to either {{the left or right}} side of the trailer. The key advantages of the side dump are that it allows rapid unloading and can carry more weight in the western United States. In addition, it is almost immune to upset (tipping over) while dumping, unlike the semi end dumps which are very prone to tipping over. It is, however, highly likely that a side dump trailer will tip over if dumping is stopped prematurely. Also, when dumping loose materials or cobble sized stone, the side dump can become stuck if the pile becomes wide enough to cover too much of the trailer's wheels. Trailers that dump at the appropriate angle (50Â° for example) avoid the problem of the dumped load fouling the path of the trailer wheels by dumping their loads further {{to the side of the}} truck, in some cases leaving sufficient clearance to walk between the dumped load and the trailer.|$|E
