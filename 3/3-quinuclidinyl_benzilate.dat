The M138 also possessed the thickest steel walls of U.S. bomblets, about 3 mm. The M43 cluster bomb was designed to hold 57 M138s, arranged in three stacks of 19 bomblets. Each bomblet held about 6 ounces of the incapacitating agent BZ, also known as <b>3-Quinuclidinyl</b> <b>benzilate.</b> The bomblets themselves were composed of M7 canisters which held a 50/50 mixture of pyrotechnic and agent (pyromix).|$|E
50|$|EA-3167 is {{a potent}} and {{long-lasting}} anticholinergic deliriant drug, related to the chemical warfare agent <b>3-Quinuclidinyl</b> <b>benzilate</b> (QNB). It was developed under contract to Edgewood Arsenal during the 1960s {{as part of the}} US military chemical weapons program, in an attempt to develop non-lethal incapacitating agents. EA-3167 has identical effects to QNB, but is even more potent and longer-lasting, with an effective dose when administered by injection of as little as 2.5μg/kg (i.e. 0.2 milligrams for an 80kg person), and a duration of 120-240 hours (5-10 days). However unlike QNB, EA-3167 was never weaponized or manufactured in bulk.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, the CIA {{investigated}} LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) {{as part of}} its Project MKUltra. In {{the same}} period, the US Army undertook the secret Edgewood Arsenal human experiments which grew out of the U.S. chemical warfare program and involved studies of several hundred volunteer test subjects. Britain was also investigating the possible use of LSD and the chemical BZ (<b>3-quinuclidinyl</b> <b>benzilate)</b> as nonlethal battlefield drug-weapons. The United States eventually weaponized BZ for delivery in the M43 BZ cluster bomb until stocks were destroyed in 1989. Both the US and Britain concluded that the desired effects of drug weapons were unpredictable under battlefield conditions and gave up experimentation.|$|E
5000|$|Following World War II, the United States {{military}} investigated a {{wide range}} of possible nonlethal, psychobehavioral, chemical incapacitating agents to include psychedelic indoles such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) and the tetrahydrocannabinol derivative DMHP, certain tranquilizers, as well as several glycolate anticholinergics. One of the anticholinergic compounds, <b>3-quinuclidinyl</b> <b>benzilate,</b> was assigned the NATO code [...] "BZ" [...] and was weaponized beginning in the 1960s for possible battlefield use. (Although BZ figured prominently in the plot of the 1990 movie, Jacob's Ladder, as the compound responsible for hallucinations and violent deaths in a fictitious American battalion in Vietnam, this agent never saw operational use.) Destruction of American stockpiles of BZ began in 1988 and is now complete.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of strong incapacitating effects and a favourable safety margin led the Edgewood Arsenal team {{to conclude that}} DMHP and its derivatives, especially the O-acetyl ester {{of the most active}} isomer, EA-2233-2, were among the more promising non-lethal incapacitating agents to come out of their research program. However they were disadvantaged by producing severe hypotension at incapacitating doses, and were not as effective as the more widely publicised anticholinergic agents such as <b>3-Quinuclidinyl</b> <b>benzilate</b> which had also already been weaponised. Funding for continued development was ultimately not approved, and the cannabinoid research program was indefinitely suspended {{along with the rest of}} the Edgewood Arsenal experiments in the late 1970s, in accordance with the US commitment to cease research into chemical weapons under disarmament treaties.|$|E
50|$|After the war, all of {{the former}} Allies pursued further {{research}} on the three new nerve agents developed by the Nazis: tabun, sarin, and soman.

50|$|The U.S. also {{investigated}} a {{wide range}} of possible nonlethal, psychobehavioral chemical incapacitating agents including psychedelic indoles such as lysergic acid diethylamide (also experimenting to see if it could be used for effective mind control) and marijuana derivatives, certain tranquilizers like ketamine or fentanyl, as well as several glycolate anticholinergics. One of the anticholinergic compounds, <b>3-quinuclidinyl</b> <b>benzilate,</b> was assigned the NATO code BZ and was weaponized {{at the beginning of the}} 1960s for possible battlefield use. This agent was allegedly employed by American troops as a counterinsurgency weapon in the Vietnam War but the U.S. maintains that this agent never saw operational use. The North Koreans and Chinese have alleged that chemical and biological weapons were used by the United States in the Korean War; but the United States' denial is supported by Russian archival documents.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. began {{stockpile}} {{reductions in}} the 1980s with the removal of outdated munitions and destroying its entire stock of <b>3-Quinuclidinyl</b> <b>benzilate</b> (BZ or Agent 15) {{at the beginning of}} 1988. In June 1990 the Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System began destruction of chemical agents stored on the Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, seven years before the Chemical Weapons Treaty came into effect. In 1986 President Ronald Reagan made an agreement with the Chancellor, Helmut Kohl to remove the U.S. stockpile of chemical weapons from Germany. In 1990, as part of Operation Steel Box, two ships were loaded with over 100,000 shells containing Sarin and VX were taken from the U.S. Army weapons storage depots such as Miesau and then-classified FSTS (Forward Storage / Transportation Sites) and transported from Bremerhaven, Germany to Johnston Atoll in the Pacific, a 46-day nonstop journey.|$|E

5000|$|Post World War I, the Geneva Convention of 1925, or the Geneva Gas Protocol, {{called for}} a ban of {{chemical}} weapons like chlorine and mustard gas. Despite advocating for it at the time, the United States continued to develop chemical agents for warfare. It has been determined that over 254 chemical compounds were tested in the Holmesburg prison facilities. Among these reagents were  “acutely toxic anticholinesterase chemicals: incapacitating agents, which included the glycolates, atropine-like anticholinergic compounds of which BZ (<b>3-quinuclidinyl</b> <b>benzilate)</b> is a prototype; the indoles, represented by EA 1729 (LSD-25); the cannabinols, or marijuana-like compounds; and the sedative, or tranquilizer, group.”One {{of the most significant}} of these chemicals was, 3-quinuclidinyl cyclopentylphenylglycolate (EA 3167)  which was discovered when a dog researcher had accidentally injected himself in the thumb. [...] The researcher was immediately seen to suffer from brain and nerve damage and the compound became of interest to the military. The military approached the University of Pennsylvania, to test this compound at the Holmesburg Prison. EA 3167 was the first compound to set the precedent {{for the rest of the}} Holmesburg prison trials. For the first batch of experiments, 19 male patients were tested upon who were chosen between the ages of 22 and 37 and based on the results of the Minnesota Multiphase Personality Inventory (MMPI) test.  These first experiments were moderate in nature and measured standard measures vitals such as heart rate and blood pressure. These tests quickly radicalized and scaled both in terms of the number of patients and number of chemical compounds. In study titled. [...] "Threshold Doses in Humans and Evaluations of Drugs in Man," [...] over 320 inmates were recruited to test [...] "ditran, atropine, scopolamine, and various experimental glycolate agents," [...] which affected nervous activity and the function of smooth muscles. In threshold experiments, rather than increasing dosage by small incremental amounts, experiments such as those involving EA 3167 increased in dosage often 40% at a time.   In addition to providing subjects for experimentation, the Holmesburg prison also served as the perfect facility for military testing due to the presence of pliable furniture and padding. Due to the nature of mind-altering testing, the Holmesburg prison allowed the military and the University of Pennsylvania a venue to experiment in where patients would be unable to harm themselves.|$|E
