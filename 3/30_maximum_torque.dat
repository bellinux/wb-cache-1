5000|$|The NTE test, {{as defined}} in CFR 86.1370-2007, {{establishes}} an area (NTE control area) under the torque curve of an engine where emissions must not exceed a specified emission cap for a given pollutant. The NTE cap is set at 1.25 times the FTP emission limit {{as described in the}} subsection above. For 2005 model year heavy-duty engines, the NTE emission cap for NMHC plus NOx is 1.25 times 2.5 grams per brake horsepower-hour, or 3.125 grams per brake horsepower-hour. The basic NTE control area for diesel engines has three basic boundaries on the engine’s torque and speed map. The first is the upper boundary that is represented by an engine’s <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> at a given speed. The second boundary is <b>30</b> percent of <b>maximum</b> <b>torque.</b> Only operation above this boundary is included in the NTE control area. The third boundary is determined based on the lowest engine speed at 50 percent of maximum power and highest engine speed at 70 percent of maximum power. This engine speed is considered the “15 percent operational engine speed”. The fourth boundary is 30% of maximum power ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An inverter-three-phase {{squirrel-cage}} {{induction motor}} drive system with improved mechanical characteristics is presented. The proposed system provides mechanical characteristics with constant <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> or increased <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and reduced slip speed at frequencies below the nominal frequency. The control algorithm {{is based on}} the constant volts per hertz principle using two improvement techniques: keeping <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> constant or keeping magnetic flux constant. Performance analysis of the system under different operation conditions was provided. For this purpose, a standard state-space model of three-phase squirrel-cage induction motor, with respect to a synchronously rotating d-q reference frame was derived. The correctness and validity of the derived model of induction motor was verified. The inverter was considered as a static linear element and modeled through its input-output equation based on the modulation index. Three types of controllers were modeled, simulated and experimentally tested. The results show that both suggested control methods improve the system performance. The slip speed has been decreased and the starting <b>torque</b> and <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> have been increased.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the resistance to}} fracture of rotary Ni-Ti files of various diameters and tapers after torsional stress simulation. Methods: Profile (Dentsply Maillerfer, Ballaigues, Suíça) instruments sizes 15 to 40, taper 0. 04 and 0. 06 were used. Ten instruments of each size and taper were tested, totaling 120 files. The <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> (Tmax) until fracture was determined {{in accordance with the}} ANSI / ADA Protocol Nº 28. The maximum force was converted into <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> using the formula: Tmax = Loadmax x RadiusResults: The diameter (p< 0. 001) and taper (p< 0. 001) influenced the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> to fracture. With the increase in diameter and taperthere was a gradual increase in the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque.</b> Using the multiple regression method an equation relating the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> to the diameter (D) and the taper (T) was found: Tmax = - 1. 4 + 0. 08 D + 10. 5 T. Conclusion: The increase in diameter and taper promoted an increase in resistance to torsion.

40|$|Background: Joint {{trauma and}} injury {{are the most}} common causes of dynamic {{instability}}. Dynamic instability has a great effect on the lumbar spine, due to its three-dimensional motions. The greatest amounts of compression and shearing force are imposed at the points of <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and velocity. The changes in these phase angles upon bearing various loads can cause some pathologic conditions. In this study, we examined the phase angle at <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and velocity in the three planes of movement and then estimated their displacement upon external loads. Methods: Using the B 200 isoinertial dynamometer, 13 subjects were tested in three stages as follows: 1) Familiarization with tests and apparatus. 2) Warm-up and three maximum isometric tests, with a rest interval between each test, in the three axes of lumbar motion including: flexion/extension, rotation to right/left, lateral flexion to the right/left. 3) Five dynamic tests in these three axes of motion without load, with 25 % <b>maximum</b> voluntary <b>torque,</b> and with 50 % <b>maximum</b> voluntary <b>torque.</b> Special software was used to analyze the raw data and detect the occurrence of <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and velocity in the dynamic range of motion at each of the three axes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Results: When the load was increased, the <b>maximum</b> dynamic <b>torque</b> {{in each of the three}} axes increased (P&lt; 0. 05). The increase in load shifted the phase angles toward the <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and velocity (P&lt; 0. 05), with a positive correlation between changes in torque and velocity phase angles (P&lt; 0. 05). Conclusions: Rather than being a function of the biomechanical pattern, the changes in <b>maximum</b> <b>torque</b> and velocity of the phase angles following an increase in motion resistance to the outer range of the three axes are actually a control behavior in the motion processing system in dynamic movement...|$|R
