5|$|As was {{the usual}} method of BBC {{television}} drama production at the time, the play was produced in a multi-camera electronic studio on video cameras, although it was recorded as a <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> telerecording rather than on videotape. This 35mm master was released for junking in 1968, and no copy of the play is known to exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} a {{critical}} and commercial success and was nominated for the 78th Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature, but lost to , which also starred Bonham Carter. It was shot with Canon EOS-1D Mark II digital SLRs, rather than the <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> cameras used for Burton's previous stop-motion film The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993).|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} shot using <b>35mm</b> <b>film.</b> Warren {{said this was}} chosen over high-definition cameras due to the low light levels that would be {{experienced}} when filming in a world without electricity and during an autumn filming period, and over Super 16 due to high-definition transmission requirements.|$|E
5|$|Following its cinema release, {{the film}} was {{transferred}} to VHS in 1991 in a pan and scan edition. However, when Glyn Watkins, a poet who had been encouraged by J.L. Carr early in his career, wanted to screen the film at the launch of a poetry book in 2003 at the National Media Museum in Bradford, the museum found that all original <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> prints had disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Mendes {{revealed}} that production would begin on 8 December 2014 at Pinewood Studios, with filming taking seven months. Mendes also confirmed several filming locations, including London, Mexico City and Rome. Van Hoytema shot the film on Kodak <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> stock, {{in contrast to}} Skyfall being filmed on digital cameras. Early filming took place at Pinewood Studios, and around London, with scenes variously featuring Craig and Harris at Bond's flat, and Craig and Kinnear travelling down the River Thames.|$|E

5|$|The {{script was}} written by Ehren Kruger, who also collaborated on the {{narrative}} of Revenge of the Fallen. Dark of the Moon employed both regular <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> cameras and specially-developed 3-D cameras, with filming locations in Chicago, Florida, Indiana, Milwaukee, Moscow, and Washington, D.C.. The film was rendered specifically for 3-D, and the visual effects involved more complex robots which took longer to render. In May 2011, {{it was announced that}} Paramount would move Dark of the Moon release date of July 1 to June 29, in order to monitor an early response to footage.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} The Quatermass Experiment led to two sequels, Quatermass II (1955) and Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59), both {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Cartier and written by Kneale. Both were successful and critically acclaimed, and Cartier's production work on them became increasingly ambitious. For Quatermass II, he pre-filmed {{a significant amount of}} material on location, using <b>35mm</b> <b>film,</b> opening the drama out from a confined studio setting with the most ambitious location shooting yet attempted in British television. Cartier, with his previous experience as a film director, particularly enjoyed working on these cinema-style filmed scenes.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} Quatermass II was telerecorded onto <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> during its live transmission, for a {{scheduled}} repeat the following Monday night at 10:15p.m. All six episodes survive intact in the BBC's archives, although the telerecording copies {{in some cases}} suffer from poor quality sound and vision. Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats. Quatermass II {{was one of the}} first BBC drama productions to be repeated from a telerecording, rather than having the production re-performed live for any second showing as had been the norm in the past.|$|E

5|$|In September 2002, a DVD box set of all 30 Joe 90 episodes, sourced from {{a digital}} remaster of <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> prints, was {{released}} in Region 2 by Carlton. The five component discs were also released individually at intervals between September 2002 and January 2003, and the episodes were also marketed in a new five-volume VHS package. A North American set from A debuted in July 2003 before a Region 4 version appeared in October. A French-language release of Joe 90– Agent Très Spécial (English: Joe 90 – Very Special Agent) hit the Canadian market in 2004. With these DVD releases, the component episodes of The Amazing Adventures of Joe 90 were made commercially available in their unedited form for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{release was}} titled Live in Japan and {{featured}} a unique sleeve design, with an overhead stage {{shot of the}} band, a selection of photographs from a gig at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and an insert with lyrics and a hand-written message from each band member. The first pressing came with a <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> negative with photos of the band which buyers could develop into their own prints. The sleeve notes claimed that the recording only contained the Tokyo gig, though {{in fact it was}} musically identical to the version released {{in the rest of the}} world. Phil Collen, later to play in Def Leppard, was in the audience for the Rainbow gig as captured on the sleeve.|$|E
5|$|While filming in Washington, D.C., {{the crew}} {{shot on the}} National Mall, and Bay stated {{that there would be}} a car race on the location. Two further {{locations}} announced were the Milwaukee Art Museum and the former Tower Automotive complex on Milwaukee's north side, then under redevelopment for mixed use as well as the city's equipment yard. Filming was scheduled to take place there after work was done in Chicago. On September 23, scenes were filmed at the former city hall in Detroit. On October 16, a scene in the later-1960s was shot at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, utilizing extras with period fashion and hairstyles. One day of shooting was also spent at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia. Other planned filming locations included Africa and China. Though about 70% of the film's live action footage was shot in 3-D using Arri Alexa and Sony F35 cameras, more than half of the film still had to be converted into 3-D in post production to fix technical flaws 3-D filming produces. Other footage that needed to be converted into 3-D in post production was either entirely computer generated or shot in the anamorphic format on <b>35mm</b> <b>film.</b> <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> was used for scenes filmed in slow motion and scenes such as closeups of faces or shots of the sky which required higher image quality than the HD digital 3-D cameras could provide. 35mm cameras were also used for scenes where the 3-D cameras proved to be too heavy, or were subject to strobing or electrical damage from dust. Principal photography officially concluded on November 9, 2010.|$|E

5|$|Each {{episode was}} rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking place {{all day on}} Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then {{transmitted}} live—with a few pre-filmed <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> inserts shot {{before and during the}} rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It {{was one of the last}} major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer to Lime Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{scene was}} {{performed}} live; {{because of the}} increased budget — £7,552 was spent on the serial, nearly double the amount spent on The Quatermass Experiment — Cartier was able to include {{a larger proportion of}} pre-filmed inserts on <b>35mm</b> <b>film,</b> which were included during the live transmissions of each episode. Most of the pre-filmed material was shot on location at the Shell Haven oil refinery in Stanford-le-Hope, doubling for the factory where the alien creature is being grown on Earth. Filming also took place in rural Essex for material showing the meteorites being discovered in fields, and in the boiler rooms of the under-construction BBC Television Centre in London for scenes set inside the factory. The location film sequences were the most ambitious that had then been attempted in British television drama, which was usually predominantly studio-bound.|$|E
5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The {{film was}} shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached muslin tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The key light was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E

5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E
5|$|For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was {{extensively}} restored. A {{process called}} VidFIRE {{was applied to}} all of the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid interlaced video look they would have had on transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original <b>35mm</b> <b>film</b> inserts still existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E
5|$|This {{version of}} the Mothers debuted on Zappa's next solo album Chunga's Revenge (1970), which was {{followed}} by the double-album soundtrack to the movie 200 Motels (1971), featuring the Mothers, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Ringo Starr, Theodore Bikel, and Keith Moon. Co-directed by Zappa and Tony Palmer, it was filmed in a week at Pinewood Studios outside London. Tensions between Zappa and several cast and crew members arose before and during shooting. The film deals loosely with life on the road as a rock musician. It was the first feature film photographed on videotape and transferred to <b>35mm</b> <b>film,</b> a process that allowed for novel visual effects. It was released to mixed reviews. The score relied extensively on orchestral music, and Zappa's dissatisfaction with the classical music world intensified when a concert, scheduled at the Royal Albert Hall after filming, was canceled because a representative of the venue found some of the lyrics obscene. In 1975, he lost a lawsuit against the Royal Albert Hall for breach of contract.|$|E
