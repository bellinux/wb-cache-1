5|$|After the side-scan sonar aboard Geosounder was {{switched}} {{out for the}} ROV (again {{delayed by}} technical issues and more bad weather), the survey ship returned to Sydneys wreck site on 3 April, and performed a detailed study {{of the ship and}} her debris field. Inspections were also carried out on Kormoran and the believed battle site (the latter found to be outcrops of pillow lava), before Mearns declared the search over on 7 April. In April 2015, an expedition to the wrecks by Curtin University and the Western Australian Museum commenced, with the objective of using <b>3D</b> <b>imaging</b> to map the wrecksites for further study, and to determine if any deterioration since the 2008 discovery requires the development of a conservation management plan.|$|E
25|$|Though imaging {{has been}} a {{standard}} part of the OR {{for a long time}} in the form of mobile C-Arms, ultrasound and endoscopy, these new minimally-invasive procedures require imaging techniques that can visualize smaller body parts such as thin vessels in the heart muscle and can be facilitated through intraoperative <b>3D</b> <b>imaging.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of {{the table in the}} room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports <b>3D</b> <b>imaging,</b> or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts <b>3D</b> <b>imaging.</b> The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging.|$|E

The sensitivities and specificities of these tech-niques for discriminating benign and malignant nodules were compared. The apparent diffusion coefficients of the pulmonary nodules on 1. 5 -T and <b>3</b> -T <b>imaging</b> correlated significantly. The sensitivities and specificities for discriminating benign and malignant lesions were similar among the <b>3</b> <b>imaging</b> techniques: 1. 5 -T imaging, 0. 91 and 0. 90; <b>3</b> -T <b>imaging,</b> 0. 88 and 0. 94; positron-emission tomography, 0. 94 and 0. 94. The apparent diffusion coefficient on 1. 5 -T imaging {{showed a significant}} reverse correlation with positron-emission tomography, and the correlation between <b>3</b> -T <b>imaging</b> and posi-tron-emission tomography was marginally significant.

Common monomers utilized for <b>3D</b> <b>imaging</b> include multifunctional acrylates and methacrylates combined with a non-polymeric component in order to reduce volume shrinkage. A competing composite mixture of epoxide resins with cationic photoinitiators is becoming increasingly used since their volume shrinkage upon ring-opening polymerization is significantly below those of acrylates and methacrylates. Free-radical and cationic polymerizations composed of both epoxide and acrylate monomers have also been employed, gaining the high rate of polymerization from the acryilic monomer, and better mechanical properties from the epoxy matrix.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for acquiring three-dimensional (3 D) images {{based on an}} electrically controlled liquid crystal (LC) micro lens array (MLA). The proposed method is extremely different from existing <b>3</b> D <b>imaging</b> methods, because adapting the proposed LC-MLA as a key element for a <b>3</b> D <b>imaging</b> system eliminates the conventional need for mechanical movements. The LC-MLA has 50 μm hole-pattern electrodes, with an operating voltage as low as 0. 2 Vrms, a focal length range of 50 - 400 μm, millisecond response time, and optical consistency between neighboring elements of 9 %. In order to demonstrate its <b>3</b> D <b>imaging</b> capability, this paper decribes an imaging experiment in which two-dimensional (2 D) images with different perspectives and magnifications are obtained by tuning the external applied voltage from 0. 2 to 5. 0 Vrms at 0. 5 Vrms/step; then, a ray back projection algorithm is applied to process the 2 D images in order to reconstruct the 3 D image of the target object.
