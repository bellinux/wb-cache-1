25|$|Near {{the close}} of the 2015 season, Canada's Wonderland {{announced}} that two new flat rides would be added in 2016 — Skyhawk (a Gerstlauer Sky Roller) and Flying Eagles (a Larson International Flying Scooters). Cedar Fair CEO Matt Ouimett also confirmed in December 2015 that virtual reality (VR) headsets would be added to Thunder Run in 2016. Available to riders for an additional upcharge fee, the experience is co-developed with Mack Rides, a German amusement ride company. The VR headgear is a type of head-mounted display that animates the entire field of vision to produce a 360-degree <b>3D</b> <b>experience.</b>|$|E

The new Google Maps can create a customized map that is specific to the behavior of each user, revealing highlights {{that are based on}} the information that is entered, and providing useful local information such as restaurants. A new feature is a carousel that gathers all Google Maps imagery in one location and contains an Earth view that directly integrates the <b>3D</b> <b>experience</b> from Google Earth into the new maps. The new version is also more closely connected to Google+ and the local businesses that are displayed are based on each user's Google+ network. Advertisements in the new Google Maps have been redesigned and short sections of advertisements are placed directly onto the map itself, alongside the business name.|$|E

500|$|Bruckheimer {{said the}} {{decision}} to film in 3D was made due to its being [...] "immersive filmmaking; I think it makes you part of the actual filming because you're part of the screen." [...] Bruckheimer described it as the first major [...] "exterior movie" [...] to be shot in 3D, as Avatar was mostly done in sound stages. At first Marshall was not much interested in 3D, but the director eventually considered it a film that could benefit from the format. [...] "You are on an adventure and with the <b>3D</b> <b>experience</b> you are inside that adventure." [...] While the original plan was to add 3D effects during post-production, {{the decision was made}} to shoot digitally with 3D cameras. Only one sequence was shot conventionally and needed a 3D conversion. The cameras were improved versions of the ones James Cameron developed for Avatar, which were made more compact for extra mobility. This meant the cameras could be brought into locations such as the Hawaiian jungle.|$|E

500|$|Superman Returns: An IMAX <b>3D</b> <b>Experience</b> was {{released}} simultaneously in 111 IMAX format theatres worldwide, which included 20 minutes of converted 3-D film material. It {{was the first}} Hollywood full-length live-action film {{to be released in}} this combined format. One of the key scenes Singer took out was [...] "the Return to Krypton sequence". $10 million was spent on this sequence alone, but it was deleted. Singer noted that it could not be released as part of a DVD featurette because it was converted to IMAX 3D. He hoped it could have appeared in an IMAX reissue. The film's second week gross rapidly declined from the first week, due to the presence of [...] and The Devil Wears Prada. Superman Returns went on to gross $200,081,192 in North America and $191 million internationally, earning $391,081,192 worldwide. Domestically, the film was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2006.

[...] At Metacritic—which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics—the film received an average score of 83, based on 19 reviews, which translates to [...] "universal acclaim" [...] on the website's rating scale. The film received positive reviews from Toronto Star and Variety following its 56-minute premiere at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival when the final 85-minute cut was months away from completion. Critics from publications such as the Irish Independent, The New Zealand Herald, Reno News & Review, Toronto Star, and USA Today said that the film's <b>3D</b> <b>experience</b> was [...] "even better than the real thing"—a reference to U2's song of the same name. Reviews by Rolling Stone and Total Film stated the film seemed to appeal to fans and non-fans of U2 alike, just as the filmmakers had intended.|$|E
500|$|The company 3ality Technica of Burbank, California {{produced}} {{some of the}} equipment. The film {{was reported to be}} the first to adopt 3ality Digital's TS-5 wireless and handheld beamsplitter mirror rig. 3ality technology helped make it possible to avoid 2D to 3D conversion. Webb wanted a new <b>3D</b> <b>experience</b> for Spider-Man: [...] "Because we're shooting in 3D, I wanted to conceive of certain things very specifically for 3D. There's an experimental component to 3D that's fascinating and we're experimenting with generating that point of view– so you feel what Peter Parker feels, you feel what Spider-Man feels when he's jumping over buildings and over the streets." [...] He felt that Spider-Man was ideal for 3D, admitting that they [...] "started making the movie around the time Avatar came out" [...] which made every studio want 3D. This was Webb's first film using the technique, and he did not want a force-fit or clumsy conversion as he had seen in other films. Webb cited childhood films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and House of Wax for inspirations to push the 3D in his film even further than the type of depth that James Cameron uses in his film.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, {{producers}} Jon and Peter Shapiro {{created a}} 2D IMAX concert film titled All Access, which featured live performances of several musicians. [...] Due {{to the difficulty}} of using conventional IMAX film stock that had to be replaced every three minutes of shooting, the Shapiros wanted to use digital technology for their next project, which could easily be upscaled to the IMAX format without loss of quality. [...] Noting how 3D films out-performed 2D films, they also wanted their next project to be in the IMAX 3D format. [...] While looking for a new digital 3D technology medium, the Shapiros met producer Steve Schklair, founder of Cobalt Entertainment in 2000. Schklair had recently developed a digital 3D filming technique known as [...] "active depth cut", which allowed for smooth cuts between shots that would normally not line up when filmed in 3D. This was done using motion control photography and real-time image processing to create a realistic <b>3D</b> <b>experience</b> without subjecting the viewer to excessive motion sickness or eye strain. It was intended to be an inexpensive and effective way to shoot live events such as concerts or sports. With the help of John and David Modell, former owners of the Baltimore Ravens American football team, the digital 3D technology was tested at several National Football League (NFL) games in the 2003 season, including Super Bowl XXXVIII. Cobalt showed the footage to the NFL, hoping to create an NFL-based 3D IMAX film. While waiting for a response, the Shapiros proposed the idea of creating a 3D concert film for IMAX theaters. Although All Access had showcased several artists, the Shapiros now wanted to focus on a single act, and being U2 fans, suggested the band as a potential subject. Schklair felt U2 would be a good choice for the film due to their large concert setups and their constant movement while performing, both of which would provide good depth of field for 3D effects.|$|E

2500|$|Nintendo {{learned from}} its {{experiences}} – {{both positive and}} negative – with the Nintendo 64's three-handled controller design and went with a two-handled, [...] "handlebar" [...] design for the GameCube. The shape was made popular by Sony's PlayStation controller released in 1994 and its follow-up DualShock series of gamepads introduced in 1997. In addition to vibration feedback, the DualShock series was well known for having two analog sticks to improve the <b>3D</b> <b>experience</b> in games. Nintendo and Microsoft designed similar features in the controllers for their sixth-generation consoles, but instead of having the analog sticks parallel to each other, they chose to stagger them by swapping the positions of the directional pad (d-pad) and left analog stick. The GameCube controller features a total of eight buttons, two analog sticks, a d-pad, and an internal rumble motor. The primary analog stick is on the left with the d-pad located below and closer to the center. On the right are four buttons: a large, green [...] "A" [...] button in the center, a smaller red [...] "B" [...] button to the left, an [...] "X" [...] button to the right, and a [...] "Y" [...] button at the top. Below and to the inside is a yellow [...] "C" [...] analog stick, which often serves a variety of in-game functions, such as controlling the camera angle. The Start/Pause button is located in the middle, and the rumble motor is encased within the center of the controller.|$|E
