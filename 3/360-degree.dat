5|$|The Batmobile has two modes, {{which can}} be {{switched}} at any time: Pursuit and Battle. Pursuit is for moving from area to area and completing specific driving challenges. In Battle mode, the Batmobile becomes more tank than car, allowing a full <b>360-degree</b> range of movement, including strafing in any direction, while revealing the multiple weapon systems on board, including a Vulcan chain gun for quick damage, a 60mm hypervelocity cannon for fire support, anti-tank guided missiles for wide-ranging damage against multiple targets, and a non-lethal riot suppressor.|$|E
5|$|There is a clifftop {{walk from}} Jacob's Ladder along {{the crest of}} the gorge and back to the road, with views of the gorge. A caving {{experience}} is offered within Gough's Cave. There is a path of 275steps, built {{up the side of the}} gorge, known as Jacob's Ladder after the Biblical description of a ladder to the heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a <b>360–degree</b> view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of the gorge.|$|E
5|$|Gifu's {{most famous}} castle is Gifu Castle, located on Mount Kinka. First {{built by the}} Nikaidō clan during the Kamakura period, the castle has gone through many forms, with its current version rebuilt in 1956. One of its first {{residents}} was Saitō Dōsan, {{who lived in the}} castle when it was still called Inabayama Castle. The next resident, Oda Nobunaga, changed the castle's name {{at the same time that}} he changed the name of the surrounding town. From the top of the castle, visitors have a <b>360-degree</b> view, effectively giving them a view to all of the city's borders. Inside the castle are many artifacts from its past.|$|E

5|$|The {{central area}} of the city serves as a {{satellite}} of nearby Nagoya, which has larges offices of many international companies, including Toyota. The ease of commute between the two cities, {{as well as the}} plentiful apartment construction underway, has contributed to this distinction. Just west of Gifu Station is Gifu City Tower 43, a 43-story high-rise building developed by Takenaka Corporation that opened on October 13, 2007 as the tallest building in Gifu Prefecture. The upper 30 floors are divided into two- and three-bedroom apartments, including those for senior citizens. The lower floors will be used as offices or shops for targeted services such as medical care. Additionally, public space exists {{at the top of the}} building, allowing residents another <b>360-degree</b> view of Gifu, complementing that offered from Gifu Castle.|$|E
5|$|The old Sky Room {{with its}} {{spectacular}} <b>360-degree</b> view reopened in 1999 as the James Edgar Hervey Skyroom, {{in honor of}} alumnus James Edgar Hervey, Class of 1950, a prominent San Diego trial lawyer. It {{is used as a}} space for student study by day (no alcohol allowed) and is available for special events in the evenings. Other floors of the building hold offices, apartments and residential conveniences. The mezzanine level contains a compact fitness center, the third and fourth floors contain classrooms and offices for political action groups and legal assistance organizations, and the 22nd and 23rd floors hold publishing headquarters for a number of scholarly journals.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} a full, <b>360-degree</b> field of view, and can quickly look left, right, forward, {{and behind the}} dragon. Enemies come from all directions, varying in size and health, and also appear on an {{on-screen}} radar that monitors the dragon's surroundings. Two weapons are available: the rider's handgun, which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming reticle, and the homing laser fired by the dragon, which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the reticle over them while holding down the fire button. Some situations with many enemies on screen {{require the use of}} the lock-on laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, IMC {{covered the}} Vancouver Olympic Games for NBC, most notably {{webcasting}} The Today Show live {{for two hours}} daily in full <b>360-degrees.</b> In other sports in 2010, IMC broadcast [...] "Hockey Night in Canada" [...] for Canadian Broadcasting (CBC Sports) live each week of the 2010 hockey season and during the 2010 season play-offs.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} a 'nollie {{backside}} 360' (not caballerial, caballerial is fakie), this is a nollie variation whereby the skateboarder and the skateboard rotate <b>360-degrees</b> after leaving the ground. The trick was invented by Rodney Mullen and {{can be seen in}} the Almost: Round Three video during the section when Mullen is skateboarding on the Hollywood Stars in Los Angeles, California, United States (US).|$|R
50|$|The site's {{navigation}} {{is based}} on areas on the mountain, with users able {{to choose their own}} path. There are 7 main sections on the site, the first one representing the mountain as a whole, in <b>360-degrees,</b> the others representing different sites: the George-Étienne Cartier Monument, the paths and woods, the mountain's cemeteries, the Saint Joseph's Oratory, Beaver Lake and the Mount Royal Cross.|$|R
5|$|Zion Cinema was {{the central}} {{landmark}} of Zion Square from the 1920s until its closure in 1972. Located {{on the south side}} of Zion Square, it was originally a 400-seat silent-movie hut and, after snowfall destroyed the structure, was rebuilt into a 600-seat theatre that staged plays, concerts, lectures, and films. In the 1920s and 1930s the Zion Cinema was the cultural center of Jerusalem. After its closure, the building was demolished and a high-rise containing the Kikar Zion Hotel and a branch of Bank HaPoalim was erected in its place. In 2013 the 117-room hotel was purchased by Orchid Hotel Management Ltd., which is renovating the property for reopening as the Herbert Samuel Hotel. The hotel will have 137 rooms and suites, and a kosher rooftop restaurant with a <b>360-degree</b> panoramic view.|$|E
5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A <b>360-degree</b> setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E
5|$|The JF-17 has a {{defensive}} aids system (DAS) composed of various integrated sub-systems. A radar warning receiver (RWR) provides data such as direction and proximity of enemy radars, and an electronic warfare (EW) suite {{housed in a}} fairing {{at the tip of}} the tail fin interferes with enemy radars. The EW suite is also linked to a Missile Approach Warning (MAW) system to defend against radar-guided missiles. The MAW system uses several optical sensors across the airframe to detect the rocket motors of missiles across a <b>360-degree</b> coverage. Data from the MAW system, such as direction of inbound missiles and the time to impact, is shown on cockpit displays and the HUD. A countermeasures dispensing system releases decoy flares and chaff to help evade hostile radar and missiles. The DAS systems will also be enhanced by integration of a self-protection radar-jamming pod that will be carried externally on a hardpoint.|$|E
50|$|NLR conducts {{research}} on future concepts in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) using its advanced proprietary simulation platform, the NLR ATC Research Simulator (NARSIM). NARSIM {{consists of two}} physical instantiations, one for en-route ATC (NARSIM-Radar) and one for airport tower controllers (NARSIM-Tower) with a <b>360-degrees</b> field-of-view visual system. NARSIM is also used for performance of technology verification and validation activities as well as air traffic controller training.|$|R
5000|$|McNasty {{refers to}} a style of slam dunk in the American sport Slamball. The move {{consists}} of a player launching himself from the outside trampoline, rotating <b>360-degrees</b> and putting the ball between their legs before dunking the ball. The move was originated and made popular by Slamball phenom Sean [...] "inches" [...] Jackson, of the Mob, who used the dunk in the 2002 Slamball dunk contest. A variation known as the reverse McNasty was also used in the contest.|$|R
50|$|A {{system with}} great range {{was needed to}} track the British and American bomber {{formations}} as they crossed Germany. For this function, consultants Theodor Schultes and Hans Hollmann designed an experimental 2.4-m (125-MHz), 30-kW radar called Panorama. Built by Siemens & Halske in 1941, it was placed atop a concrete tower at Tremmen, a few kilometers south of Berlin. The antenna had 18 dipoles on a long, horizontal support and produced a narrow vertical beam; this rotated at 6 rpm to sweep out <b>360-degrees</b> of coverage to about 110 km.|$|R
5|$|The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two {{tracking}} teams {{arrived at}} Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a <b>360-degree</b> search: one {{was from the}} SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while {{the other was a}} British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who was sitting on the bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, behind the wheel, and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{featured}} a <b>360-degree</b> configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside the ramp as well as between the ramp and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E

50|$|The Haunted Swing was {{a notable}} ride during 1894 in the San Francisco Chronicle. It {{was said to}} have caused riders to pray to the biblical saint of their choosing, as most were baffled by how the ride managed to appear to make the room spin <b>360-degrees</b> vertically. Although the room {{surrounding}} the riders caused the riders to feel as though they were spinning, they actually never left a stationary position. The room in which the riders sat spun on an axis, causing the illusion of displacement in the position of the riders.|$|R
5000|$|Radobýl (399 m) is a basalt hill in České středohoří mountains, Czech Republic. It {{rises above}} village of Žalhostice on right {{bank of the}} Elbe River 3 km west of Litoměřice.
