500|$|On set, {{a camera}} rig {{was used to}} capture the {{environment}} of the sequence. Dubbed [...] "enviro-cam", the visual effects crew would mount a Canon EOS 5D and a motorized nodal head, allowing the crew to capture the environment at a <b>360-degree</b> <b>angle</b> with 55k resolution for every shot, the process would take approximately two to four minutes. The set capture resulted in lighting and textures that could be reprojected onto geometry. Full-screen digital doubles were a major component for the fighting sequences. Digital armor was also added, along with the energy-based Kryptonian helmets. Cyberscan and FACS were conducted with the actors, and polarized and non-polarized reference photos were taken. Superman's cape and costume were scanned in high detail—the cape in particular became a direct extensions of Superman's actions.|$|E

50|$|On October 1, 2016, Country megastar Carrie Underwood {{broke the}} record for most {{attended}} concert when she brought her Storyteller Tour: Stories in the Round to the arena. The <b>360-degree</b> <b>angle</b> of the stage stretched across the arena floor, providing all viewers with a good show.|$|E
50|$|The Virtual Reality(VR) Lab {{is one of}} {{the largest}} medical {{training}} virtual reality labs in the U.S. featuring zSpace virtual reality (VR) all-in-one computers on campus. The lab features zSpace Education Systems equipped with stylus pens, 3D glasses, and screens enabling <b>360-degree</b> camera <b>angles.</b> Using these, students can observe and interact with virtual-holographic models and animations.|$|R
50|$|Honda {{introduced}} several 200 cc motorcycles {{with similar}} engines but different body {{variations in the}} 1980s. The model introduced in South Africa and Pakistan {{was known as the}} CD200 RoadMaster. It had a twin cylinder 10-degree cylinder <b>angle</b> with a <b>360-degree</b> crank shaft <b>angle</b> engine which meant the pistons moved together and reached top dead centre (TDC) and bottom dead centre (BDC) at the same time. It was a detuned version of the Honda CD185 twin. The engine had the same bore as the CD185 but low compression pistons (8.8:1) with a bore and stroke of 53.0 x 44.0 mm, compared to 9.0:1 Compression and 53.0 x 41.0 mm for the CD185. The result was less power, a higher fuel economy and a lower top speed. The alternator system was also different from the CD185. Apart from this the models were much similar, using the same frames, suspension, wheels, tyres, and brakes.|$|R
5000|$|Hutcheson {{constructed}} a cylinder from the angle to be trisected by drawing an arc across the angle, completing it as a circle, and constructing from that circle a cylinder on which a, say, equilateral triangle was inscribed (a <b>360-degree</b> <b>angle</b> divided in three). This was then [...] "mapped" [...] onto the angle to be trisected, {{with a simple}} proof of similar triangles.|$|E
