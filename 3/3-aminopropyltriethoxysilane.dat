5|$|CPG is {{commonly}} defined by its pore size. In oligonucleotide chemistry, pore sizes of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000Å {{are used to}} allow the preparation of about 50, 80, 100, 150, and 200-mer oligonucleotides, respectively. To make native CPG suitable for further processing, {{the surface of the}} material is treated with (<b>3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane</b> to give aminopropyl CPG. The aminopropyl arm may be further extended to result in long chain aminoalkyl (LCAA) CPG. The amino group is then used as an anchoring point for linkers suitable for oligonucleotide synthesis (see below).|$|E

5000|$|... (<b>3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane</b> (APTES) is an {{aminosilane}} {{frequently used}} {{in the process of}} silanization, the functionalization of surfaces with alkoxysilane molecules. It can also be used for covalent attaching of organic films to metal oxides such as silica and titania.|$|E
50|$|Vinyltrialkoxysilanes {{are also}} used as a {{coupling}} agents or adhesion promoters for treatment of glass fibers and particulate minerals in order to form stronger bonds with resin and produce fiberglass with better mechanical properties. Amino-functional silanes such as (<b>3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane</b> and epoxy-functional silanes are used for the same purpose. The silane group attaches to the glass substrate via covalent Si-O-Si bond, while the resin reacts with the vinyl-, amino-, or epoxy- group and binds to it.|$|E

50|$|Chemical {{modification}} of surfaces {{has been successfully}} applied in several instances to immobilize proteins {{in order to obtain}} valuable information. For instance, atomic force microscopy imaging of DNA has been performed using mica coated with <b>3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane</b> (APTES). The negatively charged DNA backbone bound strongly to the positive charges on the amine functionality, leading to stable structures that could be imaged both in air and in buffer. In a recent study by Behrens et al., amine-terminated silicon surfaces were successfully used to immobilize bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) for medical purposes (cf. hydrogen-terminated silicon surface). 14 Molecules with amine groups (especially APTES) are important for biological applications, because they allow for simple electrostatic interactions with biomolecules.|$|E
