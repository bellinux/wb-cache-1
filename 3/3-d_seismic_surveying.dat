The area of seismic exploration was immediately adjacent to the Piltun feeding grounds of the endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus). This study investigates relative abundance, behavior, and movement patterns of gray whales in relation to occurrence and proximity to the <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> by employing scan sampling, focal follow, and theodolite tracking methodologies. These data were analyzed in relation to temporal, environmental, and seismic related variables to evaluate potential disturbance reactions of gray whales to the <b>seismic</b> <b>survey.</b> The relative numbers of whales and pods recorded from five shore-based stations were not significantly different during periods when <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> were occurring compared to periods when no <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> were occurring and to the post-seismic period.

Univariate analyses indicated no significant statistical correlation between <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> variables and any of the eleven movement and behavior variables. Multiple regression analyses indicated that, after accounting for temporal and environmental variables, 6 of 11 movement and behavior variables (linearity, acceleration, mean direction, blows per surfacing, and surface-dive blow rate) were not significantly associated with <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> variables, and 5 of 11 variables (leg speed, reorientation rate, distance-from-shore, blow interval, and dive time) were significantly associated with <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> variables. In summary, after accounting for environmental variables, no correlation was found between <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> variables and the linearity of whale movements, changes in whale swimming speed between theodolite fixes, mean direction of whale movement, mean number of whale exhalations per minute at the surface, mean time at the surface, and mean number of exhalations per minute during a whales surface-to-dive cycle. In contrast, at higher received sound energy exposure levels, whales traveled faster, changed directions of movement less, were recorded further from shore, and stayed under water longer between respirations...|$|R

DalMorNefteGeofizika (DMNG), {{on behalf of the}} Sakhalin- 1 consortium, conducted a 3 -D <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> of the Odoptu license area during 17 August-September 2001. A portion of the primary known feeding area of the endangered western gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) is located adjacent to the seismic block. The data presented here were collected as part of daily monitoring to determine if there was any measurable effect of the <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> on the distribution and abundance of western gray whales. Mitigation and monitoring program included aerial surveys conducted between 19 July and 19 November using the methodology outlined by the Southern California High Energy <b>Seismic</b> <b>Survey</b> team (HESS). These surveys provided documentation of the distribution, abundance and bottom feeding activity of western gray whales in relation to <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> sounds. From an operations perspective, the aerial surveys provided near real-time data on the location of whales in and outside the feeding area, and documented whether whales were displaced out of an area normally used as feeding habitat. The objectives of this study were to assess (a) temporal changes in the distribution and abundance of gray whales in relation to <b>seismic</b> <b>survey,</b> and (b) the influence of <b>seismic</b> <b>survey,</b> environmental factors, and other variables on the distribution and abundance of gray whales within their preferred feeding area adjacent to Piltun Bay. Multiple regression analysis revealed a limited redistribution of gray whales southward within the Piltun feeding area when the <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> was fully operational. A total of five environmental and other variables unrelated to <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> (date and proxies of depth, sea state and visibility) and one seismic survey-related variable (seg 3 d, i. e., received sound energy accumulated over 3 days) had statistically significant effects on the distribution and abundance of gray whales. The distribution of two to four gray whales observed on the surface (i. e., about five to ten whales in total) has likely been affected by the <b>seismic</b> <b>survey.</b> However, the total number of gray whales observed within the Piltun feeding area remained stable during the <b>seismic</b> <b>survey...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{is great}} {{interest}} in exploring and exploiting hydrocarbon resources in the Arctic, {{and one of the}} main methods of locating and assessing such resources is <b>seismic</b> <b>survey.</b> Marine <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> involve the use of airguns that introduce high-energy noise to the Arctic’s largely pristine underwater acoustic environment. Narwhals may be particularly sensitive to this noise but so far no studies have addressed the question of direct effects of high-energy airgun pulses on these animals. We are concerned about the possibility that three large recent ice entrapments were causally linked to <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> activities. On these occasions narwhals remained in coastal summering areas until well into the fall and early winter season, delaying their annual offshore migration and becoming lethally entrapped by rapidly forming fast ice. About 1000 narwhals died in an ice entrapment in Canada in 2008 and about 100 in two entrapments in Northwest Greenland in 2009 – 10. We conclude that studies of the direct effects of <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> on narwhals are urgently needed and should ideally precede further <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> in narwhal habitats...|$|R

Sounds from <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> are intense and have peak frequency bands overlapping those used by baleen whales, but evidence of interference with baleen whale acoustic communication is sparse. Here we investigated whether blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) changed their vocal behaviour during a <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> that deployed a low-medium power technology (sparker). We found that blue whales called consistently more on seismic exploration days than on non-exploration days as well as during periods within a <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> day when the sparker was operating. This increase was observed for the discrete, audible calls that are emitted during social encounters and feeding. This response presumably represents a compensatory behaviour to the elevated ambient noise from <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> operations...|$|R

40|$|There {{are seven}} species of sea turtles around the world. Among these, five visit the {{northeast}} coast of Brazil to reproduce and feed. These sea turtles are impacted by human activity and need conservation measures. The <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> {{is one of}} these activities due to its high intensity and low frequency sound emissions in the marine environment. Records of sea turtles during <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> in shallow waters of the northeast of Brazil between 2002 and 2003 are presented in this study with some discussion about the effectiveness of the monitoring procedures. Three species of sea turtle were recorded within the <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> areas. The Chelonia mydas species was the most commonly sighted turtle. There was only one record of Caretta caretta and Lepidochelys olivacea. The presence of sea turtles in Sergipe state was linked to the reproductive period while this pattern was not observed in Ceará state.
