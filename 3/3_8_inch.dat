40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{investigation of}} the cryogenic recovery of tire rubber was conducted with laboratory, pilot plant and industrial equipment. Experiments were conducted with specimens of tire rubber to determine cooling curves for: (1) Scrap tire rubber dipped in liquid nitrogen. (2) Scrap tire rubber cooled by nitrogen vapour. (3) Virgin tire rubber dipped in liquid nitrogen. (4) Different size cubes of tire rubber cooled simultaneously by nitrogen vapour. (5) Tire rubber cooled and then recooled to investigate material degradation. Electron microphotographs of scrap and virgin tire treads were compared in terms of physical characteristics. The used tire rubber specimen appeared to have a granular structure. Air trapped in the interstices hindered the heat transfer process. On the other hand, the virgin tire specimen appeared to be homogeneous. This structure enabled the virgin material to cool at a higher rate. Electron photomicrographs of ambiently and cryogenically ground rubber crumbs were also compared. The ambiently ground rubber displayed more surface area than the cryogenically ground material. This increase {{was created by the}} torn edges of the ambiently ground rubber. The faceted surfaces of the cryogenically processed rubber provide smoother surfaces of lower area. Experimental and theoretical data were used to design a small fine-grind system which was proposed for the processing of <b>3</b> <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> pellets of tire rubber to a fine size less than 30 mesh. When frozen tire chips are passed through a hammermill, an entanglement of steel and nylon fibre results. Separation of this entanglement by various means was thoroughly investigated. Theoretical and experimental data were applied to the modifications of the industrial-size plant in Cambridge, Ontario. The improvements to the industrial system made it more efficient. A number of recommendations have been made for continuation of this basic investigation. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

40|$|Ground {{meal and}} 4 sizes of {{pelleted}} feeds (3 / 16, ¼, <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> and ½ <b>inch</b> diameters) were offered to captive Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris, Linnaeus) {{to determine the}} minimum feed size {{they were unable to}} consume in significant amounts. The ground meal, <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> and ½ <b>inch</b> diameter pellets substantially decreased feed consumption compared with 3 / 16 and ¼ inch diameter pellets. Additionally, ½ inch pellets were consumed substantially less than ground meal or <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> pellets. Supplemental feed was require to prevent mortality among Starlings offered only ½ inch pellets. Two pellet sizes, the 3 / 16 inch pellet which was readily consumed by Starlings and the <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> pellet which was less preferred by the birds, were selected for tests with free ranging Starlings. Field tests comparing consumption of these 2 pellet sizes were conducted in southcentral Kentucky during January and February 1982. Starlings consumed significantly (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) lesser amounts of <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> pellets than <b>3</b> / 16 inch pellets during this test.

40|$|The 6 -Pack Container Pallet is a space-frame structure, {{designed}} by Mason & Hanger Corp. to hold six AL-R 8 containers {{together in a}} convenient bundle. The AL-R 8 containers hold nuclear weapon components that require special care and consideration. The {{primary purpose of the}} 6 -pack assembly is storage, but there is some manipulation as the 6 -pack is loaded, moved and stacked. Recently, there has been an upgrade to a new AL-R 8 -SI container that is heavier than its predecessor was. The analysis discussed herein was conducted to ensure that the increased stresses due to the heavier containers are within design safety limits. At this time, however, there is disagreement as to what the strength requirements for the 6 -pack pallet are. Depending on which classification applies to the structure, a factor of safety (yield stress over design stress) of 3. 0 or more may need to be satisfied. This report documents strength analyses of loaded 6 -packs performed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The entire 6 -pack assembly was discretized into a mesh with a total of 38682 first-order finite elements. The stresses were found for four characteristic load cases using the implicit code NIKE 3 D. This was a static strength analysis only. Dynamic loading was not considered. Stability, also, was not addressed. There are two 6 -pack pallet designs under consideration: one that uses 1 / 2 inch diameter bolts and one with <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> bolts. In both cases, the maximum torque applied to the bolts is 55 in-lbf. This analysis finds the minimum factor of safety based on yield to be less than 3. 0 in the main load path of both the 1 / 2 <b>inch</b> and <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> diameter bolt designs. In general, the peak stresses found in the 1 / 2 inch bolt design are less than those of the <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> bolt design. At the welded ends of the main tube section that spans the length of the pallet, the minimum safety factor is 2. 14 when 1 / 2 inch bolts are used and 1. 77 when <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> bolts are used. Minimum safety factors of 1. 91 and 1. 78 were found around the bolt holes in the lateral supports in the 1 / 2 inch bolt and <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> bolt designs, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The 241 -SY- 101 {{waste storage}} tank at the Hanford-Site {{has been known}} to {{accumulate}} and release significant quantities of hydrogen gas. An analysis was performed to assess the tank`s structural integrity when subjected to postulated hydrogen deflagration loads. The analysis addressed many nonlinearities and appealed to a strain-based failure criteria. The model used to predict the global response of the tank was not refined enough to confidently predict local peak strains. Strain concentration factors were applied at structural discontinuities that were based on steel-lined reinforced-concrete containment studies. The discontinuities included large penetrations, small penetrations, springline geometries, stud/liner connections, and the { 1 / 2 } <b>inch</b> to <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> liner thickness transition. The only tank specific strain concentration factor applied in the evaluation was for the { 1 / 2 } <b>inch</b> to <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> liner thickness change in the dome. Review of the tank drawings reveals the possibility that a 4 inches Sch. 40 pipe penetrates the dome thickness transition region. It is not obvious how to combine the strain concentration factors for a small penetration with that of a thickness transition to arrive at a composite strain concentration factor. It is the goal of this effort to make an approximate determination of the relative significance of the 4 inch penetration and the { 1 / 2 } <b>inch</b> to <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> thickness transition in the 241 -SY- 101 dome geometry. This is accomplished by performing a parametric study with three general finite-element models.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine if}} the preparation of a cattle finishing ration has any effect on its digestibility and feed efficiency. Twenty head of yearling Hereford steers were individually fed for 140 days. The steers were divided into five treatments of four animals each. All rations contained the same ingredients and differed only in the way they were prepared. The five rations were prepared as follows: (1) ground through 1 / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> screen and pelleted, (2) ground through 2 / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> screen and pelleted, (3) ground through <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> screen and pelleted, (4) ground through <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> screen pelleted and reground, (5) ground very course and not pelleted. The rations contained 67 percent No. 2 yellow corn, 25 percent sun cured baled alfalfa hay, 2. 5 percent soybean oil meal, 5 percent molasses and 0. 5 percent dicalcium phosphate. Each steer received as much feed as it could readily consume without wastage. The chromic oxide technique was used in determining the apparent digestibility coefficients. Digestibility of crude fiber was significantly higher in the coarsely ground ration than in the pelleted rations. Regrinding the pelleted ration reduced the digestibility of the other extract in the ration. No significant difference was found in the digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and energy; however, the regrinding of the <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inch</b> ground and pelleted ration (Ration 4) resulted in lower digestion coefficients for these nutrients. There {{was no significant difference in}} rate of gain or efficiency of feed utilization between treatments; however, animal variation was great within treatments. Steers fed Rations 3 and 5 had the highest intakes, feed efficiencies and gains. The feed required per 100 pounds of gain was 857, 921, 787, 837, and 794 pounds respectively for Rations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The average daily gains were 2. 42, 2. 23, 2. 76, 2. 43, and 2. 79 pounds, respectively. With the exception of the digestibility of crude fiber, grinding and pelleting had no effect on the digestibility and feed efficiency of the cattle finishing ration used in this experiment. Crude fiber digestibility was lowered. Regrinding the pelleted ration lowered the digestibility of all the nutrients except crude fiber; however, ether extract was the only one that was significantly lowered. Advisor: Donald C.

The opening of the can is approximately 4 <b>3</b> / <b>8</b> <b>inches</b> (111. 13 mm). This HIC is primarily designed to contain items in the DOE SNF inventory that do not meet acceptance standards for direct disposal in a geologic repository. This includes fuel in the form of particulate dusts, sectioned pieces of fuel, core rubble, melted or degraded (non-intact) fuel elements, unclad uranium alloys, metallurgical specimens, and chemically reactive fuel components. The HIC is intended to act as a substitute cladding for the spent nuclear fuel, further isolate problematic materials, provide a long-term corrosion barrier, and add an extra internal pressure barrier for the waste package. The HIC will also delay potential fission product release and maintain geometry control for extended periods of time. For the entire disposal package to be licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a HIC must effectively eliminate the disposal problems associated with problem SNF including the release of radioactive and/or reactive material and over pressurization of the HIC due to chemical reactions within the can. Two HICs were analyzed to envelop a range of can lengths between 42 and 101 inches. Using Abacus software, the HIC's were analyzed for end, side, and corner drops.
