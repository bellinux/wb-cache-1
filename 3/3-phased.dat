50|$|In 2003, heavy {{corrosion}} damages {{were found}} below the sidewalks. According to another report in September 2005, the sidewalks were completely blocked for safety reasons and the city's Council decided the reconstruction and widening {{at the earliest}} possible moment. Subsequently, the funding of the 40 million Euro has been guaranteed. The <b>3-phased</b> reconstruction (north side, south side, road surface) began on April 16, 2007 and should be completed in April 2010 (later delayed to July 2011). After the reconstruction the bridge is 10 meters wider than before (26.80 meters in total).Until the completion the whole traffic (cars and tram) was contracted to the two central lanes. Pedestrians and cyclists had {{to use one of}} the closed road lanes (depending on the reconstructed bridge side).|$|E
