40|$|Presented is {{work on the}} {{development}} of the Supernumerary Robotic Limbs project, headed by Federico Parietti in the d'Arbeloff Labs under Prof. Harry Asada. Specifically, this paper focuses on the integration of lightweight, pneumatic systems for prismatic joint actuation, and the various control schemes studied. This joint serves as the leg of the robot, and extends from the hip of the wearer to contact the ground. The design consists of a two-way pneumatic cylinder inside a load bearing carbon fiber sleeve, actuated with a nominally closed 5 - <b>3</b> <b>way</b> solenoid <b>valve,</b> and weighs in at < 1 kg per actuator. The positional control scheme is closed via tracking from a linear magnetopotentiometer, while the force control scheme utilizes both the positional tracking as well as a load cell at the foot of the leg. System modeling of the actuator dynamics allowed for development of a model based proportional control method. Optimization of the proportional gain and system delay time produced a rise time of 200 ms given a step input command for a 250 mm stroke. The developed scheme was implemented in the full wearable system to assist a human support weight in crouched positions and standing up from a sitting position. Initial testing has shown the effectiveness of the power, compactness and compliance of pneumatic systems in a wearable robotic device. by Roger Lo. Thesis: S.

40|$|The final master thesis {{analyzes}} {{the system of}} temperature regulation of the heat exchanger. The Simulink model of the heat transfer medium is made. The designed system consists: of condensing heat exchanger, four <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> with drive, circulation pumps, heater, regulator. The main objective of the research is to design PID and fuzzy regulators that would control {{the position of the}} four <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> in the contour of temperature regulation of the condensing heat exchanger. While applying the quality indicators of automated regulation, such as stability of regulation, re-regulation, duration of the transitional time, the conclusion is drawn which regulator is more suitable for this system. The objective of the designed valve regulator is to maintain the chosen, stable temperature that is transferred to the condensing heat exchanger regardless of the load of the boiler and changing temperature. The output signal directly sets the position of the four <b>way</b> <b>valve.</b> This method of regulation has impact on the environmental and energy indicators of the boiler...|$|R
30|$|Stingray – Automated {{microfluidic}} system. The {{device is}} a versatile automated {{system that allows}} for control of variety of processes performed on a microfluidic chip. The system makes possible operations like precise mixing, separation, extraction or small-scale nanoparticle formation. It consists of 3 independent inlets for 3 different mobile phases with an in-built degasser, 4 peek solenoid valves, 2 independent nano piston pumps, 2 selectors (6 / 7), 2 manual inject valves with 100 μl loop volume (adjustable), 2 / 10 valve, 3 check valves and unique automated manifold for inserting microfluidic chip. This platform offers enough variability of reaction parameters and allows for a repeated return of a sample to the microfluidic chip. It may enhance the yield dramatically. CRAB – versatile platform for separation, formulation and simple labelling processes. The main parts of the system are two reactors, two selectors, peristaltic pump, <b>3</b> / 2 <b>way</b> <b>valves,</b> and the column. Prime reactor R 1 allows for transport solid target material from shielding container to process position and for handling liquid target content. It is leak-proof for 5 bars. There is an in-built solid phase extraction (SPE) column for separation processes driven by peristaltic pump and solvents. Four positions are available for uploading the solvents into the reactor R 1 or on the SPE column. Splitting the separated radionuclide from the target matrix, including enriched material, is enabled thanks to the smart software checking the column output activity and controlling the splitting valves position. Final activity concentration can be precisely set via the case software without losses {{on the walls of}} reactor R 2. There are 3 positions for uploading the solvents to the reactor R 2 for formulation or for simple labelling steps like chelation.|$|R

50|$|A rotary {{compression}} pump works in cycles. Over each cycle a volume is created {{in contact with}} the chamber where pressure is to be lowered. By random motion, molecules from the vacuum chamber pass into the volume created by the pump. This volume is then cut off from the chamber and compressed in contact with a one <b>way</b> <b>valve.</b> If the volume is compressed enough some of the molecules will pass through the valve.|$|R
50|$|Fetal aortic {{stenosis}} is a disorder {{that occurs when}} the fetus’ aortic valve does not fully open during development. The aortic valve is a one <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> that is located between the left ventricle and the aorta, keeping blood from leaking back into the ventricle. It has three leaflets that separate when the ventricle contracts to allow blood {{to move from the}} ventricle to the aorta. These leaflets come together when the ventricle relaxes.|$|R

In 2002, several types of continuously independent one <b>way</b> air <b>valve</b> films were introduced, such as [...] by 3M. These patents incorporated a one <b>way</b> air <b>valve</b> film, which can be produced continuously and independently. If one air tube is punctured, the other air tubes will still remain inflated.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Radiometals {{are finding}} {{more and more}} {{applications}} in molecular imaging and targeted therapy. For PET imaging, all the novel radiometals are directly or indirectly produced on cyclotrons. Key step in their production is achieving proper radionuclidic, radiochemical and chemical purity, as well as high specific activity. Automation of the process enhances reproducibility, shortens necessary operations and decreases radiation burden. We have, therefore, developed universal radio-metal automated laboratory workbench (RALW) that is focused on separation processes from solid and liquid (solution) targets via solid phase extraction (SPE). Material and Methods RALW is versatile platform for separation, formulation and simple labeling processes. The following FIG. 1 displays its basic scheme. RALW´s main parts are: two reactors, two selec-tors, peristaltic pump, <b>3</b> / 2 <b>way</b> <b>valves,</b> and separation column. Prime reactor R 1 is designed to carry out several functions. It can transport solid target material from shielding container to process position, or handle liquid target filling. In both cases, the reactor is leakagefree up to 5 bars. There are 4 positions available to bring solvents to the reactor 1 or applying on a SPE column according to the separation sequence with use of peristaltic pump. Smart software allows for collecting defined fractions leaving the column, e. g. enriched target matrix and the desired radionuclide, by monitoring activity profile and controlling the splitting valves. The system also minimizes losses during transport of the solvents/fractions to the reactor R 2 and the software also controls final volume settings (activity concentration) of the product. Up to three positions are available for bringing solvents/solutions to the reactor R 2 for formulation or simple labeling steps like chelation. The system’s hardware is driven by a PLC and I/O cards. The PLC is placed outside the module to avoid radiation damage. The module, PLC and host PC communicate via an Ethernet cable. This solution significantly reduced number of cables connecting the module with other component in the control chain. The PLC is controlled via host PC equipped with userfriendly interface. Results and Conclusion The presented RPLW system is rather versatile tool for separation of metal radionuclides and simple postprocessing (formulation/labelling) of the product in stable environment and easy control mechanisms. The RPLW operating prototype is shown on the FIG. 2...|$|R

It works by an [...] "anti-vacuum skirt" [...] {{in the base}} of the teat, where it forms a seal with the bottle. The skirt acts as a one <b>way</b> <b>valve,</b> allowing air to enter the bottle but not liquids to leave. If the sealing ring is tightened too much, the skirt is compressed too tightly to allow it to open and the bottle will not vent. If the sealing ring is too loose, liquid leaks from the bottle.|$|R
5000|$|Fernez's first {{idea was}} a rubber balloon {{connected}} to the swimmer's mouth with a tube. The idea was that this would provide a reservoir of air which could be breathed in and out. But Fernez quickly realised that this worked for {{only two or three}} breaths. His next idea was to use a flexible rubber tube connecting the diver's mouth to an air intake on the surface supported by a float. Fernez registered a patent on this invention on 14 May 1912, which was granted on 22 July 1912. The swimmer's end of the tube had a T shaped mouthpiece, one side {{connected to the}} air hose through a one <b>way</b> (non-return) <b>valve,</b> the other side to an exhaust with a [...] "duck bill" [...] check valve. Fernez's idea was that the divers normal inhalation would be sufficient to draw air down the tube through the one <b>way</b> <b>valve,</b> and his exhalation to expel used air through the exhaust.|$|R

50|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} problems with these valves. One {{is that the}} chest tube can clog. When chest tube clogging occurs, the pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema can recur. This {{can also lead to}} empyema. The other is that these tend to leak fluid. To address this, some have turned to small chest drainage alternatives, such as the Atrium Express Mini 500 or the Teleflex Mini Sahara. An alternative solution is to attach a sputum trap to the valve, thus providing a reservoir to capture the draining fluid. The Atrium Pneumostat chest drain valve combines a one <b>way</b> <b>valve</b> and a 30cc collection chamber to address this issue.|$|R
