40|$|Recently {{pedestrian}} navigation {{has been}} studied by many researchers, which provides pedestrians with a similar function of car navigation. On the other hand, a 3 -dimensional (<b>3</b> D) <b>map,</b> {{which is one of}} major themes in machine vision research, has been utilized as a simulation tool in city and landscape planning, and other engineering fields. The <b>3</b> D <b>maps</b> will give more intuitive information compared to conventional 2 -dimensional (2 D) ones. In this paper we first propose pedestrian navigation based on <b>3</b> D <b>maps,</b> and describe technologies required and its use situations. Secondly we compare effectiveness of 2 D and <b>3</b> D <b>maps</b> for navigation by object search experiments under conditions: <b>3</b> D <b>maps</b> with and without texture; display sizes corresponding to a mobile phone and PDA (Personal Digital Assistant). The experimental results show that <b>3</b> D <b>maps</b> with texture on mobile phone display size, and <b>3</b> D <b>maps</b> without texture on PDA display size are superior to 2 D maps in search time and error rate. From these results, we can say the effectiveness of <b>3</b> D <b>maps</b> in pedestrian navigation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Research {{objective}} of the authors is <b>3</b> D <b>map</b> building and localization of search robot for rescue use. In this paper, the authors propose a novel method of dense <b>3</b> D <b>map</b> building and present its trial result. For building a map, {{it is necessary to}} estimate robot motion. However, on rubble, it is difficult to estimate robot motion by using odometry or gyro. Therefore, in this framework, rough <b>3</b> D <b>map</b> and discrete robot motions are derived using SLAM based on 3 D scan matching. ICP algorithm is used for the matching method. Then, the dense <b>3</b> D <b>map</b> is reconstructed from the rough <b>3</b> D <b>map</b> and texture images...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has {{proposed}} and demonstrated a new <b>3</b> D <b>map</b> which is realistic image-based, thus enabling geometry measurements and geo-location services. First {{and most important}} work {{of this study is}} the implementation of positioning and spatial measurements with image-based <b>3</b> D <b>maps,</b> while current image-based <b>3</b> D <b>maps</b> like Google Street View only provide virtual experience in terms of photos in which a number of details representing the topographic and terrain attributes are all lost, such as shapes and heights. Another contribution relates to quality analysis for a MRI <b>3</b> D <b>map.</b> The research has deeply analyzed outlier impacts and introduced Dilution of Precision (DOP) values which are used to evaluate geometry quality for geo-referenced images either or measured vision points. In addition, the thesis has conducted a loose integration of mapping sensors like camera and GPS, and investigated image matching and stitching. The thesis has also proposed image-based <b>3</b> D <b>maps</b> cooperated with Street View, in that panoramic viewing could make <b>3</b> D <b>maps</b> more interactive with users, also bring an interesting immersive circumstance. This study has mainly focused on vision point positioning and implementation of spatial measurements on the MRI <b>3</b> D <b>map,</b> analysis of data quality, outlier detection, and image processing. Users could obtain their orientation, position and object distance over basic functions of the MRI <b>3</b> D <b>map.</b> A prototype geo-referencing system has been designed for the implementation of the MRI <b>3</b> D <b>mapping...</b>|$|R
