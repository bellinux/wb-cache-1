5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with <b>3D</b> <b>printing</b> equipment. The parts included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, {{with some of the}} parts costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, <b>3D</b> <b>printing</b> already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E

25|$|As 3D {{printers}} {{became more}} accessible to consumers, online social platforms have developed to support the community. This includes websites that allow users to access information {{such as how to}} build a 3D printer, as well as social forums that discuss how to improve 3D print quality and discuss <b>3D</b> <b>printing</b> news, as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models. RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on <b>3d</b> <b>printing,</b> and has developed into a community that aims to bring <b>3D</b> <b>printing</b> to everyone. Furthermore, there are other sites such as Pinshape, Thingiverse and MyMiniFactory, which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print, allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing 3D files. These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users, creating communities dedicated to <b>3D</b> <b>printing.</b>|$|E

30|$|It is {{controversial}} {{that the cost}} of construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> is lower than the conventional construction in academic field. The reason is that some scholars have confused attributes between construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> and traditional construction. The cost calculation of construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> cannot follow the rules in conventional construction because construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> was identified as both industrial product and construction product. This paper proposed a new approach to cost calculation of construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> concerning both the properties of industrial and construction product. The cost elements and calculation methods of onsite and offsite <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> were discussed and concluded. The comparison of cost composition among conventional construction, onsite construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing,</b> and offsite construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> was presented as well. The paper put forward the idea of cost calculation about industrialized construction, and it solved the problems of cost calculation among different construction technologies.|$|R

Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by <b>3D</b> <b>printing.</b> Popular materials to print include Polyamide, steel and wax (latter for further processing).

40|$|International {{audience}} <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> {{technology has}} been available as early as in the 19 th century. The present article therefore asks why the probably disruptive innovation of <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> has been observed as only incremental innovation for so long time. We assume that this incrementalization of the supposed key to the next industrial revolution occurred due to the technologys paradox nature. We hence start form a form-theoretical observation of the inherently paradox nature of observation, subsequent to which we observe <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> as both form and medium. In doing so, we will show that suppliers of <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> solutions currently try to sell <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> as form, whereas demanders observe <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> as medium. In focussing the latter side of the distinction, we finally suggest {{that the key to}} successful <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> business models will be in solutions that relate observations of the technological multifunctionality of <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> to a social multifunctionality lens...|$|R

25|$|By {{the early}} 2010s, the terms <b>3D</b> <b>printing</b> and {{additive}} manufacturing evolved senses {{in which they}} were alternate umbrella terms for AM technologies, one being used in popular vernacular by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial AM end-use part producers, AM machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations. Until recently, the term <b>3D</b> <b>printing</b> has been associated with machines low-end in price or in capability. Both terms reflect that the technologies share the theme of sequential-layer material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control. Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of Additive Manufacturing magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often synonymous in casual usage but that some manufacturing industry experts are increasingly making a sense distinction whereby AM comprises <b>3D</b> <b>printing</b> plus other technologies or other aspects of a manufacturing process.|$|E

40|$|Rapid prototyping, {{also known}} as <b>3</b> D <b>printing,</b> is a rapidly growing tool used {{in the field of}} engineering. <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> enables {{engineers}} to quickly produce components for testing or manufacturing purposes. While engineers take advantage of the benefits of <b>3</b> D <b>printing,</b> there are also drawbacks, one of which concerns the plastic filament used for the <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> process. New spools of plastic filament are expensive, and the printing process generates plastic waste in the form of support structure material inside the printed objects. Additionally, failed prints contribute to wasted plastic filament. Valparaiso University’s College of Engineering uses <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> in numerous ways, such as supporting senior design projects, undergraduate research, and as a recruitment tool for new engineering students. To better align <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> within Valparaiso University’s mission for sustainability, this project will design and build an economical, sustainable device capable of recycling <b>3</b> D <b>printed</b> plastic waste into new filament to be reused for printing...|$|R
40|$|For <b>3</b> D <b>printed</b> objects, {{research}} into the knowledge of design has increased {{in the past decade}} due to advances in digitization and <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> technologies.
