The resulting nitrogen induced GaAs(001) (<b>3</b> × <b>3)</b> <b>reconstruction</b> was investigated by in situ reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS).

RESULTS: <b>3</b> D <b>reconstruction</b> allows measurements to be obtained that {{can be difficult to}} determine using 2 D images. This method complements traditional 2 D approaches. Reconstructions also provided imaging of potential anatomical problems. Wall stress results showed key regions that may be possible rupture sites.

40|$|For several {{applications}} of close-range photogrammetry, {{there is a}} growing interest in systems that are able to automatically perform a <b>3</b> -D <b>reconstruction</b> of objects from stereo correspondences on CCD camera views. For such applications, a full- <b>3</b> D <b>reconstruction</b> of the object is often very desirable. In fact, most automatic systems for <b>3</b> -D <b>reconstruction</b> based on stereo matching can only reconstruct the front side of the imaged scene. In order to obtain a full- <b>3</b> D <b>reconstruction,</b> it is necessary to observe the scene from several significant viewpoints. Furthermore, an exact determination of position and orientation of the cameras for all considered viewpoints (camera-motion) becomes crucial.

No special positioning devices are needed as the camera-motion is retrieved for each position of the trinocular system from stereo-matching of unconstrained fiducial marks...|$|R

40|$|Summary. <b>3</b> d <b>reconstruction</b> from {{a single}} image is {{inherently}} an ambiguous problem. Yet {{when we look at}} a picture, we can often infer 3 d information about the scene. Humans perform single-image <b>3</b> d <b>reconstructions</b> by using a variety of singleimage depth cues, for example, by recognizing objects and surfaces, and reasoning about how these surfaces are connected to each other. In this paper, we focus on the problem of automatic <b>3</b> d <b>reconstruction</b> of indoor scenes, specifically ones (sometimes called “Manhattan worlds”) that consist mainly of orthogonal planes. We use a Markov random field (MRF) model to identify the different planes and edges in the scene, as well as their orientations. Then, an iterative optimization algorithm is applied to infer the most probable position of all the planes, and thereby obtain a <b>3</b> d <b>reconstruction.</b> Our approach is fully automatic—given an input image, no human intervention is necessary to obtain an approximate <b>3</b> d <b>reconstruction.</b> ...|$|R
