5|$|Grim Fandango is an {{adventure}} game developed {{and published by}} LucasArts in 1998 for Microsoft Windows, with Tim Schafer as the game's project leader. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use <b>3D</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> overlaid on pre-rendered, static backgrounds. As with other LucasArts adventure games, the player must converse with other characters and examine, collect, and use objects correctly to solve puzzles in order to progress.|$|E
5|$|New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling video game. While {{it is seen}} in 2D, most of the {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect that visually simulates <b>3D</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> The player can play as either Mario, or his brother, Luigi. Similar to previous Mario games, Mario (or Luigi) can collect coins, stomp on enemies, and break open blocks. Moves from 3D games featuring Mario reappear in New Super Mario Bros., including the ground pound, triple jump, and wall jump. Enemies from previous games, such as Boos, are also reintroduced.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Recently, {{affordable}} <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> boards {{have made}} possible the display of the <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> models on personal computers. Many web sites and software applications use photo realistic <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> images which are rendered with solid textures. Solid textures are important data for <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics,</b> {{and they have been}} used for synthesizing realistic patterns, including stone, clouds, wood grain, fire, terrain, and smoke. Our solid texture analysis technique allows users to classify a database of solid textures based on texture pattern similarities. Our experimental system extracts HLAC (higher order local autocorrelations) shape features from solid textures, and these shape features are analyzed based on a memory-based reasoning approach. By using this memory-based reasoning approach, the system can successfully learn the characteristics of shape features, and can classify textures into several categories effectively. Since this classification technique can learn shape features from data, the system can flexibly recognize various types of solid textures without changing the system program...|$|R

5|$|After {{creating}} custom plugins for the <b>3D</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> software, Burrows {{claimed that}} the team could create and test entire race tracks within five minutes. The custom plugin used for creating tracks consisted of a 450 kilobyte file, which contained polygon subdividing and data on artificial intelligence, effectively cutting down the time to create tracks from six hours to five minutes. In order to the play the game as soon as possible, the team developed the user interface in the XML markup language, which allowed revisions {{to be made for}} the content at any time. However, Burrows recalled that the only downside to converting everything to XML was that the game was always in danger of becoming too large for the PlayStation Portable's Universal Media Disc. The game's cover art was designed by Popgun, who also designed the logos for games released by EA Sports.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Gerry Anderson {{supervised}} {{the production of}} a short computer-animated test film, Captain Scarlet and the Return of the Mysterons, to explore the possibility of updating a number of his 1960s Supermarionation series for a 21st-century audience. The working title was Captain Scarlet – The New Millennium. Produced in London by the Moving Picture Company, the film features Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop reprising the roles of Captains Scarlet and Blue. Made using a combination of Maya <b>3D</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> software and motion-capture technology, the plot commences a few years after the Mysterons end their hostilities against Earth, but the reappearance of Captain Black sets the stage for a revival of the war with Mars.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} topic of recreating Chinese ink-and-brush {{painting}} in <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> and introducing film lighting aesthetics into the result. The method is primarily based on non-photorealistic shader development and digital compositing. The goal {{of this research is}} to study how to bing the visual aesthetics of Chinese ink-and-brush painting into <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> as well as explore the artistic possibility of using film lighting principles in Chinese painting for visual story telling by using <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> In this research, we use the Jiangnan water country paintings by renowned contemporary Chinese artist Yang Ming-Yi as our primary visual reference. An analysis of the paintings is performed to study the visual characteristics of Yang's paintings. These include how the artist expresses shading, forms, shadow, reflection and compositing principles, which will be used as the guidelines for recreating the painting in <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> <b>3</b> D meshes are used to represent the subjects in the painting like houses, boats and water. Then procedural non-photorealistic shaders are developed and applied on 3 D meshes to give the models an ink-look. Additionally, different types of 3 D data are organized and rendered into different layers, which include shading, depth, and geometric information. Those layers are then composed together by using 2 D image processing algorithms with custom artistic controls to achieve a more natural-looking ink-painting result. As a result, a short animation of Chinese ink-and-brush painting in <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> will be created in which the same environment is rendered with different lighting designs to demonstrate the artistic intention...|$|R

5|$|Ideas {{from the}} Deep, now {{formally}} established as id Software, {{used some of}} these to prototype ideas for their own games. Adrian Carmack used them to push his preferred, dark art style, while John Carmack began to experiment with <b>3D</b> <b>computer</b> <b>graphics,</b> which until then was largely the purview of flight simulation games such as Wing Commander (1990). Carmack found that this was {{largely due to the}} limitations of personal computers of the time, which had difficulty displaying a fast action game in 3D due to the number of surfaces it needed to calculate. During 1991, he experimented with limiting the possible surfaces the computer needed to display, creating game levels with walls designed only on a flat grid rather than with arbitrary shapes or angles. He also took the unusual approach of creating the displayed graphics through ray casting, in which only the surfaces visible to the player were calculated rather than the entire area surrounding the player. After six weeks of development, Carmack had created a rudimentary 3D game engine that used animated 2D sprites for enemies. Id Software then used the engine for the April 1991 Softdisk game Hovertank 3D, in which the player drives a tank through a plane of colored walls and shoots nuclear monsters. In the fall of 1991, after the team—sans Wilbur—had relocated to Madison, Wisconsin, and he had largely finished the engine work for Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy, Carmack learned about , a role-playing game in development by Blue Sky Productions. Ultima Underworld was planned to display texture-mapped 3D graphics without Hovertanks restrictions of flat walls and simple lighting. Deciding that he could add texture mapping without sacrificing the engine's speed or greatly increasing the system requirements as Underworld was doing, Carmack enhanced the engine over six weeks from Hovertank 3D for another Softdisk game, the November 1991 Catacomb 3-D. Upon seeing it, Scott Miller of Apogee began to push the team to make a 3D shareware action game.|$|E

40|$|Osmose is an {{immersive}} virtual environment, {{produced by}} Softimage in 1994 / 95. One {{of the primary}} goals of Osmose was to push the expressive capabilities of existing 3 D tools, to demonstrate that an alternative aesthetic and interactive sensibility is possible for real-time, interactive, <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> Osmose was created {{under the direction of}} Char Davies, the Director of Visual Research at Softimage. A former painter, as well as a creator of <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphic</b> stills, Davies has a particular artistic vision which has driven the project. Davies has been striving for years to represent space as a luminous enveloping medium. This has led her from painting to <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics,</b> and finally into creating immersive virtual spaces. One of Davies'intentions for Osmose was to create a space that is “psychically innovating,” one in which, to quote Bachelard, participants do not change “place,” but change their own nature. Osmose was therefore designed to explore the potential of immersive virtual space to allow participants to shed their habitual ways of looking at (and behaving in) the world. By doing this, we hoped they would then emerge from the virtual world to experience the real world in a fresh way, reawakening a fundamental sense of their own “being-in-the-world. ” We hoped that this could be accomplished through the visual, aural and interactive aesthetic of the work...|$|R

40|$|Mapping of {{volcanic}} activities or events during eruptions such as lava flow, pyroclastic flow, mudflow and etc. at real time basis {{is very important}} to monitor and predict movement of these events, and prevent calamity. These events are usually dynamic and occur in short time duration. In this study, a real time volcanic activity mapping system, using single ground fixed digital camera, is developed. An automatic mapping system is designed for real time monitoring. This system produces orthophotos as final outputs from digital landscape images. Once a digital landscape image is obtained, the final output is generated concurrently. A digital landscape photo is rectified into <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> to obtain texture image with fixed location and attitude.

Rectification is done by skyline matching between the edge of a skyline in the digital landscape image and in the <b>3</b> D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics.</b> The rectified digital landscape image is converted to an orthophoto map using DEM. Through this system, volcanic activity is automatically mapped as orthophoto on real time basis.

40|$|Introduction <b>Computer</b> <b>graphics</b> is {{confined}} chiefly to flat images. Images may look three-dimensional (3 -D), and sometimes {{create the illusion}} of 3 -D when displayed, for example, on a stereoscopic display [1 - 3]. Nevertheless, when viewing an image on most display systems, the human visual system (HVS) sees a flat plane of pixels. Volumetric displays can create a <b>3</b> -D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> image, but fail to provide many visual depth cues (e. g., shading, texture gradients) and cannot provide the powerful depth cue of overlap (occlusion). Discrete parallax displays (such as lenticular displays) promise to create 3 -D images with all of the depth cues, but are limited by achievable resolution. Only a real-time electronic holographic ("holovideo") display [4 - 12] can create a truly <b>3</b> -D <b>computer</b> <b>graphics</b> image with all of the depth cues (motion parallax, ocular accommodation, occlusion, etc.) and resolution sufficient to provide extreme realism [2].
