40|$|AbstractDown {{syndrome}} (DS) is {{the most}} frequent genetic cause of intellectual disability characterized {{by the presence of}} three copies of chromosome 21 (Chr 21). Individuals with DS have sufficient neuropathology for a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) after the age of 40 years. The aim of our study is to gain new insights in the molecular mechanisms impaired in DS subjects that eventually lead to the development of dementia. We evaluate the PI <b>3</b> K/Akt/mTOR <b>axis</b> in the frontal cortex from DS cases (under the age of 40 years) and DS with AD neuropathology compared with age-matched controls (Young and Old). The PI <b>3</b> K/Akt/mTOR <b>axis</b> may control several key pathways involved in AD that, if aberrantly regulated, affect amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition and tau phosphorylation. Our results show a hyperactivation of PI <b>3</b> K/Akt/mTOR <b>axis</b> in individuals with DS, with and without AD pathology, in comparison with respective controls. The PI 3 K/Akt/mTOR deregulation results in decreased autophagy, inhibition of IRS 1 and GSK 3 β activity. Moreover, our data suggest that aberrant activation of the PI <b>3</b> K/Akt/mTOR <b>axis</b> acts in parallel to RCAN 1 in phosphorylating tau, in DS and DS/AD. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the neuropathological mechanisms that may be engaged during the development of AD in DS. We suggest that deregulation of this signaling cascade is already evident in young DS cases and persist in the presence of AD pathology. The impairment of the PI <b>3</b> K/Akt/mTOR <b>axis</b> in DS population might represent a key-contributing factor to the neurodegenerative process that culminates in Alzheimer-like dementia...|$|R

40|$|The crystal in {{cubic system}} {{contains}} four 3 -fold axes with different orientations, whereas the rhombohedral modification with the face-centred pseudo cubic cell contains only one ‘true’ <b>3</b> -fold <b>axis.</b> The discrimination of the ‘true’ <b>3</b> -fold <b>axis</b> {{from the other}} three ‘pseudo’ 3 -fold axes is not difficult when the rhombohedral distortion is large. However, the difficulty increases as the distortion becomes small and the cell dimensions become very close to values of ‘metrically cubic’. This note first summarizes the geometrical relation among the face-centred pseudo cubic, primitive rhombohedral, and triple-hexagonal cells. Then it provides a procedure to choose the ‘true’ <b>3</b> -fold <b>axis,</b> and accordingly the ‘true’ rhombohedral cell, from the experimentally-obtained face-centred pseudo cubic cell.

The gold nanoparticles were grown within the host glass by thermal annealing over various lengths of time, achieving diameters lower than 1. 6 nm. The resonance wavelengths, determined theoretically and experimentally, are 770 and 800 nm. The absorption wavelength of nanoparticles was determined by using the Frohlich condition. Gold nanoparticles provide tunable emission resulting in a large enhancement for the 2 H 11 / 2 → 4 I 13 / 2 (emission at 805 nm) and 4 S 3 / 2 → 4 I 13 / 2 (emission at 840 nm) electronic transitions of Er 3 + ions; this {{is associated with the}} quantum yield of the energy transfer process. The excitation pathways, up-conversion and luminescence spectra of Er 3 + ions are described through simplified energy level diagrams.
