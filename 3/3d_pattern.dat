The gain relative to an isotropic antenna (dBi), front-to-back ratio, standing wave ratio and the general reception pattern are all evident from these numbers.

30|$|The {{subjects}} also specified {{the kind}} of difficulties they faced during framework development.

In contrast, the most common difficulties faced by the use of F 3 T were: 1) lack of practice with the tool; and 2) some actions in the tool interface, for instance, there are many steps in order to open the F 3 model editor. The subjects said that the F <b>3</b> <b>patterns</b> helped them to identify the necessary structures to implement the frameworks manually. They also said F 3 T automatized the tasks of identifying which F <b>3</b> <b>patterns</b> should be used as well as of implementing the framework source-code.

We {{examined}} the isoform patterns of VEGF mRNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in 61 colon cancers. All the colon cancers examined expressed VEGF 121. The isoform patterns were classified into three groups: type 1, VEGF 121; type 2, VEGF 121 + VEGF 165; type 3, VEGF 121 + VEGF 165 + VEGF 189. Three of the 61 colon cancers examined showed type 1 expression, 26 showed type 2 expression and 32 showed the type <b>3</b> <b>pattern.</b> The patients with liver metastases showed the type <b>3</b> isoform expression <b>pattern</b> at a significantly higher incidence (12 of 16, 75 %) than those without liver metastasis (20 of 45, 44 %) (P= 0. 036).

It is worthy of attention because its structure {{is similar to the}} linear trend pattern as well as the leading pattern of multidecadal variability of the planetary waves during the past half century. The Wave <b>3</b> <b>pattern</b> is defined as the second empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of detrended December–February mean 300 -hPa meridional wind V 300 and denotes a zonal shift of the ridges and troughs of the climatological flow. Al-though its interannual variance is roughly comparable to that of EOF 1 of V 300, which represents the Pacific–North America (PNA) pattern, its multidecadal variance is nearly twice as large as that of the PNA. Wave 3 is not completely structurally or temporally distinct from the northern annular mode (NAM) but, for some attributes, the linkage of the observed trend to Wave 3 is clearer than to NAM. The prom-inence of the Wave <b>3</b> <b>pattern</b> is further supported by attributes of many climate models that participated in phase 3 of the CoupledModel Intercomparison Project (CMIP 3). In particular, in the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM 3), the Wave <b>3</b> <b>pattern</b> is present as EOF 3 of V 300 in both a fully coupled integration and a stand-alone atmospheric integration forced by climatological sea surface temperatures.

40|$|Ray {{pattern is}} the most {{divergent}} morphological character among rhabditid nematodes. The ancestral ray pattern of Elegans group nematodes is {{commonly referred to as}} a 2 (1) <b>3</b> + <b>3</b> <b>pattern,</b> with rays 1 and 2 located anterior of the cloaca, ray 3 positioned at the cloaca, and rays 4 - 6 and 7 - 9 grouped in two clusters posterior of the cloaca. C. elegans males primarily exhibit the 2 (1) 3 + 3 pattern; however some isolates display variant patterns at a low frequency. The Hawaiian strain CB 4856 exhibits a 3 / <b>3</b> + <b>3</b> <b>pattern</b> at a frequency of 0. 09. In this <b>pattern,</b> ray <b>3</b> is located anterior of the cloaca in a cluster with rays 1 and 2. The designated wild-type strain, N 2, is fixed for the 2 (1) <b>3</b> + <b>3</b> <b>pattern.</b> To examine the genetic basis of this phenotypic variation, recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from a ten-generation intercross between strains N 2 and CB 4856 were scored for ray pattern. Transgressive segregation was observed with the 3 / 3 + <b>3</b> ray <b>pattern</b> being expressed at much higher frequencies in many RIL than in either parental strain.

To confirm the major QTL, CB 4856 alleles from the left end of chromosome V were introgressed into an otherwise N 2 background.

40|$|To {{assess the}} physico-chemical {{characteristics}} of protein-protein interactions, protein sequences and overall structural folds have been analyzed previously. To highlight this, discovery and examination of amino acid patterns at the binding sites defined by structural proximity in 3 -dimensional (3 D) space are essential. In this paper, we investigate the interacting preferences of <b>3</b> D <b>pattern</b> pairs discovered separately in transient and obligate protein complexes. These <b>3</b> D <b>pattern</b> pairs {{are not necessarily}} sequence-consecutive, but each residue in two groups of amino acids from two proteins in a complex is within certain °A threshold to most residues in the other group. We develop an algorithm called AA-pairs by which every pair of interacting proteins is represented as a bipartite graph, and it discovers all maximal quasi-bicliques from every bipartite graph to form our <b>3</b> D <b>pattern</b> pairs. From 112 and 2533 highly conserved <b>3</b> D <b>pattern</b> pairs discovered in the transient and obligate complexes respectively, we observe that Ala and Leu is the highest occuring amino acid in interacting <b>3</b> D <b>patterns</b> of transient (20. 91 %) and obligate (33. 82 %) complexes respectively.

The technique is based on diffraction of light by phase gratings. The phase gratings are incorporated into the photomask at discrete locations.

We used chromatin-immunoprecipitation on microarray to analyze histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation (H 3 K 9 me <b>3)</b> <b>patterns</b> in primary AML (n = 108), acute lymphoid leukemia (n = 28), CD 34 + cells (n = 21) and white blood cells (n = 15) specimens. Hundreds of promoter regions in AML showed significant alterations in H 3 K 9 me 3 levels. H 3 K 9 me 3 deregulation in AML occurred preferentially as a decrease in H 3 K 9 me 3 levels at core promoter regions. The altered genomic regions showed an overrepresentation of cis-binding sites for ETS and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response elements (CREs) for transcription factors of the CREB/CREM/ATF 1 family. The decrease in H 3 K 9 me 3 levels at CREs was associated with increased CRE-driven promoter activity in AML blasts in vivo. AML-specific H 3 K 9 me <b>3</b> <b>patterns</b> were not associated with known cytogenetic abnormalities. But a signature derived from H 3 K 9 me <b>3</b> <b>patterns</b> predicted event-free survival in AML patients. When the H 3 K 9 me 3 signature was combined with established clinical prognostic markers, it outperformed prognosis prediction based on clinical parameters alone. These findings demonstrate widespread changes of H 3 K 9 me 3 levels at gene promoters in AML. Signatures of histone modification patterns are associated with patient prognosis in AML...|$|R

The basic methodology of our analysis is based on the spatiotemporal random field (S/TRF) theory. We use a S/TRF decomposition model with a dominant seasonal O- 3 component that may change significantly from site to site. O- <b>3</b> seasonal <b>patterns</b> are estimated and separated from stochastic fluctuations. By means of Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) analysis, physically meaningful and Sufficiently detailed space-time maps of the seasonal O- <b>3</b> <b>patterns</b> are generated across space and time. During the summer and winter months the seasonal O- 3 concentration maps exhibit clear and progressively changing geographical patterns over time, suggesting the existence of relationships in accordance with the typical physiographic and climatologic features of California. BME mapping accuracy can be superior to that of other techniques commonly used by EPA: its framework call rigorously assimilate useful data sources that were previously unaccounted for; the generated maps offer valuable assessments of the spatiotemporal O- <b>3</b> <b>patterns</b> that can be helpful in the identification of physical mechanisms and their interrelations, the design of human exposure and Population health models, and in risk assessment.

Moreover, the maps offer valuable insight about the space-time O- <b>3</b> concentration <b>patterns</b> and are, thus, helpful for disentangling the influence of explanatory factors or even for identifying some influential ones that Could have been otherwise overlooked.
