Nitrate and α-mannosidase, which were released from vacuoles destroyed during lysis of protoplasts, moved at unequal rates in the density gradient used for vacuole isolation. Purified vacuoles retained less NO 3 − than α-mannosidase during a single washing. Empirically determined corrections were used to account for NO 3 − movement in estimating the percentage of total cellular nitrate found in the vacuole. Vacuoles from plants grown in the presence of NO 3 − contained 58 % of the total cellular NO 3 − and therefore represent a major NO <b>3</b> − <b>storage</b> pool...|$|R
