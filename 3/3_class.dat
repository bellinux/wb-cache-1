2500|$|None of {{the sources}} {{consulted}} clarifies why Cortina left the regional jefatura. At the time Carlism was divided into supporters of de Mella and those standing by the claimant, but in historiography he is only marginally mentioned as a somewhat disoriented Mellista sympathizer. It seems that the circumstances were strictly personal. Third Carlist War broke {{the back of the}} family; while other Marchena representatives of [...] "burguesia agraria" [...] kept growing into wealth, Cortina struggled. Turning 60 and with health problems, he concluded that he would be better off on the state payroll possibly earning a pension and perhaps assumed that moving to Madrid would facilitate his return to public service. Starting 1917 he was already noted as resident of the capital. As Ministerio de Ultramar no longer existed he knocked at the doors of Ministerio de Hacienda and got finally restored as <b>3.</b> <b>class</b> administrative official in Ministerio de Fomento, success probably conditioned by distant family ties.|$|E
