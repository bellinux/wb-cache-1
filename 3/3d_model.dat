After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a <b>3D</b> <b>model</b> by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. During development, many ideas were considered for Li Long's appearance, including several younger drafts.

5|$|Development of the Saturn {{began in}} 1992, {{the same year}} Sega's {{groundbreaking}} <b>3D</b> <b>Model</b> 1 arcade hardware debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi, another video display processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. The Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, known in development as Sonic X-treme, has been considered {{a factor in the}} console's poor performance.|$|E

For example, an outside artist, Shi Kai Wang, developed the early concept sketches of what would eventually become the Master Chief. However upon developing a <b>3D</b> <b>model,</b> the artists decided the Chief looked too slender, almost effeminate, and subsequently bulked up the character.

40|$|Objective: One {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the head kinematics of the Q <b>3</b> <b>model.</b> Another objective is to evaluate the effect on head kinematics of increased thoracic spine flexibility; more humanlike mass distribution; and more humanlike body geometry in the Q <b>3</b> <b>model.</b> The evaluations were based on the head kinematics of children deduced from real crashes and on new data of mass distribution and updated body dimensions for 3 -year-olds. Methods: The head kinematics of the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> was evaluated by comparing the Q <b>3</b> <b>model's</b> head displacement response with the deduced response of 3 -year-old children in real crashes. To do so, data from crashes were collected. The data were used to develop the mathematical vehicle and restraint system models (MADYMO, TASS, the Netherlands). Three crashes involving 3 -year-old children in frontal impacts were reconstructed. The models were run 35 times each (one model per crash), each time with a different setting to each of the variables for which the exact value was not known. Examples of those variables include crash pulse, initial dummy position, and initial seat belt position. Two versions of the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> were used: one that correlated with the Q 3 ATD and one that was modified regarding anthropometry and thoracic flexibility. The basis for the updated anthropometry was new data regarding characteristic dimensions and mass distribution collected at a Swedish hospital. Results: In the anthropometry study, 26 children were measured. The main differences between the average of the measured children and the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> were found in the mass distribution of the torso and thighs: the Q 3 's pelvis was too heavy and the thorax, abdomen/lumbar spine, and thighs were too light. Another difference was identified in the buttock-knee length. Two of the 3 reconstructed crashes had confirmed head impacts. The Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> responded with head kinematics that reflected the deduced courses of events for the real children in one of 3 crashes (the one without head impact). The modified Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> reflected the real children in 2 of 3 crashes. Conclusions: In high-severity, straight frontal crashes, the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> predicted non-head impact adequately. However, in oblique frontal crashes, the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> did not sufficiently predict the head impacts. The modified Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> predicted the head impacts better than the Q <b>3</b> <b>model</b> did. Greater flexibility of the thorax and redistributed mass made a positive difference regarding the head kinematics...|$|R

5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a <b>3D</b> <b>model</b> of their faces. The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E
5|$|Core Design {{improved}} and modified the character with each instalment. Developers for Tomb Raider II {{increased the number}} of polygons in the character's model and added more realistic curves to its design. Other changes included new outfits and manoeuvres. Core Design reportedly planned to implement crawling as a new gameplay option, but the option did not appear until Tomb Raider III. Actress Judith Gibbins took over voice acting responsibilities and stayed on through the third game. For Tomb Raider III, the developers {{increased the number of}} polygons in Croft's <b>3D</b> <b>model</b> to about 300, and introduced more abilities to the gameplay. Core Design wanted to reintroduce the character to players in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation and included a flashback scenario with a younger Lara. The developers expanded the character's set of moves threefold to allow more interaction with the environment, like swinging on ropes and kicking open doors. The character model was altered to feature more realistic proportions, and Jonell Elliott replaced Gibbins as the voice of Lara Croft. By the time development for The Last Revelation began, Core Design had worked on the series constantly for four years and the staff felt they had exhausted their creativeness. Feeling the series lacked innovation, Core Design decided to kill the character and depicted Croft trapped by a cave-in during the final scenes of the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the typical}} CG approach, {{the duties of}} 2D and 3D artists are distinct. The 2D artists think up and sketch out the characters' appearances; the 3D artists create the models based on these concept sketches. For Karas, these artists worked {{together}} in these areas to create the imagery seen in the show. To encourage this and establish consistency between images based on 2D and 3D processes, the 2D drawings incorporate styles typically found in 3D models. Animators also touched up or enhanced by hand, sequences involving the models. Eko's karas form was mainly a <b>3D</b> <b>model</b> but his skirt was hand drawn. During later stages of editing, the team spaced hand drawn frames among 3D-rendered frames to enhance the fusion of styles. The production did not use motion capture techniques. Animators drew out action scenes based on their feelings, inspirations, and observations. 3D and 2D animation and special effects director, Takashi Hashimoto explained companies typically reduce their animators' workload by using CG for long shots and drawing only close-ups by hand. The team working on Karas, however, drew silhouettes for long shots and created complicated CG for close-ups. The 3D animators used 3D texture software, BodyPaint 3D, to refine textures for the mikura and karas models, creating seamless details on them.|$|E
