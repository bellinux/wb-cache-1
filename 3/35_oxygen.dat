Moreover, ethanol production uses energy from renewable sources only; hence, no net carbon dioxide {{is added to the}} environment, thus reducing green-house gas emissions. It has also been well established now that ethanol increases the octane number, decreases the Reid vapor pressure and produces fuel with clean burning characteristics (Dhillon et al. 2007). Moreover, neat (unblended) ethanol can be burned with greater efficiency, and is thought to produce smaller amounts of ozone precursors (thus decreasing urban air pollution), and is particularly beneficial with respect to low net CO 2 put into the atmosphere.|$|R

This has resulted in recommending the prescription of oxygen for at least 15 h day− 1 in most European countries. In order to examine the prescription and usage of LTOT and to assess the adherence to international recommendations for its prescription, a survey was set up in a random sample of clients of the largest oxygen company in the Netherlands. After patients had been visited for an interview, additional postal surveys were sent to the physician who had prescribed LTOT and to the oxygen company. For 175 COPD patients the mean oxygen prescription and mean oxygen usage were 15 · 6 ± 5 · 8 and 14 · 1 ± 6 · 8 h day− 1, respectively. In 62 patients (<b>35</b> %) <b>oxygen</b> was prescribed < 15 h day− 1, more often by non-chest physicians than by chest physicians (P< 0 · 0001), and 91 patients (52 %) used oxygen < 15 h day− 1.

Analysis of the streamwise location of the maximum flame height enables to establish the transition between “open-tip” and “closed-tip” be- havior as well as scaling laws for the soot volume fraction. A scaled soot volume fraction is found to follow a linear relationship with the streamwise coordinate normalized by the burner length.

40|$|In {{terrestrial}} environments, {{the exchange}} of respiratory gases exacts a water cost: obtaining oxygen or carbon dioxide requires losing water. Insect eggs should be especially sensitive to this tradeoff—because {{they are unable to}} forage for water, have high surface area-to-volume ratios, and experience large temperature-driven changes in oxygen demand. Previous work from our laboratory, on eggs of a common hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, has shown that, during development, metabolic rate and water loss rates rise in parallel. These correlative data suggest that eggshell conductance increases to accommodate increasing metabolic demand. Here, we test this idea experimentally by subjecting eggs of M. sexta to 15, 21 (normoxia) and <b>35</b> % <b>oxygen</b> for 24  h, while measuring rates of metabolism (as carbon dioxide emission) and water loss. Hypoxia depressed egg metabolic rates, but led to pronounced, rapid increases in water loss. By contrast, hyperoxia had no significant effect on metabolism or water loss. These data demonstrate that insect eggs actively participate in balancing oxygen gain and water loss, and that they use tissue oxygen status, or some correlate of it, as a cue for increasing eggshell conductance. Rapid control over conductance may allow eggs to conserve water during an initial period of low metabolic demand, thereby deferring water costs of respiratory gas exchange until late in development...|$|R

The efficiency of this conversion in 25 -liter batch fermentations {{has been found}} to increase over threefold, when oxygen tension is controlled by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the aeration. Conversion of glycerol to DHA does not occur under oxygen-limited fermentation conditions. When the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained at 0. 05 atmospheres (using oxygen-enriched air), quantitative conversion of up to 100 g of glycerol/liter to DHA was obtained in 33 h. The amount of glycerol converted can be increased without increasing impeller speed or aeration rate. This increase is not the result of increased production of cell mass. The specific conversion of glycerol to DHA increased from 12. 2 g of DHA/g of cell mass at the point of maximum conversion to <b>35.</b> 8 with <b>oxygen</b> enrichment. This increased specific production occurred even though the specific growth rate during the period of oxygen enrichment decreased from 0. 23 to 0. 06 /h...|$|R

Three groups of fish were acclimated to either fresh water (FW, 0 %o), isosmotic sea water (ISW, 12 %o) or full strength sea water (SW, <b>35</b> %o) and <b>oxygen</b> consumption was measured while they swam at 10, 20, 30 and 40 cms " 1. Maintenance oxygen consumption (estimated by extrapolation), for an average fish (63 g), increased among groups in the following order: FW<ISW<SW. The net cost of swimming increased in the order ISW< SW< FW, and total oxygen consumption (maintenance + net cost of swimming) increased in the order ISW < FW < SW. We assumed that the contribution of cardiac, branchial and swimming muscles to the net cost of swimming was proportional to swimming speed only, and therefore, at similar speeds, differences in the net cost of swimming among salinities were due t...|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{even the}} {{definition}} of MET is problematic when used for specific persons. By convention, 1 MET is considered equivalent to the consumption of 3.5 ml O2·kg−1·min−1 (or <b>3.5</b> ml of <b>oxygen</b> per kilogram of body mass per minute) and is roughly equivalent to the expenditure of 1 kcal per kilogram of body weight per hour. This value was first experimentally derived from the resting oxygen consumption of a particular subject (a healthy 40-year-old, 70 kg man) and must therefore {{be treated as a}} convention. Since the RMR of a person depends mainly on lean body mass (and not total weight) and other physiological factors such as health status, age, etc., actual RMR (and thus 1-MET energy equivalents) may vary significantly from the kcal/(kg·h) rule of thumb. RMR measurements by calorimetry in medical surveys have shown that the conventional 1-MET value overestimates the actual resting O2 consumption and energy expenditures by about 20% to 30% on the average, whereas body composition (ratio of body fat to lean body mass) accounted for most of the variance.|$|R
40|$|A {{system of}} falling {{droplets}} was investigated {{for the application}} of wastewater aeration as it was hypothesised that the system would not be adversely affected by elevated mixed liquor suspended solids. The concept was trialled using a device able to create droplets of different diameters, where the liquid is pumped to a height and allowed to fall through air as droplets. Oxygen transfer into the falling droplets was determined by using de-oxygenated feed water and measuring the dissolved oxygen concentration of samples collected at various fall heights. The influence of droplet diameter on mass transfer was also investigated by using four different droplet size settings. The results were compared with a theoretical model and the droplet diameters produced from both fresh water and brewery waste sludge were measured to determine the effect of a feed liquid containing suspended solids and an organic fraction. The results demonstrated that greater oxygen transfer occurs with larger fall heights however the rate of transfer is greatest {{at the beginning of the}} fall. The experimentation and modelling showed oxygen transfer per volume to be higher with smaller droplets. Analysis of the droplet diameters produced with both fresh water and brewery waste water at 10, 000 mg/L indicated that the droplet size produced by a liquid containing a live culture and relatively high suspended solids was smaller than the droplet size produced by fresh water. The higher surface area to volume ratio of a smaller droplet results in more efficient mass transfer in the system and indicates that the system can achieve an alpha factor around 1. 1. The advantage of the system of falling droplets applied to wastewater treatment is that the system is not negatively impacted by increased suspended solids in the liquor and therefore is able to provide consistent aeration at around 1. <b>35</b> kg/kWh <b>oxygen</b> transfer efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Ventilator-dependent {{premature}} infants {{are often}} treated with dexamethasone. Several trials showed that steroids while improve pulmonary compliance and facilitate extubation, some treated infants may have adverse effects, such as alterations of growth curves. We conducted this retrospective study {{to evaluate the}} effects of steroids on mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy, hospital length stay and mortality, in ventilator-dependent infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) (defined as the need of oxygen supplementation at 28 days of life). Twenty-six newborns with BPD were evaluated during 9 [...] 42 days postpartum (mean = 31 days) and {{were divided into two}} groups: Group I - 14 newborns that did not receive dexamethasone, and Group II - 12 newborns that received dexamethasone at 14 [...] 21 days of life. Dexamethasone was given at a dose of 0. 25 mg per kilogram of body weight twice daily intravenously for 3 days, after which the dose was tapered. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the mean length of mechanical ventilation (Group I - 37 days, Group II - <b>35</b> days); <b>oxygen</b> supplementation (Group I - 16 days, Group II - 29 days); hospital stay (Group I - 72 days, Group II - 113 days); mortality (Group I - 35. 7 %, Group II - 41. 6 %). At birth, Group II was lighter (BW: Group I - 1154 grams ± 302, Group II - 791 grams ± 165; p < 0. 05) and smaller (height: Group I - 37. 22 cm ± 3. 3, Group II - 33. 5 ± 2. 4; p< 0. 05) than Group I. At 40 weeks, there were no statistically significant differences between groups in relation to anthropometric measurements.

However, after its suspension, a recovery seems to occur, suggesting that its influence could be transitory...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Within hypoxic tumor regions {{anaerobic}} dissimilation of glucose is {{the sole}} source of energy generation. It yields only 5 % of the ATP that is normally gained by means of oxidative glucose catabolism. The increased need for glucose may aggravate cancer cachexia. We investigated the impact of recombinant human erythropoietin (RhEPO) and increased inspiratory oxygen concentrations on weight loss in tumor-bearing mice. METHODS: Fragments of the murine C 26 -B adenocarcinoma were implanted in 60 BALB/c-mice. The mice were divided into four groups and assigned to: (A) no treatment; (B) RhEPO- administration (25 IU daily from day 1 - 11, three times per week from day 12); (C) RhEPO and 25 % oxygen; and (D) RhEPO and <b>35</b> % <b>oxygen.</b> Three control groups of four healthy mice each received the same treatment as groups A, B, and D, respectively. Hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, tumor volume, and body weight were monitored. At day 17 the experiment was terminated and the serum lactate concentration was measured. The tumors were excised and weighed and, for each mouse, the percentage weight loss was calculated. The impact of tumor weight and the treatments on lactate concentration and weight loss was evaluated. RESULTS: Significant positive correlations were found between tumor weight and lactate concentration and between tumor weight and percentage weight loss. In the mice with the largest tumors, RhEPO displayed a significant weight loss-reducing effect, and a significant negative correlation was found between hemoglobin concentration and weight loss. An oxygen-rich environment {{did not appear to}} influence weight loss. CONCLUSION: Anaerobic glycolysis in a growing C 26 -B tumor is related to weight loss. RhEPO administration results in a reduction of the percentage weight loss; this effect is probably mediated by an increased hemoglobin concentration...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—Exercise {{training}} is being promoted increasingly {{for patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Many of these patients experience exercise related arterial desaturation but the clinical importance of these hypoxaemic episodes is not known. QTc dispersion is a marker of myocardial repolarisation abnormalities and there has been much interest in its role as a non-invasive predictor of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. However, {{little is known about the}} dynamic effects that exercise and hypoxaemia have on QTc dispersion in patients with COPD.  METHODS— 20 patients with severe COPD (FEV 1 < 40 % predicted) undertook two 15 minute treadmill tests at a speed calculated to produce a constant workload of 50 % maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2 max) during which they were blindly given either air or <b>35</b> % <b>oxygen</b> in random order. Physiological measurements taken throughout exercise included 12 lead electrocardiograms from which QTc dispersion values were calculated according to standard criteria. Nine of the patients who desaturated with exercise were studied further. A similar degree of hypoxaemia was induced at rest by giving them a titrated mixture of air and oxygen and the changes in QTc dispersion were recorded.  RESULTS— 11 of the 20 patients developed significant hypoxaemia (desaturation by ⩾ 5 % to < 90 %) with exercise breathing air. There were no significant changes in QTc dispersion with either exercise or hypoxaemia. There were no significant changes in QTc dispersion when comparing those who did and did not desaturate, and those with and without a high baseline QTc dispersion values (60 ms). Induced hypoxaemia without exercise also failed to worsen QTc dispersion.  CONCLUSIONS—No evidence was found to suggest that exercise, even when associated with hypoxaemia, causes myocardial repolarisation abnormalities in patients with COPD. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rebreathing method for the simultaneous measurement of oxygen consumption (VO 2) and effective pulmonary blood flow (QP. eff) at rest and during exercise. Subjects rebreathed a test gas consisting of <b>35</b> % <b>oxygen,</b> 3. 5 % chlorodifluoromethane (freon- 22), and 10 % argon in nitrogen for 30 seconds {{or until the}} respired oxygen tension fell to below 13. 3 kPa. Sixty normal subjects were studied on a motorized treadmill, the Bruce protocol being used. The rebreathing manoeuvre was performed at three minute intervals, and was initially practised sitting down. Measurements were then made with the subjects standing at rest, and subsequently during the last minute of each stage of the Bruce exercise protocol until the subjects were exhausted. Heart rate was recorded from the electrocardiogram. Oxygen uptake plotted against calculated power (watts) showed a discontinuity between resting and exercise values, probably because power output during treadmill exercise is underestimated. The arbitrary addition of 30 watts to the exercise power output abolished this discontinuity. There was good agreement between rebreathing estimates of oxygen consumption and values measured during a second exercise test by the conventional open circuit argon dilution method. Coefficients of variation of oxygen consumption and effective pulmonary blood flow measured by rebreathing were usually less than 10 % even during maximal exertion. At rest mean (SD) effective pulmonary blood flow corrected for body surface area was 2. 2 (0. 46) l/min/m 2. Effective pulmonary blood flow rose linearly with oxygen consumption. At rest the arteriovenous oxygen content difference for pulmonary blood (VO 2 /QP eff) was 9. 1 (1. 6) ml/dl, rising {{to a maximum of}} 16. 4 (1. 8) ml/dl. The stroke volume index was 27. 5 (6. 8) ml/m 2, rising to a maximum of 46. 5 (7. 1) ml/m 2 during exertion...|$|R
