The aim of this thesis {{is to find the}} factors that affect the time required for the processing of accounting and taxes. Another goal is to create a multidimensional econometric model that meets the assumptions of the classical regression model. The theoretical part focuses on basic obligations in accounting, taxes and wages under the relevant legislation. A method of regression analysis is also introduced. In the practical part the dependence between the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hours and selected explanatory variables in chosen companies is examined. The result is an econometric model that is 90 % identical to the original data. The final model contains four explanatory variables. This is the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> received <b>invoices,</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> issued <b>invoices,</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> employees and experience of the accountant.

40|$|The use of Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) scanner {{has become}} {{powerful}} tools for medical imaging techniques. This will allow medical surgeons and radiologist assistants to diagnose patients before any treatment {{can be taken}} place. However, the CBCT concepts require high demand for computer resources to reconstruct three-dimensional (3 D) model from two-dimensional (2 D) images. Based on this problem, Open Source Cone-Beam Reconstructor (OSCaR) was used to train medical and biomedical engineering students in understanding the concepts of computed tomography scanner. This software requires only a small capacity of computer resources, thus allowing students to practise using their own computer. With a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> projections, the authors evaluated the performance of OSCaR to reconstruct <b>36</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> 2 D x-ray images. By using the cone-beam x-ray tube, 36 images of lemon and chicken bone were captured and saved into Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) files. The DICOM files were then imported to the OSCaR software for the reconstruction process. Based on the results, this study successfully reconstructed 3 D images of lemon and chicken bone. In conclusion, higher <b>number</b> <b>of</b> projections would produce better results in terms of accuracy and high resolution. However, the use <b>of</b> <b>36</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> 2 D images is adequate for students to understand the concepts of computed tomography scanner...|$|R
5000|$|Intelligent Data Capture (IDC) or {{learning}} systems enable end users to extract content from invoices without the system having {{to learn the}} layout <b>of</b> the <b>invoice.</b> Some intelligent engines are able to correctly sort batches on the fly, locate data fields such as invoice and PO number, as well as line item information, and then extract the desired content from those data fields.Intelligent solutions do not require the coding of rules or design form templates. Rather the system learns by reviewing a relatively small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>invoice</b> samples. This helps the system scale to large invoice volumes and widely varying document layouts without requiring a human operator to specify a template for each one, or explicitly create and tune an extensive library of keywords.Invoice processing automation software has emerged as what one consulting company has called a [...] "disruptive innovation" [...] whereby this new technological innovation has created a demand for a whole line of software products that previously did not exist.

The aim {{of this research is}} find out best kind effect of growing media and {{concentration of the}} plant growth regulator Dekamon and interaction both of two treatment on growth and yield of melon. This research was conducted at the Balai Pengkajian Teknologi Pertanian (BPTP) Banda Aceh at May until August 2013. This research used Randomized Completely Block Design 3 x 5 with 2 factors and 3 replications. First factor is kind of growing media with 3 levels; soil, soil + husk, and soil + compost. The second factor is concentration of the plant growth regulator Dekamon with 4 levels; control (0 ml L- 1), 0, 15 ml L- 1, 0, 20 ml L- 1, 0, 25 ml L- 1, dan 0, 30 ml L- 1. Observations parameter of inspected is; height of plant (cm), diameter rods (cm), <b>number</b> <b>of</b> leafes per plant (blade), <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fruit weight per plant (g) and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> diameter fruit per plant (cm). Results of this experiment shows that the growing media give significant effect on height of plant at the age 36 dap and diameter rods 16 dap, no significant on height of plant (at the age 6, 16, and 26 dap), diameter rods (at the age 6, 26 and <b>36</b> dap), <b>number</b> <b>of</b> leafes per plant (at the age 6, 16, 26 and <b>36</b> dap), <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fruit weight per plant and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> diameter fruit per plant at the age 70 dap. Growing media of soil + husk (M 2) is better growing media to height of plant and diameter rods but soil + compost(M 3) is better to give generative result of melon. The concentration of the plant growth regulator Dekamon give highly significant effect to diameter rods at the age 26 dap, significant effect on height of plant at the age 26 dap and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> leafes 16 dap, and no significant on height of plant (at the age 6, 16, and 36 dap), diameter rods (at the age 6, 16 and <b>36</b> dap), <b>number</b> <b>of</b> leafes per plant (at the age 6, 26 and <b>36</b> dap), <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fruit weight per plant and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> diameter fruit per plant at the age 70 dap.
