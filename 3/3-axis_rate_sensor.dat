40|$|Angle {{random walk}} is {{commonly}} used as a specification for <b>rate</b> <b>sensors.</b> What is it? An angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> measures the rotation rate about its sensitive axis. The output of a <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> will be a signal proportional to deg/sec. Noise is often {{thought of as the}} short- term variation in the output, such as the peak-to-peak output variation or the standard deviation of the output while the sensor is at rest. These measures of noise will also be in units of deg/sec. Noise can also be defined as a function of frequency using a power spectral density (PSD) or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). In these cases, the noise specification will be a noise density in deg/sec/Hz 1 / 2 or (deg/sec) 2 /Hz that describes the output noise {{as a function of the}} bandwidth of the sensors. Often one is interested in using the <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> to track angle changes, not simply angular rate. In this case, the output of the angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> is integrated over time to find the angle as a function of time. Figure 1 shows the output of a <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> turned through 360 deg, and the calculated angle from this data. For this application, the noise specification is a bit harder to understand.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} {{the design and}} {{characterization}} of a vibratory yaw <b>rate</b> MEMS <b>sensor</b> that uses in-plane motion for both actuation and sensing. The design criterion for the <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> {{is based on a}} high sensitivity and low bandwidth. The required sensitivity of the yaw <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> is attained by using the in-plane motion in which the dominant damping mechanism is the fluid loss due to slide film damping i. e. two–three orders of magnitude less than the squeeze-film damping in other <b>rate</b> <b>sensors</b> with out-of-plane motion. The low bandwidth is achieved by matching the drive and the sense mode frequencies.

50|$|Yaw dampers usually {{consist of}} a yaw <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> (either a {{gyroscope}} or angular accelerometer), a computer/amplifier and a servo actuator. The yaw damper uses yaw <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> to sense when the aircraft begins a Dutch roll. A computer processes the signals from the yaw <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> to {{determine the amount of}} rudder movement that is required to dampen out the Dutch roll. The computer then commands the servo actuator to move the rudder that amount. The Dutch roll is dampened out and the aircraft becomes stable about the yaw axis. Because Dutch roll is an instability that is inherent to all swept-wing aircraft, most swept-wing aircraft have some sort of yaw damper system installed.|$|R

This approach tracks the resonant frequency split between two X−Y symmetric high-Q mechanical modes of vi-bration in a microelectromechanical systems Coriolis vibratory gyroscope to produce a frequency-based measurement of the input angular rate. The system is enabled {{by a combination of}} a MEMS vibratory high-Q gyroscope and a new signal processing scheme which takes advantage of a previously ignored gyroscope dynamic effect. A real-time implementation of the quasi-digital angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> was realized using two digital phase-locked loops and experimentally verified using a silicon MEMS quadruple mass gyroscope (QMG). Structural characterization of a vacuum-packaged QMG showed Q factors on the order of one million over a wide temperature range from − 40 ◦C to + 100 ◦C with a relative x/y mismatch of Q of 1 %. Temperature characterization of the FM <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> exhibited less than 0. 2 % variation of the angular rate response between 25 ◦C and 70 ◦C environments, enabled by the self-calibrating differential frequency detection. High-speed rate table characterization of the FM angular <b>rate</b> <b>sensor</b> demonstrated a linear range of 18 000 deg/s (50 r/s, limited by the setup) with a dynamic range of 128 dB.
