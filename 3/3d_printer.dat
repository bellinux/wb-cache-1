In this situation, we consider the use of <b>3</b> D <b>printer.</b> Our focus on traditional crafts is in danger, even with their importance in social and economic terms. We started this research based on the hypothesis that the <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> that is now widely used in the design and technical fields will help to revive traditional crafts. Our two research questions are as follows: RQ 1. Why do traditional crafts need to be combined with <b>3</b> D <b>printer?</b> RQ 2. How can designs contribute to the combinations of traditional crafts and <b>3</b> D <b>printer?</b> To answer these questions, we used the interview and found five interviewees that illustrate the combination of <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> with traditional crafts. We found that <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> have the advantages of fast speed and free form. They can help traditional crafts to evolve in other ways and still deliver the meaning of traditional crafts to the people.

40|$|The {{release of}} the open source <b>3</b> -D <b>printer</b> known as the RepRap (a self-Replicating Rapid prototyper) {{resulted}} in the potential for distributed manufacturing of products for significantly lower costs than conventional manufacturing. This development, coupled with open source-appropriate technology (OSAT), has enabled the opportunity for <b>3</b> -D <b>printers</b> {{to be used for}} sustainable development. In this context, OSAT provides the opportunity to modify and improve the physical designs of their printers and desired digitally-shared objects. However, these <b>3</b> -D <b>printers</b> require electricity while more than a billion people still lack electricity. To enable the utilization of RepRaps in off-grid communities, solar photovoltaic (PV) -powered mobile systems have been developed, but recent improvements in novel delta-style <b>3</b> -D <b>printer</b> designs allows for reduced costs and improved performance. This study builds on these innovations to develop and experimentally validate a mobile solar-PV-powered delta <b>3</b> -D <b>printer</b> system. It is designed to run the RepRap <b>3</b> -D <b>printer</b> regardless of solar flux. The electrical system design is tested outdoors for operating conditions: (1) PV charging battery and running 3 -D printer; (2) printing under low insolation; (3) battery powering the <b>3</b> -D <b>printer</b> alone; (4) PV charging the battery only; and (5) battery fully charged with PV-powered 3 -D printing. The results show the system performed as required under all conditions providing feasibility for adoption in off-grid rural communities. <b>3</b> -D <b>printers</b> powered by affordable mobile PV solar systems have a great potential to reduce poverty through employment creation, as well as ensuring a constant supply of scarce products for isolated communities...|$|R

25|$|A {{large number}} of {{additive}} processes are available. The main differences between processes are in the way layers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object. Others sometimes use standard, off-the-shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype. The main considerations in choosing a machine are generally speed, costs of the <b>3D</b> <b>printer,</b> of the printed prototype, choice and cost of the materials, and color capabilities. Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive. However less expensive printers {{can be used to}} make a mold, which is then used to make metal parts.|$|E

G3DP was designed in collaboration with MIT's Glass Lab and the Wyss Institute, emulating traditional glass working processes. Molten glass was poured in fine streams and cooled in an annealing chamber, yielding precision suitable for art and consumer products, and glass strength suitable for architectural elements. The process allowed close control of color, transparency, thickness and texture. Changing the height and speed of the nozzle produced uniform loops, turning the printer into a [...] "molden glass sewing machine".

40|$|Advanced {{manufacturing}} {{has been}} well addressed in American policies, especially since 2010 when the States wanted to revitalize the economy and create jobs {{by taking advantage of}} its competitive sectors. The U. S. has strength in high-tech manufacturing industries due to endowments of advanced technology and high-skill labor. 3 D printing is a typical advanced manufacturing industry that is high value added, driven by technological innovation, highly skilled labor, cutting edge materials and production process. The U. S. has shown an obvious advantage in this industry. <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> manufacturing emerged in American in the 1980 s and has surged ahead during the recent decade. The distribution of <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> companies is not bound within California where 3 D printing was invented, but has spread out to the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes. In this thesis I look into two questions: what art the location factors of <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> manufacturing industry; why some cities that are not noted for high-tech clusters can attract <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> manufacturers. To find answers, I first summarized the location criteria of innovative manufacturing industries raised by existing studies. This is followed by my analyses of the evolution of <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> technology, the industry's market performances and the development trajectory of major companies. They illustrate the characteristics of <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> manufacturing and the reasons for their concentration at specific states. Based on these findings, I adjusted the list of location factors according. In this thesis, two case studies of <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> producers are presented. the first one is the biggest <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> firm <b>3</b> D Systems Corp. 's relocation from California to Rock Hill, South Carolina in 2005, and the second is a promising firm MakerBot Industries' establishment and development in Brooklyn, New York City since 2009. I interviewed the two companies to know their considerations when choosing their sites of business and meanwhile get their comments on the location selection criteria of <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> manufacturing. To demonstrate these factors, I analyzed the socioeconomic data, business and knowledge network as well as relevant policies that could account for the development of <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> manufacturing in these cities. My hypothesis is that highly skilled labor, knowledge sharing, and business networks are important factors that would affect their location decisions. this thesis ends up with recommendations for cities that are not the origin of new technologies to attract innovative manufacturing industries like <b>3</b> D <b>printer</b> manufacturing...|$|R
