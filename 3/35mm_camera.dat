5|$|Visual effects at Kroma were {{supervised}} by Bert Yukich and produced by Amy Yukich. A {{key part of}} the video is a 24-second visual effects sequence in which Rihanna is surrounded by silvery strands of liquid that crisscross the frame in graceful arcs in response to her movements. Water elements were recorded on a special effects stage using a high-speed <b>35mm</b> <b>camera.</b> Bert Yukich then composited them into the scene with the singer. He then added lighting effects to the practical water elements to give them the mirror-like texture of mercury.|$|E
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was fly fishing with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single <b>35mm</b> <b>camera</b> to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a <b>35mm</b> <b>camera),</b> and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an electronic viewfinder is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E

25|$|The {{apertures}} that smaller sensor cameras {{have available}} give much more {{depth of field}} than equivalent angles of view on a DSLR. For example, a 6mm lens on a 2/3″ sensor digicam has a field of view similar to a 24mm lens on a <b>35mm</b> <b>camera.</b> At an aperture of 2.8 the smaller sensor camera (assuming a crop factor of 4) has a similar depth of field to that <b>35mm</b> <b>camera</b> set to 11.|$|E

25|$|Until 1995 the Minox 35 {{cameras were}} {{considered}} the smallest cameras {{for the standard}} 35mm film format. The design {{was inspired by the}} Rollei 35, which had been the smallest <b>35mm</b> <b>camera</b> for eight years. The Rollei 35 is only slightly bigger, but much heavier than the Minox 35 cameras. However, the Minolta TC-1, introduced in 1996, is smaller.|$|E

50|$|Like all lenses in the DX format, the 55-200mm casts {{a smaller}} image circle than lenses for full-frame <b>35mm</b> <b>cameras</b> and is {{therefore}} only compatible with cameras having APS-C-sized sensors (or vignetting will result).|$|R
50|$|The {{new program}} center also houses a dark room. <b>35mm</b> <b>cameras</b> and film, {{as well as}} {{chemicals}} for developing photos, are provided to campers, with which they take many nature photos and develop them throughout the session.|$|R
25|$|In many cases, the DOF {{is fixed}} by the {{requirements}} of the desired image. For a given DOF and field of view, the required f-number is proportional to the format size. For example, if a <b>35mm</b> <b>camera</b> required 11, a 4×5 camera would require 45 to give the same DOF. For the same ISO speed, the exposure time on the 4×5 would be sixteen times as long; if the 35camera required 1/250 second, the 4×5 camera would require 1/15 second. The longer exposure time with the larger camera might result in motion blur, especially with windy conditions, a moving subject, or an unsteady camera.|$|E
25|$|Brodovitch {{released}} {{a book of}} these photographs in 1945, titled simply Ballet, through a small New York publisher. The book contains 104 photographs of several ballets and is divided into eleven segments, one for each ballet performance. On the contents page, Brodovitch introduces each chapter in a typographic style that emulates {{the feel of the}} dance it is describing. He photographed with a Contax <b>35mm</b> <b>camera,</b> no flash, and with a slow film speed. The blurred figures of the dancers allow the viewer to not only feel the music, but also to follow the line of the dancer's limbs mid-step. The images beautifully capture the atmosphere on-stage, the frenzied behind-the-scenes action backstage, and the magical moments of the ballet. By bleeding the blurred, grainy pictures off the pages and into the gutters, he communicated the emotional impact of the dance without words.|$|E
25|$|In 1968 Haskins {{moved to}} London {{and ran a}} studio in Glebe Place just off the King's Road. He worked as an {{advertising}} photographer for international consumer brands Asahi Pentax, Bacardi, Cutty Sark whisky, Honda, BMW, Haig whisky, DeBeers, British Airways, Unilever and Zanders, and specialised in the art direction and shooting of calendars, especially for Asahi Pentax in Japan. Although he endorsed Hasselblad {{for a short period}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his loyalty to the medium format 6x7 camera and lenses from Asahi resulted in a rare long-term association between a camera manufacturer and photographer. From 1970 to 2000, Asahi Optical (later Pentax) produced 30 calendars, of which Haskins shot and art-directed 15 editions including the millennium calendar. No other photographer was invited to contribute more than once. He is still involved with the Pentax Forum Gallery in Tokyo, which hosts his exhibitions. His first contact came in 1967 when Asahi Optical presented him with a <b>35mm</b> <b>camera</b> after hearing that he had shot African Image with various competitors' products.|$|E

50|$|Imagons do not {{typically}} have shutter mechanisms and are instead mounted on shutters (i.e., Copal large format shutters). There are also variants {{which can be}} mounted on focusing helicoids or bellows {{to be used with}} medium and <b>35mm</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R
25|$|Lawler's {{greatest}} coup came in 1984, {{when she}} was granted full access to the Connecticut home of twentieth-century collectors Burton and Emily Tremaine (as it turns out, {{just a few years}} before much of their collection was dispersed at Christie's in 1988). As sometimes happens in the history of photography, the artist serendipitously discovered in one place the crux of her entire project. Working in available light with a <b>35mm</b> <b>camera,</b> she found treasures everywhere she looked, such as this decorator's duet between the tortured gestural slashes of a late Jackson Pollock and the filigree of a Limoges soup bowl. In Living Room Corner, Arranged by Mr. & Mrs. Burton Tremaine, New York City (1984), a Robert Delaunay hangs above a television and a Lichtenstein bust, which {{has been turned into a}} lamp, seems to stare up and outward. For a later piece, Fragment/Frame/Text (#163) (1984), Lawler photographed a museum wall label next to a landscape painting by Claude Lorrain; only a fragment of the landscape appears in the photo. In Foreground (1994), a gelatin silver print showing an open-plan living area in the Chicago apartment of art collector Stefan Edlis, Jeff Koons' Rabbit (1986) can be seen next to a refrigerator. By manipulating the focus and the view-finder of the camera, Lawler demonstrated how an artwork is determined by the paradigms of the art world: A label on the wall of an auction house would become the focus of an image, with only a small fraction of the work itself visible, and the idea of the artwork as a commercial entity would be brought to mind.|$|E
500|$|During this period, the company's R {{department}} {{focused on}} retrofitting {{the industry standard}} <b>35mm</b> <b>camera,</b> the Mitchell BNC. [...] The first cameras produced by Panavision were Mitchell cameras, and all standard 35mm cameras made by Panavision to this day {{are based on the}} Mitchell movement.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot {{primarily}} in the anamorphic format on 35mm film, with key sequences filmed on 65mm, and aerial sequences in VistaVision. Nolan did not shoot any footage with IMAX cameras as he had with The Dark Knight. [...] "We didn't feel {{that we were going}} to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible. Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras, even though I love the format dearly". In addition Nolan and Pfister tested using Showscan and Super Dimension 70 as potential large format high frame rate camera systems to use for the film, but ultimately decided against either format. Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo-Sonics <b>35mm</b> <b>camera</b> at speeds of up to 1000 frames per second. Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speed digital camera, but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches. [...] "Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one useable piece and it didn't end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie." [...] Nolan also chose not to shoot any of the film in 3D as he prefers shooting on film using prime lenses, which is not possible with 3D cameras. Nolan has also criticized the dim image that 3D projection produces, and disputes that traditional film does not allow realistic depth perception, saying [...] "I think it's a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D. The whole point of cinematic imagery is it's three dimensional... You know 95% of our depth cues come from occlusion, resolution, color and so forth, so the idea of calling a 2D movie a '2D movie' is a little misleading." [...] Nolan did test converting Inception into 3D in post-production but decided that, while it was possible, he lacked the time to complete the conversion to a standard he was happy with. In February 2011 Jonathan Liebesman suggested that Warner Bros were attempting a 3D conversion for Blu-ray release.|$|E
50|$|Retina was the brand-name of {{a long-running}} series of German-built Kodak <b>35mm</b> <b>cameras,</b> {{produced}} from 1934 until 1969. Kodak Retina cameras were manufactured in Stuttgart-Wangen by the Kodak AG Dr. Nagel Werk which Kodak had acquired in December 1931.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{manufacturers}} started to use 35mm film for still photography between 1905 and 1913. The first <b>35mm</b> <b>cameras</b> {{available to the}} public, and reaching significant numbers in sales were the Tourist Multiple, in 1913, and the Simplex, in 1914.|$|R

2500|$|The {{impact of}} sensor size on {{field of view}} is {{referred}} to as the [...] "crop factor" [...] or [...] "focal length multiplier", which is a factor by which a lens focal length can be multiplied to give the full-frame-equivalent focal length for a lens. Typical APS-C sensors have crop factors of 1.5 to 1.7, so a lens with a focal length of 50mm will give a field of view equal to that of a 75mm to 85mm lens on a <b>35mm</b> <b>camera.</b> The smaller sensors of Four Thirds System cameras have a crop factor of 2.0.|$|E
50|$|At first, BelOMO made {{photographic}} equipment and lens-making machinery for state use. It now manufactures {{a wide range}} of products, including military and consumer optical products. During the 1980s it produced the Agat-18 and Agat-18K half-frame <b>35mm</b> <b>cameras,</b> still popular among Lomographic photographers.|$|R
50|$|The Lomographic Society International has {{produced}} a pre-loaded redscale 35mm film, that will fit in all standard <b>35mm</b> <b>cameras.</b> Because {{of the nature of}} the film, shots need to be over exposed by one to three stops to achieve correct exposure on developing.|$|R

50|$|The {{increasing}} cost {{of quality}} lens manufacture in Japan led {{to a loss of}} sales for Kiron, as the company could no longer offer its lenses at a cost less than that charged by the camera manufacturers, who had begun to offer economy-level lens designs as well as contracting lens assembly operations in lower-cost factories outside Japan. Additionally, the <b>35mm</b> <b>camera</b> market was in flux by the late 1980s, and <b>35mm</b> <b>camera</b> manufacturers were transitioning to autofocus lens designs. By 1988, the company decided to discontinue after-market <b>35mm</b> <b>camera</b> lens production to concentrate on industrial and other markets.|$|E

A notable, but largely-forgotten, {{use of the}} Double-Gauss formula was in the Canon 28mm f/3.5 (1951, Japan) [...] in M39 mount for Rangefinder cameras.
