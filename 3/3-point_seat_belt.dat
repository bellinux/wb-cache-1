40|$|Abstract Background The {{effects of}} <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> laws and public {{education}} campaigns on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use are assessed {{on the basis of}} observational or self-reported data on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. Previous studies focusing on front seat occupants have shown that self-reports indicate a greater <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage than observational findings. Whether this over-reporting in self reports applies to rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage, and to what extent, have yet to be investigated. We aimed to evaluate the over-reporting factor for rear seat passengers and whether this varies by gender and under different compulsory <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use conditions. Methods The study was conducted in the Veneto Region, an area in the North-East of Italy with a population of 4. 7 million. The prevalence of <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use among rear seat passengers was determined by means of a cross-sectional self-report survey and an observational study. Both investigations were performed in two time periods: in 2003, when rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use was not enforced by primary legislation, and in 2005, after rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use had become compulsory (June 2003). Overall, 8138 observations and 7902 interviews were recorded. Gender differences in the prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use were examined using the chi-square test. The over-reporting factor, defined as the ratio of the self-reported to the observed prevalence of rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use, was calculated by gender before and after the rear <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> legislation came into effect. Results Among rear seat passengers, self-reported rates were always higher than the observational findings, with an overall over-reporting factor of 1. 4. We registered no statistically significant changes over time in the over-reporting factor, nor any major differences between genders. Conclusion Self-reported <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> usage by rear passengers represents an efficient alternative to observational studies for tracking changes in actual behavior, although the reported figures need to be adjusted using an appropriate over-reporting factor in order to gain an idea of genuine <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} Selective Traffic Enforcement Programs (STEPs) on <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use and motor vehicle {{accident}} casualties is evaluated. The following research questions are addressed: (a) Will <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use 2 years after a STEP be above the pre-STEP level? (b) Will repeated STEPs {{be as effective as}} an initial STEP in increasing <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use? (c) Does the increase in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use induced by a STEP result in a reduction of accident casualties? A series of six <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use surveys (N = 32, 660) was conducted at the roadside in the Ottawa area where three STEPs were implemented during a 12 -month period, and in a control community. Archival data were used to examine the impact of the STEPs on accident casualties. It was found that <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use 2 years after an initial STEP was still significantly (p <. 001) above baseline usage, that three subsequent STEPs signif-icantly (p <. 001) increased <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use from 66 % to 84 %, and that driver casualties declined by 14 % subsequent to the STEPs. Periodic STEPs are effective in affecting long-term increases in <b>seat</b> <b>belt</b> use and consequently reducing traffic accident casualties.
