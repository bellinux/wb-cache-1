50|$|The {{operation}} of a synchronous motor {{is due to the}} interaction of the magnetic fields of the stator and the rotor. Its stator winding, which consists of a <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> winding, is provided with a <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> supply, and the rotor is provided with a DC supply. The <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> stator winding carrying <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> currents produces <b>3</b> <b>phase</b> rotating magnetic flux (and therefore a rotating magnetic field). The rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field and rotates along with it. Once the rotor locks in with the rotating magnetic field, the motor is said to be in synchronization.
