The methodological approach is based on a three-phase framework, in which significant issuesconcerning sustainable development are presented (Phase 1), the significant issues are translated into sustainableindicators (Phase 2), and the contribution of sustainable indicators to sustainable development is assessed (Phase <b>3).</b> <b>Phase</b> <b>1</b> and 2 build on an extensive literature review and farmers consultation. Phase 3 relies on numericalcomparisons. A comparative analysis of the empirical data is based on theories and the developed conceptualframework.

The floor-range farming system shows a slightly more negative contribution to sustainable developmentcompared with the organic EPS. The organic farming system, therefore, is considered the better animal-friendlysystem. It is certainly noteworthy to mention that the organic system however fail to contribute to sustainabledevelopment from an economic perspective. Thus, the main perceived challenge for the organic farmer is tooperate his organic business in a more profitable way. The floor-range system on the other hand, succeeds tocontribute to sustainable development in economic terms, but fails to contribute positively from an ecologicaland social perspective.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} low-Z {{molecular}} materials including hydrogen to multimegabar pressures (less than 300 GPa) have uncovered {{a range of}} phenomena relevant to understanding {{the nature of the}} interiors of the outer planets and their satellites. Synchrotron x ray diffraction measurements (to 42 GPa) have been used to determine the crystal structure of the solid (hexagonal-close packed) and equation of state. Sound velocities in fluid and solid hydrogen (to 24 GPa) have been inverted to obtain elastic constants and aggregate bulk and shear moduli. In addition, an improved intermolecular potential has been determined which fits both static and shock-wave data. Use of the new potential for the molecular envelope of Jupiter suggests the need for major revisions of existing Jovian models or a reanalysis of reported free oscillations for the planet. Studies at higher pressures (greater than 100 GPa) reveal a sequence of pressure-induced symmetry-breaking transitions in molecular hydrogen, giving rise to three high-pressure phases (1, 2, and <b>3).</b> <b>Phase</b> <b>1</b> is the rotationally disordered hcp phase which persists from low pressure to well above 100 GPa at high temperature (e. g., 300 K). Phase 2 is a low-temperature, high-pressure phase (transition at 100 GPa and 77 K in H 2) with spectral features indicative of partial rotational ordering and crystallographic distortion. The transition to Phase 3 at 150 GPa is accompanied by a weakening of the molecular bond, gradual changes in orientational ordering, strong enhancement of the infrared intramolecular vibrational absorption, and strong intermolecular interactions similar to those of ambient-pressure network solids.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{polymorphic}} malaria parasite antigen, {{merozoite surface protein}} 3 (MSP 3), {{is among}} the blood stage malaria vaccine candidates. It is believed to induce immunity through cytophilic antibodies that disrupt the process of erythrocytes invasion by merozoites. This study aimed at assessing natural acquisition of antibodies to MSP 3 in individuals living in an area with different malaria transmission intensity in preparation for malaria vaccine trials. Methods The {{study was conducted in}} individuals aged 0 - 19 years from villages located in lowland, intermediate and highland strata in Korogwe district, northeastern Tanzania. Blood samples from 492 study participants were collected between May and June 2006 for malaria diagnosis and immunological investigations. Reactivity of MSP 3 to different types of antibodies (immunoglobulin M, G and IgG subclass 1 and 3) were analysed by Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA). Results Malaria parasite prevalence was higher in the lowland (50 %) compared to the intermediate (23. 1 %) and highland (9. 8 %) strata. Immunogloblin G subclasses 1 and 3 (IgG 1 & IgG 3), total IgG and IgM were found to increase with increasing age. IgG 3 levels were significantly higher than IgG 1 (p Plasmodium falciparum infection was associated with higher IgG 3 levels (p = 0. 008). Adjusting by strata and age in individuals who had positive blood smears, both IgG and IgM were associated with parasite density, whereby IgG levels decreased by 0. 227 (95 %CI: 0. 064 - 0. 391; p = 0. 007) while IgM levels decreased by 0. 165 (95 %CI: 0. 044 - 0. 286; p = 0. 008). Conclusion Individuals with higher levels of IgG 3 might be partially protected from malaria infection. Higher levels of total IgG and IgM in highlands might be due to low exposure to malaria infection, recent infection or presence of cross-reactive antigens. Further studies of longitudinal nature are recommended.

The {{development and use of}} <b>Phase</b> <b>1</b> systems will help enable Phase 2 or <b>Phase</b> <b>3</b> fission propulsion systems capable of giving rapid, affordable access to any point in the solar system. A <b>Phase</b> <b>1</b> fission propulsion system under development at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in collaboration with individuals from Department of Energy Laboratories and industry is the Safe Affordable Fission Engine (SAFE). The propellant energy source of a 30 kW SAFE unit (SAFE- 30) is being fabricated, and will begin testing at MSFC in FY 00. The conceptual design of a 300 kW SAFE unit (SAFE- 300) is nearing completion. Experiments have been performed on both SAFE- 30 and SAFE- 300 components. Module tests have confirmed the performance potential of the SAFE series of propulsion systems. This paper will report on the development status of the <b>Phase</b> <b>1</b> SAFE fission propulsion system...|$|R
