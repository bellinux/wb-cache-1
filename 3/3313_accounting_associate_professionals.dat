40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether healthcare workers in England and Wales are {{at increased risk}} of tuberculosis and to examine the frequency of drug resistance in this population. DESIGN: Comparison of notification rates by occupation obtained from national tuberculosis notification surveys in 1988 and 1993, with denominators from the 1991 census. SUBJECTS: People with notified tuberculosis in <b>professional</b> and <b>associate</b> <b>professional</b> occupations from the two surveys. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of notified tuberculosis in health professionals (mainly doctors) and health <b>associate</b> <b>professionals</b> (mainly nurses) compared with rates in other <b>professional</b> and <b>associate</b> <b>professional</b> occupations, adjusted for ethnic group, sex, and age. RESULTS: 119 cases of tuberculosis were identified in healthcare workers, including 61 nurses and 42 doctors. The crude notification rate in healthcare workers was 11. 8 per 100, 000 per year (95 % confidence interval 9. 8 to 14. 1) compared with 3. 3 per 100, 000 per year (2. 9 to 3. 6) in other <b>professional</b> and <b>associate</b> <b>professional</b> occupations; rate ratios were higher (range 1. 7 to 3. 2) in all ethnic groups. The relative risk adjusted for ethnic group, sex, and age was 2. 4 (95 % confidence interval 2. 0 to 3. 0), slightly higher for health professionals (2. 7 (1. 9 to 3. 8)) than for <b>associate</b> <b>professionals</b> (2. 0 (1. 5 to 2. 6)). No multiple drug resistant strains of tuberculosis were identified in healthcare workers. CONCLUSIONS: Better detection and notification of cases of tuberculosis in healthcare workers may account for some of the apparent increased risk, but these findings imply that tuberculosis remains a hazard for healthcare workers and highlight the importance of ensuring that occupational health monitoring and protection workers are not neglected...|$|R
