40|$|SummaryThe {{expression}} of unconventional vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT 3 by neurons known {{to release a}} different classical transmitter has suggested novel roles for signaling by glutamate, but this distribution has raised {{questions about whether the}} protein actually contributes to glutamate release. We now report that mice lacking VGLUT <b>3</b> are <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> due to the absence of glutamate release from hair cells at the first synapse in the auditory pathway. The early degeneration of some cochlear ganglion neurons in knockout mice also indicates an important developmental role for the glutamate released by hair cells before the onset of hearing. In addition, the mice exhibit primary, generalized epilepsy that is accompanied by remarkably little change in ongoing motor behavior. The glutamate release conferred by {{expression of}} VGLUT 3 thus has an essential role in both function and development of the auditory pathway, {{as well as in the}} control of cortical excitability...|$|R
40|$|Homozygote varitint-waddler (Va) mice, {{expressing a}} mutant isoform (A 419 P) of TRPML 3 (mucolipin <b>3),</b> are <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> and display {{vestibular}} and pigmentation deficiencies, sterility, and perinatal lethality. Here {{we show that}} the varitint-waddler isoform of TRPML 3 carrying an A 419 P mutation represents a constitutively active cation channel that can also be identified in native varitint-waddler hair cells as a distinct inwardly rectifying current. We hypothesize that the constitutive activation of TRPML 3 {{occurs as a result}} of a helix-breaking proline substitution in transmembrane-spanning domain 5 (TM 5). A proline substitution scan demonstrated that the inner third of TRPML 3 's TM 5 is highly susceptible to proline-based kinks. Proline substitutions in TM 5 of other TRP channels revealed that TRPML 1, TRPML 2, TRPV 5, and TRPV 6 display a similar susceptibility at comparable positions, whereas other TRP channels were not affected. We conclude that the molecular basis for deafness in the varitint-waddler mouse is the result of hair cell death caused by constitutive TRPML 3 activity. To our knowledge, our study provides the first direct mechanistic link of a mutation in a TRP ion channel with mammalian hearing loss...|$|R

All implanted children received their implants before beginning school. The results revealed that 3 years after implantation. 38 % (16 children) of the implanted <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children attended mainstream schools, whereas 57 % (24 children) were in a unit, or special class, in a mainstream school, and 5 % (two children) were in schools for the deaf. With regard to the age-matched <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children with hearing aids, 12 % (63 children) attended mainstream schools, whereas 55 % (281 children) were in a unit of a mainstream school, and 33 % (167 children) were in schools for the deaf. In the group of age-matched severely deaf children, 38 % (239 children) attended mainstream schools, whereas 51 % (326 children) were in a unit of a mainstream school, and 11 % (70 children) were in schools for the deaf. Statistical analysis revealed a highly {{significant difference between the}} educational placement of implanted children and hearing-aided <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children (p< 0. 00001), whereas there was no statistically significant difference between implanted children and hearing-aided severely deaf children.

40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1997 Dr. Raymond C. JeanesThe ability to communicate effectively requires individuals to possess knowledge {{in a number of}} areas as well as the skill to apply this knowledge in a wide range of practical communication contexts. Understanding the syntactic and semantic systems, and the ability to put this knowledge into practice are necessary, but not sufficient, to be a competent communicator. In order to be considered a competent communicator it is necessary also to be able to apply pragmatic rules appropriately in the variety of interactional contexts which occur in person to person interaction. It has been shown (e. g., Bench, 1992; Luetke-Stahlman & Luckner, 1991) that <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children have difficulty in understanding and applying syntactic and semantic rules at the same levels of proficiency as their normally hearing peers. Major causes underlying this difference are the greatly reduced amount of linguistic input typically received by <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children and the imperfect quality of that input, even when appropriate amplification is used. These conditions, in association with greatly reduced opportunity for <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children to interact with more mature communicators, negatively affect the acquisition and application of syntactic and semantic rules. The hypotheses of this study are: (a) that these same conditions also result in difficulties for <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children in understanding and applying pragmatic rules and strategies in various interactional contexts, and, (b) that the nature and extent of this difficulty has a negative impact on <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children’s face-to-face interactions through the use of inappropriate or unproductive responses to the demands of the communicative context, to the demands of the listener, and to the demands of the interaction process. A referential communication task paradigm was employed to elicit face-to-face interactions between pairs of normally hearing students and <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> students, both from oral educational settings and educational settings in which sign is used. The tasks employed to elicit these interactions were designed to necessitate the use of pragmatic skills in order for the interactions to be completed successfully. Transcripts of the interactions were analysed for their effectiveness. A number of pragmatic skills were considered; these included the appropriateness and effectiveness of speakers’ responses to the contextual requirements of the different communication tasks, the appropriateness and effectiveness of speakers’ responses to the requirements of their listener, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of speaker and listener responses of the interactional process. Since the participants’ performances are an overt expression of the speakers’ and listeners’ conceptions of their role in face-to-face interaction, the interactions provide insights into the metacommunication knowledge of <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children and normally hearing children. It is predicted that because of the reduction in the quantity and quality of interactions in which <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children are involved, their capacity to apply pragmatic rules appropriately in face-to-face interactions will be less effective than that of their normally hearing peers. Other areas considered were the degree to which there was improvement with age in the use of pragmatic skills, and the degree to which the communicative performance of the students from oral settings resembled that of the normally hearing students, given that all the orally educated students were enrolled in integrated educational settings and, thus, had daily interaction with normally hearing students. It is predicted that there will be improvement with age in the skills being considered. It is further predicted that because of the day to day contact the oral students have with normally hearing and normally communicating peers, the performance of the oral students will more closely resemble the performance of the normally hearing group than the <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> group who sign. The results of the study showed there were significant differences between the normally hearing group and the <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> group in the overall effectiveness of the interactions, with the normally hearing group being more effective than either the oral group or the sign group. Similarly, there were significant differences between the normally hearing students and the two groups of <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> students in their ability to apply appropriately pragmatic knowledge to their interactions, suggesting that there are also differences between the normally hearing and the <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> groups in metacommunication knowledge. Some differences in pragmatic use between the oral group and the sign group were also found. Reasons for the difference in metacommunication knowledge and poor pragmatic performance, which are likely to originate in the early communicative environment and the early educational management of the <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children, are suggested. The implications these findings have on current pragmatic acquisition theory for both normally hearing and <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children are discussed, as is the significance of the findings on current practice in the education of <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children. Areas for subsequent research arising from this study are suggested. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Reading {{requires}} two related, but separable, capabilities: (1) {{familiarity with}} a language, and (2) understanding the mapping between that {{language and the}} printed word (Chamberlain & Mayberry, 2000; Hoover & Gough, 1990). Children who are <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> are disadvantaged on both counts. Not surprisingly, then, reading is difficult for <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children. But some deaf children do manage to read fluently. How? Are they simply the smartest of the crop, or do they have some strategy, or circumstance, that facilitates linking the written code with language? A priori one might guess that knowing American Sign Language (ASL) would interfere with learning to read English simply because ASL does not map in any systematic way onto English. However, recent {{research has suggested that}} individuals with good signing skills are not worse, and may even be better, readers than individuals with poor signing skills (Chamberlain & Mayberry, 2000). Thus, knowing a language (even if it is not the language captured in print) appears to facilitate learning to read. Nonetheless, skill in signing does not guarantee skill in reading—reading must be taught. The next frontier for reading research in deaf education is to understand how deaf readers map their knowledge of sign language onto print, and how instruction can best be used to turn signers into readers. Most <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children read poorly. However, a small minority learn to read fluently. Understanding how <b>profoundly</b> <b>deaf</b> children learn, or fail to learn...|$|R
