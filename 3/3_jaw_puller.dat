40|$|Objective To {{describe}} a simple protocol for ventilator-assisted preoxygenation (VAPOX) prior to rapid sequence intubation in the ED using a Hamilton T 1 ventilator {{in an effort}} to further reduce the incidence of transient and critical hypoxaemia. Methods Ventilator-assisted preoxygenation includes the following steps; preparation for rapid sequence intubation as per institutional protocols, including departmental checklists. Hamilton T 1 ventilator is setup in non-invasive spontaneous/timed mode with settings as described. The patient is optimally positioned and nasal cannula applied with an oxygen flow rate of 15 [*]L/min. A face mask is applied with the <b>jaw</b> <b>pulled</b> forward using a two-handed thenar eminence grip and the ventilator is started. Preoxygenation occurs for 3 [*]min. Drugs including neuromuscular blockers are administered, while the operator ensures the airway remains patent. The ventilator transitions into Pressure Controlled Ventilation once apnoea ensues. Nasal oxygen continues until endotracheal tube is successfully secured. Results We {{describe a}} case series of the first eight consecutive adult patients on who VAPOX was applied. All eight patients were clinically deemed at high risk of oxygen desaturation. No clinically significant hypoxia occurred, and the lowest oxyhaemoglobin desaturation was 92 %. Conclusion Preoxygenation using a ventilator with an open valve system may allow safe combination of non-invasive ventilation, pressure controlled ventilation and apnoeic oxygenation using nasal cannula. VAPOX may be the technique of choice to preoxygenate and apnoeic oxygenate many patients who undergo rapid sequence intubation in the ED equipped with these ventilators...|$|R

40|$|Summary: The purpose ofthe {{experiment}} {{was to explore}} relations between jaw and laryngeal functions. The general question was whether laryngeal adduction was affected byjaw opening or by jaw biting. Twelve untrained, vocally healthy male and female adults participated as subjects. Subjects produced repeated to-kens of/A/in each of 12 experimental conditions involving combinations of <b>3</b> <b>jaw</b> openings (10 ram, 25 mm, 40 mm), 2 jaw biting pressures (10 kPa, 200 kPa), and 2 fundamental frequencies (conversational and high). For each token, laryngeal adduction was estimated from the electroglottographic closed quo-tient. The most straightforward results were that (1) laryngeal adduction in-creased as jaw opening increased at the conversational pitch, for all subjects, in-dependent of biting pressure, and (2) laryngeal adduction increased as biting pressure increased, at the conversational pitch, for males, independent of jaw opening. Other relations between estimated laryngeal adduction and jaw ma-nipulations were more complex, varying with fundamental frequency and gen-der. Speculations aremade about possible biomechanical and neurological ex...|$|R

30|$|Meanwhile, in hoopoe and {{the common}} moorhen, the movable naso-frontal hinge gives {{flexibility}} for depression of the upper <b>jaw</b> by <b>pulling</b> the palatine bone during the contraction of the pterygoid muscle.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Characterizing genetic {{variation}} by retrospective genotyping of trophy or historical artifacts from endangered species {{is an important}} conservation tool. Loss of genetic diversity in top predators such as the white shark Carcharodon carcharias remains an issue, exacerbated in this species by declining, sometimes isolated philopatric populations. We successfully sequenced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop from osteodentine of contemporary South African white shark teeth (from <b>3</b> <b>jaws),</b> and from 34 to 129 yr old dried cartilage and skin samples from 1 Pacific Ocean and 5 Mediterranean sharks. Osteodentine-derived sequences from South African fish matched those derived from an individual’s finclips, but were generally of poorer quality than those from skin and cartilage of historical samples. Three haplotypes were identified from historical Mediterranean samples (n = 5); 2 individuals had unique sequences and 3 shared the contemporary Mediterranean haplotype. Placement of previously undescribed mtDNA haplotypes from historical material within both the Mediterranean and Pacific clades fits with the accepted intra-specific phylogeny derived from contemporary material, verifying our approaches. The utility of our methodology is in its provision of additional genetic resources from osteodentine (for species lacking tooth pulp) and cartilage of rare and endangered species held in often uncurated, contemporary and historical dry collections. Such material can usefully supplement estimates of connectivity, population history, and stock viability. We confirm the depauperate haplotype diversity of historical Mediterranean sharks, consistent with founding by {{a small number of}} Pacific colonizers. The consequent lack of diversity suggests serious challenges for the maintenance of this top predator and the Mediterranean ecosystem...|$|R

40|$|Some authors {{claim that}} occlusal {{appliances}} can enhance athletic performance. Therefore {{this study investigated}} the influence of dental occlusion on knee muscle strength performance. Twelve healthy female subjects (mean age 24. 1 +/- 3. 1 years) without temporomandibular joint dysfunction participated in this study. Isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring strength were assessed in relation to three randomized jaw conditions: mouth closed in maximum intercuspidation without splint, mouth closed on a balanced splint which optimized contact over the dental arch, mouth closed {{on a piece of}} resin of 1 mm which created an imbalanced occlusion. Tests were performed at 60 degrees /s and 240 degrees /s in concentric and 30 degrees /s in eccentric exertions. Concentric performances did not show any significant difference between the <b>3</b> <b>jaw</b> conditions (p > 0. 05). By contrast, in the eccentric trials related to quadriceps performance, significant differences (p < 0. 05) were observed between the resin condition and the two other modalities (without splint or with a balanced splint). The imbalanced occlusion created by the resin component corresponded to an average decrease of 9 % in eccentric peak torque. The eccentric hamstring peak torques also showed a significant difference (p < 0. 05) between measurements with splint and with resin (7 % decrease when occlusion was imbalanced). In conclusion, among asymptomatic females, artificial imbalanced occlusion induces immediate and significant alteration of knee eccentric muscle performances. Therefore, occlusion examination should be undertaken on a regular and frequent basis for high-level athletes. Moreover, for athletes using mouthguards, muscular performance assessments should be planned with and without the dental protection. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|How does neural control reflect {{changes in}} {{mechanical}} advantage andmuscle function? In the Aplysia feeding system a protractor muscle's mechanical advantage decreases {{as it moves}} the structure that grasps food (the radula/odontophore) in an anterior direction. In contrast, as the radula/odontophore is moved forward, the jaw musculature's mechanical advantage shifts so that it may act to assist forward movement of the radula/odontophore instead of pushing it posteriorly. To test whether the jaw musculature's context-dependent function can compensate for the falling mechanical advantage of the protractor muscle, we created a kinetic model of Aplysia's feeding apparatus. During biting, the model predicts that {{the reduction of the}} force in the protractor muscle I 2 will prevent it from overcoming passive forces that resist the large anterior radula/odontophore displacements observed during biting. To produce protractions of the magnitude observed during biting behaviors, the nervous system could increase I 2 's contractile strength by neuromodulating I 2, or it could recruit the I 1 /I <b>3</b> <b>jaw</b> muscle complex. Driving the kinetic model with in vivo EMG and ENG predicts that, during biting, early activation of the context-dependent jaw muscle I 1 /I 3 may assist in moving the radula/odontophore anteriorly during the final phase of protraction. In contrast, during swallowing, later activation of I 1 /I 3 causes it to act purely as a retractor. Shifting the timing of onset of I 1 /I 3 activation allows the nervous system to use a mechanical equilibrium point that allows I 1 /I 3 to act as a protractor rather than an equilibrium point that allows I 1 /I 3 to act as a retractor. This use of equilibrium points may be similar to that proposed for vertebrate control of movement...|$|R
