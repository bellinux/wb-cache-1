VS tasks typically require a combination of several software tools and a <b>molecular</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>system.</b> Thus, the integration of all the requisite tools in a single operating environment could reduce the complexity of running VS experiments. However, only a few freely available integrated software platforms have been developed. Results A free open-source platform, IVSPlat 1. 0, was developed in this study for the management and automation of VS tasks. We integrated several VS-related programs into a <b>molecular</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>system</b> to provide a comprehensive platform for the solution of VS tasks based on molecular docking, pharmacophore detection, and {{a combination of both}} methods. This tool can be used to visualize intermediate and final results of the VS execution, while also providing a clustering tool for the analysis of VS results. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the applicability of this platform. Conclusions IVSPlat 1. 0 provides a plug-in-based solution for the management, automation, and visualization of VS tasks. IVSPlat 1. 0 is an open framework that allows the integration of extra software to extend its functionality and modified versions can be freely distributed.

40|$|Abstract — Clustering {{algorithms}} {{are used}} as data analysis tools {{in a wide variety}} of applications in Biology. Clustering has become especially important in protein structure prediction and virtual high throughput screening methods. In protein structure prediction, clustering is used to structure the conformational space of thousands of protein models. In virtual high throughput screening, databases with millions of drug-like molecules are organized by structural similarity, e. g. common scaffolds. The tree-like dendrogram structure obtained from hierarchical clustering can provide a qualitative overview of the results, which is important for focusing detailed analysis. However, in practice it is difficult to relate specific components of the dendrogram directly back to the objects of which it is comprised and to display all desired information within the two dimensions of the dendrogram. The current work presents a hierarchical agglomerative clustering method termed bcl::Cluster. bcl::Cluster utilizes the Pymol <b>Molecular</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>System</b> to graphically depict dendrograms in three dimensions.

40|$|Background: All sequenced {{eukaryotic}} genomes {{have been}} shown to possess at least a few introns. This includes those unicellular organisms, which were previously suspected to be intron-less. Therefore, gene splicing must have been present at least in the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes. To explain the evolution of introns, basically two mutually exclusive concepts have been developed. The introns-early hypothesis says that already the very first protein-coding genes contained introns while the introns-late concept asserts that eukaryotic genes gained introns only after the emergence of the eukaryotic lineage. A very important aspect in this respect is the conservation of intron positions within homologous genes of different taxa. Results: GenePainter is a standalone application for mapping gene structure information onto protein multiple sequence alignments. Based on the multiple sequence alignments the gene structures are aligned down to single nucleotides. GenePainter accounts for variable lengths in exons and introns, respects split codons at intron junctions and is able to handle sequencing and assembly errors, which are possible reasons for frame-shifts in exons and gaps in genome assemblies. Thus, even gene structures of considerably divergent proteins can properly be compared, as it is needed in phylogenetic analyses. Conserved intron positions can also be mapped to user-provided protein structures. For their visualization GenePainter provides scripts for the <b>molecular</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>system</b> PyMol...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, an {{exponential}} {{growing number}} of tools for protein sequence analysis, editing and modelling tasks have been put {{at the disposal of}} the scientific community. Despite the vast majority of these tools have been released as open source software, their deep learning curves often discourages even the most experienced users. For example, in the earlier stages of protein modeling by homology means, the lack of user-friendly Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), the need to make use of many programs in an integrated way, Input and Output file format problems, and platform-dependent installation dependencies, often lead to submition of homology modelling tasks to automatic online servers, with no or poor chances to apply human knowledge and experience in the key-steps required to yield a good model.

When the list was complete, drawing would begin again {{from the top of}} the list, so if the list was long (a large number of molecular bonds), the display would flicker heavily. Later vector displays could rotate complex structures with smooth motion, since the orientation of all of the coordinates in the display list could be changed by loading just a few numbers into rotation registers in the display unit, and the display unit would multiply all coordinates in the display list by the contents of these registers as the picture was drawn.|$|R
