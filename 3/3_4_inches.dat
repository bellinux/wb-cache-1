40|$|By {{means of}} {{membership}} functions, measurable informations (size expressed in inches, age expressed in years) are converted into linguistic qualifiers (tall, young). It is {{emphasized that the}} acception of linguistic qualifiers is context-dependant and may depend on several attributes. Therefore, the difference between membership functions and fuzzy rules vanishes. A method inspired from inductive learning is presented : it performs the extraction of membership functions and / or fuzzy rules from examples. 1. Introduction Fuzzy logic allows to deal with fuzzy and high-level notions (e. g. being small) while processing low-level informations (e. g. size is <b>3.</b> <b>4</b> <b>inches)</b> by means of membership functions : a given size satisfies the concept of being small to a given extent [39]. The primary representation of the problem domain generally involves measurable real-valued informations; in the meanwhile, experts deal with yet generalized informations. Membership functions so enable to bridge the [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of aspect on water yield variability {{over a long}} period, 1936 - 1964, was studied at two small, mountainous watersheds within the Davis County Experimental Watershed near Farmington, Utah. North-facing Miller Creek is densely vegetated by a conifer-aspen forest and mountain brush. Miller Creek 2 ̆ 7 s yield was more variable for daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual flows than yields from south-west facing Halfway Creek which is covered by mountain brush. Differences between watersheds in annual yield and snowmelt season runoff were nonsignificant. The snowmelt runoff season extended {{for an average of}} 65 days on both watersheds, but it began 24 days earlier (March 29) on Halfway. Approximately 57 percent of the mean annual flow of 19. 4 inches on Halfway, and 68 percent of Miller 2 ̆ 7 s mean annual yield of 17. 9 inches occurred during the snowmelt runoff season. One-third of Halfway 2 ̆ 7 s annual flow and one-half of Miller 2 ̆ 7 s occurred during the May 15 to September 15 growing season when only one-fifth of the annual precipitation of 42 inches usually fell. The difference between the growing season flows from the two watersheds was significant, with Miller 2 ̆ 7 s flow greater by <b>3.</b> <b>4</b> <b>inches...</b>|$|E
40|$|Permanent {{deformation}} and shear {{instability of}} Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA) have been major {{concerns in the}} asphalt paving industry {{for a long time}} because permanent deformation failure, e. g., rutting and shoving, significantly reduces the ride quality of asphalt pavements and may even cause hazardous hydroplaning of vehicles. Furthermore, the fact that truck tire pressures are increasing and most of rutting occurs in the top <b>3</b> <b>4</b> <b>inches</b> of the HMA layer requires the production of more rut-resistant and stable mixtures.;HMA mix design has escaped from its empirical stage and become more rational {{with the advent of the}} Superpave system. Superpave Level-I mix design, however, entirely depends on the volumetric properties of the mixture, without evaluating the potential performance of mixtures. In order to cope with the increasing demand for a simple performance test, extensive research has been conducted recently across the U. S. and new test methods and/or testing equipment have been introduced. Unfortunately the equipment is expensive, and the test procedures and sample preparations are rather complicated.;This study sought to develop a performance test that is rapid and easy to perform so that it can be routinely used during mix design and during construction to differentiate stable from unstable or rut-susceptible mixtures. In order to be cost-effective, the Rapid Performance Test (RPT) presented in this study utilizes the existing Superpave Gyratory Compactor (SGC), without the need for new, elaborate or sophisticated equipment.;However, it has been recognized that the behavior of HMA mixtures observed during the conventional compaction procedure cannot properly represent the performance of the mixture due to the unrealistically elevated compaction temperatures used in testing, and the confined movements of the mixture inside the rigid mold. Therefore the indenter of 42 ̆ 6 inches;-diameter is inserted between the SGC loading platen and the mixture in order to allow plastic flow or lateral/upward movements of the mixture. Also, the RPT is performed at in-service temperatures to better capture realistic shear strength of HMA mixtures.;Extensive experiments were conducted on Iowa mixes and the RPT was evaluated by the dynamic creep test using the Nottingham Asphalt Tester (NAT) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> {{drill pipe}} {{assembly}} {{has been developed}} {{that can be used}} for drilling 6 inch diameter holes. Normally, 6 inch diameter holes are drilled with 3 - 1 / 2 <b>inch</b> pipe with <b>4</b> - <b>3</b> / <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> OD tool joints because the tool joints for <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> pipe are too large. In most cases, the pipe size is based on the strength balance between the pipe and tool joint and 5 inch or 5 - 1 / <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> OD tool joints are usually welded to <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> pipe. A 5 inch OD tool joint is too large for an overshot in a 6 inch diameter hole. A <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> drill pipe assembly with a <b>4</b> - <b>3</b> / <b>4</b> <b>inch</b> OD tool joint has been developed that can be used in 6 inch diameter holes. Four inch pipe has a number of advantages over 3 - 1 / 2 inch pipe such as more torsional and tensile strength and improved hydraulics. Less pump flow is required for the same annular velocity and there is a lower pressure loss in the pipe. This paper will discuss:! The pipe development program. ! The results of finite element analysis on the tool joint. ! Full-scale lab testing of the tool joint. ! Case histories of similar assemblies. Drill String Design. The design of a drill string or selection of drill pipe size, weight and grade is based on three parameters...|$|R
