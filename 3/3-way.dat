The 5038s are essentially midrange drivers that start rolling off at 15kHz. In 1960, after feedback from foreign distributors, the Paragon {{was made into a}} <b>3-way</b> loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring radiators (tweeters) mounted {{in the back of the}} cabinet and aimed at the central 'sweet spot'. Bass–mid crossover was at 500Hz and mid–treble frequencies crossed over at 7kHz.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of CFLs: {{integrated}} and non-integrated lamps. Integrated lamps combine the tube and ballast in a single unit. These lamps allow consumers to replace incandescent lamps easily with CFLs. Integrated CFLs work well in many standard incandescent light fixtures, reducing the cost of converting to fluorescent. <b>3-way</b> lamps and dimmable models with standard bases are available.|$|E
25|$|Later advancements on the StingRay {{included}} a 5-string version (the StingRay 5), {{which has a}} <b>3-way</b> blade switch that allows the player to split the humbucking pickup's coils, and a unique truss-rod neck adjustment system that incorporated a Teflon washer which made it highly resistant to rust and corrosion and made adjusting the neck of a StingRay relatively easy.|$|E
25|$|A key {{characteristic}} of the grid pattern is that any and all streets are equally accessible to traffic (non-hierarchical) and could be chosen at will as alternative routes to a destination. Cut-through driving, or shortcutting, has been resisted by residents. Cities responded by making modifications to prevent it. Current recommended design practice suggests the use of <b>3-way</b> intersections to alleviate it.|$|E
25|$|At Victory Road, Nash {{defeated}} A.J. Styles for the Legends Championship, {{his first}} title in TNA. However, Nash lost the title {{only three days}} later to Mick Foley.

25|$|The guitar was {{extensively}} {{modified by}} Gallagher. The tuning pegs are odd (5 Sperzel pegs and one Gotoh), {{and all of}} these {{have been found to be}} replacements. Second, it is thought that the nut has been replaced and interchanged a number of times. Third, the pickguard was changed during Gallagher's time with Taste. Only the middle pick-up is original. The final modification was the wiring: Gallagher disconnected the bottom tone pot and rewired it so he had just a master tone control along with the master volume control. He installed a 5-way selector switch in place of the vintage <b>3-way</b> one.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{ended with}} Benoit and Angle beating Edge and Rey Mysterio {{becoming}} the first-ever Tag Team Champions. Edge and Mysterio won the titles afterwards.

25|$|On March 28, 2006, Oklahoma {{head coach}} Kelvin Sampson was named {{coach of the}} Hoosiers, despite a history of violating NCAA rules and {{sanctions}} imposed on him. Sampson fielded competitive teams and scored a major recruiting victory by persuading in-state star Eric Gordon to sign with Indiana. The Hoosiers, with Gordon and forward D.J. White, were {{considered one of the}} better teams during the 2007–2008 season. However, in October 2007 Sampson was found to have violated rules again, this time by engaging in a <b>3-way</b> phone conversation with a recruit. Indiana punished Sampson by denying him a previously scheduled $500,000 raise, firing one of his assistant coaches, and taking away one of his scholarships for the 2008–2009 season.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of the genetic mechanisms underlying human skin color variation is still incomplete, however genetic studies have discovered a number of genes that affect human skin color in specific populations, and have shown that this happens independently of other physical features such as eye and hair color. Different populations have different allele frequencies of these genes, {{and it is the}} combination of these allele variations that bring about the complex, continuous variation in skin coloration we can observe today in modern humans. Population and admixture studies suggest a <b>3-way</b> model for the evolution of human skin color, with dark skin evolving in early hominids in sub-Saharan Africa and light skin evolving independently in Europe and East Asia after modern humans had expanded out of Africa.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the rest}} of the year, Brother Runt {{continued}} to feud with Abyss and several other heavyweight wrestlers while having a short-lived alliance with Raven (Raven saved Brother Runt from being smashed through two stacked tables covered in thumbtack-covered boards from Abyss, before throwing Abyss in himself), before he turned on Raven on September 15, 2006. In September and October 2006 Hyson had formed a new look, very similar to Travis Bickle in the hit 1976 movie Taxi Driver complete with Bickle's trademark green army jacket and mohawk. At No Surrender (2006), Brother Runt competed in a No Disqualification <b>3-Way</b> Dance which was won by Abyss, At Bound for Glory (2006), Brother Runt competed in a fatal four way Monster's Ball match which was won by Samoa Joe.

Jarrett would get revenge on May 19, however, by hitting Styles with a guitar during a title match, which enabled Ron Killings to win the title. Jarrett then defeated Killings, Styles, Raven and Harris in a King of the Mountain match on June 2 to win his 3rd NWA World Championship.|$|E
25|$|Storm {{continued}} teaming with Regal as {{a regular}} tag team with the same anti-American gimmick; Storm would represent Canada and Regal represented England.

500|$|At {{the end of}} 1974, {{with sales}} of D skyrocketing, the future looked bright for Gygax and Kaye, who were only 36 years old. But in January 1975, Kaye {{unexpectedly}} {{died of a heart}} attack. He had not made any specific provision in his will regarding his one-third share of the company, simply leaving his entire estate to his wife Donna. Although she had worked briefly for TSR as an accountant, she had not shared her husband's enthusiasm for gaming, and made it clear that she would not be having anything to do with managing the company. Gygax characterized her as [...] "less than personable... After Don died she dumped all the Tactical Studies Rules materials off on my front porch. It would have been impossible to manage a business with her involved as a partner." [...] After Kaye's death, TSR was forced to relocate from Kaye's dining room to Gygax's basement. In July 1975, Gygax and Blume reorganized their company from a partnership to a corporation called TSR Hobbies. Gygax owned 150 shares, Blume owned the other 100 shares, and both had the option to buy up to 700 shares {{at any time in the}} future. But TSR Hobbies had nothing to publish—D was still owned by the <b>3-way</b> partnership of TSR, and neither Gygax nor Blume had the money to buy out the shares owned by Kaye's wife. Blume persuaded a reluctant Gygax to allow his father, Melvin Blume, to buy Donna's shares, and those were converted to 200 shares in TSR Hobbies. In addition, Brian bought another 140 shares. These purchases reduced Gygax from the majority shareholder in control of the company to minority shareholder; he effectively became the Blumes' employee.|$|E
