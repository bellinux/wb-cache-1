5|$|BioWare {{produced}} Neverwinter Nights (2002) for Atari, {{the first}} CRPG to fuse the third-edition Dungeons & Dragons rules with a <b>3D</b> <b>display</b> {{in which the}} user could vary the viewing angle and distance. New game content could be generated using the Aurora toolset supplied {{as part of the}} game release, and players could share their modules and play cooperatively with friends online. Based in part on experiences while playing Ultima Online, one of the goals during development was to reproduce the feel of a live pen-and-paper RPG experience, complete with a human Dungeon Master. Neverwinter Nights (NWN) was very successful commercially, and spawned three official expansion packs and a sequel developed by Obsidian Entertainment. BioWare later produced the acclaimed , which married the d20 system with the Star Wars franchise; as well as the original Jade Empire (2005), Mass Effect (20072012) and Dragon Age (20092014) series, all which were released for multiple platforms. With the Mass Effect and the Dragon Age titles, Bioware also utilized a save import system where decisions in the earlier games impact the story in the later games.|$|E
5|$|The Sands of Time was {{announced}} in March 2003. It was released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Game Boy Advance and Microsoft Windows. The versions were released gradually between October and November 2003. The various versions had multiple differences in both graphics and control options. The GameCube and Xbox versions included a documentary about {{the making of the}} game. Gameloft developed a version of the game for mobile phones, which released in April 2004. Two versions were developed for higher and lower-spec mobile phones. Connecting the GameCube and Game Boy Advance versions of the game gave access to a port of the original Prince of Persia with the GameCube version, along with the ability for the Prince to automatically regenerate health. The PS2 version was released in Japan in September 2004. The game was published in the region by Sony Computer Entertainment Japan, who were impressed by both the quality and the praise it earned in the west. The Sands of Time was later re-released with its two sequels in a Europe-exclusive PlayStation 3 collection on November 19, 2010, which included a <b>3D</b> <b>display</b> option.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, Nintendo {{released}} the Nintendo 3DS, {{based upon a}} glasses-free stereoscopic <b>3D</b> <b>display.</b> In February 2012, Nintendo acquired Mobiclip, a France-based research and development company specialized in highly optimized software technologies such as video compression. The company's name was later changed to Nintendo European Research & Development. During {{the fourth quarter of}} 2012, Nintendo {{released the}} Wii U. It sold slower than expected, despite being the first eighth generation console. By September 2013, however, sales had rebounded. Intending to broaden the 3DS market, Nintendo released 2013's cost-reduced Nintendo 2DS. The 2DS is compatible with but lacks the 3DS's more expensive but cosmetic autostereoscopic 3D feature. Nintendo also released the Wii Mini, a cheaper and non-networked redesign of the Wii.|$|E
25|$|The Nintendo 2DS is an {{entry-level}} {{version of}} the Nintendo 3DS which maintains otherwise identical hardware, similar functionality, and compatibility with software designed for the Nintendo DS and 3DS. However, the 2DS is differentiated by a new slate form factor rather than the clamshell design used by its precursors and by lacking the Nintendo 3DS's signature autostereoscopic <b>3D</b> <b>display.</b> The 2DS is sold concurrently with existing 3DS models as an incentive to expand the market for Nintendo 3DS games; Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé stated that the 2DS was primarily targeted towards younger players (such as those younger than age 7), whom Nintendo had previously advised {{not to use the}} 3D functionality on the 3DS due to potential eye health concerns.|$|E
25|$|Further {{expanding}} the Nintendo DS line, the Nintendo 3DS uses {{the process of}} autostereoscopy to produce a stereoscopic three-dimensional effect without glasses. Released to major markets during 2011, the 3DS {{got off to a}} slow start, initially missing many key features that were promised before the system launched. Partially as a result of slow sales, Nintendo stock declined in value. Subsequent price cuts and game releases helped to boost 3DS and 3DS software sales and to renew investor confidence in the company. As of August 2013, the 3DS was the best selling console in the United States for four consecutive months. The Nintendo 3DS XL was introduced in August 2012 and includes a 90% larger screen, a 4GB SD card and extended battery life. In August 2013, Nintendo announced the cost-reduced Nintendo 2DS, a version of the 3DS without the <b>3D</b> <b>display.</b> It has a slate-like design as opposed to the hinged, clamshell design of its predecessors.|$|E

500|$|Like the Final Fantasy {{games before}} it, Final Fantasy VIII {{consists}} of three main modes of play: the world map, the field map, and the battle screen. The world map is a <b>3D</b> <b>display</b> in which the player may navigate freely across a small-scale rendering of the game world. Characters travel across the world map {{in a variety of}} ways, including by foot, car, Chocobo, train, and airship. The field map consists of controllable 3D characters overlaid on one or more 2D pre-rendered backgrounds, which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests. The battle screen is a 3D model of a location such as a street or room, where turn-based fights between playable characters and CPU-controlled enemies take place. The interface is menu-driven, as in previous titles, but with the typical weapon and armor systems removed and new features present, such as the Junction system. Also featured is a collectible card-based minigame called [...] "Triple Triad".|$|E
500|$|The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask runs on an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} engine used in Ocarina of Time and {{requires the use of}} the 4MB Expansion Pak. IGN theorizes this requirement is due to Majora's Masks possible origin as a Nintendo 64DD game, which would necessitate an extra 4MB of RAM. The use of the Expansion Pak allows for greater draw distances, more accurate dynamic lighting, more detailed texture mapping and animation, complex framebuffer effects such as motion blur, and more characters displayed on-screen. This expanded draw distance allows the player to see much farther and eliminates the need for the fog effect and [...] "cardboard panorama" [...] seen in Ocarina of Time, which were used to obscure distant areas. IGN considered the texture design {{to be one of the}} best created for the Nintendo 64, saying that although some textures have a low resolution, they are [...] "colorful and diverse", which gives each area [...] "its own unique look". Lastly, building interiors are rendered in real-time, unlike the fixed <b>3D</b> <b>display</b> featured in Ocarina of Time.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} ophthalmologic {{factors influencing}} asthenopia while watching <b>3</b> D <b>displays.</b> Methods: 30 adult subjects without ophthalmologic abnormality watched the same <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> for 30 minutes. Each subject's far and near visual acuity, near points of accommodation and convergence, amplitude of fusional convergence and divergence, stereopsis, angle of phoric deviation, tear break-up time, and temperature of ocular surface {{before and after}} watching <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> were measured. And surveys for subjective symptoms right after watching <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> were conducted. The above-mentioned experiments were performed equally with 2 D displays for detection of innate influence of <b>3</b> D <b>displays.</b> Results: The near points of accommodation and convergence were significantly changed after watching <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> (p <. 05) compared to 2 D displays. And all 10 subjective symptoms were significantly increased after watching <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> (p <. 05). Conclusion: The accommodation and binocular vergence are predominant ophthalmologic factors that might influence asthenopia significantly while watching <b>3</b> D <b>displays.</b> Subjective visual discomfort significantly increases with watching <b>3</b> D <b>displays,</b> and more specific evaluation should be added for detecting the practically related factors with asthenopia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A mobile <b>3</b> D <b>display</b> {{processor}} with a subdivider is presented for higher visual quality on handhelds. By combining a subdivision technique with a <b>3</b> D <b>display,</b> the processor can support viewers see realistic smooth surfaces in the air. However, both the subdivision and the <b>3</b> D <b>display</b> processes require {{a high number}} of memory operations to mobile memory architecture. Therefore, we make efforts to save the bandwidth between the processor and off-chip memory. In the subdivider, we propose a re-computing based depth-first scheme that has much smaller working set than prior works. The proposed scheme achieves about 100 : 1 bandwidth reduction over the prior subdivision methods. Also the designed <b>3</b> D <b>display</b> engine reduces the bandwidth to 27 % by reordering the operation sequence of the <b>3</b> D <b>display</b> process. This bandwidth saving translates into reductions of off-chip access energy and time. Consequently the overall bandwidth of both the subdivision and the <b>3</b> D <b>display</b> processes is affordable to a commercial mobile bus. In addition to saving bandwidth, our work provides enough visual quality and performance. Overall the <b>3</b> D <b>display</b> engine achieves 325 fps for 480 × 320 display resolution.

40|$|Air-traffic controllers, {{military}} personnel, {{and others}} need displays that rapidly convey {{the location and}} other attributes of objects (such as aircraft) in 3 D space. The ongoing revolution in the availability of inexpensive and fast 3 D rendering technologies is allowing display designers to develop <b>3</b> D prototype <b>displays</b> for this purpose, such as Figure 1. 1 By <b>3</b> D <b>display,</b> we mean a display that shows a perspective scene view on a flat CRT. The image is 2 D, but the oblique viewing angle means that all three dimensions are projected and represented, to provide a 3 D perspective. Various other true holographic and stereoscopic <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> are under development (such as Travis et al. ’s 2) but most interest in <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> is in flatscreen displays like Figure 1. As part of a wider research effort investigating {{how and when to}} use 2 D and <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> for operational tasks 3 and what symbology we should use to populate them, 4, 5 we wanted to find out which characteristics of <b>3</b> D <b>display</b> actually do enhance performance. We have several reasons to believe that <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> may be preferable to conventional 2 D displays that show an environment from directly above. First, because our retinal images are perspective projections of the world, <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> may be more ecologically plausible than 2 D displays. Similarly, their naturalistic look has led some <b>3</b> D <b>display</b> designers to suggest that they may require minimal interpretive effort. 1 Second, because <b>3</b> D <b>displays</b> integrate all three dimensions of space into a single display, users may be spared the mentally demanding process of scanning back and forth to integrate two planar views to gauge 3 D spatial relationships. 6 Third, users simply prefer the familiarity and easy feel of <b>3</b> D <b>displays.</b> However, counterarguments exist to each of these points. First, if a scene were reproduced with the exact same fidelity as retinal images of that scene, the brain would still need to interpret those images...|$|R
