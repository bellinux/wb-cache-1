25|$|In {{the last}} several years 3D {{printing}} has been intensively used by in the cultural heritage field for preservation, restoration and dissemination purposes. Many Europeans and North American Museums have purchased 3D printers and actively recreate missing pieces of their relics. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum have started using their 3D printers to create museum souvenirs that are available in the museum shops. Other museums, like the National Museum of Military History and Varna Historical Museum, have gone further and sell through the online platform Threeding digital models of their artifacts, created using Artec 3D scanners, in 3D printing friendly file format, which everyone can <b>3D</b> <b>print</b> at home.|$|E
25|$|As 3D {{printers}} {{became more}} accessible to consumers, online social platforms have developed to support the community. This includes websites that allow users to access information {{such as how to}} build a 3D printer, as well as social forums that discuss how to improve <b>3D</b> <b>print</b> quality and discuss 3D printing news, as well as social media websites that are dedicated to share 3D models. RepRap is a wiki based website that was created to hold all information on 3d printing, and has developed into a community that aims to bring 3D printing to everyone. Furthermore, there are other sites such as Pinshape, Thingiverse and MyMiniFactory, which were created initially to allow users to post 3D files for anyone to print, allowing for decreased transaction cost of sharing 3D files. These websites have allowed greater social interaction between users, creating communities dedicated to 3D printing.|$|E

It was widely used by police forces in Europe until at least the 1980s when more powerful 9×19mm handguns began to replace it in this market as well. It does find some use as a backup gun due to the generally small and easily concealable size of the weapons that chambered it (very few [...] "mini pistols" [...] are made in calibers larger than [...]380 ACP, and those few that are, are recent developments), and is popular on the civilian market as a personal defense round.

30|$|It is {{controversial}} {{that the cost}} of construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> is lower than the conventional construction in academic field. The reason is that some scholars have confused attributes between construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> and traditional construction. The cost calculation of construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> cannot follow the rules in conventional construction because construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> was identified as both industrial product and construction product. This paper proposed a new approach to cost calculation of construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> concerning both the properties of industrial and construction product. The cost elements and calculation methods of onsite and offsite <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> were discussed and concluded. The comparison of cost composition among conventional construction, onsite construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing,</b> and offsite construction <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> was presented as well. The paper put forward the idea of cost calculation about industrialized construction, and it solved the problems of cost calculation among different construction technologies.|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> {{technology has}} been available as early as in the 19 th century. The present article therefore asks why the probably disruptive innovation of <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> has been observed as only incremental innovation for so long time. We assume that this incrementalization of the supposed key to the next industrial revolution occurred due to the technologys paradox nature. We hence start form a form-theoretical observation of the inherently paradox nature of observation, subsequent to which we observe <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> as both form and medium. In doing so, we will show that suppliers of <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> solutions currently try to sell <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> as form, whereas demanders observe <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> as medium. In focussing the latter side of the distinction, we finally suggest {{that the key to}} successful <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> business models will be in solutions that relate observations of the technological multifunctionality of <b>3</b> D <b>printing</b> to a social multifunctionality lens...|$|R
