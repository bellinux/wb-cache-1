50|$|Leica copies {{originate}} from the Leica camera that was launched by Ernst Leitz, Wetzlar in 1925; {{it uses the}} <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> <b>perforated</b> film. The design {{was carried out by}} Oskar Barnack, beginning in 1913 by building a camera for 24×36 mm negatives that by now is called the Ur-Leica; but Ernst Leitz did not decide to manufacture it until 1924. Once started, the Leica production volume doubled each year; in 1929, some 16.000 cameras were produced. In 1930, an improved model with interchangeable lens was introduced, followed a year later by the fully developed Leica II with standardized film to lens flange distance, and in 1932 the basic Leica Standard; the Leica concept was established. This camera's features are the basis for defining a Leica copy.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to examine the characteristics of heat transfer and friction factor in the rectangular channel heat exchanger with a classic twisted tape inserts and perforated twisted tape insert. Test section was the single pass concentric tube heat exchanger with inner tube and outer tube made of aluminum. The dimensions of the outer tube were 23. 05 mm x 23. 05 mm for the outer side and 21. 75 mm x 21. 75 mm for the inner side, whereas {{the dimensions of the}} inner tube were 18. 50 mm x 18. 50 mm for the outer side and 17. 20 mm x 17. 20 mm for the inner side. The length of heat exchanger was 1, 998 mm and the length of pressure difference measurement in the inner tube was 2, 018 mm. Flows in the inner tube and in annulus were in opposite directions. Working fluid in the inner tube was hot water which its inlet temperature was maintained at 60 °C, whereas in the annulus was cold water at ± 28 oC. Both of classic twisted tape insert and perforated twisted tape insert with a twist ratio of 4. 0 were made of aluminum strips with a thickness of 0. 76 mm and width of 12. 61 mm which it was twisted so forming twist with the length of pitch was 50. <b>35</b> <b>mm.</b> <b>Perforated</b> twisted tape inserts I and II were punched with hole diameter of 4 mm and 6. 5 mm, respectively, where the distance between the center hole of 4 mm.

5000|$|For cine cameras, film <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> {{wide and}} <b>perforated</b> with {{sprocket}} holes was established {{as the standard}} format in the 1890s. It was used for nearly all film-based professional motion picture production. For amateur use, several smaller and therefore less expensive formats were introduced. 17.5 mm film, created by splitting <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> film, was one early amateur format, but 9.5 mm film, introduced in Europe in 1922, and 16 mm film, introduced in the US in 1923, soon became the standards for [...] "home movies" [...] in their respective hemispheres. In 1932, the even more economical 8 mm format was created by doubling the number of perforations in 16 mm film, then splitting it, usually after exposure and processing. The Super 8 format, still 8 mm wide but with smaller perforations {{to make room for}} substantially larger film frames, was introduced in 1965.|$|R
40|$|Full {{coverage}} {{effusion cooling}} was numerically investigated {{by means of}} conjugate heat transfer (CHT) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for an array of effusion cooling holes in order to maximise the overall cooling effectiveness for a fixed coolant mass flow rate G, kg/sm 2. The baseline case study consisted of a 152 x 152 x 6. <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> <b>perforated</b> wall with a 300 K, 0. 18 kg/sm 2 coolant flow through a square array of 90 o effusion holes. The plate was mounted in a 770 K duct crossflow. The numerical model was validated against the experimental work of Andrews et al. (1990) and showed a maximum disagreement between the prediction and the experimental data of 3 %. The effects of three geometrical parameters, i. e. the inclination of the holes, the pitch in X direction and the pitch in Y direction, on the overall cooling effectiveness were investigated without varying the coolant flow rate. The inclination of the effusion holes was varied between - 33 o and + 33 o from {{the plane of the}} plate, while the pitch in both directions was varied between 10. 64 mm and 19. 76 mm. The numerical investigation was performed using the commercial software ANSYS Workbench following a design of experiments approach. The geometrical modifications were obtained automatically in the CFD solver ANSYS Fluent for each design point by means of the RBF Morph software. This avoided the manual modification of the geometry and the subsequent mesh generation. The optimised configuration was obtained considering the maximisation of the average overall cooling effectiveness as a goal and a chosen minimum value for the local cooling effectiveness of 0. 4 as the constraint. The results showed that the inclination of the effusion holes and the pitch in the Y direction have a greater impact on the cooling effectiveness than the pitch in the X direction, up to 17 %, 28 % and 5 % from the baseline, respectively, within the range of values considered. An optimal combination of the three parameters was determined...|$|R

50|$|The format {{originated}} with Oskar Barnack and his {{introduction of the}} Leica camera in the 1920s. Thus it is sometimes called the Leica format or Barnack format. The name <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> originates with the total width of the 135 film, the <b>perforated</b> <b>cartridge</b> film which was the primary medium of the format prior to {{the invention of the}} full frame DSLR. The term 135 format remains in use. In digital photography, the format {{has come to be known}} as full frame, FF or FX, the latter invented as a trade mark of Nikon. Historically the <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> format was sometimes called miniature format or small format, terms meant to distinguish it from medium format and large format.|$|R

40|$|This study aims to use {{ultrasound}} {{to investigate}} the boundary effect of the cut edge on the osmosis-induced shrinkage and swelling of articular cartilage while {{the distance from the}} scanning site to the edge decreases with the reduction of specimen size. Sixteen cartilage-bone specimens (of diameter 6. <b>35</b> <b>mm)</b> were prepared from normal bovine patellae. The cartilage width was gradually reduced to 4. <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> and to 2. <b>35</b> <b>mm.</b> Shrinkage and swelling were induced by changing the concentration of the saline solution and monitored using nominal 50 MHz focused ultrasound. The parameters including shrinkage and swelling peak strains (εP 1 and εP 2, respectively), shrinkage and swelling equilibrium strains (εE 1 and εE 2, respectively), and shrinkage and swelling slopes (k 1 and k 2, respectively) were extracted. The εP 1, εE 1, εE 2, k 1, and k 2 of the 2. <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> specimens were significantly different (p < 0. 05) from those of the 6. <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> specimens. For the 4. <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> specimens, εE 1 and εP 1 were, respectively, significantly different (p < 0. 05) from εE 1 of the 6. <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> specimens and εP 1 of the 2. <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> specimens. The percentage of coefficient of variation (18. 5 % for shrinkage and 16. 3 % for swelling) of the 2. <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> specimens was much higher than that (< 8. 5 %) of the 6. <b>35</b> <b>mm</b> specimens.
