This paper proposes a typical structure named the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter. The structural characteristics and working principle of the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter was introduced in detail, the prototype of the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter was designed and processed, and the calibration tests and pressure experiments of the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> flow-meter prototype was made at last. We can draw that the three gear flow-meter {{can be used in}} hydraulic system pressure range is less than 25 Mpa, the flow rate was 0. 15 ~ 0. 2 m 3 /h can meet the high requirements of the stability of measurement, and the measurement accuracy in the whole flow range is 0. 2 class. This article provides a reliable experimental data for the design of the micro gear flow-meter...|$|R

5000|$|Ford {{used the}} term [...] "SelectShift" [...] because placing the gear {{selector}} in second gear forced the transmission to start and remain in second gear only, regardless of engine revolutions, or torque {{being sent to the}} unit. If the transmission was placed in <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> the transmission would start in first gear, then shift to second and <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> as normal.|$|R
50|$|Third (3): This mode {{limits the}} {{transmission}} {{to the first}} three gear ratios, or sometimes locks the transmission in <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> This {{can be used to}} climb or going down hill. Some vehicles will automatically shift up out of <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> in this mode if a certain revolutions per minute (RPM) range is reached in order to prevent engine damage. This gear is also recommended while towing a trailer.|$|R
50|$|The <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> in {{the picture}} has 42 teeth. The gear ratio between the idler and <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> is thus 42/21, or 2:1, and hence the final gear ratio is 1.62x2â‰ˆ3.23. For every 3.23 {{revolutions}} of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns one revolution, or for every one revolution of the smallest gear, the largest gear turns 0.31 (1/3.23) revolution, a total reduction of about 1:3.23 (Gear Reduction Ratio (GRR) = 1/Gear Ratio (GR)).|$|R

50|$|Revolo is {{designed}} to work in typical stop-and-go city traffic and allows cars to cruise at about 30 km/h in the <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> without straining the engine.|$|R
50|$|A {{road test}} in Popular Science Magazine (October 1975) noted the {{prototype}} vehicle, {{powered by a}} 900cc Kawasaki, produced a 14 second 1/4 mile, reached 80 mph in <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> and handled banked turns at 40 mph with ease.|$|R
50|$|Carlos Pace had {{handling}} {{problems and}} dropped down the order {{when he lost}} <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> By lap 49, Ronnie Peterson crashed into the catch fencing, whilst Brambilla surrendered third place to change a blistered tyre, resuming but retiring with brake problems.|$|R
5|$|The {{transmission}} {{had three}} speeds with no neutral position; a mechanism held the clutch open when the motorcycle was at idle in first gear. First gear was positioned {{in the middle}} of the shift pattern, with second <b>gear</b> below and <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> above.|$|R
5000|$|The {{previous}} sluggish {{engine performance}} has been improved {{by a new}} [...] "patented turbo combustion" [...] cylinder head and special connecting rods. The troublesome crankshaft is now harmonically balanced. The gearbox has been fitted with a silent <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> or Traffic top.|$|R
5000|$|Takra's output corresponded Fordson Major. During Vakola tests {{it could}} easily pull with a <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> a spade roller harrow with 25 rollers. When {{equipped}} with wheel chains, Takra could pull a two-furrow plough with 14" [...] wings through medium hard soil.|$|R
5000|$|On models {{fitted with}} an {{automatic}} transmission, the lockup torque converter switch malfunctioned, keeping the torque converter locked in <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> when slowing down and stalling the engine when the car came to standstill. This {{was due to the}} poor durability of the plastic switch.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shifting}} sequence {{was very}} different and much rougher than the Hydra-Matics that preceded it, or the Super Turbines and Turbo Hydramatics that followed it. The shift from 1st to 2nd or 2nd to 3rd range was long and drawn-out, ending with a harsh shift. The reason for this was that three things were happening. Not only was the transmission shifting to a very much higher range ( [...] 2.93 to 1.56, {{but it was also}} simultaneously emptying the fluid coupling and making a mechanical lock-up. The wide gap in the reduction ratio between first and second gears combined with the direct mechanical connection to the engine to create a shift that could be firm enough to lug the engine. Because of the mechanical lock-up, there was sometimes a shudder felt as the transmission shifted into <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> (fourth range) by refilling the fluid coupling. Direct drive (1:1 ratio) is achieved by splitting engine power between the fluid coupling (used for first gear) and the front clutch (used for second gear), which are both applied to provide <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> effectively locking the planetary gearsets and forcing them to spin at engine speed. The design is unique in that it provides <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> by applying first and second gears at the same time.|$|R
50|$|At Le Mans in 1955 the Cunningham C6-R, {{fitted with}} an Offenhauser engine, {{retired from the}} race. Second and <b>third</b> <b>gears</b> failed, and the engine, {{designed}} for methanol fuel and insufficiently modified for the mandatory French pump gasoline, overheated. A burned exhaust valve ended the car's run.|$|R
50|$|Rover's new car was {{announced}} 21 August 1931 described in advertisements as: a 12-horsepower six-cylinder having a four-speed gearbox with a silent <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> capable of 65 to 70 mph and 28 to 30 {{miles per gallon}} A de luxe model included safety glass in all windows.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the Mark VII and VIII predecessors, the Borg Warner DG {{automatic}} gearbox started in first gear {{and had a}} dash-mounted switch to allow second gear to be held indefinitely. Once in <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> a series of clutches engaged to allow direct drive rather than through the torque converter.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary reports {{praised the}} all-round {{visibility}} and the commanding driving position while recording {{that it was}} necessary to lean forward a little to engage first and <b>third</b> <b>gears</b> due to the long travel distance of the gear lever. [...] The large 40 cm tall luggage compartment was also commended.|$|R
5000|$|... [...] Unlike most {{front wheel}} drive inline engine transaxles, the gearbox is between the engine and the final drive. Engine-clutch-gearbox-final drive, direct drive through gearbox in <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> fourth [...] "overdrive." [...] Final drive spiral bevel gear on primary shaft, {{step-down}} to differential gear through helical (not herringbone) pinion and gear.|$|R
5000|$|This pair of cars {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the complete lemon". The straight eight engine was subject to bearing failure. The name was changed to Vortic and some modifications made including a silent <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> but it was to try to sell off unwanted stock. They were still offered in 1932.|$|R
50|$|Electrically engaged {{overdrive}} gearboxes were an available {{option on}} all MGBs. The overdrive unit was operational in <b>third</b> and fourth <b>gears</b> (until 1977, when overdrive was only operational in fourth) {{but the overall}} ratio in <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> overdrive was roughly the same as fourth gear direct. The overdrive unit was engaged by a toggle switch located on the dashboard. The switch {{was moved to the}} top of the gearshift knob in 1977. Overdrives were fitted to less than 20% of all MGBs.|$|R
5000|$|Mixing of gearsets can be {{achieved}} due to the similarity between the various transmissions, but some gears must be interchanged in sets. First and second gear are integral to the input shaft and cannot be interchanged independently. All transmissions have a <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> ratio of 1.38:1. However, <b>third</b> and fourth <b>gear</b> are clustered on the counter shaft which was available with two different fourth gear ratios: 1.03:1 or [...]94:1. Fifth gear is independently interchangeable and available with a [...]80:1 and [...]72:1 ratio.|$|R

50|$|Later {{cars had}} {{shallower}} doors. In 1950, the Vanguard and the Triumph Renown {{were the first}} cars to be fitted with a Laycock de Normanville clutchless overdrive controlled from the gearlever. The Phase 2 car was available with the Laycock overdrive that operated on the second and <b>third</b> <b>gears</b> of the three-speed transmission, creating, in effect, a five-speed gearbox.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to the AW's 25% {{reduction}} in first gear, direct-drive second gear, and 33.33% overdrive 3rd gear, the SW offered slightly wider gearing, {{referred to by}} Brian Hayes as [...] "super-wide" [...] gearing, with 27.7% reduction for first gear, direct-drive second, and taller 38.4% overdrive <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> Riders appreciate the nearly silent operation of its springless centrifugal pawls.|$|R
5000|$|The Jeep Truck was {{available}} {{with only one}} transmission, the Borg-Warner T-90 three-speed manual, with synchromeshed second and <b>third</b> <b>gears.</b> A Spicer/Dana 18 transfer case was used on four-wheel drive models. The heavy duty Timken 51540 {{was used in the}} early years of production, later being replaced by the Dana 53. The front axle was a Dana 25 ...|$|R
5000|$|On manual {{transmission}} 1593 cc four-cylinder engined cars September 1973 also saw small {{changes to the}} gear ratios for second and <b>third</b> <b>gear.</b> At this time lateral stabilizer bars were also fitted front and back which provided a belated answer to widespread criticism of the original car's propensity to wallow when changing direction or driving on irregular road surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|Splitter {{transmissions}} use an [...] "H" [...] {{pattern with}} a wide range of gears, and the other selector splits each sequential gear position in two: First gear is in first position/low split, second gear is in first position/high split, <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> is in second position/low split, fourth gear is in second position/high split, and so on.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} gears on the manual shift (first <b>gear,</b> second <b>gear,</b> <b>third</b> <b>gear,</b> fourth gear, and neutral). Depending on the {{jurisdiction}} and/or location that the arcade cabinet is located in, the speed will either {{be measured in}} kilometres per hour or miles per hour; this is {{set up by the}} arcade operator upon calibration and cannot be altered by the player. For example, most video arcades in the United States would have the machine set to read the speed in MPH while cruise ships and international attractions would set the speed to KM/H.|$|R
50|$|Other key {{improvements}} over the TR3 included a wider track front and rear, slightly larger standard engine displacement, full synchromesh on all forward gears, and {{rack and pinion}} steering. In addition, the optional Laycock de Normanville electrically operated overdrive could now be selected for second and <b>third</b> <b>gears</b> as well as fourth, effectively providing the TR4 with a seven-speed manual close ratio gearbox.|$|R
50|$|Scattered {{throughout}} the stage are red boxes marked with yellow wrenches that contain either chips or health. Each stage also contains two red gears that upgrades the drills gearbox to allow Jill to shift her Drill Dozer {{to the second}} and <b>third</b> <b>gears.</b> The higher the gear, the more powerful the Drill Dozers drill is and the longer it spins.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{available}} transmission was the six-speed manual Tremec T56. The transmission used the skip-shift feature to conserve fuel during light loads by preventing drivers {{from using the}} second and <b>third</b> <b>gears,</b> and a dual mass flywheel to reduce [...] "rattle" [...] in no load conditions. The rear axle was a Getrag limited slip IRS unit with a 3.73:1 ratio.|$|R
25|$|Through all the retirements and bungled pit-stops, Red Bull driver David Coulthard {{raced to}} what became a strong fifth {{position}} despite losing <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> in the team's new quick shift gearbox. Despite Williams driver Rosberg's best attempts, {{he was unable}} to pass the Scot. This was Red Bull's strongest result so far this season and highlighted the improving performance of the Adrian Newey designed RB3 chassis.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the vehicle}} has {{completed}} {{the shift to}} second gear, the first gear is immediately de-selected, and <b>third</b> <b>gear</b> (being on the same shaft as 1st and 5th) is pre-selected, and is pending. Once the time comes to shift into 3rd, the second clutch disengages and the first clutch re-engages. This method of operation continues {{in the same manner}} for the remaining forward gears.|$|R
