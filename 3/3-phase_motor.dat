According to these claims, a Chorus AC motor can generate far more torque than its conventional brethren.

5000|$|In January 2008, a {{new model}} was introduced, the REVAi (G-Wiz i in the United Kingdom). It has an AC drive system, which raises the maximum speed to 80 km/h. The power flows through a 350 Amp motor {{controller}} to a <b>3-phase</b> AC <b>motor</b> rated at [...] peak. Like the REVA, power comes from eight 6 V, 200 A h lead-acid batteries located under the front seats.|$|R
50|$|The {{other popular}} motor to {{consider}} when building a BugE is an AC motor. There are two main classifications for AC motors: induction and synchronous. The most popular AC motor for electric vehicles is the <b>3-phase</b> induction <b>motor.</b> The AC motor still uses a DC power source so, instead of the controller {{that would be used}} with a DC drive system, an inverter is needed. This can increase the overall price in comparison with the DC motor system.|$|R
50|$|DOL {{starting}} {{is sometimes}} used to start small water pumps, compressors, fans and conveyor belts. In {{the case of}} an asynchronous motor, such as the <b>3-phase</b> squirrel-cage <b>motor,</b> the motor will draw a high starting current until it has run up to full speed. This starting current is typically 6-7 times greater than the full load current. To reduce the inrush current, larger motors will have reduced-voltage starters or variable speed drives in order to minimise voltage dips to the power supply.|$|R
50|$|WAG-9 {{is a type}} of {{electric}} locomotive used in India. It is the most powerful freight locomotive in Indian Railways' fleet. It is very similar to WAP-7; the only major difference being the gear ratio which makes it suitable for heavy freight operations. In November 1998, Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW) started producing these with indigenous components. The first one, 'Navyug' (translated, 'New Era'), was flagged off on November 14. Like the WAP-5 units, they have GTO thyristor converters and <b>3-phase</b> asynchronous <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} system also comprises a hydraulic pump, which {{is driven by}} a 50-horsepower, 480 volt, <b>3-phase</b> electric <b>motor.</b> The electric motor is constantly running, and is cooled by a large fan. The pump, however, is only engaged when hydraulic pressure needs to be generated. For instance, when a vehicle is stopped and the motion base is not moving, the pump will only engage one or two times per minute. However, when the vehicle is traveling through the attraction, the pump is engaged {{for the majority of}} the time.|$|R
5000|$|Zero's Lithium-ion {{power packs}} and motors were {{developed}} in-house, and are branded under the names [...] "Z-Force" [...] and [...] "ZF".

The motorcycles' propulsion {{is provided by}} a single electric, air-cooled, brushless, permanent-magnet <b>3-phase</b> AC <b>motor.</b> The motor is directly coupled to the rear wheel by a belt or - optionally on the Zero FX - a chain. A controller manages the power delivery and comes in 420-amp, 550-amp, 660-amp, and 775-amp sizes depending on the year and model.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Fifth Continent {{converted}} the PSO-1960 camera to accept camera negative stock milled for the BH 4740 'negative perforation'. This is because film stock {{is no longer}} milled for KS 'positive perforation'. In 2007, a crystal-sync motor replaced the original 24-volt DC variable speed motor {{as well as the}} 240-volt <b>3-phase</b> 50-hertz synch <b>motor.</b>|$|R
50|$|Earlier stock, {{like most}} {{electric}} trains before the 1990s, used DC motors. These are now regarded as inefficient, {{partly because they}} are traditionally controlled by resistors, and partly because a <b>3-phase</b> AC induction <b>motor</b> can provide higher specific power and volumetric power density. The brushes and commutator of a DC motor are prone to wear and require regular maintenance, while an induction machine does not.|$|R
50|$|The Sparrow {{is powered}} by a 20 kW (continuous) 156-volt DC or <b>3-phase</b> AC {{electric}} <b>motor</b> and has a range of 32 to 64 km (20 to 40 miles) and a top speed of 112 km/h (70 mph). Fuel efficiency is approximately 130 W·h/km (4.8 mi/(kW·h), which is equivalent to 162 mpg (US) or 194 mpg (UK) (1.45 L/100 km) using the DOE conversion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electric}} motor provides greater efficiency by replacing the starter and alternator {{with a single}} device which assists the powertrain. Mild hybrids do not require {{the same level of}} battery power and do not achieve the same levels of fuel economy improvement as compared to full hybrid models. One example is the 2005-07 Chevrolet Silverado, Parallel Hybrid Truck (PHT) a full-size pickup truck with a single 7 kW <b>3-phase</b> electric <b>motor</b> mounted in the bell-housing between the engine and a conventional 4L60E transmission. Chevrolet was able to get a 10% improvement on the Silverado's city fuel efficiency by shutting down and restarting the engine on demand, and the reduction of parasitic accessory loads. However the PHT had no power assist features or all-electric [...] "electric vehicle" [...] (EV) capability, and very limited regenerative braking features.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{technical}} problems reported for Tangaras generally, included brake failure and reported power surge problems. After the accident, they were often blamed by some for being {{the cause of the}} accident. Many of the survivors of the accident mentioned a large acceleration before the accident occurred. Furthermore, there was an understanding that the emergency brake should be seldom used because the train would accelerate between 5 and 10 km/h before the brake came into effect. IT was noted that the G7 trainset was the only train in the Tangara fleet to use <b>3-phase</b> induction <b>motors,</b> and that these are not able to [...] "run-away". Furthermore, the majority of braking and traction system components were thoroughly examined and tested by experts from Australia and overseas, and found to be working normally. Those damaged in the crash were examined and were also found not to have had pre-existing damage able to cause such an accident.|$|R

2500|$|Modern {{electrification}} systems take AC {{energy from}} a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and {{converted to a}} DC voltage {{to be used by}} traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be <b>3-phase</b> AC <b>motors</b> which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? [...] And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? [...] Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). [...] Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. [...] Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.|$|R
