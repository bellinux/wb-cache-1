Materials and Methods: We compared the frictional resistance in 0. 018 slot and 0. 022 slot of the three brackets - titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> - using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> archwires and TMA archwires. An in vitro study of simulated canine retraction was undertaken to evaluate the difference in frictional resistance between titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets, using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and TMA archwires. Results and Conclusion: We compared the frictional resistance of titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets, using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> and TMA archwires, with the help of Instron Universal Testing Machine. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Student′s "t" test, and post hoc multiple range test at level of < 0. 05 showed statistically significant difference in the mean values of all groups. Results demonstrated that the titanium, self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets of 0. 018 -inch and 0. 022 -inch slot had no significant variations in frictional résistance.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the quantitative effects on torque expression of varying the slot size of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> orthodontic brackets and {{the dimension of}} <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire, and to analyze {{the limitations of the}} experimental methods used. Materials and Methods: In vitro studies measuring torque expression in conventional and self-ligating <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> brackets with a torque-measuring device, with the use of straight <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> orthodontic wire without second-order mechanics and without loops, coils, or auxiliary wires, were sought through a systematic review process.
