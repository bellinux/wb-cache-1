Our approach is based on a logical decomposition of the elements of <b>3</b> D <b>rendering</b> into four major class categories: Shapes define geometric objects; attributes specify quality and visual appearance; controllers describe rendering techniques and rendering processes, and rendering engines evaluate shapes, attributes, and controllers. We have implemented our concepts in VRS, the Virtual Rendering System, as a portable C++ toolkit.

40|$|Virtual 3 D city models provide {{powerful}} {{user interfaces}} for communication of 2 D and 3 D geoinformation. Providing high quality visualization of massive 3 D geoinformation in a scalable, fast, and cost efficient manner {{is still a}} challenging task. Especially for mobile and web-based system environments, software and hardware configurations of target systems differ significantly. This {{makes it hard to}} provide fast, visually appealing renderings of 3 D data throughout a variety of platforms and devices. Current mobile or web-based solutions for 3 D visualization usually require raw 3 D scene data such as triangle meshes together with textures delivered from server to client, what makes them strongly limited in terms of size and complexity of the models they can handle. In this paper, we introduce a new approach for provisioning of massive, virtual 3 D city models on different platforms namely web browsers, smartphones or tablets, by means of an interactive map assembled from artificial oblique image tiles. The key concept is to synthesize such images of a virtual 3 D city model by a <b>3</b> D <b>rendering</b> service in a preprocessing step. This service encapsulates model handling and <b>3</b> D <b>rendering</b> techniques for high quality visualization of massive 3 D models. By generating image tiles using this service, the <b>3</b> D <b>rendering</b> process is shifted from the client side, which provides major advantages: (a) The complexity of the 3 D city model data is decoupled from data transfer complexity (b) the implementation of client applications is simplified significantly as <b>3</b> D <b>rendering</b> is encapsulated on server side (c) 3 D city models can be easily deployed for and used by a large number of concurrent users, leading to a high degree of scalability of the overall approach. All core <b>3</b> D <b>rendering</b> techniques are performed on a dedicated <b>3</b> D <b>rendering</b> server, and thin-client applications can be compactly implemented for various devices and platforms...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{extend our}} {{previous}} work [1] {{which is a}} new method for early depth test in a <b>3</b> D <b>rendering</b> engine. We add a filter stage to the rasterizer in the <b>3</b> D <b>rendering</b> engine, {{in an attempt to}} identify and avoid the occluded pixels. This filtering block determines if a pixel is hidden by a certain plane. The plane is a mask having the history of a pixelâs appearances in front of it. If a pixel is hidden by the plane, it can be removed. The filter adaptively updates its position from an initial position in order to find a maximum rejection ratio. The simulation results show that the filter reduces the number of pixels to the next stage up to 71. 7 %.
