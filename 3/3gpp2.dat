25|$|PMC-Sierra offers {{communication}} ICs for metro access, metro transport, FTTH/PON, Ethernet over SONET/SDH, Optical Transport Network (OTN) {{and wireless}} base transceiver stations (BTS). PMC-Sierra sells products {{for what is}} known as Ethernet in the first mile, which generally uses a passive optical network to residential areas. PMC-Sierra semiconductor devices allow wireless service providers to deploy wireless mobile phone network equipment. This includes MIPS-based network processors for wireless back haul and radio frequency integrated circuits for wideband radio modules. The company's UniTRX chipsets are highly integrated, low-power RFICs for wideband radio modules that operate in the 400MHz to 4GHz frequency range. These solutions address the performance requirements of 3GPP and <b>3GPP2</b> macro base station radio transceivers and support multiple standards such as MC-GSM, cdma2000Â®, WCDMA, and LTE.|$|E
