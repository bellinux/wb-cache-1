It {{is also possible that}} ATS-6 was a forerunner of the large ELINT satellites such as Mentor.|$|R
50|$|Haeussermann's {{main area}} of work was in {{automatic}} guidance and control for missiles. For example, he {{was instrumental in}} the design of the Saturn V system. He also conducted research more broadly, for instance in <b>3-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> control and the use of Hall devices in aerospace control devices. In his late career, he examined control issues related to experiments on board the Space Shuttle.|$|R

50|$|The {{center of}} the PFD usually {{contains}} an <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> (AI), which gives the pilot information about the aircraft's pitch and roll characteristics, and {{the orientation of the}} aircraft with respect to the horizon. Unlike a traditional <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator,</b> however, the mechanical gyroscope is not contained within the panel itself, but is rather a separate device whose information is simply displayed on the PFD. The <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> is designed to look very much like traditional mechanical AIs. Other information {{that may or may not}} appear on or about the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> can include the stall angle, a runway diagram, ILS localizer and glide-path “needles”, and so on. Unlike mechanical instruments, this information can be dynamically updated as required; the stall angle, for example, can be adjusted in real time to reflect the calculated critical angle of attack of the aircraft in its current configuration (airspeed, etc.). The PFD may also show an indicator of the aircraft's future path (over the next few seconds), as calculated by onboard computers, making it easier for pilots to anticipate aircraft movements and reactions.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> {{are also}} used on manned {{spacecraft}} and are called Flight Director <b>Attitude</b> <b>Indicators</b> (FDAI), where they indicate the craft's yaw angle (nose left or right), pitch (nose up or down), roll, and orbit relative to a fixed-space inertial reference frame, for which an FDAI can be configured to use known positions relative to Earth or the stars, so that the engineers, scientists and astronauts can communicate the relative position, attitude, and orbit of the craft.|$|R
5000|$|These {{include the}} Horizontal Situation <b>Indicator</b> (HSI) and <b>Attitude</b> Director <b>Indicator</b> (ADI). The HSI {{combines}} the magnetic compass with navigation signals and a Glide slope. The navigation information {{comes from a}} VOR/Localizer, or GPS. The ADI is an <b>Attitude</b> <b>Indicator</b> with computer-driven steering bars, a task reliever during instrument flight.|$|R

40|$|The {{layout of}} a {{remotely}} piloted vehicle (RPV) flight instrument display was evaluated. An eye tracking system was employed to record pilots 2 ̆ 7 eye movements while they perform two tasks in a computer simulated control environment. Fixation duration and fixation frequency were calculated for each flight instrument. Link analysis was conducted to evaluate the frequency of eye movement transitions between each pair of instruments. ^ There were several major findings: 1) the heading indicator, which was a numeric indicator, was easier to interpret {{than some of the}} flight instruments that used moving textbox symbology, and thus suggested that the moving textbox symbology did not function well in providing qualitative cues as it was designed for; 2) the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> was the most important instrument and 3) the locations of the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator,</b> airspeed, and heading indicator on the flight display were adequate, but the altitude indicator should be placed closer to the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> as compared to the vertical speed indicator and RPM. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{instrument}} {{may develop}} small [...] "precession" [...] errors, in pitch indication during {{extended periods of}} acceleration or deceleration and, in bank indication during extended periods in a turn, caused by the mechanism that normally keeps the gyro rotor properly erected. These errors develop very slowly (usually at not more than 2 or 3 degrees per minute) and are not significant in normal flying. Some <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> can only tolerate a specific range of bank angles. If the aircraft rolls too steeply or achieves an extreme pitch attitude — while performing aerobatics, for example — the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> can [...] "tumble" [...] (or [...] "topple") and become temporarily unusable. For this reason, some <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> are fitted with a [...] "caging mechanism" [...] (a device to restore the gyroscope to an erect position). Some <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> can be manually erected once the airplane is in level flight using the caging mechanism. Most modern instruments are designed to tolerate 360 degrees of rotation in pitch and roll without tumbling, although periods of violent aerobatics may tumble any gyro horizon. [...] Once tumbled, an instrument without a caging mechanism {{may not be able}} to re-erect itself until power is removed and the aircraft is in a level pitch and roll attitude for a long enough period that the gyro rotor comes to a stop.|$|R

5000|$|Most US {{aircraft}} built {{since the}} 1940s have flight instruments {{arranged in a}} standardized pattern called the [...] "T" [...] arrangement. [...] The <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> is in the top center, airspeed to the left, altimeter {{to the right and}} heading <b>indicator</b> under the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator.</b> The other two, turn-coordinator and vertical-speed, are usually found under the airspeed and altimeter, but are given more latitude in placement. The magnetic compass will be above the instrument panel, often on the windscreen centerpost. In newer aircraft with glass cockpit instruments the layout of the displays conform to the basic T arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The first {{critical}} hurdle for any deployed spacecraft is {{to establish}} communications with the ground. This was achieved on the first pass over the MinXSS ground station in Boulder, Colorado. As a science mission, success is determined by receipt of useful scientific measurements. MinXSS first light was presented at a press briefing and a contributed poster during the American Astronomical Society's 47th Solar Physics Division Meeting in Boulder, Colorado. Over 40 GOES C-class and 7 M-class solar flares occurred in the first weeks of the MinXSS mission, and those observations were downlinked to the ground for analysis. The results of those analyses will be the subjects of several upcoming peer-review papers. Additionally, MinXSS was the first flight of the Blue Canyon Technologies XACT <b>3-axis</b> <b>attitude</b> determination and control system (ADCS). It continuously performed exceptionally, with 8 arcsecond (1-sigma) pointing, where the specification was for 11 arcseconds.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> (AI), {{also known}} as gyro horizon or {{artificial}} horizon or <b>attitude</b> director <b>indicator</b> (ADI, when it has a Flight Director), is an instrument used in an aircraft to inform the pilot of {{the orientation of the}} aircraft relative to Earth's horizon. It indicates pitch (fore and aft tilt) and bank (side to side tilt) and is a primary instrument for flight in instrument meteorological conditions.|$|R
25|$|Despite initial {{reports that}} {{technical}} issues {{had resulted in}} the accident, the cause {{was found to be}} spatial disorientation of the pilot following the loss of the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator.</b> Flying in poor weather conditions, the flight crew would have had to rely only on their instruments; such a situation is known as instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The failure of the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> was caused by the failure of both generators and the crew using an outdated checklist and not adhering to a checklist; the battery was therefore drained of power in less than half the time that it {{should have been able to}} supply power for.|$|R
50|$|Dominating {{the forward}} {{section of the}} cabin was the {{crescent-shaped}} main display panel measuring nearly 7 ft wide and 3 ft tall. It was arranged into three panels, each emphasizing the duties of each crew member. The mission commander’s panel (left side) included the velocity, <b>attitude,</b> and altitude <b>indicators,</b> the primary flight controls, and the main FDAI (Flight Director <b>Attitude</b> <b>Indicator).</b>|$|R
50|$|As a {{condition}} of certification, all aircraft utilizing the G1000 integrated cockpit must have a redundant airspeed <b>indicator,</b> altimeter, <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator,</b> and magnetic compass. In {{the event of a}} failure of the G1000 instrumentation, these backup instruments become primary.|$|R
50|$|An ISIS is {{designed}} to combine the functions of separate equivalent mechanical instruments {{that had previously been}} included as backup in such cockpits, including altimeter, airspeed <b>indicator,</b> and <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator.</b> More sophisticated integrated standby systems can include additional functions.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, {{a flight}} {{director}} (FD) is a flight instrument that is overlaid on the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> {{that shows the}} pilot of an aircraft the attitude required to follow a certain trajectory to which the flight is to be conducted.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} proposed {{two possible}} causes: a short-time negative thrust due to {{failure of the}} far right engine and false readings of the <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators,</b> even though both causes {{could lead to the}} disaster only in the presence of other factors.|$|R
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} accident was the loss of spatial orientation by the crew and chiefly by the Captain who was piloting the aircraft during the landing phase. The plane banked left, overturned and went into a rapid descent. The loss of spatial orientation occurred in the night, while flying in the clouds, with autopilot and autothrottle switched off. Poor CRM and insufficient training for using the Western type of <b>attitude</b> <b>indicators</b> contributed to the accident. The pilots had previously flown Tupolev Tu-134 and Antonov An-24 with {{a different type of}} <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> (where the bank angle is shown by the movements of an aircraft symbol, and the indicator's background does not turn left or right).|$|R
50|$|European Aviation Safety Agency {{certification}} {{for private}} use was achieved on 21 November 2008. It requires the aircraft to be equipped {{differently from the}} FAA certification, including the Avio NG 1.5 avionics system, a third <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> and dual Mode S transponders.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary cause}} of the crash was that both pilots had lost spatial {{orientation}} due to their inexperience with the Western type of <b>attitude</b> <b>indicator</b> on the aircraft.
