After visiting the National Gallery, or Hertford House, or hearing Brahms or Beethoven at the Bechstein Hall, she {{would come back to}} find a new person awaiting her, in whose soul were imbedded some grains of the invaluable substance which she still called reality, and still believed that she could find. The Hilberys, as the saying is, [...] "knew every one," [...] and that arrogant claim was certainly upheld by the number of houses which, within a certain area, lit their lamps at night, opened their doors after <b>3</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> and admitted the Hilberys to their dining-rooms, say, once a month. An indefinable freedom and authority of manner, shared by {{most of the people who}} lived in these houses, seemed to indicate that whether it was a question of art, music, or government, they were well within the gates, and could smile indulgently at the vast mass of humanity which is forced to wait and struggle, and pay for entrance with common coin at the door. The gates opened instantly to admit Cassandra. She was naturally critical of what went on inside, and inclined to quote what Henry would have said; but she often succeeded in contradicting Henry, in his absence, and invariably paid her partner at dinner, or the kind old lady who remembered her grandmother, the compliment of believing that there was meaning in what they said. For the sake of the light in her eager eyes, much crudity of expression and some untidiness of person were forgiven her. It was generally felt that, given a year or two of experience, introduced to good dressmakers, and preserved from bad influences, she would be an acquisition. Those elderly ladies, who sit on the edge of ballrooms sampling the stuff of humanity between finger and thumb and breathing so evenly that the necklaces, which rise and fall upon their breasts, seem to represent some elemental force, such as the waves upon the ocean of humanity, concluded, a little smilingly, that she would do. They meant that she would in all probability marry some young man whose mother they respected.|$|E

Document A (March 5) shows my anticipation of the enemy's campaign....:On {{the night of the}} 8th, shortly after the action closed, I ordered a force of cavalry to push on the road from Blair's Landing to Pleasant Hill, taking a cross-road from Mansfield which fell into that road near the ferry over the Bayou Pierre, mentioning in the order that a small force posted on the bluff overlooking Bayou Pierre could delay indefinitely the crossing of that stream from the east. Unfortunately this order was construed to mean that its execution was to follow on possession of Pleasant Hill, so that I could not decide what force we were confronted by on the 9th. It was late after midday before the infantry got up, and a glance at Churchill's troops showed they were too much exhausted to attack. The infantry was ordered to lie down and rest for two hours. Mean time cavalry was pushed right and left to gain information, and a party was sent on the Blair's Landing road by a detour to the left, to procure the intelligence of which I was deprived by the mistake above mentioned. This party did not return until after the attack. At <b>3</b> <b>p.</b> <b>m.,</b> the infantry being somewhat restored by rest, the plan of attack was formed and the troops put in motion. The Arkansas and Missouri divisions, under Churchill and Parsons, with Etter's and Daniel's batteries, were sent to the right to outflank the enemy, reach the Jesup road, and attack from the south and west.:R.

The substantial advantages over the original method are con rmed with extensive veri cations. The modi ed <b>P</b> <b>3</b> <b>M</b> method is implemented into an ensemble Monte Carlo (EMC) simulator, MOCA 3 D, to treat the Coulomb scattering, i. e. carrier-carrier and carrier-impurity scattering. We show {{that most of the}} problems in the particle{mesh (PM) based scattering rate approach are solved by the <b>P</b> <b>3</b> <b>M</b> method. The properties of the Coulomb scattering are analyzed by comparison of the proposed and the conventional approaches. One of the important observations is that the introduction of discrete dopants in EMC simulation signi cantly in uences the carrier energy and the device performance. The proposed method can also be applied for the random dopant uctuation (RDF) simulation, in which the accurate treatment of charge granular e ect is required. Furthermore, a 2 -D <b>P</b> <b>3</b> <b>M</b> method is developed based on the 3 -D approach. The inherent di culty in 2 -D simulation, due to the line-charge approximation, can be overcome by a quasi 3 -D approach.
