40|$|A case of {{ulnar artery}} {{thrombosis}} following a sports-related injury is reported. Treatment by resection of the thrombosed segment and replacement with a reversed vein graft resulted in complete relief of symptoms. An extensive {{review of the}} literature is presented. Thrombosis of the ulnar artery and the superficial palmar arch was first recognized by von Rosen 54 in 1934. The diagnosis is seen in association with vascular or neurologic compromise of the hand and is often missed. 29 This diagnosis has been described in the literature as ulnar artery throm-bosis,&dquo;-~-~’~-~- ~ ulnar artery insufficiency,&dquo; hy-pothenar hammer syndrome, 4, lo, 18, 35, <b>36</b> <b>pneumatic</b> tool dis-ease, 46 and posttraumatic digital ischemia. l ° Ulnar artery thrombosis was noted to have a higher than expected inci...|$|E
40|$|An {{integrated}} microfluidic immunoassay {{system was}} established for high throughput analysis of clenbuterol. This system consisted {{of an integrated}} microchip and a linear confocal laser induced fluorescence (LIF) scanner. The microchip was composed of three layers: a fluidic channel layer, a PDMS membrane layer and a pneumatic control layer. The multi-layer chip was integrated with <b>36</b> <b>pneumatic</b> micro-valves and multiple micro-pumps to realize the flexible reagent delivery, facilitating the automatic assays with less consumption of samples and reduced analysis time. The homemade LIF scanner was able to simultaneously detect multi-channels and provide the potential capability of high throughput assays. The performance of the system was demonstrated by the determination of clenbuterol, {{one of the most}} widely used beta-agonists. Under the optimal conditions, the linear range and the limit of detection of clenbuterol were 0 similar to 5. 0 ng mL(- 1) and 0. 088 ng mL(- 1), respectively. The recovery rates determined with pig urine samples of 1. 0 ng mL(- 1) and 2. 0 ng mL(- 1) were 98. 74 % and 102. 51 % (n = 3), respectively. The total detection time was less than 30 min. The system had the potential application for rapid detection of multiple beta-agonists in clinical, pharmaceutical and chemical analyses...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} an Intelligent Chair Tool (ICT) - a new chair-type {{human and}} machine interaction seating system powered by <b>36</b> intelligent <b>pneumatic</b> actuators. This tool {{can be used}} to facilitate investigation of chair shapes from spring and damping effects of seating and backrest surfaces. Each actuator used consists of five extensive elements of encoder, laser strip rod, pressure sensor, valves and PSoC microcontroller incorporated in a single device. By using the ICT, different shapes, spring and damping characteristics can be obtained to aid the design of chairs from the control inputs, i. e., position x, stiffness k s and viscous coefficient c. Several control algorithms are presented to realize the communication and control system, and to obtain all data in real-time. The control methodology presented contains an inner force loop and an outer position loop implemented using a unified control system. The specification, development design and experimental evaluation of the ICT control system and actuator used are presented and discussed...|$|R

During January–February 2009, an active-source seismic survey was performed over the Eastern Lau Spreading Center in the Lau Back-Arc Basin (21 °S, 176 °S). Acoustic signals generated by the R/V Langseth's <b>36</b> -gun <b>pneumatic</b> source array were recorded within the deep sound channel at offsets of 29 – 416 km. The local ocean acoustic environment is everywhere bottom limited, with seafloor depths within the study domain ranging from ∼ 1700 – 2800 m. Low-frequency (4 – 125 Hz) sound levels are monitored using root-mean-square, energy-flux-density and zero-to-peak measurement techniques. From these field data, transmission loss is found to exceed the predictions of a geometric spherical spreading model. At similar ranges, arrival amplitudes vary by up to 20 dB and durations vary by a factor of three to six. The depth of the seafloor beneath the air gun source exhibits a positive correlation with arrival duration and a negative correlation with range-corrected amplitude, explaining up to 30 % of the observed variation in both parameters. The strength of this correlation, however, varies for stations lying at different azimuths, highlighting the importance of seafloor aspect and slope in the coupling of bottom-interacting acoustic energy into the sound channel. Range-dependent ray tracing shows that shots deployed over shallower seafloor are more likely to produce sound channel trapped signals that propagate with limited bottom interaction. This results in arrivals that are more impulsive, with shorter durations and higher amplitudes. Shots deployed in deeper water typically undergo a larger number of bounces and are characterized by more emergent, longer duration and smaller amplitude arrivals...|$|R
