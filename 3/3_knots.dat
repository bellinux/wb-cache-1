25|$|By 1913, Woodbury was {{not only}} the Coast Guard's oldest cutter, she was the oldest active-duty vessel in U.S. {{government}} service, as well as being the only ship to have seen active service in both the American Civil War and the Spanish–American War. Despite her age, she was still able to perform useful service. On 10 January 1913, for example, the crew of Woodbury were able to effect temporary repairs to their ship's broken rudder to go to the aid of the steamer Monhegan, which, after breaking down on the Maine coast, was being driven to destruction by a gale. Woodbury was able to get a line to the stricken vessel and tow it to safety, albeit at the stately pace of <b>3</b> <b>knots.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{this paper}} we will {{consider}} the number of minimal surfaces which do not touch all of a C <b>3</b> <b>knot</b> in R <b>3.</b> We find a lower bound {{of the number of}} soap-film-like minimal surfaces panning part of a given C <b>3</b> <b>knot</b> in R <b>3.</b> This lower bound is called the admissible number of the knot. To do this, we will use the model defined by H. R. Parks [4], soap-film-like minimal suraces homotopically spanning knots modulo L. 1. Introduction. The general Plateau problem is to find a minimal surface with a given wire boundary. After the disc type solutions were obtained by J. Douglas [2] and T.

25|$|The North Carolina Sounds occupy most of {{the coast}} from Cape Lookout (North Carolina) to the Virginia border.

Raiders, either privateers or state-owned vessels, could lie inside, protected from both the weather and from Yankee blockaders, until an undefended victim appeared. Watchers stationed at the Hatteras lighthouse would then signal a raider, which would dash out and make a capture, often being able to return the same day.|$|E

40|$|In [EH], Etnyre and Honda {{provide a}} {{classification}} of the Legendrian isotopy classes for a (2, 3) -cable of a (2, <b>3)</b> -torus <b>knot</b> {{as it is}} embedded in S 3 with the standard contact structure. To do this, they use the theory of convex surfaces in a tight contact structure. Their classification takes the visual form of a mountain range formed from points having values of (r,tb), where r is the rotation number and tb is the Thurston-Bennequin number. In [M 3] and [MM], the two Legendrian classes at (r,tb) = (2, 5) are realized as rectangular braided diagrams, and are seen to be related by an elementary negative flype. In this note, we first prove directly that the rectangular braided diagrams in [M 3] do represent the two Legendrian classes at (r,tb) = (2, 5). In the process we provide a way to visualize convex tori peripheral to positive torus <b>knots</b> in S <b>3.</b> We then complete {{the realization of the}} Legendrian isotopy classes for a (2, 3) -cable of a (2, <b>3)</b> -torus <b>knot,</b> describing how to construct a Legendrian representative of arbitrary (r,tb) value. We also analyze the relationships amongst these representatives, and this analysis yields an enhanced Legendrian mountain range where elementary negative flypes allow us to move toward the maximal tb value without having to use Legendrian stabilization. Thus, we obtain for this particular cable knot type a Legendrian Markov Theorem without Stabilization (LMTWS). Finally, the enhanced Legendrian mountain range and associated LMTWS determines the transverse classes of a (2, 3) -cable of a (2, <b>3)</b> -torus <b>knot</b> along with an associated transverse Markov Theorem without Stabilization (TMTWS). Specifically, negative braid destabilizations and an elementary negative flype are sufficient to move toward maximal self-linking number in the transverse classes of a (2, 3) -cable of a (2, <b>3)</b> -torus <b>knot...</b>|$|R
