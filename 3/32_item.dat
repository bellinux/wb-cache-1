40|$|Investigates {{the effects}} of a priming {{activity}} on the reading comprehension of a science topic for subjects with low prior knowledge about that topic and/or for subjects with misconceptions about the topic. The priming activity taught concepts that science experts identified as being prerequisite to understanding the reading passage. Theoretically, this study emanates from schema theory. That is, readers' comprehension is believed to be affected by inadequate or inappropriate background knowledge. 140 eighth grade science students were administered a <b>32</b> <b>item</b> researcher-developed multiple choice test to assess prior knowledge of the topic, photosynthesis. Of these, 99 were identified as having low prior knowledge of the topic and were thus selected as subjects for the study. The quality of their prior knowledge was also assessed by this instrument; the distractors to many of the items were misconceptions about the topic. Procedures included the pretest, a videotaped priming activity, an intervening task, a 920 -word silent reading passage, and a posttest. The target priming activity and passage were about photosynthesis. A placebo priming activity and passage were about heredity. Subjects were randomly assigned into one of four treatment conditions: (1) target priming activity + target passage, (2) target priming activity + placebo passage, (3) placebo priming activity + target passage, or (4) placebo priming activity + placebo passage. The dependent variable was a <b>32</b> <b>item</b> multiple choice test (identical to the pretest) about photosynthesis. Three question types were included: (1) textually explicit, (2) textually implicit, and (3) scriptally implicit items. The data were analyzed using a hierarchical regression model.

Another descriptive analysis was performed on the questions containing misconception data. Results indicate that a lesson which teaches prerequisite concepts does not significantly affect the reading comprehension of students with low prior knowledge. Of the three question types, the priming activity had a significant effect on scriptally implicit questions. There was no effect due to priming activity on textually explicit or textually implicit questions. A problem with test items precluded any results about misconceptions...|$|E

Design: A propaganda index consisting of 32 items was developed drawing on related literature. Seventeen subjects who review manuscripts for possible publication were requested to read five recent published reports of randomized controlled trials concerning social anxiety and to identify indicators of propaganda (defined as encouraging beliefs and actions with the least thought possible).

The {{question is what}} is the minimal (i. e. the optimal) text size at which probabilities of linguistic phenomena become stable.

This study extended the Smith and Wolverton (2010) instrument by exploring whether or not variables such as gender or employment classification (i. e., an individual’s role within the institution) show significant differences in perception of leadership competencies. This study utilized principal component analysis to determine factors based on the individual competencies and multivariate analysis of variance to determine if differences arose between reported scores in gender and employment classification. Data showed that competencies did not fit into McDaniel’s theorized four components, but rather a five component model that included a heavy emphasis on institutional mission and culture.
