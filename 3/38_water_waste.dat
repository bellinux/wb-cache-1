40|$|Notwithstanding the {{benefits}} accruing from sachet water production and consumption, the indiscriminate and improper disposal {{of the waste}} poses huge environmental problems. The study therefore identified factors responsible for indiscriminate disposal of sachet <b>water</b> <b>wastes</b> in Anambra State, Nigeria. Structured questionnaire were used to collect data from a sample of 161 respondents. Percentage, mean score, factor analysis, Pearson’s correlation matrix of interrelation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were employed for data analysis. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} shows attitude/behaviour (0. 620) and people’s ignorance of the effects (- 0. 532) as psychological factors responsible for indiscriminate disposal of sachet <b>water</b> <b>waste</b> while affordability (0. 562) and lack of recycling plants (0. 610) were economic factors responsible for indiscriminate disposal of sachet <b>water</b> <b>waste.</b> Attitude and need (80. 10 %) and environmental control (13. 24 %) were the two underlying dimensions used in explaining these factors which are responsible for indiscriminate disposal of sachet <b>water</b> <b>waste.</b> For proper and adequate disposal of sachet <b>water</b> <b>wastes,</b> the study suggests public enlightenment campaigns aimed at helping people change their attitude about indiscriminate disposal of sachet <b>water</b> <b>waste...</b>|$|R

40|$|Untreated <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> is {{used for}} {{irrigation}} in over 80 % of all Pakistani communities {{with a population of}} over 10, 000 inhabitants. The absence of a suitable alternative <b>water</b> source, <b>waste</b> <b>water’s</b> high nutrient value, reliability, and its proximity to urban markets are the main reasons for its use. Two case studies in Pakistan studied the impact of untreated <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> use on health, environment, and income. The results showed a high increase in hookworm infections among <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> users and a clear over-application of nutrients through <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> Heavy metal accumulation in soilover a period of 30 years was minimal in Haroonabad, a small town with no industry,but showed initial signs of excess levels in soil and plant material in Faisalabad, a city with large-scale industry. The impact of <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> irrigation on household income was considerable as <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> farmers earned approximately US$ 300 /annum more than farmers using freshwater. Both case studies showed the importance of waste water-irrigation on local livelihoods. The lack of financial resources at municipal and provincial levels for <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> treatment calls for other measures to reduce the negative impact of untreated <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> use on health and environment, for example to manage groundwater, regular (canal) irrigation <b>water,</b> and <b>waste</b> <b>water</b> conjunctively,and regular deworming treatment of those exposed to <b>waste</b> <b>water.</b> ...|$|R

The concrete mix of M 20 grade with water cement ratio of 0. 5 were investigated. Water samples, such as tap <b>water,</b> <b>waste</b> <b>water,</b> well water, bore well water & mineral water (packed drinking water) were collected from various sources at college campus and were used to cast 150 mm concrete cubes. The cured cubes were crushed on 7 & 28 days for compressive strength estimation.
