This phenomenon spans many years and several exchange rates, and overrides calendar effects. We {{argue that it is}} mainly due to liquidity and inventory patterns that emerge from the combination of two factors: domestic agents tend to be net buyers of foreign currency and to trade mostly in their country's working hours. The prevalence of domestic (foreign) traders demanding the counterpart currency during domestic (foreign) working hours implies sell-price (buy-price) pressure on the domestic currency during domestic (foreign) working hours.

40|$|Renewable energy {{technologies}} (including solar) have enjoyed {{a period of}} rapid growth in recent years, largely due to government subsidies of various kinds. But renewable {{energy technologies}} cannot expect to replace fossil fuels {{on the back of}} the taxpayers or ratepayers; they will have to become price competitive. Most studies on the economics of renewable energy systems fail to consider one of the most powerful trends in their favor: the rising cost of fossil fuels. This study provides an economic analysis of residential solar systems (photovoltaic and water heating) in Michigan and Hawaii. It shows that residential grid-intertied PV systems are not currently economically attractive in Michigan under any likely assumptions, while higher utility rates and greater solar radiation in Hawaii make a PV system a reasonable investment on economics alone – without government subsidies. Solar water heating systems are very financially attractive in Hawaii and somewhat attractive in Michigan, depending on assumptions about the future rate of utility price escalations. In either location, without government assistance, solar water heaters are more financially attractive than PV systems. Finally, this study examines the effect of using the optional <b>time-of-day</b> <b>tariff</b> offered by one of the major utilities (DTE) and surprisingly finds that the TOD rate structure puts a lower value on the output of either system than the standard flat-rate tariff...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs {{renewable}} energy generating capacity increases on electricity grids, technology {{is needed to}} balance the supply and demand of energy. In order to manage the demand side of electricity, <b>time-of-day</b> (TOD) <b>tariffs</b> are a simple economic mechanism that encourages consumers to smooth the diurnal demand profile by shifting consumption to off-peak times. The management of supply by {{renewable energy}} generators can be achieved using energy storage. This study investigates the use of {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES) to de-couple a wind energy converter (WEC) from the electricity grid and manage its power output. Numerical and thermodynamic models simulate the operation of the system. One year of operation is simulated using 10 minute WEC time-step data for varying CAES capacities in order to optimize the economic performance of the total system. By selling electricity according to TOD tariff schedules, the income generated by a 0. 8 MW WEC using a 4 MWh CAES system is increased by 30 %. The CAES has a round-trip efficiency of 66 % and annually experiences 450 deep cycles as it stores 25 % of the energy generated by the WEC...|$|R

40|$|Background. Current {{data suggest}} {{systemic}} autoimmune activation in {{the pathogenesis of}} bronchopulmonary diseases. The imbalance in the system of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines {{is very important in}} immunopathogenesis. Objective. The aim of our research was to determine the caspase- <b>3</b> <b>rate</b> in the dynamics of experimental acute lung injury and to study the relationship between their level and the number of cells carrying membrane binding TNF receptor type 1 to define the main mechanisms of cell death. Results. The analysis of the results of caspase- <b>3</b> <b>rate</b> in lung homogenate showed that this cysteine proteinase was uniformly increasing in all experimental groups during simulating of ALI induced by administration of hydrochloric acid (p< 0. 001). When comparing the results of caspase course of apoptosis it was defined that, despite the progressive increase in caspase- <b>3</b> <b>rate</b> in lung homogenate, cysteine proteinase rate in plasma did not change. The receptor mechanism of apoptosis was studied by establishing correlation relationships with the number of cells carrying membrane binding TNF type 1 (TNF-R 1) receptor. A strong positive correlation relationship between the number of neutrophils with TNF-R 1 and caspase- <b>3</b> <b>rate</b> in lungs of all research groups was determined. Conclusions. The implementation of neutrophils death by apoptosis is caused by change of activity of caspase cascade effector components, such as caspase- 3, in cases of ALI induced by intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid. One of the potential mechanisms responsible for the activation of caspase course is excessive generation of active forms of oxygen and {{increase in the number of}} neutrophils carrying membrane binding TNF receptor type 1...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{chemical}} reaction mechanisms describing hydrocarbon combustion chemistry are conceptually structured in a hierarchical manner with H 2 and CO chemistry at the base, supplemented as needed by elementary reactions of larger chemical species. While this structure gives a logical organization to com-bustion chemistry, {{the degree to}} which this organization reflects actual reactive fluxes in flames is not known. Moreover, it has not been tested whether sets of rate parameters derived by optimizing fits to small-hydrocarbon combustion data are secure foundations upon which to optimize the rate parameters needed for modeling the combustion of larger hydrocarbons. In this work, a computer modeling study was undertaken to discover whether optimizing the rate parameters of a 258 -reaction C 3 combustion chemistry mechanism that was added to a previously optimized 205 -reaction C 3 mechanism would pro-vide satisfactory accounting for C 3 flame speed and ignition data. The optimization was done with 21 optimization targets, 9 of which were ignition delays and 12 of which were atmospheric pressure laminar flame speeds; 2 of the ignition delays and 2 of the flame speeds, all for methane fuel, had served as optimization targets for the C <b>3</b> <b>rate</b> parameters. It was found in sensitivity studies that the coupling between the C 3 and the C 3 chemistry was much stronger than anticipated. No set of C <b>3</b> <b>rate</b> parameters could account for the C 3 combustion data as long as the previously optimized (against C 3 optimization targets only) C <b>3</b> <b>rate</b> parameters remained fixed. A reasonable match to the C 3 targets could be obtained, without degrading the match between experiment and calculation for the C 3 optimization targets, by reoptimizing six of the previously optimized and three additional C <b>3</b> <b>rate</b> parameters...|$|R
