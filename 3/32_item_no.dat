40|$|Background: Item {{analysis}} {{is an effective}} method {{in the evaluation of}} multiple‑choice achievement tests. This study aimed to compare the classical and the latent class models used in item analysis, as well as their efficacy in the evaluation of the examinations of the medical faculty. Materials and Methods: The achievement tests in the medical faculty were evaluated using different methods. The two methods used were the classical and the latent class models. Among the classical methods, Cronbach’s alpha, split half methods, item discrimination, and item difficulty was investigated. On the other hand, various models of item response theory (IRT) and their statistics were compared in the group of latent class methods. Results: Reliability statistics had values above 0. 87. <b>Item</b> <b>no.</b> 7 was found easy, <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 45 difficult and <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 64 fairly difficult according to the evaluations done by classical and item response theories. In terms of <b>item</b> discrimination, <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 45 had lower, <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 7 had middle and <b>item</b> <b>no.</b> 64 had high discrimination levels. The distribution graph shows that personal abilities are good enough to tick the correct choice. Conclusion: In this study, similar results were obtained by classical and latent methods. IRT can be considered perfect at a mathematical level, and if its assumptions are satisfied, it can easily perform assessments and measurements for most types of complex problems. Classical theory is easy to understand and to apply, while IRT is, on the contrary, sometimes rather difficult to understand and to implement...|$|R

40|$|Background: Regional Cardiocerebrovascular Centers (RCC) were {{established}} for the prevention and treatment of cardiocerebrovas-cular disease and funded by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop and validate the measure-ment tool of public benefits in RCC. Methods: Through the intensive literature review, experts surveys and their repetitive feedback, we selected the 46 items about the public benefits in RCC. Development of measurement tool involved content validity test using Content Validity Index (CVI), construct validity test through factor analysis and reliability test. Results: Thirty-five items were selected by content validity test, which CVI was 0. 08 or higher. Through the construct validity test, <b>32</b> <b>items</b> in 7 factors were derived. And Cronbach’s alpha was 0. 951. Finally, public benefits measurement tool is composed of <b>32</b> <b>items</b> in 7 factors which are comprehensiveness of health care services, market complement, emergency care, cost, governance, quality improvement, and government control. Conclusion: Though we developed the measurement tool of public benefits in RCC, it would be utilized to measure the public ben...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{language}} corpus {{implies a}} text sample of size n that provides stable probability distributions of linguistic phenomena. The {{question is what}} is the minimal (i. e. the optimal) text size at which probabilities of linguistic phenomena become stable. Specifically, we were interested in probabilities of grammatical forms. We started with an a priori assumption that text size of 1. 000. 000 words is sufficient to provide stable probability distributions. Text of this size we treated as a "quasi-population". Probability distribution derived from the "quasi-population" was then correlated with probability distribution obtained on a minimal sample size (<b>32</b> <b>items)</b> for a given linguistic category (e. g. nouns). Correlation coefficient was treated as a measure of similarity between the two probability distributions. The minimal sample was increased by geometrical progression, up to the size where correlation between distribution derived from the quasi-population and the one derived from an increased sample reached its maximum (r= 1). Optimal sample size was established for grammatical forms of nouns, adjectives and verbs. General formalism is proposed that allows estimate of an optimal sample size from minimal sample (i. e. <b>32</b> <b>items)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} an index in increasing recognition of misleading problem framing in articles and manuscripts. Design: A propaganda index consisting of <b>32</b> <b>items</b> was developed drawing on related literature. Seventeen subjects who review manuscripts for possible publication were requested to read five recent published reports of randomized controlled trials concerning social anxiety and to identify indicators of propaganda (defined as encouraging beliefs and actions with the least thought possible). They then re-read the same five articles using a propaganda index to note instances of propaganda. Data source: Convenience sample of individuals who review manuscripts for possible publication and sample of recent published reports of randomized controlled trials regarding social anxiety in five different journals by different authors, blinded by author and journal. Results: Data showed {{that there was a}} high rate of propagandistic problem framing in reports of RCTs regarding social anxiety such as hiding well argued alternative views and vagueness. This occurred in 117 out of 160 opportunities over five research reports. A convenience sample of 17 academics spotted only 4. 5 percent of propaganda indicators. This increased to 64 percent with use of the <b>32</b> <b>item</b> propaganda index. Use of a propaganda index increased recognition of relate...|$|R
40|$|This {{researcher}} {{examined how}} participants 2 ̆ 7 attitudes towards homosexuality influenced {{their ability to}} reason on logic test items concerning homosexuality. A 64 -item logic test was developed to measure distortion in reasoning due to prohomosexual or antihomosexual beliefs (measured by <b>32</b> <b>items),</b> while controlling for distortions caused by the truth or falseness of conclusions on nonhomosexual matters (also measured by <b>32</b> <b>items).</b> McFarlands 2 ̆ 7 (2000) abbreviated version of the Attitudes Towards Homosexuality Scale (ATH Scale) was administered to directly measure participants 2 ̆ 7 attitudes. The logic test and ATH Scale was administered to 201 undergraduate psychology students. Data analyses showed {{a significant amount of}} distortion due to the truth-value of the conclusion. Correlations between scores on the logic test and the ATH Scale, after partialing out the effects of the truth-value of the conclusions, showed that on the logically valid items where accuracy was generally high, both antihomosexual and prohomosexual attitudes produced logical distortion in the direction of those attitudes. But on the invalid items, where logical error rates were much higher, only antihomosexual attitudes led to distortion. Overall, the findings provide more support for hypothesis that people with antihomosexual attitudes distort reasoning in keeping with their attitudes about these issues than do those with prohomosexual attitude...|$|R
