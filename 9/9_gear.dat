Three lost gears were recorded showing different levels of epibiosis thus supporting multi-annual exploitation of the bank. The red coral population of the Ragusa bank showed a typical â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 forest-likeâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 configuration with upright, medium-sized colonies {{similar to those of}} other commercially exploited deep Mediterranean banks. The direct negative effect of this trawling gear was evident from numerous rocky boulders completely enveloped by lost nets and occasionally turned over. Red coral fragments as well as fragments of â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 ingegnoâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 nets were observed in high abundance on the sea floor. This evidence suggests that this gear is highly destructive even on rough sea floors, contrary to the traditional view, which is that it has a more random impact on rough rocky bottoms.

The crankshaft was also altered, in order to accept a straight-cut gear which would drive the gear train instead of the chain system, used in the [...] "F" [...] model. Each head had 2 gears held by a carrier, which was then bolted into the respective head, driving {{each of the two}} camshafts arranged in a dual overhead camshaft arrangement for each head. Total, there were <b>9</b> <b>gears</b> required to transmit power from the crankshaft to all 4 camshafts. The camshafts were altered in relation to the ones found on the [...] "F" [...] model in order to provide more power. This arrangement added 7 pounds to the weight of the engine when compared to the chain driven arrangement present in the [...] "F" [...] model.|$|R

5000|$|From the 1980s to 2009, {{mountain}} bikes often had either 15, 18, 21, 24 or 27 speeds, with 3 gears {{in the front}} and anywhere from 5 to <b>9</b> <b>gears</b> at the rear wheel. Thirty-speed {{mountain bikes}} were found to be unworkable, as the mud-shedding capabilities of a ten-speed cassette, and the intricacies of a ten-speed rear dérailleur have never been suitable. However, many pro-level mountain bikers have taken to using a narrower 10-speed road chain with a 9-speed setup in an effort to reduce the weight of their bike. In early 2009, component group SRAM announced their release of their XX groupset, which uses a two-speed front dérailleur, and a ten-speed rear dérailleur and cassette, similar to that of a road bike. Mud-shedding capabilities of their ten-speed XX cassette are made suitable for MTB use by extensive CNC machining of the cassette. Due to the time and cost involved in such a product, they were only aimed at top-end XC-racers. However, 10-speed has become the norm by 2011 and the market leader Shimano even offers its budget groupset [...] "Alivio" [...] in a 10-speed version. In July 2012, SRAM announced a 1x11 drivetrain called XX1 that does not make use of a front dérailleur for lighter weight and simplicity.In the 2014 Commonwealth Games at Glasgow all leading riders used 1x11 drivetrains. SRAM's new 1x12 gearing was introduced in 2016 as SRAM Eagle. This gives a single chain ring bike better ability to ride climbs.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the provision of}} the data communication of the new protection relays via 6 kV switch gears to the electro monitoring system at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Station. These protection relays will replace the current analog protection. The replacement process will start in 2015 and will finish in 2018. Given the overall complexity of the project, this thesis deals only with the following 6 kV switch <b>gears</b> <b>9</b> BB and 9 BD. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part concerns the actual consumption and output of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Station. The following chapters describe the electro monitoring system and GRAF and LOGA software programs that are closely connected with it and {{that were used in}} the practical part. The last chapter of the theoretical part deals with the actual replacement of the protection relays of the 6 kV switch gears. Also, it describes a new optical network, which will be set up at the Dukovany Nuclear Power Station {{as a part of the}} process of replacement. The segment of the practical part concerns laboratory verification of the data communication of the new protection relays. Next, it describes actions that had to be taken in order to ensure and verify correct functionality of the data communication. This part is followed up by a closely related practical activity, which describes examination and verification of the protection functions of each of the 9 BB and <b>9</b> BD switch <b>gears</b> protection relays...|$|R

30|$|Before forging the gear, the {{oxidized}} {{layer and}} surface defects were removed using a hand sand wheel to effectively avoid the cracking phenomenon of forging residue. In the forging process, the procedures must be strictly followed; the forging temperature must be strictly controlled with the temperature difference not exceeding 300  °C. After forging, the forging part must be normalized under more than 950  °C and tempered less than 600  °C to eliminate forging stress and improve cutting performance.
