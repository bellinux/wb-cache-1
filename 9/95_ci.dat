However, there are few studies on the general population and these have very variable results. Methods: An observational, prospective and cross-sectional study was carried out on a sample of 1064 subjects in a total working population of 7887 subjects (Ford factory, Spain) in order to know the prevalence of HVA in this population {{and the influence of}} several risk factors in its development. Results: The rate of exposure to stings was 84. 1 % (<b>ci</b> <b>95</b> %: 81. 8 – 86. 3 %). The prevalence of HVA was 7. 6 % (<b>ci</b> <b>95</b> %: 6. 1 – 9. 4 %), with local severe reactions (LSR) in 5. 3 % (<b>ci</b> <b>95</b> %: 4 – 6. 8 %) and systemic reactions (SR) in 2. 3 % (<b>ci</b> <b>95</b> %: 1. 5 – 3. 4 %).

The {{quality of the}} reporting in these publications has not been assessed. Objectives In this study we sought to determine the proportion of treatment-related case reports that adequately reported information about the patient, disease, interventions, co-interventions, outcomes and other critical information. Methods We identified CRs published in 4 emergency medicine journals in 2000 – 2005 and categorized them according to their purpose (disease description, overdose or adverse drug reactioin, diagnostic test or treatment effect). Treatment-related CRs were reviewed for {{the presence or absence}} of 11 reporting elements. Results All told, 1, 316 CRs were identified; of these, 85 (6. 5 %; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 66, 84) were about medical or surgical treatments. Most contained adequate descriptions of the patient (99 %; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 95, 100), the stage and severity of the patient's disease (88 %; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 79, 93), the intervention (80 %; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 70, 87) and the outcomes of treatment (90 %; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 82, 95). Fewer CRs reported the patient's co-morbidities (45 %; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 35, 56), concurrent medications (30 %; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 21, 40) or co-interventions (57 %; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 46, 67) or mentioned any possible treatment side-effects (33 %; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 24, 44). Only 37 % (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 19, 38) discussed alternative explanations for favorable outcomes. Generalizability of treatment effects to other patients was mentioned in only 29 % (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> = 20, 39).

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} and correlates of physical disability and functional limitation among older {{people have been}} studied in many developed countries {{but not in a}} middle income country such as Malaysia. The present study investigated the epidemiology of physical disability and functional limitation among older people in Malaysia and compares findings to other countries. Methods: A population-based cross sectional study was conducted in Alor Gajah, Malacca. Seven hundred and sixty five older people aged 60 years and above underwent tests of functional limitation (Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment Tool). Data were also collected for self reported activities of daily living (ADL) using the Barthel Index (ten items). To compare prevalence with other studies, ADL disability was also defined using six basic ADL's (eating, bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting and walking) and five basic ADL's (eating, bathing, dressing, transferring and toileting). Results: Ten, six and five basic ADL disability was reported by 24. 7 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 21. 6 - 27. 9), 14. 4 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 11. 9 - 17. 2) and 10. 6 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 8. 5 - 13. 1), respectively. Functional limitation was found in 19. 5 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 16. 8 - 22. 5) of participants. Variables independently associated with 10 item ADL disability physical disability, were advanced age (>= 75 years: prevalence ratio (PR) 7. 9; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 4. 8 - 12. 9), presence of diabetes (PR 1. 8; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 4 - 2. 3), stroke (PR 1. 5; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 1 - 2. 2), depressive symptomology (PR 1. 3; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 1 - 1. 8) and visual impairment (blind: PR 2. 0; <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 1 - 3. 6).

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that wound {{infection}} (surgical site infection [ssi]) rates fall when surgeons are provided with data on their performance. Since 1987, the authors have been performing concurrent surveillance of surgical patients and confidentially reporting surgeon-specific ssi rates to individual surgeons and their clinical directors, and providing surgeons with the mean rates of their peers. The program has been gradually refined and expanded. Data are now collected on wound infection risk and report risk adjusted rates compared with the mean for hospitals in the United States National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (nnis) data bank. Since inception through to December 1993, ssi rates have fallen 68 % in clean contaminated general surgery cases (relative risk [rr] 0. 36, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 0. 2 to 0. 6, P= 0. 0001), 64 % in clean plastic surgery cases (rr 0. 35, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 0. 06 to 1. 8), 72 % in caesarean section cases (rr 0. 23, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 0. 03 to 1. 96) and 42 % in clean cardiovascular surgery cases (rr 0. 59, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 0. 34 to 1. 0).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Healthy {{lifestyle}} including sufficient {{physical activity}} may mitigate or prevent adverse {{long-term effects of}} childhood cancer. We described daily physical activities and sports in childhood cancer survivors and controls, and assessed determinants of both activity patterns. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a questionnaire survey including all children diagnosed with cancer 1976 - 2003 at age 0 - 15 years, registered in the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, who survived ≥ 5 years and reached adulthood (≥ 20 years). Controls came from the population-based Swiss Health Survey. We compared the two populations and determined risk factors for both outcomes in separate multivariable logistic regression models. The sample included 1058 survivors and 5593 controls (response rates 78 % and 66 %). Sufficient daily physical activities were reported by 52 % (n =  521) of survivors and 37 % (n =  2069) of controls (p< 0. 001). In contrast, 62 % (n =  640) of survivors and 65 % (n =  3635) of controls reported engaging in sports (p =  0. 067). Risk factors for insufficient daily activities in both populations were: older age (OR for ≥ 35 years: 1. 5, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 2 - 2. 0), female gender (OR 1. 6, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 3 - 1. 9), French/Italian Speaking (OR 1. 4, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 1 - 1. 7), and higher education (OR for university education: 2. 0, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 5 - 2. 6). Risk factors for no sports were: being a survivor (OR 1. 3, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 1 - 1. 6), older age (OR for ≥ 35 years: 1. 4, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 1 - 1. 8), migration background (OR 1. 5, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 3 - 1. 8), French/Italian speaking (OR 1. 4, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 2 - 1. 7), lower education (OR for compulsory schooling only: 1. 6, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 2 - 2. 2), being married (OR 1. 7, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 5 - 2. 0), having children (OR 1. 3, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 4 - 1. 9), obesity (OR 2. 4, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 7 - 3. 3), and smoking (OR 1. 7, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 5 - 2. 1).

40|$|We report double-spike {{molybdenum}} (Mo) isotope {{data for}} forty-two mafic and fifteen ultramafic rocks from diverse locations and compare these with results for five chondrites. The d 98 / 95 Mo values (normalized to NIST SRM 3134) range from - 0. 59 ± 0. 04 to + 0. 10 ± 0. 08 ‰. The compositions of one carbonaceous (CI) and four ordinary chondrites are relatively uniform (- 0. 14 ± 0. 01 ‰, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> (confidence interval)) in excellent agreement with previous data. These values are just resolvable from {{the mean of}} 10 mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) (0. 00 ± 0. 02 ‰, <b>95</b> % <b>ci).</b> The compositions of 13 mantle-derived ultramafic xenoliths from Kilbourne Hole, Tariat and Vitim are more diverse (- 0. 39 to - 0. 07 ‰) {{with a mean of}} - 0. 22 ± 0. 06 ‰ (<b>95</b> % <b>ci).</b> On this basis, the isotopic composition of the bulk silicate Earth (BSE or Primitive Mantle) is within error identical to chondrites. The mean Mo concentration of the ultramafic xenoliths (0. 19 ± 0. 07 ppm, <b>95</b> % <b>ci)</b> is similar in magnitude to that of MORB (0. 48 ± 0. 13 ppm, <b>95</b> % <b>ci)</b> and MORB (0. 48 ± 0. 13 ppm, <b>95</b> % <b>ci),</b> providing evidence, either for a more compatible behaviour than previously thought or for selective Mo enrichment of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle. Intraplate and ocean island basalts (OIBs) display significant isotopic variability within a single locality from MORB-like to strongly negative (- 0. 59 ± 0. 04 ‰). The most extreme values measured are for nephelinites from the Cameroon Line and Trinidade, which also have anomalously high Ce/Pb and low Mo/Ce relative to normal oceanic basalts. d 98 / 95 Mo correlates negatively with Ce/Pb and U/Pb, and positively with Mo/Ce, explicable if a phase such as an oxide or a sulphide liquid selectively retains isotopically heavy Mo in the mantle and fractionates its isotopic composition in low degree partial melts. If residual phases retain Mo during partial melting, {{it is possible that the}} [Mo] for the BSE may be misrepresented by values estimated from basalts. This would be consistent with the high Mo concentrations of all the ultramafic xenoliths of 40 to 400 ppb, similar to or, significantly higher than, current estimates for the BSE (39 ppb). On this basis a revised best estimate of the Mo content in the BSE based on these concentrations would be in the range 113 to 180 ppb, significantly higher than previously assumed. These values are similar to the levels of depletion in the other refractory moderately siderophile elements W, Ni and Co. A simpler explanation may be that the subcontinental lithospheric mantle has been selectively enriched in Mo leading to the higher concentrations observed. Cryptic melt metasomatism would be difficult to reconcile with the high Mo/Ce of the most LREE depleted xenoliths. Ancient Mo-enriched subducted components would be expected to have heavy d 98 / 95 Mo, which is not observed. The Mo isotope composition of the BSE, cannot be reliably resolved from that of chondrites at this time despite experimental evidence for metal-silicate fractionation. An identical isotopic composition might result from core-mantle differentiation under very high temperatures such as were associated with the Moon-forming Giant Impact, or from the BSE inventory reflecting addition of moderately siderophile elements from an oxidized Moon-forming impactor (O'Neill, 1991). However, the latter would be inconsistent with the nonchondritic radiogenic W isotopic composition of the BSE. Based on mantle fertility arguments, Mo in the BSE could even be lighter (lower 98 / 95 Mo) than that in chondrites, which might be explained by loss of S rich liquids from the BSE during core formation (Wade et al., 2012). Such a late removal model is no longer required to explain the Mo concentration of the BSE if its abundance is in fact much higher, and similar to the values for ultramafic xenoliths...|$|R
40|$|Background. Nocturnal oxyhaemoglobin {{desaturation}} (NOD, mean saturation < 96 % on overnight pulse oximetry) {{appears to}} be a predictor of central nervous system events and frequent pain in children with sickle cell disease (SCD). The risk factors are poorly understood. Aims. To undertake a secondary analysis of potential risk factors (age, genotype, haematocrit previous chest crisis, comorbid asthma or central nervous system disease and upper airway infection) for NOD in the East London cohort. Method. Of an unselected hospital cohort of children, 69 (median age 7. 8 (range 1 - 16. 5) years; 39 male) had overnight pulse oximetry at home between 1990 and 1995. Those over the age of 6 and any with CNS events were invited to have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and angiography (MRA). Clinical details, including emergency department attendances and hospital admissions, were obtained from the hospitalnotes for the period preceding the overnight study. A sleep questionnaire was administered to a subset. Logistic regression was used to look at predictors of NOD. Results. For mean overnight saturation (SpO 2), the range was 84 - 99. 7 % (median 96. 1 %) and values were significantly lower in patients with HbSS (median 95. 4, range 84 - 99. 7 %) than in those with HbSC (median 97. 9, range 94. 8 - 98. 9 %) or Sb thalassaemia (median 97. 8, range 93. 5 - 99. 5 %). 25 children (36 %) had mean saturation < 96 %. 13 had dips in saturation suggesting OSA, of whom 10 also had mean saturation < 96 %. 36 completed the sleep questionnaire, of whom 30 snored (14 sometimes, 3 often, 13 always); {{there was no evidence that}} NOD was associated with concurrent snoring (Fisher’s exact test, p= 0. 8). Of 11 children with abnormal overnight studies who had repeat overnight pulse oximetry after adenotonsillectomy, 8 were still abnormal. In univariate logistic regression, genotype (OR 9. 00, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 1. 08, 74. 7; p= 0. 04), haemogloin at the time of the study (odd ratio, OR 0. 64 95 % confidence intervals, ci 0. 47, 0. 87; p= 0. 005), greater age at first Casualty attendance for an upper airways infection (p= 0. 02) and abnormal MRA (OR 4. 5, 95 %ci 1. 24, 16. 3; p= 0. 02) were associated with OD and there were trends for white cell count at the time of the study (OR 1. 10, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 1. 00, 1. 21; p= 0. 06) and infarction on MRI (OR 3. 14, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 0. 67, 14. 6; p= 0. 15). There was no effect of age at sleep study, haemoglobin F, doctor-diagnosed asthma, number of admissions with chest infection or any other measure of complication rate. Both haemoglobin at the time of the study (OR 0. 68, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 0. 48, 0. 95; p= 0. 02) and age at first upper airway infection (OR 1. 44, <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 1. 04, 1. 99; p= 0. 02) remained in the multiple logistic regression model. Summary and Conclusions. Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation is common in patients with HbSS, but is difficult to predict clinically and may not improve with adenotonsillectomy. Prospective studies of aetiology should commence in infancy and ideally include serial measurements of cerebral as well as lung function. If NOD is confirmed as a predictor of complications in SCD, treatment options might include hydroxyurea or overnight continuous positive airways pressure...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} intraoperative {{complications of}} cataract surgery {{over the period}} 2006 to 2010. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 106 of 272 cataract surgical centers in Iran were selected through multistage random cluster sampling from all provinces. In each province, the selected number of centers was proportionate {{to the number of}} cataract surgeries, and in each center, the selected number of charts was proportionate to the centers number of cataract surgeries, from which we retrieved intraoperative complications. Results: The prevalence of intraoperative complications of cataract surgery was 5. 04 (95 confidence interval, CI, 3. 53 - 6. 54) in 2006, which decreased significantly to 3. 44 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 84 - 5. 04) in 2010. The most common complication was posterior capsular rupture/vitreous loss which decreased from 4. 29 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 2. 93 - 5. 66) in 2006 to 2. 81 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 3 - 4. 31) in 2010. The next most common complication was suprachoroidal hemorrhage at 0. 56 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0. 25 - 0. 87) in 2006 and 0. 46 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0. 3 - 0. 62) in 2010. The least common complication concerned intraocular lens (IOL) -drop. Complications were seen most with lensectomy, while phacoemulsification caused the least complications. Mean hospitalization time in uncomplicated cases was 0. 59 days (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0. 58 - 0. 61 days) and in complicated cases 1. 14 days (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 1. 07 - 1. 20 days; p < 0. 001). Conclusion: Complications of cataract surgery in Iran had a decreasing trend during 2006 - 2010. However, results from 2010 indicate that cataract surgical complications still need to be focused on. Hospitalization was longer for cases with complications, and further reducing this could help decrease costs of cataract surgery. Â© 2016 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{relative}} {{safety of}} drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents, especially {{with respect to}} stent thrombosis, continues to be debated. In view of the overall low frequency of stent thrombosis, large sample sizes are needed to accurately estimate treatment differences between stents. We compared the risk of thrombosis between bare-metal and drug-eluting stents. Methods: For this network meta-analysis, randomised controlled trials comparing different drug-eluting stents or drug-eluting with bare-metal stents currently approved in the USA were identified through Medline, Embase, Cochrane databases, and proceedings of international meetings. Information about study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample characteristics, and clinical outcomes was extracted. Findings: 49 trials including 50 844 patients randomly assigned to treatment groups were analysed. 1 -year definite stent thrombosis was significantly lower with cobalt-chromium everolimus eluting stents (CoCr-EES) than with bare-metal stents (odds ratio [OR] 0 · 23, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0 · 13 - 0 · 41). The significant difference in stent thrombosis between CoCr-EES and bare-metal stents was evident as early as 30 days (OR 0 · 21, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0 · 11 - 0 · 42) and was also significant between 31 days and 1 year (OR 0 · 27, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0 · 08 - 0 · 74). CoCr-EES were also associated with significantly lower rates of 1 -year definite stent thrombosis compared with paclitaxel-eluting stents (OR 0 · 28, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0 · 16 - 0 · 48), permanent polymer-based sirolimus-eluting stents (OR 0 · 41, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0 · 24 - 0 · 70), phosphorylcholine-based zotarolimus-eluting stents (OR 0 · 21, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0 · 10 - 0 · 44), and Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents (OR 0 · 14, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0 · 03 - 0 · 47). At 2 -year follow-up, CoCr-EES were still associated with significantly lower rates of definite stent thrombosis than were bare-metal (OR 0 · 35, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0 · 17 - 0 · 69) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (OR 0 · 34, <b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 0 · 19 - 0 · 62). No other drug-eluting stent had lower definite thrombosis rates compared with bare-metal stents at 2 -year follow-up. Interpretation: In randomised studies completed to date, CoCr-EES has the lowest rate of stent thrombosis within 2 years of implantation. The finding that CoCr-EES also reduced stent thrombosis compared with bare-metal stents, if confirmed in future randomised trials, represents a paradigm shift.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several {{cross-sectional}} {{studies on}} populations with iodine deficiency showed that TSH-levels are {{negatively associated with}} age, while in populations with high iodine intake TSH is positively associated with age. The question is whether such an age-thyroid function relation is an ongoing process apparent also in longitudinal studies and whether it reflects an actual iodine deficiency or an iodine insufficiency in the past. METHODS: In an area with a borderline iodine status in the past, we studied 980 participants of the Nijmegen Biomedical Study. We measured serum TSH, free thyroxine (FT(4)), total triiodothyronine (T(3)), peroxidase antibodies, and the urine iodine and creatinine concentration 4 years after our initial survey of thyroid function, in which we reported a negative association between TSH and age. RESULTS: within 4 years, TSH decreased by 5. 4 % (<b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 2. 58. 3 %) and FT(4) increased by 3. 7 % (<b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 2. 94. 6 %). median urinary iodine concentration was 130 mug/l. estimated 24 -h iodine excretion {{was not associated with}} TSH, T(3), change of TSH, or FT(4) over time or with the presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase. Only FT(4) appeared to be somewhat higher at lower urine iodine levels: a 1. 01 % (95 % CI 0. 17 - 1. 84 %) higher FT(4) for each lower iodine quintile. CONCLUSIONS: In this longitudinal study, we found an ongoing decrease in TSH and increase in FT(4) in a previously iodine insufficient population, despite the adequate iodine status at present. This suggests that low iodine intake at young age leads to thyroid autonomy (and a tendency to hyperthyroidism) that persists despite normal iodine intake later in life...|$|R
40|$|Medication {{screening}} using Beers and stopp/start {{criteria for}} elderly patients: association between potentially inappropriate medication and medication-related hospital admissions OBJECTIVE To {{assess the risk}} of medication-related hospital admissions associated with inappropriate medication use applying the Beers and the stopp/start criteria. There are multiple screening methods to detect and reduce potentially inappropriate medication (pim) and prescribing omissions (ppos). Whether this will result in less medication-related hospitalisations is unknown. DESIGN A nested case-control {{study was conducted with}} a subset of patients of the Hospital Admissions Related to Medication (harm) study. METHODS Cases were defined as patients ≥ 65 years with a potentially preventable medication-related hospital admission. For each case one control was selected, matched on age and sex. The primary determinant was defined as the presence of one or more pims and/or ppos according to the Beers 2012 and the stopp/start criteria. The strength of the association between a pim/ppo and a medication-related hospital admission was evaluated with multivariate logistic regression and expressed as odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals (<b>ci</b> <b>95).</b> RESULTS pims and ppos detected with the stopp/start criteria are associated with medication-related hospital admissions (or 3. 47; <b>ci</b> <b>95</b> 1. 70 - 7. 09), while for the presence of pims according to the Beers 2012 criteria a non-significant trend was visible (oradj 1. 49; <b>ci</b> <b>95</b> 0. 90 - 2. 47). CONCLUSION Both the stopp/start criteria and the Beers 2012 criteria can be used to identify older people at risk for medication-related problems. The choice which set of criteria should be used is more dependent on other factors (e. g. national guidelines, practical considerations) than on the association of each set with adr-related hospital admission...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} trial, we {{compared}} the broncholytic efficacy of the combination therapy with 50 μg salmeterol + 250 μg fluticasone and 12 μg formoterol + 400 μg budesonide, both in a single inhaler device, in 16 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. The study was performed using a single-blind crossover randomized study. Lung function, pulse oximetry (S pO 2) and heart rate were monitored before and 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360, 480, 600, and 720 min after bronchodilator inhalation. Both combinations were effective in reducing airflow obstruction. FEV 1 AUC 0 – 12 H was 2. 83 l (95 % ci: 2. 13 – 3. 54) after salmeterol/fluticasone and 2. 57 l (95 % ci: 1. 97 – 3. 2) after formoterol/budesonide. Formoterol/budesonide elicited the mean maximum improvement in FEV 1 above baseline after 120 min (0. 29 l; 95 % ci: 0. 21 – 0. 37) and salmeterol/fluticasone after 300 min (0. 32 l; 95 % ci: 0. 23 – 0. 41). At 720 min, the increase in FEV 1 over baseline values was 0. 10 l (95 % ci: 0. 07 – 0. 12) after salmeterol/fluticasone and 0. 10 l (95 % ci: 0. 07 – 0. 13) after formoterol/budesonide. The mean peak increase in heart rate occurred 300 min after formoterol/budesonide (1. 5 b/min; <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> — 2. 3 to 5. 3) and 360 min after salmeterol/fluticasone (2. 6 b/min; <b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> — 1. 9 to 7. 0). S p 02 did not change. All differences between salmeterol/fluticasone and formoterol/budesonide were not significant (P> 0. 05) except those in FEV 1 at 120 and 360 min. The results indicate that an inhaled combination therapy with a long-acting β 2 -agonist and an inhaled corticosteroid appears {{to be effective in}} improving airway limitation after acute administration in patients suffering from COPD...|$|R
40|$|Background. It {{remains unknown}} whether a {{composite}} of inflammation and calcification markers provides better mortality and cardiovascular risk stratification in chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Methods. We performed a 4 -year prospective follow-up study in 231 chronic PD patients from a single regional dialysis centre in Hong Kong. Valvular calcification was detected using echocardiography, and fasting venous blood was collected to measure a panel of inflammation markers. The patients were stratified into five groups {{on the basis of}} 0, 1, 2, 3 and all 4 inflammation and calcification risk markers, namely high C-reactive protein (CRP) (CRP in upper tertile), high interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) (IL- 6 in upper tertile), low fetuin-A (fetuin-A in lower tertile) and valvular calcification. Study outcomes included all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events (CVEs). Results. The patients with 4, 3, 2 and 1 markers had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 5. 17 (<b>95</b> <b>CI,</b> 1. 81 - 14. 77, P = 0. 002), 3. 38 (<b>95</b> <b>CI,</b> 1. 50 - 7. 60; P = 0. 003), 2. 17 (<b>95</b> <b>CI,</b> 0. 98 - 4. 77; P = 0. 056) and 2. 42 (<b>95</b> <b>CI,</b> 1. 18 - 4. 96; P = 0. 016), respectively, for mortality at 4 years than those with 0 risk marker. The adjusted HRs for fatal or non-fatal CVEs were 4. 33 (<b>95</b> <b>CI,</b> 1. 70 - 11. 03; P = 0. 002), 1. 60 (<b>95</b> <b>CI,</b> 0. 73 - 3. 52; P = 0. 24), 1. 92 (<b>95</b> <b>CI,</b> 0. 95 - 3. 90; P = 0. 07) and 1. 33 (<b>95</b> <b>CI,</b> 0. 67 - 2. 62; P = 0. 42), respectively, for patients with 4, 3, 2 and 1 markers than those with 0 risk markers. Conclusions. A composite of inflammation and calcification markers provides long-term prognostication and identifies the sickest PD patients with the worst clinical outcomes. Since these parameters can all be obtained quite readily, our data support the adoption of a multiinflammation and calcification risk marker approach for mortality and cardiovascular risk stratification in PD patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: Although QT {{prolongation}} {{is associated}} with increased risk of torsade de pointes (TdP), the precise relationship is not well defined. Aim: To evaluate {{the performance of a}} QT nomogram in assessing the risk of TdP from QTRR combinations. Design: Systematic review. Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE/EMBASE for cases of drug-induced TdP. Controls were patients taking non-cardiotoxic drugs in overdose. Inclusion criteria were definite TdP, normal ECG before or after the event, association with a drug/toxin and QTRR measurements available. The upper bound of a QTRR cloud diagram developed from human preclinical studies was converted into a QT nomogram [QT vs. heart rate (HR) ]. QTHR combinations for TdP cases and controls were plotted with the QT nomogram, and curves corresponding to a QTc 440 ms and QTc 500 ms for comparison (Bazetts correction). Results: We identified 129 cases of TdP. TdP cases occurred at lower HR values with longer QT intervals, with most cases occurring at HR 3090 bpm. Controls were more evenly distributed, with HR 40160 bpm. The sensitivity and specificity of the QT nomogram were 96. 9 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 93. 999. 9) and 98. 7 (<b>95</b> <b>CI</b> 96. 8100), respectively.

Method: A population-based, cross-sectional study was performed {{with a sample of}} 1, 217 adults aged between 20 and 59 years, in the city of Viçosa, in 2014. The sampling process was performed by conglomerates and sample was selected using a two-stage cluster-sampling scheme. First, 30 of the 99 census tracts of Viçosa were randomly selected using a random sampling scheme, without replacement. Household questionnaires were applied to obtain CJS data, sociodemographic conditions, behavioral factors and health status.

40|$|Although several {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) {{have examined the}} effect of misoprostol prior to hysteroscopy for cervical dilatation, no solid conclusion has been reached. We therefore set out to perform a meta-analysis of RCTs. We searched MEDLINE, the ISI Web of Science and the Cochrane Library to identify RCTs comparing misoprostol versus placebo or control prior to hysteroscopy. No restrictions on language or time were applied. Relative risks (RRs) and 95 confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for all dichotomous outcomes, whereas mean differences (MDs) and 95 CIs were calculated for continuous outcomes using the MantelHaenszel or DerSimonianLaird model according to the heterogeneity. Of the initial 141 potentially relevant articles that were retrieved, 21 RCTs involving 1786 patients {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to menopausal status and according to whether diagnostic or operative hysteroscopy was performed. Premenopausal women treated with misoprostol had a significantly lower risk for further cervical dilatation in the diagnostic setting [RR (<b>95</b> <b>CI)</b> : 0. 56 (0. 340. 92) ] and a significantly lower risk for cervical laceration in the operative setting [RR (<b>95</b> <b>CI)</b> : 0. 22 (0. 090. 54) ], compared with placebo. In contrast, post-menopausal patients did not experience any clear benefit from misoprostol compared with placebo regarding the need for further cervical dilatation [RR (<b>95</b> <b>CI)</b> : 0. 99 (0. 761. 30) ] and the cervical laceration rate [RR (<b>95</b> <b>CI)</b> : 1. 15 (0. 403. 29) ]. In addition, the mean cervical width prior to hysteroscopy was significantly higher in premenopausal women treated with misoprostol compared with placebo [MD (<b>95</b> <b>CI)</b> : 2. 47 mm (1. 813. 13) ] but did not differ among post-menopausal patients [MD (<b>95</b> <b>CI)</b> : 0. 39 mm (0. 42 to 1. 21) ].

40|$|Abstract Background Collecting {{population}} data on {{sensitive issues}} such as non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is problematic. Case note audits or hospital/clinic based presentations only record severe cases and do not distinguish between suicidal and non-suicidal intent. Community surveys have largely been limited to school and university students, resulting in little much needed population-based data on NSSI. Collecting these data via a large scale population survey presents challenges to survey methodologists. This paper addresses the methodological issues associated with collecting this type of data via CATI. Methods An Australia-wide population survey {{was funded by the}} Australian Government to determine prevalence estimates of NSSI and associations, predictors, relationships to suicide attempts and suicide ideation, and outcomes. Computer assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) on a random sample of the Australian population aged 10 + years of age from randomly selected households, was undertaken. Results Overall, from 31, 216 eligible households, 12, 006 interviews were undertaken (response rate 38. 5 %). The 4 -week prevalence of NSSI was 1. 1 % (<b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 0. 9 - 1. 3 %) and lifetime prevalence was 8. 1 % (<b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> 7. 6 - 8. 6). Methodological concerns and challenges in regard to collection of these data included extensive interviewer training and post interview counselling. Ethical considerations, especially with children as young as 10 years of age being asked sensitive questions, were addressed prior to data collection. The solution required a large amount of information to be sent to each selected household prior to the telephone interview which contributed to a lower than expected response rate. Non-coverage error caused by the population of interest being highly mobile, homeless or institutionalised was also a suspected issue in this low prevalence condition. In many circumstances the numbers missing from the sampling frame are small enough to not cause worry, especially when compared with the population as a whole, but within the population of interest to us, we believe that the most likely direction of bias is towards an underestimation of our prevalence estimates. Conclusion Collecting valid and reliable data is a paramount concern of health researchers and survey research methodologists. The challenge is to design cost-effective studies especially those associated with low-prevalence issues, and to balance time and convenience against validity, reliability, sampling, coverage, non-response and measurement error issues. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{data from}} 12 {{randomized}} controlled trials (over 4 thousand {{of children with}} known anthropometric data), investigating efficacy of supplement of vitamins and minerals in complex drug to the increase of height and weight in children were included. Proved that routine prescription of micronutrients is accompanied by increase of children's height — standardized mean difference (smd) was 0, 28 (<b>95</b> % <b>ci</b> — 0, 09; 0, 47) (р = 0, 003). Maximal efficacy of micronutrients supply was registered in subgroup of stunted children with heightbage zbscores (haz) < b 2, 0 — SMD 0, 58 (0, 33; 0, 84) (p < 0, 001) and in children over 5 years — SMD 0, 42 (0, 07; 0, 78) (р = 0, 02). micronutrients don't affect body weight, HAZ, WAZ (weightbage zbscores) and WHZ (weight height zbscores). The results of trials were heterogeneous. The reasons of heterogeneity were a difference in age of children, growth and body weight dynamics, and duration of trial. This metabanalysis indicates that routine micronutrients supply doesn't affect children's body weight, but favors to increase of their growth compared to placebo. Micronutrients show maximal activity in stunted children. Key words: children, micronutrients, height, weight, meta analysis. </strong...|$|R
