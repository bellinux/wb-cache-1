The Zoom Plate is a disposable self-standing device, without any external vacuum or set up apparatus, which allows dot blots {{to be performed}} much easier and faster. The user never needs to handle a piece of membrane as in older methods.

50|$|The {{stationary}} phase {{comes in the}} form of a packed syringe-shaped cartridge, a <b>96</b> <b>well</b> <b>plate,</b> a 47- or 90-mm flat disk, or a microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) device, a SPE method that uses a packed sorbent material in a liquid handling syringe. These can be mounted on its specific type of extraction manifold. The manifold allows multiple samples to be processed by holding several SPE media in place and allowing for an equal number of samples to pass through them simultaneously. A typical cartridge SPE manifold can accommodate up to 24 cartridges, while a typical disk SPE manifold can accommodate 6 disks. Most SPE manifolds are equipped with a vacuum port. Application of vacuum speeds up the extraction process by pulling the liquid sample through the {{stationary phase}}. The analytes are collected in sample tubes inside or below the manifold after they pass through the stationary phase.|$|E

30|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} M- 1 and M- 2 {{were determined by}} two methods namely microdilution method and plate count method. For microdilution method, 90  µl of BHI broth with 2 % sucrose was added to each well in a <b>96</b> <b>well</b> <b>plate.</b> M- 1, M- 2, and clove oil were added to final concentrations of 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.6 and 0  µg/ml.

40|$|Spheroid based {{cellular}} {{screening approaches}} represent a highly physiologic experimental setup to identify potential novel chemical compounds in cancer research. Increasing numbers of chemical compound libraries are available, which offer straightforward development of preclinical drug screening assays for academic research. Cellular screening experiments are often performed in <b>96</b> <b>well</b> <b>plates</b> {{in a small}} culture volume for elongated time periods; therefore, growth medium volume decrease due to evaporation poses a problem. We show here that uneven loss of growth medium depending on the microwell position on the plate (edge and corner versus central positions) led to significantly different readouts in a cell metabolism assay (alamarBlue®) as indicator for cellular health and proliferation. These effects are due to both an increase in dye concentration and reduced cellular metabolic activity owing to the decrease in culture volume. The incubation of the <b>96</b> <b>well</b> <b>plates</b> in cheap, custom-made humidity chambers almost abolished the loss of liquid and restored equal growth medium volumes in all wells after prolonged culture. This led to evenly distributed alamarBlue ® fluorescence intensity values on the multiwall-plate and warrants proper identification of effective compounds in screening assays...|$|R

By optimization of a stage oscillation process, the undesirable effects of a locally high concentrated drug elution within a <b>well</b> <b>plate</b> can be alleviated. This requires quantitative measurement of the mixing associated with “jitter” from the Beta 2 tool for both <b>96</b> and 384 <b>well</b> <b>plates.</b> This project began by researching theoretical underpinnings of mixing within the <b>well</b> <b>plates</b> and calculating dimensionless parameters associated with mixing from jitter and well size.
