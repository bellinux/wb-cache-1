25|$|As {{early as}} 1972 Genie scored between the level an 8-year-old and an adult on all right-hemisphere tasks the {{scientists}} tested her on, and showed extraordinarily rapid improvement on them. Her ability {{to piece together}} objects solely from tactile information was exceptionally good, and on spatial awareness tests her scores were reportedly the highest ever recorded. Similarly, on a Mooney Face Test in May 1975 she had {{the highest score in}} medical literature at that time, and on a separate gestalt perception test her extrapolated score was in the <b>95th</b> <b>percentile</b> for adults. On several other tests involving right-hemisphere tasks, her results were markedly better than other people in equivalent phases of mental development; in 1977 the scientists measured her capacity for stereognosis at approximately the level of a typical 10-year-old, significantly higher than her estimated mental age. The scientists also noted in 1974 that Genie seemed to be able to recognize the location she was in and was good at getting from one place to another, an ability which primarily involves the right hemisphere.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, the Department of Energy's {{public affairs}} group {{published}} a pamphlet {{stating that the}} inhalation of sediments that become resuspended in the air is considered the most significant pathway that could expose human beings to plutonium from the contaminated local reservoirs, but also stated that the airborne plutonium concentrations as measured by downwind air monitors remained below the DOE standard. In a 1999 analysis, {{it was found that}} [...] "the major event contributing the highest individual risk from plutonium released from Rocky Flats was the 1957 fire," [...] with wind distribution of plutonium from the 903 Pad Storage Area being the next greatest source of health risk. In this analysis, health risk estimates for off-site humans had a variance of four orders of magnitude, from [...] "between 2.0 × 10−4 (<b>95th</b> <b>percentile)</b> and 2.2 × 10−8 (5th percentile), with a median risk estimate of 2.3 × 10−6."

50|$|It {{is normal}} {{to apply a}} partial safety factor to the loads and to the {{material}} strengths, to design using <b>95th</b> <b>percentiles</b> (two standard deviations from the mean).

50|$|As {{a result}} of ERTA and other tax acts in the 1980s, the top 10% were paying 57.2% of total income taxes by 1988, up from 48% in 1981, the bottom 50% of earners share {{dropping}} from 7.5% to 5.7% in the same period. The total share borne by middle income earners of the 50th to <b>95th</b> <b>percentiles</b> decreased from 57.5% to the 48.7% between 1981 and 1988. Much of the increase {{can be attributed to}} the decrease in capital gains taxes, and the ongoing recession and subsequently high unemployment contributed to stagnation among other income groups until the mid-1980s. Another explanation is any such across the board tax cut removes some from the tax rolls. Those who remain pay a higher percentage of a now smaller tax pie even though they pay less in absolute taxes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{indices are}} {{expressed}} via a fixed threshold {{and others are}} based on percentiles. Fixed threshold indices describe a particular criteria such {{as the number of}} frost days that the minimum temperature is below 0 °C, or as another example, the number of heavy precipitation days that the precipitation sum exceeds 10 mm. Percentile indices describe the case in which a value of a variable falls above a certain percentage, such as the number of days that the precipitation sum exceeds the 75th, <b>95th</b> or 99th <b>percentile.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{information}} {{gleaned from}} cadaver research and animal studies {{had already been}} put to some use {{in the construction of}} human simulacra as early as 1949, when [...] "Sierra Sam" [...] was created by Samuel W. Alderson at his Alderson Research Labs (ARL) and Sierra Engineering Co. to test aircraft ejection seats, aviation helmets and pilot restraint harnesses. This testing involved the use of high acceleration to 1000km/h (600mph) rocket sleds, beyond the capability of human volunteers to tolerate. In the early 1950s, Alderson and Grumman produced a dummy which was used to conduct crash tests in both motor vehicles and aircraft. The original [...] "Sierra Sam" [...] was a <b>95th</b> <b>percentile</b> male dummy (heavier and taller than 95% of human males).|$|E
2500|$|Hybrid III, the 50th {{percentile}} male dummy {{which made}} its first appearance in 1976, is the familiar crash test dummy, {{and he is now}} a family man. If he could stand upright, he would be 175cm (5'9") tall and would have a mass of 77kg (170lb). He occupies the driver's seat in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) 65km/h (40mph) offset frontal crash tests. He is joined by a [...] "big brother", the <b>95th</b> <b>percentile</b> Hybrid III, at 188cm (6ft 2 in) and 100kg (223lb). Ms. Hybrid III is a 5th percentile female dummy, at a diminutive 152cm (5ft) tall and 50kg (110lb). The three Hybrid III child dummies represent a ten-year-old, 21kg (47lb) six-year-old, and a 15kg (33lb) three-year-old. The child models are very recent additions to the crash test dummy family; because so little hard data are available on the effects of accidents on children and such data are very difficult to obtain, these models are based in large part on estimates and approximations. [...] The primary benefit provided by the Hybrid III is improved neck response in forward flexion and head rotation that better simulates the human.|$|E
