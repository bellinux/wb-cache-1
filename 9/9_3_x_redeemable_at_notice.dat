40|$|Exploitation {{of natural}} gas hydrate is expecting to be an {{important}} strategic way {{to solve the problem of}} energy depletion. Understanding the effectiveness of the well configuration plays a pivotal role in gas production from the hydrate reservoir. This study evaluates the methane hydrate dissociation behaviors using both vertical well and horizontal well experimentally. Methane hydrate in porous media has been synthesized in a 117. 8 L pilot-scale hydrate simulator (PHS), which is equipped with <b>9</b> (<b>3</b> <b>x</b> <b>3)</b> vertical wells and <b>9</b> (<b>3</b> <b>x</b> <b>3)</b> horizontal wells. The condition of hydrate formation is corresponding to the ocean depth of 1200 m and it is similar to the hydrate characteristics of the South China Sea. Hydrate is dissociated under depressurization and thermal stimulation. The results indicate that, for the depressurization and thermal stimulation methods, the gas production rate, the heat transfer rate, and the accumulative dissociation ratio with the horizontal well pattern are higher than those with the vertical well pattern. Meanwhile, the evaluations of the energy ratio and the thermal efficiency indicate that the horizontal well pattern has the advantage of higher production efficiency by the thermal stimulation. Thus, it is determined that the production performance is better using the horizontal well pattern. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

From the 20 water samples tested, 14 (70 %) and 7 (35 %) were PCR positive for the HF 183 and CF 128 markers, respectively. The numbers of the HF 183 and CF 128 markers in lake water samples were <b>3.</b> <b>9</b> <b>x</b> 104 to 6. 3 × 107 and <b>9.</b> <b>3</b> <b>x</b> 103 to 6. <b>3</b> <b>x</b> 105 genomic units (GU) / 100 ml of water, respectively. The high numbers of enterococci and the HF 183 markers indicate sewage pollution and potential health risks to those who use the lake water for non-potable purposes such as bathing and washing clothes. This is the first study that investigated the presence of microbial source tracking (MST) markers in Dhaka, Bangladesh where diarrhoeal diseases {{is one of the}} major causes of childhood mortality. The molecular assay as used in this study can provide valuable information on the extent of sewage pollution, thus facilitating the development of robust strategies to minimise potential health risks...|$|R
40|$|Closantel binds to the serum {{proteins}} of {{the host}} and affects blood sucking parasites when they ingest the brood of treated hosts. Closantel binds specifically to ovine serum albumin (K-a of <b>9.</b> <b>3</b> <b>x</b> 10 (6) M(- 1)) at site I, the warfarin/phenylbutazone binding site of albumin Closantel also binds to invertebrate haemocyanin and haemolymph. The strongest binding of closantel in homogenates of H. contortus is found in fractions containing soluble proteins. This binding is of low affinity and, because the site itself is not fully denaturable, {{it may not be}} proteinaceous. There is no detectable difference in binding affinity between homogenate fractions from closantel susceptible and resistant isolates of adult or larval worms suggesting that closantel resistance is not due to changes in the closantel receptor or carrier.

40|$|Abstract. Field {{emission}} from Al-doped ZnO nanostrcutures {{has been}} investigated in planar diode configuration under ultra high vacuum conditions. The Al-doped ZnO nanostructures were synthesized by co-precipitation method with varying aluminium concentrations. The as- synthesized product was characterized by x-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive x-ray analysis. The threshold field required to draw a current density of ~ 1 µA/cm 2 was observed to be ~ 2. 0 V/µm and ~ 2. 3 V/µm for Al-doped ZnO nanostructures synthesized with aluminium concentrations of 1 % and 3 %, respectively. The Fowler- Nordheim (F-N) plots for both the specimens exhibit non-linear behaviour, which is observed to be specimen dependent. The non-linearity observed in the F-N plots has been interpreted {{on the basis of}} the theory of electron emission from semiconductor emitters. The field enhancement factors, estimated from the slope of the F-N plots, are found to be ~ <b>9.</b> <b>3</b> <b>x</b> 103 and <b>3.</b> <b>9</b> <b>x</b> 103 for 1 % and 3 % Al-doped ZnO emitters, respectively. The high values of the field enhancement factor suggest that the emission is from the nanostructures. The emission current stability measured at the preset value of ~ 2 µA over a period of more than three hours is found to be fairly stable. The results indicate use of Al-doped ZnO nanostructures as promising emitters for field emission based devices...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an efficient}} heuristic {{to minimize the}} makespan of scheduling n independent jobs on m unrelated parallel machines. The problem of scheduling the jobs on the unrelated parallel machines is combinatorial in nature. Hence, the heuristic approach is inevitable for quicker solution. In this paper, a simple and efficient heuristic is designed to minimize the makespan of scheduling n independent jobs on m unrelated parallel machines. A mathematical model is also presented for this problem. A factorial experiment is {{used to compare the}} results of the proposed heuristic with that of a mathematical model by taking “Method” (Heuristic and Model) as the first factor and “Problem Size” (No. of machines X No. of Jobs: 2 X 5, 2 X 6, ……, 2 <b>X</b> <b>9,</b> <b>3</b> <b>X</b> 5, <b>3</b> <b>X</b> 6, ……, <b>3</b> <b>X</b> <b>9,</b> ……., 5 X 5, 5 X 6, … 5 X 9) as the second factor. It is found that there is {{no significant difference between the}} results of the proposed heuristic and that of the mathematical model. Further, the mean percent error of the results obtained by the heuristic from the optimal results obtained by the model is 2. 336 %. The heuristic gives optimal solution for 76. 67 % of the problems...|$|R
