50|$|The village can roughly {{be divided}} into four parts: the old village which grew northeast-wards from the south west corner; the more {{up-market}} properties northwest-wards along and {{to the west of}} the main <b>Runcorn</b> <b>Road</b> (A533); the council-built estate to the north west, largely between Townfield Lane and Runcorn Road; and the more modern estates (the largest known as the Locke estate after the builders) to the north and east. The village has no easily identifiable centre with some shops along the <b>Runcorn</b> <b>Road</b> and others by the new Health Centre in Lydyett Lane. There are currently only two pubs, a small number for such a large village and greatly fewer than there were 100 years ago. The parish church is Christ Church in Church Road in the old part of the village; there are also Catholic, Methodist and Pentecostal churches.|$|R

500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20thcentury the {{industry}} of the town continued to be dominated by chemicals and tanning. This growth was largely due to government fixed-priced cost contracts for tanned hides. In 1926 four chemical companies merged to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). As the century progressed there was diversification of industry. In 1961 the Transporter Bridge was replaced by <b>Runcorn</b> <b>Road</b> Bridge (since named the Silver Jubilee Bridge) which allowed a more efficient means of <b>road</b> traffic across <b>Runcorn</b> Gap. [...] The designation of Runcorn as a new town in 1964 brought major changes and more than doubled the population. Much of the architecture of the new town was innovative, especially the Southgate development designed by Sir James Stirling and built between 1970 and 1977. Stirling's housing development was beset with problems and it was demolished in the early 1990s. [...] During the second half of the 20th century the tanneries closed (the last to close was the Highfield Tannery in the late 1960s) and the chemical industry declined. At the same time, light industry developed together with warehouses and distribution centres.|$|R
50|$|Moore is {{the site}} of a disused railway station named Daresbury. The railway station was opened in 1850 and was located {{on the south side of}} <b>Runcorn</b> <b>Road.</b> The station was closed to {{passengers}} in 1952 and closed completely in 1965. The platforms and ramps down from road are still visible from <b>Runcorn</b> <b>Road.</b> The railway station was situated on the Birkenhead Joint Railway close to Warrington and in the village of Moore. The railway station was the second to open in the village.The first railway station which was very close by was part of the Grand Junction Railway which opened on 4 July 1837. Moore was a second class station at which a First Class train would not stop. The engineer for the northern half of the new railway was Joseph Locke who became a famous as a railway engineer. The date of closure of Moore railway station is uncertain. Drake's Road Book of the Grand Junction Railway (1838) Moorland Reprints: Moorland Publishing Co., Market Place, Hartington, Buxton, Derbyshire - 1974.Daresbury railway station was initially called Moore but the name was changed to Daresbury in April 1861 taking its name from a village a mile or so away.|$|R

50|$|Runcorn War Memorial {{was built}} to commemorate the {{servicemen}} of Runcorn lost in active service in the First World War. It was unveiled in 1920, {{and the names of}} those lost in the Second World War and subsequently were added later. The memorial stands in a small garden by a <b>road</b> junction in <b>Runcorn,</b> Cheshire, England, and consists of a Latin cross in white granite on a plinth and steps. Behind the cross is a wall containing plaques with inscriptions and the names of those who died. An inscribed stone has been added later with the names of those lost in subsequent conflicts. The war memorial is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.|$|R
50|$|The road {{remains an}} {{undivided}} four-lane highway through the Twiggs County Line to the junction with GA 96 in Tarversville, then narrows {{down to two}} lanes for the next 24 miles. Within this vicinity US 23/ALT 129/SR 87 runs through communities such as Bullard, South Twiggs, Huber and later Reids with no major intersections, especially as it passes through the Bond Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, and has occasional entrances to the refuge. After passing between some antenna fields for some Macon-area television and FM Radio stations, the routes pass one more entrance to the Wildlife Refuge before crossing the Twiggs-Bibb County line, and widens to a three and then four-lane undivided highway. In Smithsonia the routes are given the name Ocmulgee East Boulevard, and then becomes a four-lane divided highway for the first interchange with Interstate 16 west of old Camp Wheeler, only to narrow back down to an undivided two-lane highway as it runs through East Macon, where it runs along {{the western edge of}} the Macon Downtown Airport. Just after a small power line right of way, the road curves to the right, then turns left as Emery Highway while Ocmulgee East Boulevard becomes GA Connecting Route 87 leading towards US 80/GA 19 and Jeffersonville Road. Emery Highway is later joined by US 80/SR 19, and all five routes (US 23/80/ALT 129/SR 19/87) continue to the northwest. Within Macon, US 23/80/ALT 129 first enters the city limits by running beneath a former Southern Railway bridge, and then runs under a power line right-of-way before crossing a pair of old bridges over Walnut Creek, where it runs along the northern edge of the Ocmulgee National Monument. After Indian Circle, the road curves to the left as it climbs a hill approaching the intersection of Jeffersonville Road, across from the entrance to the Ocmulgee National Monument. The road briefly replaces the alignment of Jeffersonville Road and then Main Street, which can only be accessed from Short Street. Briefly passing Fort Hawkins between Maynard and Fort Hill Streets, Georgia State Route 87 turns south onto U.S. Route 80 (Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard), passing between two hospitals, then the Macon Coliseum, before encountering an interchange with Interstate 16 again this time at Exit 2. Immediately after this interchange US 80/SR 87 crosses the Otis Redding Memorial Bridge and then makes a right turn onto Riverside Drive, joining northbound U.S. Route 129/GA 11, where both the current and former bridge embankments for some Southern Railway lines cross over US 80/GA 11 south of the intersection and US 129/GA 11/87 west of the intersection. The northwest corner of this intersection also contains the Charles H. Jones Gateway Park. Three blocks after this intersection, the road passes under the bridge for Georgia State Route 22 (Second Street), which only includes access from a south to east loop ramp. Rotary Park can be found across from this loop. West of First Street, a vacant lot that may or may not be part of this park can also be found. The concurrency along Riverside Drive ends at Spring Street (GA 19/49) when US 129/SR 11 turns right and SR 87 rejoins US 23. From there, US 23/SR 87 passes by the NRHP-listed Rose Hill Cemetery as it descends towards a bridge over Interstate 75 in Georgia, running parallel to that interstate until it reaches Exit 171, northwest of the city limits. Passing by some car dealerships, strip malls and The Shoppes at River Crossing, the road becomes a two-lane undivided highway after New Forsyth Road, although a long stretch of right-of-way for new northbound lanes can be found along the east side as it passes through the intersection of the northwest end of Bass Road (former Georgia State Route 361) and <b>Arkwright</b> <b>Road,</b> where a traffic circle is currently proposed. This right-of-way shows up at random moments even as it runs through its last miles within Bibb County.|$|R
5000|$|An inquest {{was held}} in Preston Brook and the jury {{returned}} a verdict of accidental death. The jury also added their unanimous opinion that the company should accept [...] "great blame" [...] and that [...] "there was a want of prudence and discretion" [...] {{on the part of}} the [...] "officers and servants" [...] of the company. A report was prepared by Captain R. E. Laffan who was appointed by the Commissioners of Railways. Captain Laffin was critical of the secretary of the company, the locomotive superintendent, the three drivers, two of the guards and the Frodsham station master, but in particular he blamed the executive committee of the railway company. He made six recommendations: a station should be built at each end of the tunnel and that the stations should be connected by an electric telegraph; two guards should be provided on each train rather than one; the locomotive stock and number of carriages should be increased; a more efficient staff should be engaged; all passenger carriages passing through the tunnel should be provided with lights; the interval of five minutes between trains should be increased. The stations were built. At the Frodsham end the station went first by the name of <b>Runcorn,</b> then <b>Runcorn</b> <b>Road,</b> and finally Halton; it is now closed. At the other end was Norton station, which has been replaced by Runcorn East station.|$|R
50|$|To the east, {{the parish}} {{boundary}} runs {{for a short}} distance against the River Witham and the North Hykeham Pump Drain, where it borders Waddington. It deviates to the west from the Witham, following the Pump Drain, then follows the Witham further south from Hykeham Bridge for 0.5 mi. To the south it follows The Beck, with South Hykeham to the south, and passes {{to the south of}} Grange Farm. it crosses Newark Road (A1434) at Ascot Way. At Pike Drain, near the Sailing Club and Teal Lake, it borders Doddington and Whisby. Directly north of the Sailing Club, it crosses the railway, then crosses the A46 bypass to the north-west. It passes through the middle of West Lodge Game Farm and on the eastern edge of Coronation Plantation. South-west of the A46 Doddington Road roundabout, the parish meets Lincoln, becoming the North Kesteven boundary. The boundary crosses the A46 just south of the roundabout, following Prial Drain. The parish includes the Lyndon Business Park next to the A46, the factory units on Whisby Road and the Hotel Ibis on <b>Runcorn</b> <b>Road.</b> Although Prial Drain crosses Doddington Road (B1190), the boundary deviates to the east, following the road to the south, just north of the transport museum, to the railway line. It leaves the railway line on {{the eastern edge of the}} lakes, and runs straight through a housing estate to meet Tritton Road (B1003). It crosses the A1434 at the Tritton Road junction. South-east, it crosses Hykeham Road, and passes just north of Conway Drive to the river.|$|R
