40|$|During January 2004, a Savannah-area {{well driller}} {{contacted}} the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (GaEPD) to report saltwater contamination of three domestic wells {{completed in the}} Upper Floridan aquifer in the Vernon-burg, Georgia, area. Because the Upper Floridan aquifer is deeply buried in the area, {{it was unlikely that}} saltwater was encroaching laterally into the aquifer. Instead saltwater was more likely entering through an improperly con-structed or failing well and leaking downward. Vernonburg is located south of Savannah (Fig. 1) and is bordered by the Savannah city limit and the Vernon River. Vernonburg consists of about 65 households, 62 of which have wells completed in the Upper Floridan aquifer. The remaining three residences are connected to the Savan-nah public water system. Groundwater in the Vernonburg area is known to be salty at relatively shallow depths, within 50 feet below land surface in general and less than 10 feet deep adjacent to the river (Hall and Carter, 2004). Interviews with some well owners revealed that the saltwa-ter contamination was first recognized during 2001. GaEPD conducted a preliminary investigation to ver-ify the reported saltwater contamination and identify wells with elevated specific conductance (an indicator of saltwa-ter contamination). During February and March of 2003, an extensive well inventory was conducted, in cooperation with the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), which included the measurement of water levels and collection of water samples for chloride analysis. Of the 51 wells inventoried, 11 had specific conductance levels exceeding 300 micro-siemens per centimeter (μS/cm) (Fig. 2). Chloride concen-trations in the wells with elevated specific conductance ranged from 227 to 4, 173 milligrams per liter (mg/L) chlo-ride. During the investigation, two possible sources for the saltwater were identified: an abandoned uncapped well located in the tidal zone along the Vernon River and a domestic well with ungrouted casing. The abandoned well along the river was the most probable source of saltwater contamination; GaEPD per-sonnel plugged the well during May 2004. Prior to plug-ging, the well was purged for 4 hours on May 17 and for 7 hours on May 18. The conductance of the purged water peaked at 7, 480 μS/cm and decreased to 3, 000 μS/cm.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Presentation date: 1985 - 07 - 24 The 18 May 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens, emplaced between 3 - 3. 5 billion <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (bcy) of poorly sorted material ranging from silt to boulders, extending from river mile (RM) 25 to RM 38 {{in the upper}} North Fork Toutle River drainage. Sediment yields from the debris avalanche were calculated for four water years, 1980 - 1983. During 1980, the North Fork Toutle River reestablished a main channel from RM's 20 to 27, yielding 15 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> (mcy). In 1981 the channel network lengthened by head cutting, and the network was further integrated to pond and lake breaches on the debris avalanche. Channel length and width increased with winter storms. Within the channel area, braiding and incision were the major processes which yielded 31. 5 million <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of sediment. Channel widening, associated with braiding, incision, and bank failure were the dominant geomorphic processes during 1981 and 1982. By 1982, the North Fork Toutle headwaters had extended to the topographic divide at Spirit Lake. Related to this headward growth, sediment yields from the upper 7 river miles of the debris avalanche increased. This accelerated erosion induced a cascading hydrologic effect, increasing sediment yields to 34. 1 mcy during 1982. By 1983, channel widening slowed and aggredation increased in the lower 8 river miles, facilitating an overall increase in sediment storage. Establishment of a stable ground water table within the debris avalanche and reduced channel incision induced a decreased bank failure and sediment transport promoting channel stabilization. This increased stability resulted in a 15. <b>1</b> million <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> reduction in sediment yield, producing a net yield of 19. 0 mcy. The North Fork Toutle River long profile showed rapid incision from 1980 - 1982. While 1982 - 1983 showed definite smoothing and concave profile development. Profile plots for 1982 and 1983 show that the system adjusted toward the sediment load and hydrologic conditions in the study area.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{feasibility}} of processing and marketing the hardwood bark and finewood residue materials generated by the primary wood using industries located within the project study area (an area encompassing all of Illinois and area fifty miles wide surrounding Illinois). The study (1970 through 1973) involved three separate phases of work. The first phase developed information regarding the sources of residue materials both with regard to the geographic distribution of the mills generating the residues and with regard to the quantities produced by the various types of mills within the project area. The data developed indicated that 71 of the saw mills considered to be large enough to justify debarker installations and the six pulp mills operating in the study area could have generated an estimated <b>1,</b> 125, 000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> and finewood residue materials in 1970 if all the round wood processed had been debarked. The mills with debarkers Installed in 1970 generated about 528, 000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of residue bark and an additional 335, 800 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of finewood residues (sawdust and shavings). The remaining indicated potential supply of residue materials (261, 200 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards)</b> is the residue materials that could have been produced by those larger mills that had not installed debarking equipment at the time the study was made. The second phase of the project or marketing study developed information regarding the market project area when used only as mulches, soil conditioners, bedding, litter and for other closely related type uses. The eleven user-groups contacted in the marketing survey represented approximately 7, 300 potential marketing outlets for these materials. This figure excludes the livestock producers. The eleven user-groups surveyed used and/or sold approximately 2, 902, 000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of all types of mulching materiasl in 1971. It was estimated the twelfth user-group considered (all Commercial livestock producers) uses an additional 26, 000, 000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of bedding and litter materials annually. By applying estimated replacement ratios of wood residue products for the various other types of materials now used and/or sold by these various user-groups, it appears a market potential of approximately <b>1,</b> 979, 000 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of wood residue products could be developed in the marketing area. This indicates that potential markets in excess of the quantities of bark and wood residue generated by the primary wood using industries can be developed over the next five to seven years. The third phase of the study examined, through operational analysis procedures, the economic aspects of processing and distributing residue products from eight assumed processing sites to nine major marketing points within Illinois. The MPS/ 360 linear programming routine (6), a basic cost minimization procedure, was modified to develop a profit maximization model. The purpose was to determine what the optimum flow of the various types of residue products would be from the eight assumed processing points (including external sources) to the nine marketing points selected in the study area. Various spacial analyses were made wherein the objective functional elements of the matrix (production costs, transportation costs and product selling prices) as well as flow constraints were varied to demonstrate the sensitivity of optimum flow solutions to these variable cost and price elements. Spacial Analysis IV indicates all residue materials in the project area could be dispersed profitably if the average delivered prices of 11. 88 per <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> for bagged mulches, 6. 72 per <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> for bulk processed bark and 3. 25 per <b>cubic</b> <b>yard</b> for bedding and litter prevail. Returns of approximately 5, 500, 000 would accrue to the primary wood processing firms participating in the production and distribution of these residue products, 34 percent of which would derive from sources outside the project area...|$|R

40|$|An {{environmental}} assessment has been prepared that summarizes the expected {{effects of the}} proposed project on the existing environment. This is a project proposed by the Omaha District, Corps of Engineers to halt the erosion occurring along the riverfront at Ponca State Park in Dixon County, Nebraska, and protect the access road to the park 2 ̆ 7 s public boat ramp. This project is authorized under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act amendment of 1978 (Public Law 95 - 625). The proposed project is located along the right bank of the Missouri River between River Miles (RM) 753. 9 and 753. 5 at Ponca State Park about 2 {{miles east of the}} town of Ponca, Nebraska. The proposed work will involve the construction of a buried revetment 80 feet long, 520 feet of direct bank armoring, and a 91 O-foot long peaked revetment. Notches in the peaked revetment would be 5 feet deep. Two tiebacks would connect the peaked revetment to the shoreline and create fisherman access to the structure. The bank armor and buried revetment would require a combined <b>1,</b> 145 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of rock, and the peaked revetment would comprise 3, 515 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards.</b> The tiebacks would add 410 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of rock, for a total project of 5, 070 <b>cubic</b> <b>yards</b> of rock. All environmental, social, and economic factors, which are relevant to the proposal, were considered in this assessment. These include, {{but are not limited to}} threatened and endangered species, vegetation, wetlands, cultural resources, air quality, water quality, and wildlife. The purpose of the project would be to protect the recreational area on Ponca State Park 2 ̆ 7 s floodplain, and to reduce the risk that unchecked erosion caused by the river current and waves could attack the access road to the park 2 ̆ 7 s boat ramp. Severe erosion has developed at the site recently after high 19902 ̆ 7 s flows eroded an island that had been protecting the area from the direct current. Erosion is now threatening the the dirt road to the picnic area, which is now closed to vehicular traffic. If erosion continues unchecked, it could erode into the blacktop access road to the boat ramp. Adverse effects would include temporary noise, and fugitive dust during construction. There are not expected to be any adverse impacts to threatened and endangered species as a result of the proposed project. Erosion control methods would be utilized during construction. Bank armor above ordinary high water would be covered with topsoil and seeded with native vegetation after construction is complete. It is my finding, based on the {{environmental assessment}}, that the proposed Federal activity will not have any significant adverse impacts on the environment and that the proposed project will not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The proposed action has been coordinated with the appropriate resource agencies, and there are no significant unresolved issues. Therefore, an environmental impact statement will not be prepared...|$|R

The Assiut dam was constructed between 1898 and 1903, and {{in conjunction with the}} reservoir, provided for the diversion of river water into Egypt's largest irrigation canal, the Ibrahimiya Canal, during the low water season. The dam was estimated to cost £525,000 but by the time of its completion it actually cost £870,000. The main contractor for the project was the British contractor John Aird & Co..
