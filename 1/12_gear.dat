50|$|The {{final time}} trial was over a course {{approximately}} 25 kilometres (15.5 mi) long, {{with a net}} elevation loss of 75 metres (247 ft). The riders had a moderate tailwind. LeMond put his bike into a huge 55 x <b>12</b> <b>gear.</b> His effort was the fastest individual time trial for a distance longer than 10 km ever ridden. A November 1989 Bicycling Magazine article, supported by wind-tunnel data, estimated that LeMond may have gained 1 minute on Fignon {{through the use of}} the new aerobars. He also could have gained 16 seconds by wearing his aero helmet with a slightly elongated tail section for better aerodynamics, while Fignon rode bare-headed with his ponytail exposed to the wind. Fignon did perhaps gain a 5-second advantage by using a disk front wheel, while LeMond used a 24-spoke bladed radially spoked front wheel. Fignon finished third in the final time trial with an average speed of 53.59 km/h. His time was fifty-eight seconds slower than LeMond's, which gave the yellow jersey and the Tour title to the American. LeMond's final margin of victory over Fignon was eight seconds. Another change in the general classification top 10 produced by the time trial was Kelly finishing ninth in the GC overtaking Millar by 21 seconds.|$|E

So during the design phase of any electrical equipment thermal analysis is mandatory to predict the temperature rise. The objective is to develop an analytical tool based on thermal networking method by exploiting the similarity between thermal and electrical analogy to calculate steady state temperatures in less time along current carrying path in electrical equipments. As a later part, the tool developed is used to predict change in temperatures for change in geometry of the components in the electrical equipment. The problem is considered as two parts. As first part, an Excel tool is developed with Visual Basic backend, based on thermal networking method to calculate steady state temperatures in electrical equipments. Here the numerical method used is Elementary Balance Method, in which every element is represented by a node and relevant energy balance equations are formulated for it. Temperatures are calculated using the Excel tool for frame 1 and 3. Test (Thermal Run) is conducted on AKD- <b>12</b> switch <b>gear</b> (frame 1 and frame 3) under continuous current to find out temperatures. Analytical results from the tool are then validated against the test data. As second part, dimensions of components in the switch gear are varied and variation in temperatures of components, particularly at moving contact (highest temperature point) with respect to original temperatures is observed. Good matching is observed in temperature profile between analytical and experimental results. The maximum percentage error is 15 %. By analyzing the results, {{it can be concluded}} that thermal network theory helps engineers to predict temperatures easily for changes in design reducing design cycle time and it is flexible as to expand its application to any heat generating equipment...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{applying}} vibration-based condition monitoring in gear systems is {{to detect the}} initiation and development of degradation before the occurrence of failure. Eventually, degradation {{will result in a}} malfunction of the gearing system, which will affect the availability of the whole system. Early detection allows proper scheduled shutdown to prevent catastrophic failure and consequently results in a safer operation and higher cost reduction. The current thesis deals with crack modelling from a condition monitoring perspective and focuses on the early detection of cracks propagating in gear teeth using vibration signal analysis. The research approach is based on crack modelling and gear mesh stiffness calculation, dynamic modelling and simulation, and methods for fault detection by means of dynamic response and vibration analysis. The time-varying gear mesh stiffness has been studied for cracked gears, and different crack progression scenarios have been applied. Different gear dynamic models have been used for simulating the dynamic response of the studied gear system. The gyroscopic effect of the gear disc has been studied by introducing a <b>12</b> DOF <b>gear</b> dynamic model. Signal processing techniques have been used in vibration signal analysis for detecting any impact of the crack. Moreover, the changes in the system dynamic response with varying mesh stiffness have been investigated. The possibility of detecting cracks has then been studied using the changes in the dynamic response of the system due to a stiffness reduction of the cracked tooth.

40|$|The aplyronines are {{a family}} of 24 -membered {{macrolides}} of polyketide origin, isolated from the Japanese sea hare Aplysia kurodai. They exhibit an exceptional biological activity profile, acting through an actin and tubulin dual-targeting mechanism, with subnanomolar growth inhibitory potency against a diverse range of cancer cell lines. These characteristics render the aplyronines ideal payloads for antibody-drug conjugates but their prohibitively low natural abundance calls for an efficient total synthesis to overcome the supply issue. This dissertation describes the efforts towards developing a second-generation Paterson synthesis of the macrocyclic core of the aplyronines, focused on improving the scalability and selectivity of key transformations. Chapter 1 details the isolation, biological background and previous synthetic efforts towards the aplyronines to illustrate their therapeutic potential and the challenges associated with material sourcing by chemical synthesis. Chapter 2 presents the existing body of work on the aplyronine project within the Paterson group, highlighting the lessons learned {{over the past two}} decades and shortcomings to be addressed. Chapter 3 discusses a revised protecting group strategy towards the C 1 -C 27 macrocyclic alcohol 159 with fewer manipulation steps. A refined reaction sequence featuring titanium aldol methodology and an enzymatic desymmetrisation process delivered multigram stocks of the C 15 -C 27 aldehyde 161 upon scale- up, testifying to the robustness of the devised route. Synthesis of the C 1 -C 14 northern fragment 253 closely followed the existing boron aldol approach with optimisation of the C 11 -C <b>12</b> alkylation step, <b>geared</b> towards enhancing the regioselectivity. Chapter 4 describes the coupling of the two major fragments using an Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction to assemble the C 1 -C 27 backbone of the cyclic aplyronine core and suitably adjusted endgame steps to enable a one-step oxidative unmasking of the macrolactonisation sites. The first-generation intermediate 159 was accessed via site-specific Yamaguchi esterification and orthogonal deprotection of the C 27 allyl carbonate. Discussion in Chapter 5 includes the appendage of the C 28 -C 34 side chain 118, prepared by the known sequence, and suggestions for the future direction of the second-generation route with the outlook of linker appendage for the purposes of antibody-drug conjugate development.

Then new teams are assembled, taking one student from each “sphere” team to create a diverse group which can build on the work of all the sphere teams. The other two modules are similar studies of global warming and the Wisconsinan ice age. The teams produce reports which are graded using a rubric.

Under the new licensure requirements middle school licensure candidates wishing to earn a science concentration now have to take 15 semester hours of content class work in Science. The Ohio Department of Education has strongly suggested that teacher preparation institutions develop new courses for middle school educators in all four areas of concentration, including science. In response to this call for new courses science education faculty in all science areas worked together to develop a comprehensive suite of courses that would target the science content standards guidelines in the state and national standards. The newly developed Earth and Space science course is titled Earth Systems. The course carries 4. 5 quarter hours of credit and is intended expressly for pre-service middle school (grades 4 - 9) science teachers. The content is structured around three modules of study that are designed to develop interdisciplinary science content within the context of past, present and future Earth Systems science. Because the course is created for pre-service teachers, the class models the jigsaw teaching technique, an effective and age-appropriate method of science instruction. This enables pre-service teachers to experience a technique they can use in their own classroom. Course content is aligned with all state and national 4 - 10 Earth/Space Science standards, which supports pre- service Middle School Science teachers by covering the content areas tested in the Praxis Middle School Science test, a requirement for graduation with licensure from Wright State University. It also helps the pre- service teachers gain experience with the content that they will need to teach to their K- 12 students, so {{they will be able to}} pass the high-stakes Ohio Graduation Test.

40|$|Combined extrusion-forging {{processes}} are now getting importance for its abilities to give improved material properties, high production rate and less material waste {{when compared with}} that produced by machining, casting or by assembling the individual parts produced by different manufacturing processes. In its simplest form of combined extrusion-forging process, a billet is forged by punch and dies with punch/die or both containing an opening for extrusion. This tooling arrangement permits the simultaneous lateral spread due to forging, and backward/forward extrusion or both forward and backward extrusion simultaneously through the die/punch opening(s). The flow pattern of the material is dependent {{on a number of}} factors, including the frictional conditions at the work piece/tooling interface; the geometry of the dies, particularly the size of the dies hole; the material type; and the percentage area reductions. Due to the complexity of the analysis, and because of the large number of process variables, it is difficult to estimate the forming force required to manufacture a given component. In this direction, the present work emphasizes on estimation of forming force for forward and forward-backward extrusion-forging process of regular shapes and different tooth spur gear shapes. Though technological barriers exist, as in most manufacturing areas, it is important to overcome them by developing proper understanding of the process with related attributes. In this direction, present work emphasis on the forward and forward-backward extrusion-forging process analysis of different methodology applied to different section heads with circular shaft. Based on these guiding principles, the methodology applied are upper bound analysis (particularly reformulated spatial elemental rigid region (SERR) technique), finite element analysis (commercial package DEFORM®- 3 D codes), and experimentation. The understandings generated in this work not only properly explain the complex material flow mechanism but also presents in detail the upper bound analysis. The results of UBA are well validated with that of finite element analysis and experimental results. The achievements realized from the present work can be summarized as follows: 	Experimental studies are carried out with a view to compare some of the theoretical results predicated using the upper bound method in general, modified SERR technique in particular, with that obtained from the experiment. SERR technique is used to analysis the last stage of the combined extrusion forging process, which requires maximum load. 	A computational model for forward and forward-backward extrusion-forging process with and without considering friction is developed by incorporating all special features for all the section extrusions. Three formulations for forward extrusion-forging process and six formulations for forward-backward extrusion-forging {{processes are}} analyzed and the optimal solution for non-dimensional extrusion pressure is found out for further computation. The model is developed using FORTRAN code. 	Experiments are performed for triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon, 4 -tooth, 6 -tooth, 8 -tooth and <b>12</b> -tooth spur <b>gear</b> (involutes profile and pressure angle 14 ½º) is form using flat / square dies.

40|$|EXPLANATION OF TEST REPORT GENERAL CONDITIONS East tractor is a {{production}} model equipped for common usage. Power consuming accessories can be disconnected {{only when it}} is convenient for the operator {{to do so in}} practice. Additional weight can be added as ballast if the manufacturer regularly supplies it for sale. The static tire loads and the inflation pressures muse conform to recommendations in the Tire Standards published by the Society of Automotive Engineers. PREPARATION FOR PERFORMANCE RUNS The engine crank case is drained and refilled with a measured amount of new oil conforming to specifications in the operator’s manual. The fuel used and the maintenance operations must also conform to the published information delivered with the tractor. The tractor is then limbered-up for 1 hour on drawbar work in accordance with the manufacturers published recommendations. The manufacturer’s representative is present to make appropriate decisions regarding mechanical adjustments. The tractor is equipped with approximately the amount of added ballast that is used during maximum drawbar tests. The tire tread-bar height must be at least 65 % of new tread height prior to the maximum power run. BELT OR POWER TAKE-OFF PERFORMANCE Maximum Power and Fuel Consumption. The manufacturer’s representative makes carburetor, fuel pump, ignition and governor control settings which remain unchanged throughout tall subsequent runs. The governor and the manually operated governor control lever is set to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer for maximum power. Maximum power is measured by connecting the belt pulley or the power take-off to a dynamometer. The dynamometer load is then gradually increased until the engine is operating at the rated speed specified by the manufacturer for maximum power. The corresponding fuel consumption is measured. Varying Power and Fuel Consumption. Six different horsepower levels are used to show corresponding fuel consumption rates and how the governor causes the engine to react to the following changes in dynamometer load: 85 % of the dynamometer torque at maximum power; minimum dynamometer torque, ½ the 85 % torque; maximum power; ¼ and ¾ of the 85 % torque. Since at tractor is generally subjected to varying loads the average of the results in this test serve well for predicting the fuel consumption of a tractor in general usage. DRAWBAR PERFORMANCE All engine adjustments are the same as those used in the belt or power take-off tests. If the manufacturer specifies a different rated crankshaft speed for drawbar operations, then the position of the manually operated governor control is changed to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer in the operating instructions. Varying Power and Fuel Consumption With Ballast. The varying power runs are made to show the effect of speed-control devices (engine governor, automatic transmissions, etc.) on horsepower, speed and fuel consumption. These runs are made around the entire test course with has two 180 degree turns with a minimum radius of 50 feet. The drawbar pull is set at 3 different levels as follows: (1) as near to the pull a maximum power as possible and still have the tractor maintain the travel speed at maximum horsepower on the straight sections of the test course; (2) 75 % of the pull at maximum power; and (3) 50 % of the pull at maximum power. Prior to 1958, fuel consumption data (10 hour test) were shown only for the pull obtained at maximum power for tractors having torque converters and at 75 % of the pull obtained at maximum power for gear-type tractors. Maximum Power With Ballast. Maximum power is measured on straight level sections of the test course. Data are shown for not more that <b>12</b> different <b>gears</b> or travel speeds. Some gears or travel speeds may be omitted because of high slippage of the traction members or because the travel speed may exceed the safe-limit for the test course. The maximum safe speed for the Nebraska Test course has been set at 15 miles per hour. The slippage limits have been set at 15 % and 7 % for pneumatic tires and steel tracks or lugs, respectively. Higher slippage gives widely varying results. Maximum Power Without Ballast. All added ballast is removed from the tractor. The maximum drawbar power of the tractor is determined by the same procedure used for getting maximum power with ballast. The gear (or travel speed) is the same as that used in the 10 -hours test. Varying Power and Travel Speed With Ballast. Travel speeds corresponding to drawbar pulls beyond the maximum power range are obtained to show the “lugging ability” of the tractor. The run starts with the pull at maximum power; then additional drawbar pull is applied to cause decreasing speeds. The run is ended by one of three conditions; (1) maximum pull is obtained, (2) the maximum slippage limit is reached, or (3) some other operating limit is reached...|$|R
