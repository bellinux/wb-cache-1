30|$|Researchers share {{sequence}} {{data with}} {{the academic community}} by submitting sequences to these public databases. This is generally a requirement when sequences are included in a publication. In addition to nucleotide sequence data, various optional meta-data fields are included with sequence submissions. These fields include {{the name of the}} organism from which the sequence data originated, the names of the authors or researchers, a draft publication title, co-ordinates of any coding regions within the sequence, and the date of the submission. If coding regions are specified, the resulting protein translation is stored in the database automatically. Although sequence data submitted to the databases is <b>checked</b> for integrity, <b>no</b> <b>checks</b> are <b>performed</b> on text submitted into the free-form text fields, such as the “Author” or “Note” fields.|$|R
50|$|In BioJava peptide {{sequences}} and nucleotide sequences are {{lists of}} symbols. The symbols can be retrieved {{one after the}} other with an iterator or sub-sequences can be obtained. The advantages are that the entire sequence does not necessarily reside in memory and that programs are less susceptible to programming errors. Symbol objects are immutable elements of an alphabet. In STRAP however simple byte arrays are used for sequences and float arrays for coordinates. Besides speed the low memory consumption is an important advantage of basic data types. Classes in Strap expose internal data. Therefore, programmers might commit programming errors like manipulating byte arrays directly instead of using the setter methods. Another disadvantage is that <b>no</b> <b>checks</b> are <b>performed</b> in STRAP whether the characters in sequences are valid with respect to an underlying alphabet.|$|R
40|$|In several {{parts of}} the world {{livestock}} animals (sheep, goats and cattle) are identified with radiofrequency identification (RFID) devices. These transponders can be read with handheld and stationary readers. The reading can be performed on the farm, during transport, in the sales yard and in the slaughterhouse. Especially when the RFID tags are read with a static reader the signal strength the transponders produce is very important (reading distance shall be sufficient if animal passes the reader). If the signal is insufficient it can result in misreads. In many countries RFID tags have to meet certain approval criteria to get allowance for use for identifying a certain species with those tags. The approval is mostly based upon tests that are performed by test agencies on new tags that the manufacturer has send to the test agency. The tags the manufacturer later on sell on the market can have a different quality as the original tested product or the quality of the RFID tags can be influenced by environmental conditions e. g. moisture. The reduced quality can increase the misread percentage. In the most RFID schemes there are <b>no</b> <b>checks</b> <b>performed</b> that safeguard the quality of the products sold on the marked. Schemes that monitor the quality of RFID products on the market could be introduced. This monitoring could e. g. be based upon RFID sample tags that are collected during slaughter. When a certain percentages of the recovered tags are outside specification the manufacturer should improve the quality of his product. If the manufacturer e. g. within a year does not succeed {{to improve the quality of}} that product approval for that product could be withdrawn...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSecure user {{authentication}} {{is a crucial}} service for many systems and applications, especially when the data stored and the functionalities offered are highly confidential or critical. In those situations, traditional, single-occurrence, authentication mechanisms can be inadequate to face intrusions: <b>no</b> <b>checks</b> are <b>performed</b> after login, {{and even if they}} were repeated, frequently asking for passwords or secrets would reduce system usability. Biometric continuous authentication, instead, is emerging as viable alternative that can guarantee reliable and transparent verification for the whole session: the traits can be repeatedly acquired without the user active participation. In addition, another security service that it can offer is non-repudiation, thus providing irrefutable evidence of system usage, hard-or better, impossible-to deny. The paper focuses on biometric continuous authentication and non-repudiation, and it presents a preliminary solution based on a specific case study.

40|$|Data from {{municipal}} and private {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTP) in the Dodecanese prefecture in Greece was collected via a questionnaire and personal interviews, and was analyzed {{with respect to the}} operational status of the plants. The data was compared with the latest reports by the Greek Ministry of the Environment, which is what is officially reported at a national level and to the European Union (EU), and what judges Greece's compliance with EU Directives. Our assessment is that the picture presented by the Ministry is limited and optimistic when compared to reality, with many plants going unreported. This confirms what other researchers have reported previously, and presents an update on operational status, specifically for the highly touristic and ecologically sensitive island area of the Dodecanese. A short survey of the private WWTPs belonging to hotel establishments reveals that, although they are expected to treat {{a large percentage of the}} wastewaters produced in the islands during summer months, most of them operate poorly, while <b>no</b> regular <b>checks</b> are <b>performed</b> by public health officials...|$|R
