50|$|The TL6930 cells {{work well}} over typical ocean {{temperatures}} (0-40 °C), and for typical ocean deployments (1 month - 2 years). At {{a temperature of}} 5-10 °C, one TL6930 holds roughly three times {{the energy of the}} same size alkaline cell. Most of that difference is accounted by the lithium cell's higher voltage (nominally 3.8 VDC vs. <b>1.5</b> <b>VDC).</b> Fig. 1 provides an example of how the voltage on these cells varies with time, assuming both cells supply the same continuous power. The lithium cell lasts 3 times as long as an alkaline cell, and sustains a more constant voltage during its life. Primary lithium cells also hold several times the capacity of rechargeable lithium cells.|$|E
50|$|On Friday night, October <b>15,</b> 1965, the <b>VDC</b> held an anti-war {{march that}} {{began at the}} UC Berkeley campus and was {{intended}} to end at the Oakland Army Terminal. The march left the UC campus at 7:52 p.m. after an all-day rally there. Marchers carried anti-U.S. foreign policy signs and chanted anti-war slogans. There were 10,000-14,000 people in the march. At {{the head of the}} march was a banner carried by a line of marchers, then a sound truck containing VDC leaders including Jack Weinberg, Bettina Aptheker, Jerry Rubin, Stephen Smale, Steve Weissman, Frank Bardacke, and Robert Scheer. Also in the truck was the poet Allen Ginsberg chanting the Heart Sutra. However, the City of Oakland had refused to grant the march a permit, and so Oakland police blocked Telegraph Avenue at the Oakland border with a phalanx of some 375 policemen. When the march neared the border, it came to a halt while the leaders considered what to do. Weinberg and Bardacke got out of the truck, crossed the police line, and met with Oakland Police Chief Edward M. Toothman. Weinberg and Bardacke could not persuade Toothman to let the march proceed into Oakland. So they returned to the sound truck and told the other VDC leaders. A fierce debate ensued about what to do; they voted 5-4 to turn back into Berkeley.|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} of Arrhenius and Eyring reaction rate models for describing microcircuit aging characteristics {{as a function}} of junction temperature and applied voltage was evaluated. The results of a matrix of accelerated life tests with a single metal oxide semiconductor microcircuit operated at six different combinations of temperature and voltage were used to evaluate the models. A total of 450 devices from two different lots were tested at ambient temperatures between 200 C and 250 C and applied voltages between 5 Vdc and <b>15</b> <b>Vdc.</b> A statistical analysis of the surface related failure data resulted in bimodal failure distributions comprising two lognormal distributions; a 'freak' distribution observed early in time, and a 'main' distribution observed later in time. The Arrhenius model was shown to provide a good description of device aging {{as a function of}} temperature at a fixed voltage. The Eyring model also appeared to provide a reasonable description of main distribution device aging as a function of temperature and voltage. Circuit diagrams are shown...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{tangential}} drive (Tdrive) polysilicon, {{linear actuator}} is presented which produces large magnitude tangential motion by flexing a microstructure in an essentially straight line with moderate input voltage. These devices have been designed, fabricated, and successfully tested to have substantial displacements even for static positioning. The working {{principle of the}} T-drive is that the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between a fixed bar and a free bar are converted to large amplitude tangential motion by the parallelogram flexural suspension of the free bar. Operating devices are capable of tangential displacements as great as 32 pm. This displacement is stable and easily varied, since the tangential displacement can be controlled by adjusting the potential between the fixed electrode and the traversing bar. Static displacements are detectable for voltages as low as <b>15</b> <b>VDC.</b> Typical T-drives have free bars 200 m long, 12 pn wide, with flexural suspensions 450 pn long and 2 pm wide. All component thicknesses are 2 pn. Theoretical models for both the flexural suspension and electrostatic forces have been derived and they predict the relation between tangential displacement and excitation voltage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Energetic {{autonomy}} of a hydraulic-based mobile field robot requires a power source capable of both electrical and hydraulic power generation. While the hydraulic power {{is used for}} locomotion, the electric power {{is used for the}} computer, sensors and other peripherals. An internal combustion engine was used as the prime mover due to the high energy density of gasoline. The primary specification for this hybrid Hydraulic-Electric Power Unit (HEPU) is that it must output constant pressure hydraulic power and constant voltage electric power. An on-board computer uses a pressure sensor and a speed sensor to regulate the pressure and voltage by modulating a hydraulic solenoid valve and an engine throttle. The speed regulation also results in a system noise with predictable frequency band which allows for optimal muffler design. A novel characteristic of this power source is its cooling system in which hydraulic fluid is used to cool the engine cylinders. Several hydraulic-electric power units were built and successfully demonstrated on the Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX) shown on bleex. me. berkeley. edu/bleex. htm. A prototype power unit weighs 27 Kg, outputs 2. 3 kW (3. 0 hp) hydraulic power at 6. 9 MPa (1000 psi), and 220 W of electric power at <b>15</b> <b>VDC.</b> Index Terms- mobile power sources, hydraulic power, power generation, field and service robotics, BLEEX I...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the design of}} a low-cost broadband low-noise amplifier (LNA). This LNA is designed to provide robust performance at L-band and above even in the presence of strong interference from broadcast signals in lower-frequency bands. The completed LNA is shown in Figure 1 and its specifications are summarized in Figures 2 and 3. Figure 4 shows a schematic of the LNA electrical design. The design uses Agilent’s ATF- 34143 low-noise pseudomorphic high-electron-mobility transistor (PHEMT) [1], following a design strategy described in [2]. DC power (6 - <b>15</b> <b>VDC)</b> is accepted through the RF output connector using the “bias-tee ” method. A parts list is given in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the assembled circuit on its printed circuit board (PCB). The enclosure is constructed from PCB material. The PCB was obtained from ExpressPCB ∗. The PCB was designed using ExpressPCB’s proprietary PCB layout software. The PCB layout is shown in Figures 7 and 8. Note that the raw PCB consists of four sections: (1) The main PCB for the electronics, which doubles as the top cover, (2) The bottom cover, which is mostly ground plane, and (3) two identical sections which are used as spacers between (1) and (2). The dimensions of the dimensions of the raw PCB are 3. 8 -in by 2. 5 -in, which allows ExpressPCB’s low-cost “MiniBoard ” service to be used. The laminate is 0. 062 -in FR- 4 epoxy glass with a dielectric constant specified to be between 4. 2 and 5. 0. The LNA is assembled as follows...|$|E
40|$|A {{versatile}} electronic timing-and-control unit, denoted a rotorcraft strobe controller, {{has been}} developed for use in controlling stroboscopes, lasers, video cameras, and other instruments for capturing still images of rotating machine parts especially helicopter rotors. This unit {{is designed to be}} compatible with a variety of sources of input shaftangle or timing signals and to be capable of generating a variety of output signals suitable for triggering instruments characterized by different input-signal specifications. It is also designed to be flexible and reconfigurable in that it can be modified and updated through changes in its control software, without need to change its hardware. Figure 1 is a block diagram of the rotorcraft strobe controller. The control processor is a high-density complementary metal oxide semiconductor, singlechip 8 -bit microcontroller. It is connected to a 32 K x 8 nonvolatile static random-access memory (RAM) module. Also connected to the control processor is a 32 K 8 electrically programmable read-only-memory (EPROM) module, which is used to store the control software. Digital logic support circuitry is implemented in a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). A 240 x 128 -dot, 40 - character 16 -line liquid-crystal display (LCD) module serves as a graphical user interface; the user provides input through a 16 -key keypad mounted next to the LCD. A 12 -bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) generates a 0 -to- 10 -V ramp output signal used as part of a rotor-blade monitoring system, while the control processor generates all the appropriate strobing signals. Optocouplers are used to isolate all input and output digital signals, and optoisolators are used to isolate all analog signals. The unit is designed to fit inside a 19 -in. (. 48 -cm) rack-mount enclosure. Electronic components are mounted on a custom printed-circuit board (see Figure 2). Two power-conversion modules on the printedcircuit board convert AC power to + 5 VDC and <b>15</b> <b>VDC,</b> respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of new satellites generate electrical power using photovoltaic solar arrays and store energy in batteries for use during eclipse periods. Careful regulation of battery charging during insolation can greatly increase the expected lifetime of the satellite. The battery charge regulator is usually custom designed for each satellite and its specific mission. Economic {{competition in the}} small satellite market requires battery charge regulators that are lightweight, efficient, inexpensive, and modular enough {{to be used in}} a wide variety of satellites. A new battery charge regulator topology has been developed at the NASA Lewis Research Center to address these needs. The new regulator topology uses industry-standard dc-dc converters and a unique interconnection to provide size, weight, efficiency, fault tolerance, and modularity benefits over existing systems. A transformer-isolated buck converter is connected such that the high input line is connected in series with the output. This "bypass connection" biases the converter's output onto the solar array voltage. Because of this biasing, the converter only processes the fraction of power necessary to charge the battery above the solar array voltage. Likewise, the same converter hookup can be used to regulate the battery output to the spacecraft power bus with similar fractional power processing. The advantages of this scheme are: 1) Because only a fraction of the power is processed through the dc-dc converter, the single- stage conversion efficiency is 94 to 98 percent; 2) Costly, high-efficiency dc-dc converters are not necessary for high end-to-end system efficiency; 3) The system is highly fault tolerant because the bypass connection will still deliver power if the dc-dc converter fails; and 4) The converters can easily be connected in parallel, allowing higher power systems to be built from a common building block. This new technology will be spaceflight tested in the Photovoltaic Regulator Kit Experiment (PRKE) on TRW's Small Spacecraft Technology Initiative (SSTI) satellite scheduled for launch in 1996. This experiment uses commercial dc-dc converters (28 to <b>15</b> <b>Vdc)</b> and additional control circuitry to regulate current to a battery load. The 60 -W, 87 - percent efficiency converters can control 180 W of power at an efficiency of 94 percent in the new configuration.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{prolonged}} {{exposure to the}} LEO space environment and charge-enhanced contamination on optical, thermal, and electron emission and transport properties of common spacecraft materials has been investigated by comparing pre- and post-flight characterization measurements. The State of Utah Space Environment 2 ̆ 6 Contamination Study (SUSpECS) deployed in March 2008 on board the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE- 6) payload, was exposed for 18 months on {{the exterior of the}} International Space Station (ISS), before retrieval in September 2009. A total of 165 samples were mounted on three separate SUSpECS panels on the ram and wake sides on the ISS. Electron-, ion-, and photon-induced electron emission yield curves, crossover energies and emission spectra, resistivity, dielectric strength, optical and electron microscopy, UV/VIS/NIR reflection spectroscopy, and emissivity were tested for pre-flight SUSpECS samples in their pristine conditions. Results reported here focus on the comparison of two specific sets of materials samples. The first comparison focuses on six sets of four identical samples [Au, Al, carbon-loaded polyimide (Dupont Black Kapton 100 XC), and carbon-loaded polyester (Sheldahl Thick Film Black) ]. Two sample sets were located on the top and bottom tiers of a three-tiered sample panel designed to provide variable atomic oxygen and UV exposure. The four other sample sets were located on the wake side sample panel, with sets biased {{for the duration of the}} flight at 0 VDC, + 5 VDC, - 5 VDC, and - <b>15</b> <b>VDC,</b> respectively. The biased sample configuration was designed to approximate typical conditions of materials subject to spacecraft charging. Positively charged components will typically charge to only a few volts positive. By contrast, negatively charged materials can charge to large voltages. Biases of - 5 V and - 15 V were chosen as representative of modest and more extreme negative charging. The second comparison reported here focused on four materials [carbon-loaded polyimide, polyester (Dupont Mylar), Al 2 O 3 (sapphire), and SiO 2 (quartz) ] that showed some of the most pronounced environmentally–induced changes in optical properties. Samples of each material on the wake and three-tiered sample panels were exposed to a complex environment during the flight. Identical witness samples were also exposed to a simulated subset of the environment in the Characterization of Combined Orbital Surface Effects (CCOSE) space environment test chamber at the USAF Arnold Engineering Development Center to mimic the space exposure profile. The primary optical characterization methods employed for the comparison were UV/VIS/NIR and FTIR transmission of the sapphire and quartz and UV/VIS/NIR reflectance of the polyimide and polyester. Comparison of pre-flight, post-flight, and simulated exposure samples served two primary purposes: to investigate the validity of simulated environmental testing methods and to help distinguish the effects of specific components of the complex space environment that samples were simultaneously exposed to during the flight...|$|E
