50|$|The Type <b>1</b> <b>Communication</b> Scanner was {{an entry}} level device which {{presented}} an interrupt on every received bit. Transmission also required an interrupt for every bit.

The aggregate bandwidth was restricted due to the heavy processing requirements.|$|E

50|$|Three {{paradigms}} can {{be considered}} when examining non-native speakers in a US culture: <b>1)</b> <b>communication</b> apprehension, 2) self-perceived communication competency, and 3) social inclination to communicate. Insufficiencies in oral communication courses for English {{as a second language}} learners and appropriate curriculum contribute to the lack of oral communication competencies. These apprehensions contribute to the failure of some foreign students. In a qualitative study among Chinese graduate students, 94% of students reported their academic experience was negative and not enjoyable due to tremendous language barriers. Additionally, study abroad programs were thought to be a cure all for language and cultural barriers. However, students often arrive to their host countries linguistically underprepared.|$|E

Skills included using a 'speaker-listener' technique, establishing ground rules, identifying hidden issues, and maintaining friendship and fun in the relationship. The focus on self-care and anger management included such strategies as using time-out to prevent escalation.

50|$|The Governor-General's Flight was a Royal Australian Air Force {{transport}} unit. The Governor-General's Flight {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Canberra on 4 April 1945. The unit {{was equipped with}} an Avro York named 'Endeavour', an Avro Anson and a Percival Proctor. Although the Flight initially only provided transport for the Governor-General of Australia its role was later expanded to include carrying the Prime Minister and other dignitaries. The Governor-General's Flight was disbanded on 10 July 1947 and No. <b>1</b> <b>Communication</b> Unit assumed responsibility for VIP transport. The Flight was re-raised on 1 July 1948 equipped with a B-24 Liberator and a Dakota. The Flight was disbanded {{for a second and}} final time on 1 October 1950 with the VIP transport role being transferred to No. 36 Squadron.|$|E
5000|$|Having {{offered his}} {{services}} to the Australian government on his return from New Guinea, Pentland rejoined the RAAF on 17 June 1940. He undertook the course at Central Flying School in Camden, New South Wales, and was posted as an instructor to elementary flying training schools in eastern Australia, including Brisbane, Tamworth, Temora, Bundaberg, and Lowood. Addressed by a young pilot at one school as [...] "Pop", Pentland responded {{in front of the}} large audience, [...] "I'm sorry son, but I don't remember sleeping with your mother". He was promoted to flight lieutenant in October 1941, and joined No. <b>1</b> <b>Communication</b> Flight in June 1942. Based in Victoria at Laverton and, later, Essendon, it was primarily engaged in army and naval cooperation, and operated as far afield as the Northern Territory and New Guinea.|$|E
50|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} flight lieutenant on 1 August 1943, McAloney {{was sent}} to the Directorate of Technical Services from November as the specialist officer on American and gas turbine jet engines. The following November, he was dispatched to Dutch New Guinea to rectify issues being experienced with Pratt & Whitney engines in operations by aircraft of the 1st Tactical Air Force. He returned to Australia and his position with Technical Services in December, and saw out the remainder of the war in this post. McAloney decided he wanted to remain in the Air Force on the cessation of hostilities, and subsequently sought a permanent commission in the post-war RAAF. Having continued on a short-service commission in the meantime, his application was ultimately approved in September 1948 and he was granted the substantive rank of flight lieutenant. His younger brother, Robert Simpson McAloney, also saw service with the RAAF in the Second World War. He had enlisted in late 1937 and rose to the rank of warrant officer before his discharge in 1946, his final posting being to No. <b>1</b> <b>Communication</b> Unit.|$|E

50|$|Culturally {{relevant}} {{teaching in}} mathematics was developed initially {{to support the}} success of African-American students, frequently poorly served by the American public school system which {{has a long history}} of educational inequality. The liquor store example provided above is shared by Tate as an example of culturally relevant teaching, but might likewise be seen to embody the tenets of critical pedagogy. He cites six core practices of the teacher from the example that make her work culturally relevant: (<b>1)</b> <b>communication</b> between students, teacher, and outside entities, (2) cooperative group work, (3) investigative research throughout the learning process, (4) questioning content, people, and institutions, (5) open-ended problem solving connected to student realities, and (6) social action. While the practices listed by Tate resonate profoundly with those of critical mathematics pedagogy, the difference (if there is any) is in the goals of the two approaches. The focus of culturally relevant teaching is on the empowerment and liberation of a cultural or racial group, whereas the goals of critical pedagogy include empowerment and liberation of individuals as well as groups, in the face of any form of oppression, not only cultural or racial oppression.|$|E
5000|$|After the war, No. 1 AD was {{responsible}} for introducing the first jets into RAAF service. A Gloster Meteor made its first flight in Australia from Laverton in 1946. By May 1947, No. 1 AD had assembled the first de Havilland Vampire jet in Australia for its maiden flight. In October the same year, the first helicopter in RAAF service, a Sikorsky S-51, arrived at the depot. That month, No. 1 AD also completed fitting out a Douglas Dakota with an office, a lounge suite, and a kitchenette for service as the Governor-General's VIP transport, operated out of Laverton by No. <b>1</b> <b>Communication</b> Unit. In 1950, the depot received the sole high-performance piston-engined CAC CA-15 to be built, which {{had been sent to}} be [...] "converted to components" [...] (scrapped). No. 1 AD took delivery of the first Australian-built English Electric Canberra jet bomber in July 1953. Shortly afterwards, it modified the three Canberras of No. 1 Long Range Flight prior to the unit taking part in the 1953 London-to-Christchurch air race. In September that year, the first Australian-built Sabre jet fighter was delivered.|$|E
50|$|The Communication Centre is {{staffed by}} {{a minimum of}} 7 Operators and <b>1</b> <b>Communication</b> Center Shift Supervisor (CCSS) on four 24 hours platoons, {{dispatching}} WEMS and WFD. All Communication Operators are responsible to taking 9-1-1 calls, confirming the {{address and phone number}} of the emergency, obtaining all specific relevant information about the call, establishing through security questions if the scene is safe for field providers to attend and establishing the priority of the call (emergency or non-emergency). The 9-1-1 call taker then forwards the information to the EMS or Fire dispatchers (or both) who are responsible for assigning the call to the appropriate crews/units as well as monitor all vehicles in the field. Meanwhile, the call taker may stay on the line until help arrives on-scene and will give pre-arrival instructions to the patient. These include assisting/instructing the caller with performing Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), or instructing appropriate chest pain patients to self-administer Aspirin (ASA). The WFPS also is respondsible for the operations of the WRHA's Inter Facility Transport system. The booking and dispatching of ambulances and stretcher car services in the movement of patients between care facilities within the cities 6 hospitals and many clinics. This secondary dispatch center is staffed 24/7 with 3-4 communication operators who interchange with the 911 center on a rotational basis.|$|E
