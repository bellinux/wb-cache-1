40|$|Recent {{innovations}} {{may lead}} to magnetic sensors that are smaller, more sensitive, and/or cost less than current magnetometers. Examples of this are the chip scale atomic magnetometer, magnetic tunnel junctions with MgO barriers, and a device for minimizing the effect of <b>1</b> <b>f</b> <b>noise,</b> the microelectromechanical system (MEMS) flux concentrator. In the chip scale atomic magnetometer, researchers {{have been able to}} fabricate the light source, optics, heater, optical cell, and photodiode detector in a stack that passes through a silicon wafer. Theoretical and subsequent experimental work has led to the observation of magnetoresistance values of 400 % at room temperature in magnetic tunnel junctions with MgO barriers. This large magnetoresistance occurs because electrons in the majority band can tunnel more easily through the MgO barrier than electrons in the minority band. The MEMS flux concentrator has the potential to increase the sensitivity of magnetic sensors at low frequencies by more than an order of magnitude. The MEMS flux concentrator does this by shifting the operating frequency to higher frequencies where the <b>1</b> <b>f</b> <b>noise</b> is much smaller. The shift occurs because the motion of flux concentrators on MEMS flaps modulates the field at kilohertz frequencies at the position of the sensor. Though miniaturization is generally beneficial, trade-offs are necessary because some properties, such as noise, worsen with decreasing size. © 2008 American Vacuum Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Any order {{parameter}} quantifying {{the degree of}} organisation in a physical system can be studied in connection to source extraction algorithms. Independent component analysis (ICA) by minimising the mutual information of the sources falls into that line of thought, since it {{can be interpreted as}} searching components with low complexity. Complexity pursuit, a modification minimising Kolmogorov complexity, is a further example. In this article a specific case of order in complex networks of self-sustained oscillators is discussed, with the objective of recovering original synchronisation pattern between them. The approach is put in relation with ICA. 1 Interactions in complex systems Synchronisation is a commonly encountered phenomenon in complex systems consisting of many interacting nonlinear oscillatory elements, each with a stable limit cycle [1]. Such dynamic systems are present in nature, e. g., nervous systems [2] or chemical oscillators [3], and in technical devices like Josephson’s junction [4]. Inference about the interactions in complex systems is also related to such omnipresent phenomena as self-organisation and the <b>1</b> <b>f</b> <b>noise</b> [5]. The quantification of synchronisation in complex systems from empirical measurements is accompanied with a difficulty: access to the individual oscilla-tors is crucial otherwise spurious synchronisation will be measured [6]. In many fields these are not easily available, but one rather deals with superpositions of several elementary oscillators [7]. Below it is addressed how the original oscil-lators could be regained by postulating a general synchronisation structure for the system. 2 Superpositions and phase synchrony Phase synchrony between two oscillators uj(t) and uk(t) with arbitrary phase lag can be quantified with the phase locking factor (PLF), the circular variance of the phase lag between them.

Additional Lorentzian-shape (<b>1</b> / <b>f</b> 2) <b>noise</b> components were recorded only when nanoelectrodes were bridged by individual 1, 4 benzenediamine molecule. The characteristic frequency of the revealed <b>1</b> / <b>f</b> 2 <b>noise</b> related to a single bridging molecule correlates with the lock-in current amplitudes. The recorded behavior of Lorentzian-shape noise component {{as a function of}} current is interpreted as the manifestation of a dynamic reconfiguration of molecular coupling to the metal electrodes.

From a physical point of view, this ensemble may be useful to describe transitions between different symmetries or to describe the terrace-width distributions of vicinal surfaces. Moreover, its simple form allows one to speed up and increase the efficiency of numerical simulations dealing with large matrix dimensions. We analyze the long-range spectral correlations of this ensemble by means of the delta(n) statistic. We derive an analytical expression for the average power spectrum of this statistic,, based on approximated forms for the two-point cluster function and the spectral form factor. We find that the power spectrum of delta(n) evolves from proportional to 1 / k at nu= 1 to proportional to 1 / k(2) at nu= 0. Relevantly, the transition is not homogeneous with a <b>1</b> / <b>f</b> alpha <b>noise</b> at all scales, but heterogeneous with coexisting <b>1</b> / <b>f</b> and <b>1</b> / f(2) noises.
