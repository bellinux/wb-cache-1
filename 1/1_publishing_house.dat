The thesis includes Kruh's predecessors Východočeské nakladatelství and Jiří Chvojka's <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> in Havlíčkův Brod. Kruh is associated with Jiří Chvojka's <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> only remotely, {{but it is an}} interesting object for comparison of regional <b>publishing</b> <b>houses.</b> There had existed two <b>publishing</b> <b>houses</b> in the east of the Czech Republic, which published the regional literature. Their production extended the complexity of the national literature. This thesis outlines historical figure of Jiří Chvojka and edition policy of his <b>publishing</b> <b>house.</b> Furthermore, I also wrote about Krajské nakladatelství in Hradec Králové, which had been operated from 1950 till 1951. Even at that time it was possible to find an attempt to publishing regional literature. For each <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> is outlined their origin, historical context and part of edition policy. Attention is focused on regionalism and its application to the literature of the Eastern Bohemia. I analyzed the <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> Kruh in relation with former circumstances.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I try to outline running and {{production}} of the contemporary <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> Host. The <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> Host was established in 1990 s' but the magazine Host, whose legacy the <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> carries, has been working for several decades. The <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> Host and the magazine Host have been coexisting simultaneously and shared almost the same editorial team. For that reason it is not quite possible to separate one from the other. In {{the first part of}} this thesis I introduce the initial existential period of the magazine Host from 1920 s' to its samizdat publication in 1980 s'. In the next part I try to ouline the beginning of the <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> Host leaded by Dušan Skála in early 1990 s'. The current shape of the <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> and the magazine has been formed since the second half of 1990 s' under the leadership of Tomáš Reichel and Miroslav Balaštík. In the main part of my thesis I try to describe the contemporary work of the <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> Host which I make mostly through its book production. I also try to point out the transformation of the <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> Host from a narrowly focused <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> to a <b>publishing</b> <b>house</b> whose production can excite even a mass readerʼs interests. The aim of my thesis is primarily to introduce comprehensive description of publishing [...] ...|$|R
