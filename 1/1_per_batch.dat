40|$|Marine {{fish culture}} is a new farming {{opportunity}} for NSW prawn farmers. To address current seed-stock supply issues two Palmers Island brackish-water prawn hatcheries (of Australian and Taiwanese design) were examined for conversion to mulloway (Argyrosomus japonicus) production. Both hatcheries were easily adapted with minimal cost and modification; the Australian design (1062 m 2) was the simplest and cheapest to convert. The Taiwanese design (695 m 2), required more work due to the permanent built-in nature of the concrete tanks, their rectangular shape and drainage. Fingerling output from the Australian hatchery was calculated at 630, 000 × 40 mm (1 g) fingerlings or 150, 000 larger 100 mm (12 g) fingerlings using a single annual hatchery run of 3 or 5 months, respectively, at a water temperature of 20 – 25 °C. The smaller Taiwanese hatchery had a theoretical maximum production of 320, 000 × 40 mm (<b>1</b> g) <b>per</b> <b>batch</b> or 50, 000 × 100 mm (12 g); if pure oxygen {{was used in the}} nursery area this could be increased to 100, 000 × 100 mm. Both hatcheries could operate with 3 to 4 staff and use of these facilities, in conjunction with staff training, would resolve the current poor availability and high cost of juveniles for grow-out...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{treatment}} of waste by incineration is considered an ultimate solution {{in order to get}} rid of waste properly by using the combustible properties of waste and transforming them into inert form and gaseous emission, with the main advantage of a huge reduction in mass and volume of treated waste, destruction of the dangerous components in waste, and obtaining green and clean energy from the exothermal reaction from the completed combustion process. In order to achieve the main goal of incineration, a good design, construction, supervision, and intensive operation and maintenance must be taken into account, especially for the small-scale incinerator. This research will deal with the green, innovative, and eco design and manufacturing technology of a <b>1</b> -ton <b>per</b> <b>batch</b> municipal solid waste (MSW) incinerator. The concept design of the incinerator will focus on the design of the feeding process where only one batch of waste will be discharged into the combustion chamber at one time instead of the semi-feed process, as found in the conventional incinerator. This will ease the operation of the operator and reduce the operating cost. Moreover, the innovative design includes the redesign of combustion air injection into either the primary or secondary combustion chamber in order to achieve the 3 Ts of combustion (time, temperature. and turbulence). This design can eliminate the use of an auxiliary burner in the primary combustion chamber. Rethinking the innovative design of using recirculation hot flue gas for preheating of wet garbage in order to pre-dry the waste before combustion is also taken into account. The manufacturing process of the wall composition as well as other parts of the incinerator are also examined...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect on egg quality of dietary supplementation of Atlantic cod broodstock with the carotenoid astaxanthin (ASTA). Duplicate groups of farm-reared Atlantic cod broodstock were fed either a control diet with no added ASTA, or an ASTA supplemented diet (73. 7 mg/kg dry weight; Carophyll Pink®) for 2 months prior to peak spawning. The results indicated that ASTA uptake into eggs from the broodstock diet was highly efficient. Fish fed the diet supplemented with ASTA produced fewer batches of eggs, but the mean number <b>per</b> <b>batch</b> of eggs spawned/kg female was higher, and numbers of floating eggs and numbers of fertilised eggs per kg female in each batch were also significantly improved. A correlation between the egg ASTA content and fertilisation success of individual batches was identified. This improvement in egg quality demonstrated the potential value of ASTA supplementation of broodstock diets for cod. ASTA supplementation produced a 20 % {{increase in the number}} of eggs <b>per</b> <b>batch</b> spawned, a 37 % increase in the number <b>per</b> <b>batch</b> of floating eggs per kg female and a 47 % increase in the number <b>per</b> <b>batch</b> of fertilised eggs per kg female.

40|$|Post-harvest life of {{strawberries}} is largely limited by Botrytis cinerea infection. It {{is assumed that}} there are two factors influencing the batch keeping quality: the botrytis pressure and the resistance of the strawberry against infection.
