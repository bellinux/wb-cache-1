50|$|Although a {{derivative}} of <b>12-aminododecanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{it is made}} from cyclododecatriene. The triene is hydrogenated to the saturated alkane, cyclododecane. In the process adopted by Evonik Industries, the cycloalkane is oxidized to the ketone cyclododecanone using a boric acid catalyst. The cyclic ketone is converted to the oxime by condensation with hydroxylamine. Under strong acidic conditions and elevated temperatures (115 Â°C), the oxime converts via a Beckmann rearrangement to laurolactam.|$|E
