Small, light weight FTS systems open up applications not possible with the larger and heavier conventional FTS systems. This paper presents a novel approach for the design, implementation and test of a subminiature Flight Terminate System Receiver {{for use in the}} Subminiature Flight Safety System (SFSS). This receiver implements the new digital-based Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) protocol, while maintaining a volume of less than <b>1</b> <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> with power consumption of less than 2 watts. Combining all of the necessary functionality into a small package while meeting the rigorous requirements of the Range Commanders Council (RCC) specifications (EMI, vibration and shock) presented significant challenges.

40|$|Ignition of a nominal- 125 -pound-thrust cold (2000 R) gaseous-hydrogen - liquid-oxygen rocket {{combustor}} with {{chlorine trifluoride}} (hypergolic with hydrogen) and triethylaluminum (hypergolic with oxygen) resulted in consistently smooth starting transients {{for a wide}} range of combustor operating conditions. The combustor exhaust nozzle discharged into air at ambient conditions. Each starting transient consisted of the following sequence of events: injection of the lead main propellant, injection of the igniter chemical, ignition of these two chemicals, injection of the second main propellant, ignition of the two main propellants, increase in chamber pressure to its terminal value, and cutoff of igniter-chemical flow. Smooth ignition was obtained with an ignition delay of less than 100 milliseconds for the reaction of the lead propellant with the igniter chemical using approximately 0. 5 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> (0 - 038 lb) of chlorine trifluoride or <b>1.</b> 0 <b>cubic</b> <b>inch</b> (0 - 031 lb) of triethylaluminum. These quantities of igniter chemical were sufficient to ignite a 20 -percent-fuel hydrogen-oxygen mixture with a delay time of less than 15 milliseconds. Test results indicated that a simple, light weight chemical ignition system for hydrogen-oxygen rocket engines may be possible...|$|R

[...] As the horsepower race continued, Chevrolet introduced a new version of their small block, with 283 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches</b> of displacement and 245 horsepower.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1999 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Instrumentation and Telemetry Departments at Sandia National Laboratories {{have been}} instrumenting earth penetrators for over thirty years. Recorded {{acceleration}} data {{is used to}} quantify penetrator performance. Penetrator testing has become more difficult as desired impact velocities have increased. This results in the need for small-scale test vehicles and miniature instrumentation. A miniature recorder will allow penetrator diameters to significantly decrease, opening the window of testable parameters. Full-scale test vehicles will also benefit from miniature recorders by using a less intrusive system to instrument internal arming, fusing, and firing components. This single channel concept is the latest design in an ongoing effort to miniaturize the size and reduce the power requirement of acceleration instrumentation. A micro-controller/memory based system provides the data acquisition, signal conditioning, power regulation, and data storage. This architecture allows the recorder, including both sensor and electronics, to occupy a volume of less than <b>1.</b> 5 <b>cubic</b> <b>inches,</b> draw less than 200 mW of power, and record 15 kHz data up to 40, 000 gs.
