40|$|Measures of {{residual}} risk are developed as extension of measures of risk. They view a random variable {{of interest in}} concert with an auxiliary random vector that helps to manage, predict, and mitigate the risk in the original variable. Residual risk can be exempli ed as a quanti cation of the improved situation faced by a hedging investor {{compared to that of}} a single-asset investor, but the notion reaches further with deep connections emerging with forecasting and generalized regression. We establish the fundamental properties in this framework and show that measures {{of residual}} risk along with generalized regression can play central roles in the development of risk-tuned approximations of random variables, in tracking of statistics, and in estimation of the risk of conditional random variables. The paper ends with dual expressions for measures of residual risk, which lead to further insights and a new class of distributionally robust optimization models. <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant FA 9550 - 11 - <b>1</b> - 0206 <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant F 1 ATAO 1194 GOO <b>1</b> <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant F 4 FGA 04094 G 003 DARPA grant HR 0011412251 <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant FA 9550 - 11 - <b>1</b> - 0206 <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant F 1 ATAO 1194 GOO <b>1</b> <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> Air Force Office of Scientific Research grant F 4 FGA 04094 G 003 DARPA grant HR 001141225...|$|R

40|$|Background: GAS(Streptococcus pyogenes) is {{a genetically}} diverse human {{pathogen}} having > 150 serotypes. Serotype M 89 strains {{are a common}} cause of GAS pharyngeal and invasive infections. Recent studies indicate M 89 strains may be increasing in prevalence. Over the last 15 years in Italy, two large epidemic outbreaks were caused by macrolide resistant M 89 strains. M 89 epidemic strains differed in gene content encoding virulence factors and macrolide resistance. We used comparative genomics to assess serotype M 89 genetic diversity and its contribution to GAS pathogenesis. Methods:Next-generation DNA sequencing was conducted for 22 isolates (Italy = 5, Canada = 1, New Zealand = <b>1,</b> <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> A. = 15). Complete genomes were determined for 1 Italian and <b>1</b> <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> strain. Polymorphisms were identified genome-wide for the cohort and used to infer genetic relationships. Results:The genome of Italian strain 11610 is 1, 709, 407 bp and lacks prophages. Italian epidemic isolates differed pairwise by ~ 32 core-genome SNPs. The genome of <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> strain MGAS 11027 is 1, 786, 881 bp and has 2 prophages encoding secreted virulence factors. <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> M 89 strains differed pairwise by ~ 397 SNPs. Italian M 89 <b>s</b> differed from <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> M 89 s by ~ 2064 SNPs. SNPs among <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> M 89 <b>s,</b> and differing <b>U.</b> <b>S.</b> from Italian M 89 s, were nonrandomly clustered. Conclusions:SNPs among the M 89 strains exceeded that among other GAS serotypes. Most SNPs were attributed to discrete recombination events involving genes encoding virulence factors including surface adhesins, antimicrobial peptides, and secreted anti-immune response proteins. These findings demonstrate that genetic recombination strongly contributes to diversification of M 89 pathogenic capacity...|$|R
