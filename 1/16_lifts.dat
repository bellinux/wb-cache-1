40|$|The {{design of}} {{intermediate}} turbine ducts {{has become increasingly}} challenging and important. This {{is due to the}} trend of increasing the by-pass ratio (BPR) of turbo-fan engines. A high BPR leads to the need for more aggressive turbine duct, which implies a higher aspect ratio and/or an increased area ratio. Expanding the current turbine duct design space toward more aggressive configurations requires detailed flow analysis. In the present work CFD-based non-axisymmetric endwall shape optimization has been used to obtain a state-of-the-art duct design. It is shown that the inclusion of optimization in the design process can lead to benefits both in weight and performance of the component. The aim of the presented work has been to optimize the hub endwall of an intermediate turbine duct with <b>16</b> <b>lifting</b> vanes...|$|R

2500|$|The HS.141 {{design was}} a jet {{airliner}} of all-metal construction with a T-tail and a low-mounted swept wing with a quarter-chord sweepback of 28degrees. The design featured two wing-mounted [...] "cruise" [...] engines and <b>16</b> <b>lift</b> fan engines mounted in sponsons {{either side of}} the fuselage (eight per side). The engines under main consideration were the Rolls-Royce RB.220 turbofan for forward propulsion and the Rolls-Royce RB.202, a high bypass ratio lift fan engine using technology developed for the Rolls-Royce RB.162 lift jet. Both engines were themselves design studies by Rolls-Royce and it was feared that there would be delays in their development due to the company's problems at the time. One new engine type also considered for main propulsion was the 'SNECMA M.56', which became the CFM International CFM56. Variations using fewer lift fan engines for STOL operations only were also studied as it was realised that the engines could account for 15% of the total weight of the aircraft and 35% of the final cost.|$|R

50|$|Park City Mountain Resort {{is located}} 34 mi east of {{downtown}} Salt Lake City, in Park City, Utah. It was opened on December 21, 1963, as Treasure Mountain by United Park City Mines, the last surviving mining company in Park City, with funds {{from a federal}} government program meant to revive the economically depressed town. When it originally opened, it boasted the longest gondola in the United States, {{as well as a}} double chairlift, a J-bar lift, base and summit lodges, and a nine-hole golf course. A special Skier's Subway was used to transport skiers nearly 2.5 mi into the mountain through the pitch-black Spiro Tunnel on a mine train, where skiers then boarded a mining elevator that lifted them 1750 ft to the surface, from there they had access to the entire mountain. Treasure Mountain's name was changed to the Park City Ski Area for its fourth season of 1966-67, and eventually it became known as the Park City Mountain Resort. The resort has grown to include eight peaks and nine bowls, with 3300 acres of skiing and <b>16</b> <b>lifts.</b>|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the lifts}} and ski slopes {{are located on}} the {{shouldering}} mountains Doss del Sabion and Monte Spinale. There is however a long modern high capacity lift that goes from Madonna del Campiglio right up the main chain of the Brenta Group to Passo Grostè at 2444 meters. In all, the Ski Area Campiglio Dolomiti di Brenta-Val di Sole-Val Rendena can offer around 150 km of piste on 98 ski slopes of all difficulty grades, facilitated by 63 lifts. On {{the east side of}} the Brenta Group the ski slopes are located on the Paganella. The Paganella Ski Area can offer around 50 km of piste, facilitated by <b>16</b> <b>lifts.</b> The skiing area above Molveno at Pradel is very small but offers a splendid view into the central part of the Brenta Group.Most hikers come to the Brenta Group to hike along the Via della Bocchette and connected vie ferrate, like Sentiero Castiglioni. A completion of the whole south-north itinerary departing from Rif. Agostini along the Sentiero Castiglioni, Sentiero dell'Ideale, Bocchette Centrali, Bocchette Alte, Sentiero Benini and Sentiero Costanzi, ending at Rifugio Peller would require in total approximately 28 walking/climbing hours. Therefore, an entire network of Alpine huts exists above the 2000 meter altitude, mostly operated by the SAT as part of the Club Alpino Italiano: Several privately owned mountain huts can be found at lower altitudes. Signed mountain paths cross the entire Brenta Dolomites, giving access to much frequented areas of these mountains. Hikers can choose between very challenging itineraries like the Bochette Alte or less demanding alternatives but should always come well prepared with the right equipment, safety gear and precautions against sudden weather changes. A few small shelter huts (It.:bivacco) have been erected at high and remote altitudes: Bivacco Castiglioni (3135 m) at the summit of Crozzon di Brenta, Bivacco Bonvecchio (2790 m) 300 m north of the Cima Sassara, and Bivacco Costanzi at 2365 m on the Sasso Rosso. Some peripheral subgroups, like Ghez, Daino, Vallon and Campa are far away from all the touristic attention - even on an August day. These wild remote areas pose their own specific challenges and a hike in these areas requires cautious preparation.Those areas, however, are somehow less interesting for the vertical rock climbers because of the fragility of the more calcareous rock. For these climbers the peaks and pinnacles of the Central Chain - made up of solid Dolomia principale- remain the main attraction. Challenging historic itineraries like the Via Preuss and Diedro Fehrmann on Campanile Basso, the Via Schulz and the Pilastro die Francesi on the Crozzon di Brenta, the Via Videsott on the Cima Margherita, the Via Dibona on the Croz dell'Altissimo and so many other classic routes and their endless variants attract many climbers every year. The Brenta group has become also popular with mountain bikers and has become the last decade a renown base for paragliders. Former European Champion (2006, 2010) and World Cup Silver Medalist (2011) Paragliding Luca Donini is from Molveno.|$|E

40|$|Population-based {{data from}} 10 centres in Burma, Thailand, China and Vietnam, have been {{analysed}} to assess those {{social and environmental}} factors which {{may be associated with}} pre-term delivery and low birth-weight. The philosophy behind the study was that if the same association was found in different countries, then the association may be causal; if associations differed in the various countries, then causality was unlikely. The major findings were as follows: a strong association between low birth-weight and pre-term delivery and the unmarried state (RR 1. 64, 1. 39), a consistent reduced risk of pre-term delivery when the father was in a managerial post (RR 0. 77), an excess risk of pre-term delivery if the mother was a housewife (RR 1. <b>16),</b> <b>lifting</b> heavy objects at the time of quickening (RR 1. 63) or frequently bending and stooping at the time of quickening (1. 15). Strong associations were found with both paternal and maternal education levels but these were strongest for the mother's education level. The association was far stronger for pre-term delivery than for low birth-weight and it is assumed that the low birth-weight effect is secondary to pre-term delivery. The only variation with maternal age concerned an excess of low birth-weight among teenage mothers, but not of pre-term delivery, and an excess of low birth-weight but not pre-term delivery among mothers with small head circumferences or small arm circumferences. We conclude that the aetiology of growth retardation and pre-term delivery are probably different in South-east Asia, and point out the need to elucidate further the strong variation with education level. low birth-weight pre-delivery social factors...|$|R
