2500|$|A {{report on}} the track {{and its impact on}} traffic delays and {{congestion}} in the City of Glen Eira was presented to the Glen Eira City Council on 22 July 2008 following a meeting between representatives of council and VicRoads on 27 May 2008. VicRoads advised the council that it was unlikely a third track would be installed for the [...] "entire length" [...] of the line. The more likely outcome would be that there would be three tracks for some sections and the existing two in others. It said modelling to deal with subsequent road traffic congestion was to be undertaken on three options: Grade separation on (<b>1)</b> <b>none</b> of Glen Eira's roads, (2) all of Glen Eira's roads and (3) some of Glen Eira's roads. The third option would have the effect of channelling further traffic volumes on to any roads that were grade separated from the railway lines. The council concluded that it was not in the interest of VicRoads or the council to have intolerable levels of traffic congestion, and that it expected there would be detailed impact statements prepared, public submissions sought and the range of options examined by an independent panel appointed by the Transport Minister.|$|E

50|$|A Finnish {{study of}} {{return to work}} in {{patients}} with spinal stenosis treated by surgery found that: (<b>1)</b> <b>none</b> of the patients who had retired before the operation returned to work afterward. (2) The variables that predicted postoperative ability to work for women were: being fit {{to work at the}} time of operation, age < 50 years at the time of operation, and duration of lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms < 2 years. (3) For men, these variables were: being fit to work at the time of operation, age < 50 years at the time of operation, no prior surgery, and the extent of the surgical procedure equal to or less than one laminectomy. Women's and men's working capacity do not differ after lumbar spinal stenosis operation. If the aim is to maximize working capacity, then, when a lumbar spinal stenosis operation is indicated, it should be performed without delay. In lumbar spinal stenosis patients who are > 50 years old and on sick leave, it is unrealistic to expect that they will return to work. Therefore, after such an extensive surgical procedure, re-education of patients for lighter jobs could improve the chances of these patients returning to work.|$|E
