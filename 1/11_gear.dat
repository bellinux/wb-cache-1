40|$|Several NASA {{missions}} suffered {{failures and}} anomalies due to problems in applying space mechanisms technology to specific projects. Research shows that engineers often lack either adequate knowledge of mechanism design or sufficient {{understanding of how}} mechanisms affect sensitive systems. The Space Mechanisms Project conducted a Lessons Learned study and published a Space Mechanisms Handbook to help space industry engineers avoid recurring design, qualification, and application problems. The Space Mechanisms Handbook written at the NASA Glenn Research Center details the state-of-the-art in space mechanisms design as of 1998. NASA's objective in developing this Space Mechanisms Handbook was to provide readily accessible information on such areas as space mechanisms design, mechanical component availability and use, testing and qualification of mechanical systems, and a listing of worldwide space mechanisms experts and testing facilities in the United States. This handbook has been expanded into a two-volume CD-ROM set in an Adobe Acrobat format. In addition to the handbook, the CD's include (1) the two volume Space Mechanisms Lessons Learned Study, (2) proceedings from all the NASA hosted Aerospace Mechanisms Symposia held through the year 2000, (3) the Space Materials Handbook, (4) the Lubrication Handbook for the Space Industry, (5) the Structural & Mechanical Systems Long-Life Assurance Design Guidelines, (6) the Space Environments and Effects Source-Book, (7) the Spacecraft Deployable Appendages manual, (8) the Fastener Design Manual, (9) A Manual for Pyrotechnic Design, Development and Qualification, (10) the Report on Alternative Devices to Pyrotechnics on Spacecraft, and (<b>11)</b> <b>Gearing</b> (a manual).

2500|$|In {{the context}} of {{mountain}} biking the term compact crankset, or micro drive, refers to smaller triple cranksets, giving a small benefit in weight {{at the expense of}} increased wear and also giving the bike better clearance over obstacles. [...] Typical ratios would be 22/32/44 teeth as opposed to 28/38/48 or 24/36/46 teeth. [...] These would be used with smaller cassettes (Generally cassettes are available with <b>11</b> tooth minimum <b>gear</b> sizes for compact chainsets while standard chainsets were designed for cassettes with a 13 or 14 tooth top gear), giving the same overall ratio. Compact chainrings have been the dominant standard for mountain bike cranks since the mid nineties.|$|R
25|$|In recent years, bicycle designs have trended towards {{increased}} specialization, as {{the number}} of casual, recreational and commuter cyclists has grown. For these groups, the industry responded with the hybrid bicycle, sometimes marketed as a city bike, cross bike, or commuter bike. Hybrid bicycles combine elements of road racing and mountain bikes, though the term is applied {{to a wide variety of}} bicycle types. Hybrid bicycles and commuter bicycles can range from fast and light racing-type bicycles with flat bars and other minimal concessions to casual use, to wider-tired bikes designed for primarily for comfort, load-carrying, and increased versatility over a range of different road surfaces. Enclosed hub gears have become popular again - now with up to 8, <b>11</b> or 14 <b>gears</b> - for such bicycles due to ease of maintenance and improved technology.|$|R
40|$|The {{southern}} coast of Ionian Calabria was recently {{recognized as the}} main nesting area of the loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta in Italy. The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the fishing fleet in this area in terms of number of boats, economic situation, social aspects and impact on sea turtle specimens and target species. A multidisciplinary approach was essential to understand how the conservation problems of C. caretta are linked to various characteristics of the fishing fleet. Our data showed a vast discrepancy between the official census and the actual number of boats fishing in the area: 87 % of the observed artisanal vessels lacked a required registration number, and thus were fishing illegally. This has caused serious social problems that worsened over the summer of 2007, when the presence of non-local registered vessels, using drift nets, generated a spatial conflict with the local artisanal fishermen. We identified <b>11</b> fishing <b>gears</b> used in the area and four of them were studied with on board observations: illegal drift nets, trammel nets, bottom longlines and longlines targeting swordfish. The total number of turtles caught during the summer in the area by longliners targeting swordfish was calculated to be 500 (± 180 SE). In addition the presence of drift netters had a negative impact from an ecological and social point of view...|$|R
40|$|Rowing is demanding, in part, because drag on {{the oars}} {{increases}} as the square of their speed. Hence, as muscles shorten faster, their force capacity falls, whereas drag rises. How do frogs resolve this dilemma to swim rapidly? We predicted that shortening velocity cannot exceed a terminal velocity where muscle and fluid torques balance. This terminal velocity, which is below V max, depends on gear ratio (GR = outlever/inlever) and webbed foot area. Perhaps such properties of swimmers are 'tuned', enabling shortening speeds of approximately 0. 3 Vmax for maximal power. Predictions were tested using a 'musculo-robotic' Xenopus laevis foot driven either by a living in vitro or computational in silico plantaris longus muscle. Experiments verified predictions. Our principle finding is that GR ranges from 11. 5 to 20 near the predicted optimum for rowing (GR ≈ <b>11).</b> However, <b>gearing</b> influences muscle power more strongly than foot area. No single morphology is optimal for producing muscle power. Rather, the 'optimal' GR decreases with foot size, implying that rowing ability need not compromise jumping (and vice versa). Thus, despite our neglect of additional forces (e. g. added mass), our model predicts pairings of physiological and morphological properties to confer effective rowing. Beyond frogs, the model may apply {{across a range of}} size and complexity from aquatic insects to human-powered rowing. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

40|$|Effect of {{temperature}} and time on morphology of CuO nanoparticle during synthesis In the past decades, many {{methods have been}} developed to synthesize zero- dimensional nanoparticles, quasi–one–dimensional (1 D) CuO nanostructures, such as metal organic deposition technique, microwave irradiation, sol-gel-like dip technique, reverse micelle-assisted route, chemical method, and simple template free solution route.

40|$|The {{marine fishery}} in Kenya is {{predominantly}} small-scale and artisanal with about 11, 000 fishers intensely fishing near shore coastal reefs using minimally selective fishing gears. A large majority (88 %) of fishers use outdated {{equipment such as}} basket traps, beach seines, hand lines (hook and lines), fence traps, gillnets, spearguns and cast nets. Handmade canoes propelled by paddles (kasia) or sail power are used to access offshore waters, while only a few fishers have motorized boats. Although fishers along this coast know and express the potential of offshore fishing, {{most of them are}} disempowered and unable to access any of the largely untapped offshore pelagic resources. Using a unique dataset from four distinct coastal areas: Funzi-Shirazi bay area, Diani-Chale area, Mombasa-Kilifi north coast area and the Malindi-Ungwana bay area, containing species level length frequency catch data from the multi-gear and multi-species fishery, abundance of specific species, gear use comparisons in various regions, catch per unit effort and total catch estimate over a nine year period (2001 – 2009) were evaluated. Despite high diversity in the fishery, five species (Lethrinus lentjan, Siganus sutor, Leptoscarus vaigiensis, Lethrinus harak and Parupeneus macronemus) represented over 75 % of the catch. A total of <b>11</b> legitimate <b>gears</b> were observed in this coastal artisanal fishery with basket traps (42 %) being the most popular. Fishers along the Mombasa-Kilifi area predominatly used beach seines while those in Diani-Chale, Malindi-Ungwana bay and Funzi-shirazi bay predominaltly used spearguns, gillnets and basket traps, respectively. Apart from gillnets, a general declining trend for most of the gear types was observed since 2004. Beach seines recorded the lowest (20. 9 ± 0. 2 cm) mean length while gillnets recorded the highest (34. 2 ± 0. 3 cm). The highest catch (~ 26, 000 metric tons) came in 2001 and the lowest (~ 15, 000 metric tons) in 2005. The highest number of fishers was observed in 2008 while 2009 recorded the highest (4. 8 ± 2. 3) mean number of hours per outing. The mean annual CPUE per region ranged from (1. 5 kg. fisher- 1. hr- 1) in Diani-Chale to (1. 0 kg. fisher- 1. hr- 1) in Malindi-Ungwana bay. Making use of questionnaire data, the attitudes towards offshore fishing strategies, FADs in particular, were evaluated. Some communities (about 25 % in every location) were not even aware of FAD fisheries. With the imminent introduction of a FAD fishery in Kenya, it was concluded that, for this fishery to realize its full potential, training on FAD fishing techniques has to be done. Finally, effective management is necessary if small-scale fisheries are to continue providing food security for many poor coastal communities. Gear-based management in Kenya, although under represented and under studied, {{has the potential to be}} adaptive, address multiple objectives, and be crafted to the socio-economic setting. Management effectiveness in near shore fisheries has generally been evaluated at the scale of the fish community. However, community level indicators can mask species-specific declines that provide significant portions of the fisheries yields and income. This thesis seeks to identify ways in which the Kenyan artisanal fishery can be sustained and managed from within coastal communities, giving them the resources and education to effectively improve their lives. The introduction of a offshore FAD fishery and hence access to offshore pelagic species provides an opportunity to not only alleviate pressure on coastal resources but also to empower coastal communities and contribute to the growth of Kenya’s national economy as a whole.
