In addition, we found multiple Vδ <b>1</b> <b>chains</b> with fetal type rearrangements which were also shared among organs and among animals. These Vδ <b>1</b> <b>chains</b> were typically characterized by a conserved amino acid motif, ‘GGIRA’. Furthermore, by analysing the early postnatal period at days 10 and 16, we demonstrated that the diversification of the thymic Vδ 1 repertoire is not paralleled by a diversification of extrathymic Vδ 1 +γ/δ T cells. This indicates that only fetal type rearrangements survive at extrathymic sites. In conclusion, γ/δ T cells expressing the canonical Vδ 1 -Dδ 2 -Jδ 2 chain are not unique to the skin and reproductive sites. Furthermore, we found other γ/δ T cells expressing fetal type Vδ <b>1</b> <b>chains</b> which were shared among different organs and animals. Thus, γ/δ T cells expressing conserved Vδ <b>1</b> <b>chains</b> {{are likely to have}} important functions.

40|$|Dilated cisternae of the ER {{resembling}} Russell Bodies (RBs) are induced {{in light}} (L) chain producing myeloma cell lines by transfection of a mu heavy (H) chain gene lacking the first constant domain (mu delta CH 1). RBs {{do not appear}} to be tissue specific, since they are also induced in a rat glioma cell line transfected with mu delta CH <b>1</b> and L <b>chain</b> genes. Efficient RB biogenesis requires H-L assembly and polymerization. The mutant Ig is partially degraded in a pre-Golgi compartment. The remnant, however, becomes an insoluble lattice when intersubunit disulphide bonds are formed. The resulting insoluble aggregate accumulates in RBs. Replacing the COOH-terminal cysteine of mu delta CH <b>1</b> <b>chains</b> with alanine reverses the RB-phenotype: the double mutant mu ala delta CH <b>1</b> <b>chains</b> assemble noncovalently with L and are secreted as H 2 L 2 complexes. Similarly, secretion of mu delta CH <b>1</b> <b>chains</b> can be induced by culturing transfectant cells in the presence of reducing agents. The presence of RBs does not alter transport of other secretory or membrane molecules, nor does it affect cell division. Resident proteins of the ER and other secretory proteins are not concentrated in RBs, implying sorting at the ER level. Sorting could be the result of the specific molecular structure of the insoluble lattice. We propose that RBs represent a general response of the cell to the accumulation of abundant, nondegradable protein(s) that fail to exit from the ER...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{provide some}} insight into the {{aetiology}} of spontaneous abortion, the contents of type V collagen was investigated in human decidual tissues in spontaneous abortion and normal pregnancy. METHODS: Collagens were extracted from decidual tissues in spontaneous abortion (n = 19) and normal pregnancy (n = 25). The different types of collagen alpha chains were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, and measured by densitometry. The relative amounts of the alpha 1 (III) and alpha <b>1</b> (V) <b>chains</b> were calculated by dividing the band intensities of the alpha 1 (III) and alpha <b>1</b> (V) <b>chains</b> by that of the alpha <b>1</b> (I) <b>chain.</b> RESULTS: The ratio of the alpha <b>1</b> (V) <b>chain</b> to that of the alpha <b>1</b> (I) <b>chain</b> in decidual tissues in spontaneous abortion was significantly lower than that found in normal pregnancy (p < 0. 05).
