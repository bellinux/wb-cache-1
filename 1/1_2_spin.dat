40|$|Quantum {{magnetism}} describes quantum many-body {{states of}} spins cou-pled by exchange interactions and {{lies at the}} heart of many fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics (<b>1,</b> <b>2).</b> <b>Spin</b> systems often tend to show long-range order at low temperatures; however, the interplay of exchange interactions with geometry and quantum fluctuations can lead to quantum states characterized by their short-range magnetic order.

After being synthesized by solid state reaction, pellets of CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 were annealed for 24 h at 1000 °C under air, Ar or O 2. Our temperature dependent ESR data revealed for all samples nearly temperature independent g value (2. 15 (1)) and linewidth for T TN ≈ 25 K. However, the values of ESR linewidth are strongly affected by the oxygen content in the sample. For instance, argon post-annealed samples show a much larger linewidth than the O 2 or air post-annealed samples. We attribute this broadening to an increase of the dipolar homogeneous broadening of the Cu 2 + ESR lines due {{to the presence of}} oxygen vacancies which induce an S= <b>1</b> <b>2</b> <b>spin</b> inside the TiO 6 octahedra.
