50|$|In {{computer}} programming, an Iliffe vector, {{also known}} as a display, is a data structure used to implement multi-dimensional arrays. An Iliffe vector for an n-dimensional array (where n ≥ 2) consists of a vector (or <b>1-dimensional</b> <b>array)</b> of pointers to an (n − <b>1)-dimensional</b> <b>array.</b> They are often used to avoid the need for expensive multiplication operations when performing address calculation on an array element. They {{can also be used to}} implement jagged arrays, such as triangular arrays, triangular matrices and other kinds of irregularly shaped arrays. The data structure is named after John K. Iliffe.|$|E
50|$|This expresses 2-dimensional array A as a <b>1-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> of n*n size, so that {{whenever}} the high-level code expresses Ay it will internally be A(x*n)+y {{for any given}} valid indices x and y.|$|E
50|$|Similarly simple is {{representing}} a multi-dimensional array {{as a single}} <b>1-dimensional</b> <b>array,</b> together with its dimensions. For example, representing an m × n array as a single list of length m·n, together with the numbers m and n (instead of as a <b>1-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> of pointers to each 1-dimensional subarray). The elements need not be of the same type, and a table of data (a list of records) may similarly be represented implicitly as a flat (1-dimensional) list, together with the length of each field, so long as each field has uniform size (so a single size can be used per field, not per record).|$|E

5000|$|... (also {{known as}} {{multispot}} beam generator or array beam generator) {{is a single}} optical element that divides an input beam into N output beams. Each output beam retains the same optical characteristics as the input beam, such as size, polarization and phase. A diffractive beam splitter can generate either a <b>1-dimensional</b> beam <b>array</b> (1xN) or a 2-dimensional beam [...] (MxN), depending on the diffractive pattern on the element. The diffractive beam splitter is used with monochromatic light such as a laser beam, and is designed for a specific wavelength and angle of separation between output beams.|$|R
50|$|Digital cameras use a <b>1-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> sensor to take 1-pixel-wide {{sequential}} {{images of}} the finish line. Since only a single line of the CCD is read out at a time, the frame rates can be very high (up to 10,000 frames per second). Unlike a film based photo finish, there is no delay from developing the film, and the photo finish is available immediately. They may be triggered by a laser or photovoltaic means.|$|E
5000|$|Given a {{reference}} basis of vectors, a tensor {{can be represented}} as an organized multidimensional array of numerical values. The [...] (also degree or [...] ) of a tensor is the dimensionality of the array needed to represent it, or equivalently, the number of indices needed to label a component of that array. For example, a linear map is represented by a matrix (a 2-dimensional array) in a basis, and therefore is a 2nd-order tensor. A vector is represented as a <b>1-dimensional</b> <b>array</b> in a basis, and is a 1st-order tensor. Scalars are single numbers and are thus 0th-order tensors. The collection of tensors on a vector space forms a tensor algebra.|$|E
