5000|$|There {{are four}} basic {{parameters}} {{that are involved}} in spin coating: solution viscosity, solid content (density), angular speed, and spin time. [...] A range of thicknesses can be achieved by spin coating. Most commonly the thicknesses range from <b>1-200</b> µm. The main properties that affect the thickness of the film are viscosity and spin speed. The more viscous the solvent the thicker the film will be and the faster the wafer is spun the thinner the film will be. By manipulating these two factors the different range of thicknesses is possible.|$|E

50|$|Incendiary {{bombs were}} used {{extensively}} {{by both the}} Axis and Allied air forces against civilian populations and targets of military significance in civilian areas, including Chongqing, London, Coventry, Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo. Late in the war, some of these bombs used white phosphorus (about <b>1-200</b> grams) in place of magnesium as the igniter for their flammable mixtures. The use of incendiary weapons against civilians was banned by signatory countries in the 1980 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons Protocol III. The United States signed Protocols I and II on 24 March 1995 under the Clinton Administration (and the amended article II on 24 May 1999) and later Protocols III, IV, and V, on 21 January 2009 under the Obama Administration.|$|E
50|$|Drug {{injection}} via intravenous administration, intramuscular administration, or subcutaneous administration carries relatively greater risks {{than other}} methods of administration. The doses used by recreational intravenous users vary widely, {{with a range}} of <b>1-200</b> times the doses used therapeutically (i.e., up to several grams). Intravenous users risk developing pulmonary embolism (PE), a blockage of the main artery of the lung or one of its branches, and commonly develop skin rashes or infections at the site of injection. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users share a common needle without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as HIV or hepatitis, can be transmitted. The level of needle sharing among methamphetamine users is similar to that among other drug-injection users.|$|E
5000|$|This ecologically catholic neotropical {{songbird}} provides {{perhaps one}} of the clearest and most widely distributed habitat-related dialect systems. The geographic variation in the song of this species became apparent over 30 years ago with F. Nottebohm's study in subtropical and temperate Argentina. He interpreted his findings largely in the context established a few years before in the white-crowned sparrow, that is, he suggested that these dialects perhaps serve to enhance the genetic integrity of local populations. The first direct investigation of this possibility, while providing no support for what came to be called the [...] "genetic adaptation hypothesis" [...] (GAH), which explains the vocal dialects of the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) well. [...] showed that the spatial organisation of song variation was very closely associated with the distribution of distinct habitat types. Moreover, the structural characteristics of the dialect variable (trill interval) showed variation largely consistent with the interspecific acoustic patterns described by E.S. Morton, that is, in general, the trill interval varied from short (c. 50 ms; rapid trills) in open grasslands to long (<b>1-200</b> ms; slow whistles) in woodlands and forests.|$|E

50|$|After the Proof of Principle {{exercise}} was completed, U.S. Army Europe issued {{an order for}} JTF-East to begin a period of “warm-basing” at the Mihail Kogălniceanu Airfield, Romania. The driver for this decision was {{the absence of any}} available rotational forces to occupy JTF-East due to the 2007 “surge” in Iraq, which significantly increased the number of troops deployed there. This decision to go to a warm-basing status was reinforced by the perception that the impact on rotational force availability would be temporary and that construction of the PFOS was not yet complete. As operational impacts grew clearer, in February 2008, USAREUR announced that the originally intended brigade-sized rotation would be down-sized to a battalion for 2008. Due to the lack of forces available in Europe, the rotation was adjusted to a battalion-sized active component/reserve component mix. The 2008 Rotation was executed sequentially with training operations first in Romania then in Bulgaria. Approximately 3,100 total U.S., Romanian, and Bulgarian personnel participated in the first rotation. Of the 2,100 that participated in Romania, the U.S. units included the <b>1-200</b> Infantry of the New Mexico Army National Guard, the 541st Engineer Company and B Company, 1-4th Infantry Regiment and 1st Battalion, 94th Field Artillery from Germany; Romanian Land Forces included the 341st Infantry Battalion. Nearly 1,000 participants in Bulgaria included members of the 5th Battalion, 7th Air Defense Artillery out of Germany.|$|E
5000|$|Argyrosomus regius is a demersal, oceanodromous fish {{which is}} found in inshore waters and on the {{continental}} shelf, it can occur close to the bottom {{as well as in}} surface and mid-waters. The adults prey on grey mullet and clupeids such as sardines which are actively pursued in open water. The adults gather in inshore waters to spawn during spring and summer. The juveniles and subadults prefer estuaries and coastal lagoons, and the health of recruitment into the adult population is possibly determined by the availability of these habitats. These fish are migratory, at all ages, migrating along shore or between offshore and inshore waters in response to temperature changes. A. regius feeds on fishes and swimming crustaceans and mostly occurs over sand, close to rocks, at <b>1-200</b> m max, but commonly found at 15-100 m. The three main spawning sites in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea are the Nile delta, Lévrier Bay, and the Gironde estuary and with large numbers of adults congregate at these sites between May and July. [...] Large schools of A. regius occur around wrecked ships that were deliberately sunk to create new habitat for a number of commercially caught species of fish. Most of their growth happens during the summer months and feeding activity is significantly reduced when the water temperature drops below 13-15 °C.|$|E
50|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs) are used {{extensively on the}} surface of superalloy in both commercial and military gas turbine engines to increase component life and engine performance. A coating of about <b>1-200</b> µm can reduce the temperature at the superalloy surface by up to 200K. TBCs are really a system of coatings consisting of a bond coat, a thermally grown oxide (TGO), and a thermally insulating ceramic top coat. In most applications, the bond coat is either a MCrAlY (where M=Ni or NiCo) or a Pt modified aluminide coating. A dense bond coat is required to provide protection of the superalloy substrate from oxidation and hot corrosion attack and to form an adherent, slow growing TGO on its surface. The TGO is formed by oxidation of the aluminum that is contained in the bond coat. The current (first generation) thermal insulation layer is composed of 7wt % yttria stabilized zirconia (7YSZ) with a typical thickness of 100-300 µm. Yttria stabilized zirconia is used due to its low thermal conductivity (2.6W/mK for fully dense material), relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion, and good high temperature stability. The electron beam directed vapor deposition (EB-DVD) process used to apply the TBC to turbine airfoils produces a columnar microstructure with several levels of porosity. The porosity between the columns is critical to providing strain tolerance (via a very low in-plane modulus), as it would otherwise spall on thermal cycling due to thermal expansion mismatch with the superalloy substrate. The porosity within the columns reduces the thermal conductivity of the coating.|$|E
