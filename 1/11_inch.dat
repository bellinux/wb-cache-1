5|$|In 1937 eight /75 caliber AA guns in two quadruple mounts {{were added}} to improve the light AA armament. The ships were more {{extensively}} refitted with large amounts of light AA guns {{at the expense of}} the 5-inch/51 caliber guns in 1942, as the attack on Pearl Harbor had shown pre-war light AA armament to be inadequate. The <b>1.1</b> <b>inch</b> quad mounts were removed and 24 Bofors 40 mm guns were added in six quadruple mounts (later increased to 40 guns), while 42 Oerlikon 20 mm guns in single mounts were also added. The 3-inch AA gun armament was increased to 10 guns, while the 5-inch gun armament was reduced to 6 guns.|$|E
5|$|Tubman {{spent her}} {{remaining}} years in Auburn, tending {{to her family}} and other people in need. She worked various jobs to support her elderly parents, and took in boarders to help pay the bills. One of the people Tubman took in was a 5-foot, <b>11</b> <b>inch</b> tall farmer born in North Carolina named Nelson Charles Davis. He was {{a veteran of the}} 8th United States Colored Infantry, serving as a private in the unit from September 1863 to the late summer of 1865. He began working in Auburn as a bricklayer, and they soon fell in love. Though he was 22 years younger than she was, on March 18, 1869, they were married at the Central Presbyterian Church. They adopted a baby girl named Gertie in 1874, and lived together as a family; Nelson died on October 14, 1888 of tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|Various other {{guns are}} mounted or {{unmounted}} in Bermuda, with some lying outside of Fort St Catherine, having been rolled out when made obsolete (the guns actually mounted on display there {{were taken from}} other forts, notably Fort Albert), and a number having been found buried in the moat of Fort Cunningham (the two mounted at Fort George are the RML <b>11</b> <b>inch</b> 25 ton gun). At least one has been erected on a display stand at Fort Hamilton, though the original mount is missing, and another at Alexandia Battery.|$|E

25|$|The first 100 Tempest Vs were {{fitted with}} 20mm (.79in) Hispano Mk.IIs with long barrels which {{projected}} {{ahead of the}} wing leading edges and were covered by short fairings; later production Tempest Vs switched to the short-barrelled Hispano Mk.Vs, with muzzles flush with the leading edges. Early Tempest Vs used Typhoon-style 34 by <b>11</b> <b>inch</b> (83.4 by 28cm) five-spoke wheels, but most had smaller 30 by 9 inch (76.2 by 22.9cm) four-spoke wheels. The new spar structure of the Tempest V also allowed up to 2,000lb (907kg) of external stores to be carried underneath the wings.|$|E
500|$|The {{game has}} over 300 books (not {{counting}} spell scrolls). One particular compilation {{of the text}} was 1,241 sheets of 8.25× <b>11</b> <b>inch</b> paper. PC Gamer weighted the in-game text as equal to six typical-size novels. Many of these books provide long, serial stories, and provide hints as to the background {{and history of the}} game. One critic in particular, Phillip Scuderi, remembered Morrowind for its great literary richness. To him, the in-game literature and its integration within the game were Morrowinds [...] "most original and lasting contribution to the history of games", one that would place it beside [...] {{as one of the most}} important games of all time. Such themes are echoed in other responses to the game, such as that of RPGamers Joseph Witham, who found the story [...] "discreet" [...] in its progression, with a dungeon-crawling feel, standing alongside a [...] "whole world of unique history" [...] with books forming the greater part of the player's interaction with that world. Most of the books were reused in Oblivion.|$|E
