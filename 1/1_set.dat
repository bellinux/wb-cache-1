Characterization of <b>SET</b> <b>1</b> RC showed that <b>SET</b> <b>1</b> mRNA binding did not require associated Swd 1, Spp 1 and Shg 1 proteins or RNA recognition motifs present in <b>Set</b> <b>1.</b> RNA binding was not observed when <b>Set</b> <b>1</b> protein and <b>SET</b> <b>1</b> mRNA were derived from independent genes or when <b>SET</b> <b>1</b> transcripts were restricted to the nucleus. Importantly, the protein–RNA interaction was sensitive to EDTA, to the translation elongation inhibitor puromycin and to the inhibition of translation initiation in prt 1 - 1 mutants. Taken together, our results {{support the idea that}} <b>SET</b> <b>1</b> mRNA binding was dependent on translation and that <b>SET</b> <b>1</b> RC assembled on nascent <b>Set</b> <b>1</b> in a cotrans-lational manner. Moreover, we show that cellular accumulation of <b>Set</b> <b>1</b> is limited by the availability of certain <b>SET</b> <b>1</b> C components, such as Swd 1 and Swd 3, and suggest that cotranslational protein interactions may exert an effect in the protection of nascent <b>Set</b> <b>1</b> from degradation...|$|R

Both Caradon Hill and Four Lanes/Redruth {{were converted to}} transmit DAB signals {{for the first time}} in 2000. This enabled DAB to be heard {{for the first time in}} Cornwall, although due to the still scarcity of sets, not many listeners were tuning in on launch day. That all changed in 2002, when Pure launched their Evoke <b>1</b> <b>set</b> at GB£100, by far the cheapest at that time. Other manufactures followed, and the price by 2004 had gone below the GB£50 mark, enabling a much greater consumer take up. However, DAB signal reception within Cornwall remained patchy, and was (and at 2007 still is) virtually non-existent in areas like Falmouth. The BBC did not come to DAB in Cornwall until 2003, three years behind the commercial rival, and even then this was broadcasting to mid and east Cornwall only, as Redruth was not DAB enabled by the BBC until late in 2004.|$|E

The Lions received a huge scoring opportunity when Williams fumbled a punt {{at the end of the}} next drive. Lions linebacker Matt Russell got to the ball first, but instead of falling on the ball, he tried to pick it up and run with it. Instead of grabbing the ball, he accidentally batted it out of bounds, allowing the Bucs to keep possession on the Lions 11-yard line. Taking full advantage of their second chance, Tampa Bay subsequently drove 89 yards in 17 plays, taking 8:50 off the clock and converting three third downs, one from a 12-men on the field penalty against Detroit. Dilfer finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Horace Copeland that put the team up 10-0. Later on, Buccaneers cornerback Anthony Parker intercepted a pass from Mitchell and returned it 19 yards to the Lions 20-yard line, setting up Husted's 43-yard field goal that gave the team a 13-0 lead at the end of the half. Tampa Bay had a chance to increase their lead even more before halftime with a drive to the Lions 43, but Ron Rice intercepted a pass from Dilfer on the last play of the second quarter.|$|E
