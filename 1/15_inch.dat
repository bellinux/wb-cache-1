25|$|In late 1900, {{the ships}} were {{extensively}} refitted, {{during which time}} their sail rigging was removed, and armament changed to eight QF 2.5 pdr guns and six quadruple 1-inch Nordenfelt guns. The torpedoes were upgraded from <b>15</b> <b>inch</b> to 18-inch torpedo tubes. However, during the Russo-Japanese War, the ships were regarded as obsolete and were assigned as guard ships in ports in the Japanese home islands.|$|E

25|$|During World War I an {{estimated}} one tonne of explosives {{was fired for}} every square metre of territory on the Western front. As many as one in every three shells fired did not detonate. In the Ypres Salient, {{an estimated}} 300 million projectiles that the British and the Germans forces fired at each other during World War I were duds, {{and most of them}} have not been recovered.

25|$|From the outset, the railway's {{owners and}} {{designers}} envisaged freight services. Two {{of the original}} locomotives (No 5 Hercules and No 6 Samson) were built to the 'mountain' wheel arrangement (4-8-2), unique on any British railway and giving the ability to haul heavy freight with only a small loss of speed when used on passenger work. In the early years the railway carried {{a limited amount of}} freight (mainly shingle and fish traffic). A goods shed was built at New Romney and featured dual gauge track allowing easy transfer between the standard and <b>15</b> <b>inch</b> gauges. This was seldom used and was demolished in about 1934.|$|E

The design also enabled {{the ship to}} be up-gunned with six <b>15</b> <b>inch</b> guns which never took place. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve 15cm (5.9in) L/55 guns, fourteen 10.5cm L/65 and sixteen [...] SK C/30 L/83, and initially ten [...] C/30 anti-aircraft guns.

500|$|The BL 18-inch Mk I naval gun was a breech-loading naval gun {{used by the}} Royal Navy during World War I. It was {{the largest}} and {{heaviest}} gun ever used by the British. Only the Second-World-War Japanese 40 cm/45 Type 94 had a larger calibre, , but the British shell was heavier.

2500|$|The biggest {{difference}} between the so-called [...] "XR series" [...] performance versions and standard models were the engines; the XR6 and XR8 boasted a [...] six-cylinder and a [...] V8 respectively. The V8 was later upgraded to output 185kilowatts (248hp) in October 1997. The upgraded transmission and exhaust system were unique to the XR range, as was the exterior styling with an XR exclusive quad headlamp assembly giving the vehicle {{a higher degree of}} aggression when compared to the look possessed by the other variants. Both models came standard with limited slip differential and specially tuned suspension. Body kits were also installed to improve the aesthetics and the aerodynamics.

60|$|A {{piece of}} waste, swampy land was enclosed, drained, ploughed, harrowed and thickly {{covered in the}} year 1822 with burnt marl and cinders. It was sowed with grass seeds, and now {{supports}} a tolerably good but coarse pasture. Holes were dug in this field in 1837, or 15 years after its reclamation, and {{we see in the}} accompanying diagram (Fig. 5), reduced to half of the natural scale, that the turf was 1 inch thick, beneath which there was a layer of vegetable mould 2.5 inches thick. This layer did not contain fragments of any kind; but beneath it there was a layer of mould, <b>1.5</b> <b>inch</b> in thickness, full of fragments of burnt marl, conspicuous from their red colour, one of which near the bottom was an inch in length; and other fragments of coal-cinders together with a few white quartz pebbles. Beneath this layer and at a depth of 4.5 inches from the surface, the original black, peaty, sandy soil with a few quartz pebbles was encountered. Here therefore the fragments of burnt marl and cinders had been covered in the course of 15 years by a layer of fine vegetable mould, only 2.5 inches in thickness, excluding the turf. Six and a half years subsequently this field was re-examined, and the fragments were now found at from 4 to 5 inches beneath the surface. So that in this interval of 6.5 years, about <b>1.5</b> <b>inch</b> of mould had been added to the superficial layer. I am surprised that a greater quantity had not been brought up during the whole 21.5 years, for in the closely underlying black, peaty soil there were many worms. It is, however, probable that formerly, whilst the land remained poor, worms were scanty; and the mould would then have accumulated slowly. The average annual increase of thickness for the whole period is 0.19 of an inch.|$|E
60|$|We {{marched on}} the 28th to Kota, at the {{junction}} of the river of that name with the Soane, over hills of flinty rock, which projected everywhere, to the utter ruin of the elephants' feet, and then over undulating hills of limestone; on the latter I found trees of Cochlospermum, whose curious thick branches spread out somewhat awkwardly, each tipped with a cluster of golden yellow flowers, {{as large as the}} palm of the hand, and very beautiful: it is a tropical Gum-Cistus in the appearance and texture of the petals, and their frail nature. The bark abounds in a transparent gum, of which the white ants seem fond, for they had killed many trees. Of the leaves the curious rude leaf-bellows are made, with which the natives of these hills smelt iron. Scorpions appeared very common here, of a small kind, <b>1.5</b> <b>inch</b> long; several were captured, and one of our party was stung on the finger; the smart was burning for an hour or two, and then ceased.|$|E
60|$|Whilst {{the plant}} is quite young, the first-formed leaves are not {{modified}} in any way, but those next formed have their terminal leaflets reduced in size, and soon all the leaves assume the structure represented in the following drawing. This leaf bore nine leaflets; the lower ones being much subdivided. The terminal portion of the petiole, about <b>1.5</b> <b>inch</b> in length (above the leaflet f), is thinner and more elongated than the lower part, and may be considered as the tendril. The leaflets borne by this part are greatly reduced in size, being, on an average, about the tenth of an inch in length and very narrow; one small leaflet measured one-twelfth of an inch in length and one-seventy-fifth in breadth (2.116 mm. and 0.339 mm.), {{so that it was}} almost microscopically minute. All the reduced leaflets have branching nerves, and terminate in little spines, like those of the fully developed leaflets. Every gradation could be traced, until we come to branchlets (as a and d in the figure) which show no vestige of a lamina or blade. Occasionally all the terminal branchlets of the petiole are in this condition, and we then have a true tendril.|$|E

6000|$|In {{countries}} where the rain is very heavy, as in the tropics, the castings appear, as might have been expected, to be washed down in a greater degree than in England. Mr. Scott informs me that near Calcutta the tall columnar castings (previously described), the diameter of which is usually between 1 and <b>1.5</b> <b>inch,</b> subside on a level surface, after heavy rain, into almost circular, thin, flat discs, between 3 and 4 and sometimes 5 inches in diameter. Three fresh castings, which had been ejected in the Botanic Gardens [...] "on a slightly inclined, grass-covered, artificial bank of loamy clay," [...] were carefully measured, and had a mean height of 2.17, and a mean diameter of 1.43 inches; these after heavy rain, formed elongated patches of earth, with a mean length {{in the direction of}} the slope of 5.83 inches. As the earth had spread very little up the slope, a large part, judging from the original diameter of these castings, must have flowed bodily downwards about 4 inches. Moreover some of the finest earth of which they were composed must have been washed completely away to a still greater distance. In drier sites near Calcutta, a species of worm ejects its castings, not in vermiform masses, but in little pellets of varying sizes: these are very numerous in some places, and Mr. Scott says that they [...] "are washed away by every shower." ...|$|E
