60|$|Rate of Movement to measure.--a. When {{the length}} of pace etc., is known before beginning, to observe.--A man or a horse walking {{at the rate of}} one mile per hour, takes 10 paces in some ascertainable number of seconds, {{dependent}} upon {{the length of}} his step. If the length of his step be 30 inches, he will occupy 17 seconds in making 10 paces. Conversely, if the same person counts his paces for 17 seconds, and finds that he has taken 10 in that time, he will know that he is walking at the rate of exactly <b>1</b> <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> If he had taken 40 paces in the same period, he would know that his rate had been 4 miles per hour; if 35 paces, that it had been 3.5, or 3 1/2 miles per hour. Thus it will be easily intelligible, that if a man knows the number of seconds appropriate to the length of his pace, he can learn the rate at which he is walking, by counting his paces during that number of seconds and by dividing the number of his paces so obtained, by 10. In short the number of his paces during the period in question, gives his rate per hour, in miles and decimals of a mile, to one place of decimals. I am indebted to Mr. Archibald Smith for this very ingenious notion, which I have worked into the following Tables. In Table I., I give the appropriate number of seconds corresponding to paces of various lengths. I find, however, that the pace of neither man nor horse is constant in length during all rates of walking; consequently, where precision is sought, it is better to use this Table on a method of approximation. That is to say, the traveller should find his approximate rate by using the number of seconds appropriate to his estimated speed. Then, knowing the length of pace due to that approximate rate, he will proceed afresh by adopting a revised number of seconds, and will obtain a result much nearer to the truth than the first. Table I. could of course be employed for finding the rate of a carriage, when the circumference of one of its wheels was known; but it is troublesome to make such a measurement. I therefore have calculated Table II., in terms of the radius of the wheel. The formulae by which the two Tables have been calculated are, m=l x 0.5682 for Table I., and m=r x 3.570 for Table II., where m is the appropriate number of seconds; l is the length of the pace, or circumference of the wheel; and r is the radius of the wheel.|$|E

40|$|Running economy (RE) is an {{important}} predictor of endurance performance. To date, the typical methods of measuring RE involves calculating an athlete?s VO 2 (ml- 1 ?kg? 1 ?km? 1) at a known speed during a physiological steady-state. Measuring RE for athletes who race at distances above the anaerobic threshold (AT) (800 m ? 5000 m) is problematic because these distances are contested in conditions when physiological steady-states cannot be achieved. The current study explored the use of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) being added to the oxygen consumption during running for estimating RE above the AT and examined {{the construct validity of}} this measurement technique. The EPOC was measured for three minutes (fast component) from seven male and seven female varsity cross-country runners after running for three minutes at a pace of <b>1.</b> 0 <b>mile</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (MPH) above their calculated AT pace. Construct validity was established by noting theoretical associations and computing Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients between blood lactate (BLa), heart rate (HR), ventilation (VE), and excess CO 2, and RE. For the male participants, excess CO 2 had the highest correlation (r =. 629, p <. 005), followed by BLa (r =. 586, p <. 001). In the female participants ventilation had the strongest correlation (r =. 836, p <. 001) followed by excess CO 2 (r =. 607, p <. 001). These results support the construct validity for our measurement technique. The findings from this study will have implications as a performance assessment tool for researchers, coaches, and athletes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Despite their {{increased}} use, {{no studies}} have examined the validity of Actical accelerometry cut points for moderate physical activity (PA) in underserved (low-income, high-crime), minority populations. The high rates of chronic disease and physical inactivity in these populations likely impact the measurement of PA. There is growing concern that traditionally defined cut points may be too high for older or inactive adults. The present study aimed to determine the self-selected pace associated with instructions to “walk for exercise” and the corresponding accelerometry estimates (e. g., Actical counts/minute) for underserved, African American adults. Method Fifty one participants (61 % women) had a mean age of 60. 1 (SD[*]=[*] 9. 9) and a mean body mass index of 30. 5 [*]kg/m 2 (SD[*]=[*] 6. 0). They performed one seated task, one standing task, and three walking tasks: “strolling”; “walking for exercise”; and “walking in an emergency. ” Results The average pace for strolling, walking for exercise, and walking in an emergency were <b>1.</b> 62 <b>miles</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (mph; SD[*]=[*]. 51), 2. 51 mph (SD[*]=[*]. 53), and 2. 86 mph (SD[*]=[*]. 58), respectively. The average Actical counts/minute for the five activities were: 4 (SD[*]=[*] 15), 16 (SD[*]=[*] 29), 751 (SD[*]=[*] 591), 2006 (SD[*]=[*] 1095), and 2617 (SD[*]=[*] 1169), respectively. Regression analyses showed that the predicted counts/minute for a pace of 2. 0 mph (which is used as the criterion for moderate exercise in this study) was 1075 counts/minute (SEM[*]=[*] 73). Conclusions The cut point associated with subjectively determined moderate PA is similar to those previously published for older adults and extends the use of adjusted cut points to African American populations. These results indicate that accurate cut points can be obtained using this innovative methodology. </p...|$|R
