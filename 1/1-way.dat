2500|$|Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), {{also known}} as vesicoureteric reflux, is a {{condition}} in which urine flows retrograde, or backward, from the bladder into the ureters/kidneys. [...] Urine normally travels in one direction (forward, or anterograde) from the kidneys to the bladder via the ureters, with a <b>1-way</b> valve at the vesicoureteral (ureteral-bladder) junction preventing backflow. [...] The valve is formed by oblique tunneling of the distal ureter through the wall of the bladder, creating a short length of ureter (1–2cm) that can be compressed as the bladder fills. [...] Reflux occurs if the ureter enters the bladder without sufficient tunneling, i.e., too [...] "end-on".|$|E
2500|$|Ivybridge {{has long}} been a staging post on the Exeter to Plymouth road dating back to the 13th century and the [...] "Ivy Bridge" [...] was the only way over the River Erme at the time. The bridge itself is still in use to this day taking cars (one-way) and {{pedestrians}} across the river. [...] In the 1830s a new bridge was built at the top of Fore Street (approximately 130 yards down the river). It is now used as a <b>1-way</b> road across the river for vehicles and a separate pedestrian bridge lies alongside it. Another bridge (Marjorie Kelly Way/B3213, built in the 1990s) is situated at the bottom of Fore Street. In 1974 the A38 road was opened linking Ivybridge to Plymouth and Exeter. It was the first major trunk road for Ivybridge and was bypassed at the B3213, which runs through the centre of Ivybridge and connects it to the nearby villages of Bittaford and Wrangaton.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>1-way</b> {{differential}} {{will provide}} its limiting action {{in only one}} direction. When torque is applied {{in the opposite direction}} it behaves like an open differential. In the case of a FWD car it is argued to be safer than a 2-way differential. [...] The argument is if there is no additional coupling on over run, i.e. a <b>1-way</b> LSD as soon as the driver lifts the throttle, the LSD unlocks and behaves somewhat like a conventional open differential. This is also the best for FWD cars, as it allows the car to turn in on throttle release, instead of ploughing forward.|$|E
50|$|A 1.5-way {{differential}} {{refers to}} {{one where the}} forward and reverse limiting torques, Trq d_fwd, d_rev , are different but neither is zero {{as in the case}} of the <b>1-way</b> LSD. This type of differential is common in racing cars where a strong limiting torque can aid stability under engine braking.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{channels}} transmitted was a low-speed data channel {{that could be}} decoded with a leased-line telephone modem connected to the Coastcom receiver, called the DACS channel, or the Direct Access Communications System. It acted as a <b>1-way</b> wire that provided NPR stations with text messages regarding programming and other information.|$|E
5000|$|The Tom-Dee duality in Thailand maybe be {{compared}} to the butch-fem duality of lesbianism but differs in a number of ways. [...] Among them are <b>1-way</b> and 2-way subcategories in both, and in Toms physical presentation that may {{be compared}} to transgender men and a sense of role and duty of living up to strict stereotypes associated with gentleman.|$|E
5000|$|MCET created [...] "Mass LearnPike", a satellite-based network {{funded in}} part by a Star Schools grant to [...] "explore the use of distance-learning in K-12 schools." [...] The LearnPike used semi-interactive video, {{consisting}} of a <b>1-way</b> video broadcast and a 2-way audio channel to deliver educational content. [...] Mass LearnPike program listings were made available on the MCET web site beginning in 1997.|$|E
5000|$|... iBeacon {{differs from}} some other location-based {{technologies}} as the broadcasting device (beacon) is only a <b>1-way</b> transmitter to the receiving smartphone or receiving device, and necessitates a specific app installed on the device {{to interact with the}} beacons. This ensures that only the installed app (not the iBeacon transmitter) can track users, potentially against their will, as they passively walk around the transmitters.|$|E
5000|$|Housing-first {{approach}} to homelessness which would house all homeless people, {{accompanied by a}} ban on bussing programs (many cities and counties across the US offer homeless people free <b>1-way</b> bus tickets {{out of town and}} California is a top destination due to its temperate climate) and a commitment to file lawsuits against any government entity that runs such programs with California as a destination.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cash fare}} {{to board the}} bus is $1.25. A reduced fare of 60 cents is {{available}} to Medicare card holders, persons with disabilities, and students (with a valid ID). Transfers to other buses (for as many <b>1-way</b> trips within a 2-hour period, round-trips & stopovers prohibited; no transfer use charge thereafter) are $0.50 and children under 7 with fare-paying rider are free; limit 3.|$|E
50|$|Deterministic tournament {{selection}} selects {{the best}} individual (when p = 1) in any tournament. A <b>1-way</b> tournament (k = 1) selection {{is equivalent to}} random selection. The chosen individual can {{be removed from the}} population that the selection is made from if desired, otherwise individuals can be selected more than once for the next generation. In comparison with the (stochastic) fitness proportionate selection method, tournament selection is often implemented in practice due to its lack of stochastic noise.|$|E
50|$|The Lite version {{features}} descriptive statistics, {{hypothesis testing}} (t-tests, chi-square, <b>1-way</b> ANOVA with post-hocs, non-parametric tests), distribution testing, linear regression, correlation and {{a selection of}} basic graphing functions. It is limited to 254 rows and 12 columns of data, and does not offer import or export functions. The Pro version features advanced analyses (unlimited rows and columns, import and export, more means of analyses (2-way ANOVA, logistic and nonlinear regression, principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling, time series, power/sample-size, factorial design), more types of graph, word processing functions and options for formatting of results.|$|E
5000|$|Emil Post in an {{independent}} description of a computational process, reduced the symbols allowed to the equivalent binary set of marks on the tape { [...] "mark", [...] "blank"=not_mark }. He changed the notion of [...] "tape" [...] from <b>1-way</b> infinite {{to the right to}} an infinite set of rooms each with a sheet of paper in both directions. He atomized the Turing 5-tuples into 4-tuples—motion instructions separate from print/erase instructions. Although his 1936 model is ambiguous about this, Post's 1947 model did not require sequential instruction execution.|$|E
5000|$|GPS {{personal}} tracking {{devices are}} used in the care of the elderly and vulnerable. Devices allow users to call for assistance and optionally allow designated carers to locate the user's position, typically within 5 to 10 metres. Their use helps promote independent living and social inclusion for the elderly. Devices often incorporate either <b>1-way</b> or 2-way voice communication. Some devices also allow the user to call several phone numbers using pre-programmed speed dial buttons. Trials using GPS personal tracking devices are also underway in several countries for use with early stage dementia.|$|E
50|$|Another type of <b>1-way</b> {{satellite}} Internet {{system uses}} General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) for the back-channel. Using standard GPRS or Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE), costs are reduced for higher effective rates if the upload volume is very low, {{and also because}} this service is not per-time charged, but charged by volume uploaded. GPRS as return improves mobility when the service is provided by a satellite that transmits {{in the field of}} 50-53 dBW. Using a 33 cm wide satellite dish, a notebook and a normal GPRS equipped GSM phone, users can get mobile satellite broadband.|$|E
50|$|The OR1200 design uses a Harvard memory {{architecture}} and therefore has separate memory management units (MMUs) for data and instruction memories. These MMUs each {{consist of a}} hash-based <b>1-way</b> direct-mapped translation lookaside buffer (TLB) with page size of 8 KB and a default size of 64 entries. The TLBs are individually scalable from 16 to 256 entries. There is also a one-way direct-mapped cache each for both the instruction memory and for the data memory. Each cache has a default size of 8 KB, but both are individually scalable between 1 and 64 KB. The MMU includes support for virtual memory.|$|E

5000|$|In 2003 and 2004, much {{discussion}} was held {{about the future}} of the districts. Possibilities were discussed including a 3-way whole grade sharing agreement between Hampton-Dumont, CAL, and Dows; continuing or expanding 2-way sharing between CAL and Dows; and Dows beginning a <b>1-way</b> whole grade sharing agreement with either Clarion-Goldfield, Belmond-Klemme, or CAL. After {{much discussion}} it was ultimately it was decided that Clarion-Goldfield would provide the best educational opportunities and stability for the long-term future of Dows area students. When the partnership with CAL Community School ended, CAL re-established itself as an independent P/K-12 school district. Initially, quite a few of the high school students that were already attending CAL open enrolled to finish attending school at CAL. Over time, as those classes graduated a vast majority of the Dows students were attending school in Clarion.|$|E
5000|$|Ectopic {{enhanced}} nodal automaticity suggests foci of sub-pulmonic valvular pacemaker {{cells that}} have a subthreshold potential for firing. The basic rhythm of the heart raises these cells to threshold, which precipitates an ectopic beat. This process is the underlying mechanism for arrhythmias due to excess catecholamines and some electrolyte deficiencies, particularly low blood potassium, known as hypokalemia. [...] Reentry occurs when an area of <b>1-way</b> block in the Purkinje fibers and a second area of slow conduction are present. This condition is frequently seen in patients with underlying heart disease that creates areas of differential conduction and recovery due to myocardial scarring or ischemia. During ventricular activation, one bundle tract's area of slow conduction activates the other tract's bundle fibers post block after {{the rest of the}} ventricle has recovered. This resulting in an extra beat. Reentry can produce single ectopic beats, or it can trigger paroxysmal tachycardia.|$|E

5000|$|During the AMD Analyst Day 2006 on December 14, 2006, AMD {{announced}} their official timeline for server, desktop and mobile processors. For the servers segment, AMD will unveil two new processors {{based on the}} architecture codenamed [...] "Barcelona" [...] and [...] "Budapest" [...] for 8/4/2-way and <b>1-way</b> servers respectively. For {{the second half of}} 2007, HyperTransport 3.0 and Socket AM2+ will be unveiled, which are designed for the specific implementation of the aforementioned consumer quad core desktop chip series, with naming convention changes from city names (up to middle of 2007) to stars or constellations after that, such as Agena; in addition, the AMD Quad FX platform and its immediate successor will support the high end enthusiast dual-processor versions of the chip, codenamed as Agena FX, updates the processors line for AMD Quad FX platform. As with the server chips codenamed Barcelona, the new desktop quad core series will feature a shared L3 cache, 128-bit floating point (FP) units and an enhanced microarchitecture. Agena will be the native quad-core processor for the desktop. Kuma, a dual-core variant will follow on in Q3 while Rana, the dual-core version with no shared L3 cache is expected {{at the end of the}} year.|$|E
50|$|The Dows Community School District, {{established}} in 1914, served {{the community of}} Dows, Iowa for 100 years. It served as a full K-12 school system until the last class graduated in 1998. In 1963, Dows recorded its largest enrollment of 532 students in K-12, 50 in kindergarten alone. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, enrollment declined. In the fall of 1998, a 2-way whole grade sharing agreement began with CAL Community School District of Latimer, Iowa. The shared high school was at CAL, the shared middle school (6-8) was at Dows, and both districts maintained their own separate elementary schools. This agreement continued for seven years. Beginning in 2005-06, Dows ended the agreement with CAL and began a <b>1-way</b> whole grade sharing agreement with Clarion-Goldfield. Dows maintained a P/K-5 elementary school and shared numerous administration, faculty, and staff positions. In September 2013, voters of both districts approved consolidation into a single district. The Dows School was closed {{in the spring of}} 2014, in its centennial year of operation. An all-school reunion was held at Dows Corn Days in August 2014. The district became part of the Clarion-Goldfield-Dows Community School District with all students attending classes and activities in Clarion in the fall of 2014. The Dows School building was sold in June 2014 to warehouse seed for Pioneer. The playground and football/baseball complex were gifted to the City of Dows.|$|E
