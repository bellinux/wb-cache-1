40|$|Abstract: In-line {{process control}} with sensors and {{instrumentation}} is financially similar to Verification-In-Process in NDT. One inspects 100 % of production between process steps {{to assure that}} production meets specifications. Financial methods exist to prove that <b>100</b> % <b>inspection</b> should be carried out. The added cost of testing is compared with the resources saved by eliminating the nonconforming material. The three methods to be presented are (1) the Deming Inspection Criterion for short-term projects, (2) the Internal Rate of Return method for long-term projects with investment and depreciation, and (3) the Productivity & Profit method which shows the decrease in profit when nonconforming material produces major detrimental costs. Introduction: (1) : The subject {{of this paper is}} how to make financial calculations which prove that <b>100</b> % <b>inspection</b> should be used or should not be used. Making such financial calculations is of interest to the field of process control in manufacturing because it gives a quantitative justification for expending resource (money) on one or another approach to process control.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} <b>100</b> % <b>inspection</b> {{of a product}} of which several characteristics have to satisfy given specification limits. A <b>100</b> % <b>inspection</b> procedure {{may be necessary to}} bring the percentage of nonconforming items down to a level acceptable for the consumer. If one can observe the actual values of the characteristics, {{it would be possible to}} bring this percentage down to zero. However, quite often this is not possible, as a measurement error occurs in measuring the characteristics. Therefore, it is common practice to inspect each characteristic by comparing its measurement to a test limit which is slightly more strict than the corresponding specification limit. An item then is accepted if for each characteristic the measurement conforms to the corresponding test limit. However, instead of inspecting an individual characteristic merely using its own measurement, it is (much) more efficient to use the measurements of the other characteristics as well, especially if some of the characteristics are highly correlated. In this paper it is shown how the measurements of all the characteristics can be used to test whether an item is conformin...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes another {{realistic}} {{application of}} the economic order quantity EOQ model. Researchers have studied EOQ models that assume the received lot contains items that are perfect and imperfect. All models in the literature assume that the received lot goes through a <b>100</b> % <b>inspection</b> to separate acceptable items from the non-acceptable items. This paper argues that <b>100</b> % <b>inspection</b> {{is not always a}} cheap option to the buyer; instead, the received lot is subjected to an acceptance sampling plan before the lot can be accepted. In addition, for real life cases, destructive testing of items in the acceptance sample must be performed to test the acceptability of the items in the lot, as in packaged food and electrical wires. This paper will develop an EOQ model when items are of perfect and imperfect quality and a single acceptance sampling plan with destructive testing and inspection errors is adopted. It is assumed that when the lot is rejected, items in the rejected lot are sold at a secondary market at a reduced price and the buyer will place another order. It is also assumed that there are inspection errors...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [42]- 46) Traditional SPC techniques, {{such as the}} Shewhart control charts, {{require a}} minimum lot size quantity of 100 pieces {{in order to obtain}} sufficient data for their use. Small lot size manufacturers are generally unable to use these techniques because of this requirement. As a result, many small lot size manufacturers still rely upon <b>100</b> % part <b>inspection</b> by each machine operator or by a separate department. This study examined the use of a process control method known as pre-control as compared to <b>100</b> % operator <b>inspection</b> in a small lot size manufacturing environment. Although its overall effectiveness as a process control method is uncertain, pre-control has potential in small lot size manufacturing because it only requires 5 pieces to qualify the process. Quality characteristics examined in order to compare the two methods included dimensional variation and departure from the target value. The procedure used was a time series design. An initial sample of 129 parts was machined on a numerically controlled lathe using 100 % operator control as the method of process control. After training the same operator in the rules of pre-control, another sample of 129 parts was run on the same machine using pre-control. The 129 piece part samples were made up of similar parts which each contained a single, common feature. Dimensions produced on this common feature were inspected and recorded by the operator. After analyzing the data obtained, {{the results of the study}} showed pre-control to be more effective than <b>100</b> % operator <b>inspection</b> in guiding operators toward a desired target dimension. As quantified by the Taguchi loss function, tangible economic loss occurs as a part dimension departs from its ideal target dimension. The results of the study were inconclusive in regard to the effect of pre-control as compared to <b>100</b> % <b>inspection</b> on dimensional variation of parts produced. Subtle differences in the overall shape and material removal methods of the different parts used in the 129 piece pre-control sample distorted the overall calculated dispersion. However, analysis of subgroups which were made up of similar shaped parts showed no significant difference in the amount of dispersion present in parts produced by each method. M. S.
