We concluded that the technical trading rules examined have strongly predictive ability in term of Vietnamese data. The rules have greater forecasting power for Vietnamese than those for some other Asian markets. Using all the VMA rules and averaging the results yields annualized profit of 39. 05 % before trading cost, compared to 37. 29 % in Thailand and 29. 2 % in some other emerging Asian markets. The profitability of short-term technical trading rules is better than that of longer-term ones. We realize that the (1, 10, 0) <b>rule,</b> (<b>1,</b> <b>20,</b> 0) <b>rule,</b> and (<b>1,</b> 50, 0) rule are determined to be very effective in Vietnamese stock market because they allow investors to make a large excess returns before trading cost. Specially, unlike almost prior studies for other emerging markets, we prove that the technical trading rules are profitable, even after adjusting for trading costs. However, they are not effective to create access returns for investors in the Vietnamese market after reducing trading costs...|$|R

With this purpose, in our study the theoretical and the practical studies about the 80 / <b>20</b> <b>rule</b> in the literature of library and information science are dealt with. Furthermore an example concerning the 80 / <b>20</b> <b>rule</b> is given. The database of our example is 1271 articles published on the subject of museology in the “The Bibliography of Articles in Turkish Periodicals” between 1923 - 2002.

40|$|In this attempt, {{which is}} a second part of discussions on tapped density {{optimisation}} for four agricultural wastes (particles of coconut, periwinkle, palm kernel and egg shells), performance analysis for comparative basis is made. This paper pioneers a study direction in which optimisation of process variables are pursued using Taguchi method integrated with the Pareto 80 - <b>20</b> <b>rule.</b> Negative percentage improvements resulted when the optimal tapped density was compared with the average tapped density. However, the performance analysis between optimal tapped density and the peak tapped density values yielded positive percentage improvements for the four filler particles. The performance analysis results validate the effectiveness of using the Taguchi method in improving the tapped density properties of the filler particles. The application of the Pareto 80 - <b>20</b> <b>rule</b> to the table of parameters and levels produced revised tables of parameters and levels which helped to identify the factor-levels position of each parameter that is economical to optimality. The Pareto 80 - <b>20</b> <b>rule</b> also produced revised S/N response tables which were used to know the relevant S/N ratios {{that are relevant to}} optimality...|$|R

40|$|The {{online auction}} {{market has been}} growing rapidly, {{but what are the}} {{significant}} effects on Taiwan? Based upon the 80 / <b>20</b> <b>rule</b> and the Long Tail, the paper started its observation by taking Yahoo Auction platform as a case study and found a negative co-variance existing between performance and the number of online sellers. A further analysis showed that these 20 % sellers promoted more items of goods online than numerous online sellers with less efficient performance. The former ones were found to have attracted more patronage than 80 % of the sellers do, and they were capable of promoting both popular and rare goods, which led to sustained revenues in E-commerce. The paper concluded that 80 % of economies of scale in the online auction market are characterized by higher performance sellers that constitute 20 % of the whole participants, a sign that proves supportive of the 80 / <b>20</b> <b>rule.</b> These <b>20</b> % sellers display more items of goods online and create more revenues than those of the lower performance sellers do, a sign that reflects the Long Tail. The co-existence of the 80 / <b>20</b> <b>rule</b> and the Long Tail, may serve as a preliminary study for further academic research...|$|R
