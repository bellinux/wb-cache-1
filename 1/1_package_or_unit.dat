40|$|The {{limitation}} of liability is a legal institute {{that can be found}} in international conventions as well as in local regulations in differ¬ent countries.

Regarding the de-crease of the real value of the currencies, the Montreal convention has provided a good solution by which taking into account those countries that are against the amounts increase will at least to some extent decrease the negative effect of the decrease of value of the currencies and thereby improve the position of the carrier in relation to the transport users (all of this of course to the loss of the consumer) ...|$|R
40|$|Current assay {{evaluates the}} {{internal}} quality of eggs of Hy-Line W- 36 hens, according to storage time, temperature and packaging. Two equal experiments, starting one day apart, {{were conducted with}} 140 eggs each. The two experiments {{were divided into two}} phases, from 1 to 9 days and from 9 to 21 days, in a randomized block design. In the 1 st phase, the treatments were arranged in a factorial 2 x 3 + <b>1,</b> <b>packaging</b> (with <b>or</b> without), time (3, 6 and 9 days), with control on the 1 st day. In the 2 nd phase, treatments were arranged in a factorial design 2 x 2 + <b>1,</b> <b>packaging</b> (with <b>or</b> without), cooling (with or without), and control on the 9 th day. Egg weight, albumen, yolk and shell percentage, yolk index and Haugh unit were evaluated. The internal quality was reduced (p 0. 05) on the 9 th and 21 st days. Packaging assured better quality (p < 0. 05), but not similar to the quality of refrigerated eggs. Results showed that the internal quality of the eggs was worse when there was no refrigeration during storage time and that packages provided better internal quality, although not as effective as cooling. ...|$|R
40|$|The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Regulations for {{the safe}} {{packaging}} and transportation of radioactive materials follow a graded {{approach to the}} requirements for both packaging and controls during transport. The concept is that, the lower the risk posed {{to the people and}} the environment by the contents, (1) the less demanding are the packaging requirements and (2) the smaller in number are the controls imposed on the transport of the material. There are likely to be a great number of situations arising in coming years when large objects, contaminated with radioactive material having unlimited A{sub 2 } values will result from various decommissioning and decontamination (D and D) activities and will then require shipment from the D and D site to a disposal site. Such situations may arise relatively frequently during the cleanup of operations involving mining, milling, feedstock, and uranium enrichment processing facilities. Because these objects are contaminated with materials having an unlimited A{sub 2 } value they present a low radiological risk to worker and public safety and to the environment during transport. However, when these radioactive materials reside on the surfaces of equipment and other large objects, where the equipment and objects themselves are not radioactive, the radioactive materials appear as surface contamination and, if the contaminated object is categorized as a surface contaminated object, it would need to be packaged for shipment according to the requirements of the Regulations for SCO. Despite this categorization, alternatives may be available which will allow these contaminants, when considered by themselves for packaging and transport, to be categorized as either (1) a limited quantity of radioactive material to be shipped in an excepted <b>package</b> <b>or</b> (2) low specific activity (LSA) materials to be shipped in an IP- <b>1</b> <b>package</b> <b>or</b> possibly even shipped unpackaged.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of gamma radiation associated with modified atmosphere on postharvest quality of guavas ‘Pedro Sato’. It was used guavas from the region of Vista Alegre do Alto/São Paulo/Brazil. After harvest, the fruits were immediately transported to the Fruit and Vegetables Laboratory from the Agroindustrial Management and Technology Department, Agronomic Sciences College - UNESP - Botucatu / SP, where they were kept at 10 ° C and 90 - 95 % RH in cold storage, for 28 days. It was used the randomized design, with factorial scheme 5 x 5, three repetitions. The first factor consisted of the following effects: control <b>1</b> (without <b>package</b> <b>or</b> irradiation), control 2 (polystyrene package/PS + package low density polyethylene/LDPE and without irradiation), treatment 1 (PS + LDPE and 0. 2 kGy), treatment 2 (PS + LDPE and 0. 6 kGy) and treatment 3 (PS + LDPE and 1. 0 kGy). The second factor consisted of the evaluation periods: 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. The analyses were: firmness, soluble solids (SS), titratable acidity (TA), maturity index, pH, respiration rate. Concluded that high doses of irradiation promoted a negative effect on physical-chemical characteristics of guava ‘Pedro Sato’, verifying that only the lowest dose associated with modified atmosphere provided fruits with higher quality and acceptability, due to higher maturation rate and soluble solids obtained. Regarding the days of analysis, there were no positive effect of the treatments during storage, where only the early days promoted better values for the variables studied...|$|R

40|$|A source release {{model was}} {{developed}} to quantify time dependent liquid phase releases of radioactive material to the vadose zone from a disposal site. The model has been implemented to evaluate the source terms in the Performance Assessment for the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) Disposal Facility at Area G, {{an analysis of the}} long term post-closure impact of disposal operations required by the USDOE orders. Analytic solutions describe transport through the model compartments: the solid phase waste package, the liquid phase within each waste package and the liquid phase within the disposal unit. The model accounts for elemental solubility limits and retardation coefficients (Rf) separately in the waste package and in the disposal unit. Several parameters define the site specific aspects of the disposal unit. In our case for example, the disposal unit is waste buried with crushed volcanic tuff, and a small net infiltration rate is determined from independent numerical studies. The analytic solution allows efficient explorations of the sensitivity to the input parameters. Numerical solutions extend the model to account for decay product ingrowth which may have different transport properties than the parent nuclides. Results show source release rates verses <b>package</b> <b>or</b> disposal <b>unit</b> Kd, and effects of solubility limits. At the LANL LLRW disposal site, only thorium, uranium and some low-level nuclides are solubility limited. Otherwise, a {open_quote}rapid rinse{close_quote} waste package category dominates the peak disposal unit efflux which occurs for the LANL disposal site at about 100 years for nuclides with Kd= 0 (Rf= 1) and for proportionately longer times as Kd or Rf increases. Additional simple analytic models or detailed numerical codes can be coupled to these results to predict groundwater concentrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{overall goal}} of {{this portion of the}} project was to <b>package</b> one <b>or</b> more <b>unit</b> processes, as modular {{components}} in vertical and/or horizontal recirculation wells, for treatment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [e. g., trichloroethene (TCE) ] and radionuclides [e. g., technetium (Tc) {sup 99 }] in groundwater. The project was conceived, in part, because the coexistence of chlorinated hydrocarbons and radionuclides has been identified as the predominant combination of groundwater contamination in the US Department of Energy (DOE) complex. Thus, a major component of the project was the development of modules that provide simultaneous treatment of hydrocarbons and radionuclides. The project objectives included: (1) evaluation of horizontal wells for inducing groundwater recirculation, (2) development of below-ground treatment modules for simultaneous removal of VOCs and radionuclides, and (3) demonstration of a coupled system (treatment module with recirculation well) at a DOE field site where both VOCs and radionuclides are present in the groundwater. This report is limited to the innovative treatment aspects of the program. A report on pilot testing of the horizontal recirculation system was the first report of the series (Muck et al. 1996). A comprehensive report that focuses on the engineering, cost and hydrodynamic aspects of the project has also been prepared (Korte et al. 1997 a) ...|$|R
