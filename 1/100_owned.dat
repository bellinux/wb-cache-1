40|$|Abstract: Background and Aims: Ehrlichiosis is an {{emerging}} tick-borne zoonotic disease {{caused by the}} gram-negative coccid obligate intracellular bacteria of the family Anaplasmataceae. Since the only available evidence in regard to monocytic Ehrlichiosis in Iran is related to dogs, {{the present study was}} designed to use the polymerase chain reaction assay for confirming the presence of Ehrlichia spp. in tick infested client-owned dogs in Kerman. Methods: Blood samples were prepared randomly from <b>100</b> <b>owned</b> tick infested dogs regardless of clinical status. Complete blood count was done for each sample and in the next step, DNA extraction was done and PCR was carried out by a commercial kit. Results: Six of 100 (6...|$|E

40|$|A coproscopy {{survey was}} {{conducted}} on <b>100</b> <b>owned</b> dogs in Kerman city from July 2011 to July 2012 with the objective to assess the presence of Gastrointestinal parasites with zoonotic potential. Faecal samples from 100 dogs were examined {{for the presence of}} parasites. Samples (n= 100) collected from dogs of different ages and genders were analysed using 5 techniques, i. e. centrifugal flotation in sucrose solution, centrifugal flotation in 33 % Zinc sulphate solution, Ziehl-Neelsen staining, trichrome staining, and iodine staining. The overall proportion of Gastrointestinal parasitic infection was 16 % (16 / 100). The most frequently observed parasites in this study were Toxocara canis (9 %), followed by Taeniidae eggs (3 %), Cryptosporidium spp. (3 %), Troglotrema salmincola (1 %), Toxoscaris leonina (1 %) and Isospora canis (1 %). Most of the dogs (62 %) included in the study were regularly dewormed and no significant association was found between parasitic infection and sex, age and breed of the dogs. It is noteworthy {{that this is the first}} report of Troglotrema salmincola infection in Iran...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the low prevalence of Dirofilaria immitis in dogs in Johor Bahru as reported by veterinary practitioners, using wet blood mount, Knott’s Concentration Test and two heartworm antigen test kits (IDEXX Canine SNAP ® 4 Dx and RapiGEN®). This study also compared the two test kits used and determined the microfilaria species. Blood were collected from <b>100</b> <b>owned</b> dogs and 50 stray dogs in Johor Bahru via cephalic venipuncture. A thick blood smear was done and examined for samples that were positive for microfilaria species identification. The overall prevalence of D. immitis in dogs in Johor Bahru was 1. 33 % (2 / 150) and the microfilaria identified was D. immitis. The prevalence of heartworm in owned and stray dogs in this study was 1 % and 2 % respectively. With only one false negative result from RapiGEN ® test kit, comparing the sensitivity between the two test kits could not be achieved. The low prevalence of D. immitis found in this study confirmed anecdotal evidence that prevalence of dirofilariasis is indeed low in Johor Bahru. Additionally, we speculate that dirofilariasis in dogs might be considered as an indicator of vector availability. Heartworm disease is of considerabl...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of villagers in the rural Lau Lagoon, Malaita Province, Solomon Islands, as they adopt mobile phones. I discuss how the adoption of mobile phone technology affects and is affected by existing information-communication technologies; how {{and to what extent}} Lau adoption of mobile phones is circumscribed by the marginal place of the Lau in globalized capitalist economies; and I elaborate on the main controversies that surround the adoption and use of mobile phones, local conceptualizations of how digital technologies work, their morality, what they are meant to be used for and for what they are not to be used. Specifically, I focus on the two primary functions of mobile phones in Gwou’ulu: the mobile phone as (1) telephone and (2) as movie-watching device. Theoretically, I rework approaches to technography for an investigation of digital technology and media consumption with a focus on mobile phones—in 2014 of the approximate 250 adults living in Gwou’ulu, <b>100</b> <b>owned</b> a personal mobile phone and many more shared a mobile phone. Technography, or ethnographies of technology, offers a strategic multi-disciplinary combination that examines the historical, economic, political, religious, environmental and material conditions that constitute the realm of possibilities that constrain but also facilitate particular sets of choices made by individuals in response to the adoption of new technologies such as mobile phones. My methods for data collection are a combination of participant observation and open ended interviews on individual mobile phone usage. My findings show village life in a transition period of technological and social digitization. They highlight how, in the Lau Lagoon, mobile phones shift information-communication technologies (ICTs) from the public to the private realm and how an individualized consumption of mobile phones fuels uncertainties as to if and how mobile phones, as telephone or as movie-watching devices, transform social relationships among village residents as well as relationships between villagers and their urban relatives. I argue that mobile phones and their diverse functions—from telephony to movie player to calculator—are best described as super-compositional objects because they encompass and agitate so many of the social relationships and cultural values that are otherwise the defining features of a particular group of peoples in a particular place...|$|E
