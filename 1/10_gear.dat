50|$|This {{nomogram}} {{is a real}} geometric calculator exactly {{representing the}} rotational speeds of the transmission's 3x4 = 12 internal shafts for each of its 9 ratios (+ reverse), grouped according to their 4 permanent coupling on 3 joint ordinates and 5 independent ordinates. These ordinates are positioned on the abscissa in strict accordance with the proportions of the sun gears' teeth numbers relative to those of their rings. Consequently, the output ratios on the 3rd ordinate (carrier of the third planetary gearset) follows closely those of the actual transmission. This advantageous geometric construction sets us free from Willis' famous and tedious formula, because all calculations are exclusively determined by lengths ratios, respectively teeth numbers on the abscissa for the 4 epicyclic ratios, and of rotational speeds on the 3rd ordinate for the <b>10</b> <b>gear</b> ratios.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{most of the}} {{factories}} use lift indicators to guide the mill operators in adjusting their roller speeds. However, {{it is not only}} important to keep the roller floating all the time, but as pointed out earlier, ' great importance should be attached {{to the fact that the}} rollers should remain as closely as possible to a predetermined position, as any movement of the top roller affects the work ratio. The necessity of keeping the top roller at its predetermined position prompted the S. M. R. I. to develop a reliable means of continuously recording the lift of a top roller. Further important considerations were the advantage of having an instrument that enables the staff to carry out a "from minute to minute " control, the fact that the S. M. R. I. intends to propose the initiation of a system of "Mutual Milling Control " and the fact that some investigations concerning moisture in final bagasse were being conducted at Illovo. As direct recording was regarded as being impossible, due to the constant vibrations of a mill, an electrical system was selected. Since it was considered essential to make measurements both at pinion and at pintle sides of the mill, a six-point recording mA meter was transformed into a two-point recorder by short circuiting the terminals. Basically, the linear movement of the roller plus bearing is transformed into a rotating one by means of a chain, sprocket wheel and contraweight (all very cheap Meccano parts). A movement of 0. 5 " of the roller causes a rotation of 29 ° of the sprocket wheel, and as a potentiometer normally. turns 290 - 300 ° between its extreme positions, the potentiometer was linked with the sprocket wheel by means of a 1 : <b>10</b> <b>gear</b> ratio (also Meccano parts). Hence, a movement of 0. 5 " of the top roller caused the potentiometer to rotate over its full range. A rectifier with voltage stabilisation was built in order to make the reading independent of possible variations in the voltage of the mains, and the circuit decided upon is shown in Fig. I (see also Appendix) ...|$|E

Two testing torques provided nominal pitch-line Hertz stresses greater and lesser than the contact stress limit as recommended by the grease manufacturer. As was expected, all tests resulted in some gear tooth wear. Discoloration of the perfluoro type grease occurred for all tests. Tests in dry nitrogen produced some dark-grey colored perfluoro type grease. Testing in either ambient or dry air produced red debris after short test duration, and for tests of longer duration large amounts of red debris, red grease, and wear were evident. Tests using higher torques produced more debris. The first indications of discoloration occurred more quickly with higher test torques.

The gear pitch diameter was 8. 89 cm (3. 5 in.). Test conditions were a gear temperature of 350 K (170 " F), a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 71 x 109 N/m 2 (248 000 psi), and a speed of 10 000 rpm. The shot-peened gears exhibited pitting fatigue lives 1. 6 times {{the life of the}} standard gears without shot peening.

In January 1991, Werner Reith, a German journalist from the newspaper Tageszeitung, suggested in an article that the Ramstein disaster could have been caused by some sudden technical problem—or even sabotage—in Nutarelli's plane. No supporting evidence could be collected. Reith pointed out that Lt. Col. Nutarelli and Lt. Col. Naldini were supposed to know details about another air disaster, the 1980 Ustica Massacre, citing Italian press sources.

One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between <b>10</b> and 18 <b>gears)</b> {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|R
25|$|The {{combination}} of 3 chainrings and an 8-sprocket cogset does {{not result in}} 24 usable gear ratios. Instead it provides 3 overlapping ranges of 7, 8, and 7 gear ratios. The outer ranges only have 7 ratios rather than 8 because the extreme combinations (largest chainring to largest rear sprocket, smallest chainring to smallest rear sprocket) result in a very diagonal chain alignment which is inefficient and causes excessive chain wear. Due to the overlap, there will usually be some duplicates or near-duplicates, so that there might only be 16 or 18 distinct gear ratios. It may not be feasible to use these distinct ratios in strict low-high sequence anyway due to the complicated shifting patterns involved (e.g. simultaneous double or triple shift on the rear derailleur and a single shift on the front derailleur). In the worst case there could be only <b>10</b> distinct <b>gear</b> ratios, if the percentage step between chainrings {{is the same as}} the percentage step between sprockets. However, if the most popular ratio is duplicated then it may be feasible to extend the life of the gear set by using different versions of this popular ratio.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Tractor {{drivers are}} {{continuously}} exposed to whole body vibration during driving that, this may cause disorders {{in the system}} of musculoskeletal, nervous, circulatory and occupational diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate exposed to whole body vibration among tractor driver.. Material and Method: In this study, whole-body vibration parameters such as root mean square (rms) of acceleration, total equivalent acceleration, vibration dose value (VDV) and crest factor (CF) were separately compared in three directions (x, y, and z), in 3 Massey Ferguson Model 165 Tractor it was done during 3 different modes of transport (without trailer, with empty trailer and with a trailer load of soil), plowing the land and loading trailer in working conditions with various gear according to the guidelines of ISO 2631 standard.. Result: The results showed that in all measuring points, exposure to whole body vibration was higher than permissible level and the risks of disorders exist. Exposure to vibration were as with empty trailer (43. 11 m/s 2). The maximum of crest factor was obtained for transportation mode of empty trailer with 3 <b>gear</b> (<b>10.</b> 7), then plowing (7. 35) and loading soil(6. 50). The maximum of vibration dose value was eventuated for transportation mode with empty trailer with 4 gear (189. 92 m/s 1. 75) and 3 gear (108. 15 m/s 1. 75). In all measuring modes exposure with vibration in Y direction was greater than X and Z axes.. Conclusion: This study shows that the need to provide intervention, controlling and managing measures to eliminate or reduce exposure to whole body vibration among tractor drivers its necessary. And, preventing main disorder Including musculoskeletal disorders, discomfort and early fatigue is of circular importance. More studies are also necessary to identify the sources of vibration among various of tractors...|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{of various}} {{components}} in rotating machinery like gearboxes may generate excitation forces at various frequencies. These frequencies may sometimes overlap with {{the frequencies of}} the forces generated by other components in the system. Conventional vibration spectrum analysis does not attenuate noise and spectral frequency band overlapping, which in many applications masks {{the changes in the}} structural response caused by the deterioration of certain components in the machine. This problem is overcome by the use of time domain averaging (dsynchronous averaging). In time domain averaging, the vibration signal is sampled at a frequency that is synchronized with the rotation of the gear of interest and the samples obtained for each singular position of the gear are ensemble-averaged. When sufficient averages are taken, all the vibration from the gearbox, which is asynchronous with the vibration of the gear, is attenuated. The resulting time synchronously averaged signal obtained through this process indicates the vibration produced during one rotation of the monitored gear. This direct time domain averaging process essentially acts as a broadband noise synchronous filter, which filters out the frequency content that is asynchronous with the vibration of the gear of interest provided that enough averages are taken. The time domain averaging procedure requires an enormous amount of vibration data to execute, making it very difficult to develop online gearbox condition monitoring systems that make use of time domain averaging to enhance their diagnostic capabilities since data acquisition and analysis cannot be done simultaneously. The objective of this research was to develop a more efficient way for calculating the time domain average of a gear vibration signal. A study of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) was conducted to assess their suitability for use in time domain averaging. Two time domain averaging models that use ANNs and SVMs were developed. Model 1 uses a single feedforward network configuration to map the input which are rotation synchronized gear vibration signals to the output which is the time domain average of the gear vibration signal, using only a section of the input space. Model 2 operates in two stages. In the first stage, it uses a feedforward network to predict the instantaneous time domain average of the <b>gear</b> vibration after <b>10</b> inputs (<b>10</b> rotation synchronized <b>gear</b> vibration signals) to predict the instantaneous average of the gear rotation. The outputs from the first state are used as inputs to the second stage, where a second feedforward network is used to predict the time domain average of the entire vibration signal. When ANNs and SVMs were implemented, the results indicated that the amount of gear vibration date that is required to calculate the time domain average using Model 1 can be reduced by 75 percent and the amount of gear vibration data that needs to be stored in the data acquisition system when Model 2 is used can be reduced by 83 percent.
