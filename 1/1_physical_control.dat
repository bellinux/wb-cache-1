40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>controls</b> are now {{ubiquitous}} in everyday interactions. Empirical studies of physical interactions {{have traditionally been}} exploring instrumental aspects such as error rate and experienced workload. Recently, affective aspects of physical interaction have attracted an increased interest. In this paper we further argue that <b>physical</b> <b>controls</b> might have a character. We describe an exploratory study that aimed at understanding whether individuals form character judgments of <b>physical</b> <b>controls</b> based on haptic information, and explored the diversity across individuals’ inference processes...|$|R

40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>controls</b> such as knobs, sliders, {{and buttons}} are {{experiencing}} a revival as many computing systems progress from personal computing architectures towards ubiquitous computing architectures. We demonstrate {{a process for}} measuring and comparing visceral emotional responses of a <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> to performance results of a target acquisition task. In our user study, participants experienced mechanical and rendered friction, inertia, and detent dynamics as they turned a haptic knob towards graphical targets of two different widths and amplitudes. Together, this process and user study provide novel affect- and performance-based design guidance to developers of <b>physical</b> <b>controls</b> for emerging ubiquitous computing environments. Our work bridges extensive human factors work in mechanical systems that peaked in the 1960 ’s, to contemporary trends, with a goal of integrating mechatronic controls into emerging ubiquitous computing systems.

40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>controls</b> are {{fabricated}} through complicated {{assembly of}} parts requiring expensive machinery and {{are prone to}} mechanical wear. One solution is to embed controls directly in interactive surfaces, but the proprioceptive part of gestural interaction that makes <b>physical</b> <b>controls</b> discoverable and usable solely by hand gestures is lost {{and has to be}} compensated, by vibrotactile feedback for instance. Vibrotactile actuators face the same aforementioned issues as for <b>physical</b> <b>controls.</b> We propose printed vibrotactile actuators and sensors. They are printed on plastic sheets, with piezoelectric ink for actuation, and with silver ink for conductive elements, such as wires and capacitive sensors. These printed actuators and sensors make it possible to design vibrotactile widgets on curved surfaces, without complicated mechanical assembly...|$|R

Fathers with strong stereotypical gender-role attitudes and mothers were observed to use more <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> strategies with boys than with girls, whereas fathers with strong counterstereotypical attitudes toward gender roles used more <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> with girls than with boys. Moreover, when fathers had strong attitudes toward gender roles (stereotypical or counterstereotypical), their differential treatment of boys and girls completely accounted for the gender differences in children's aggressive behavior a year later. Mothers' gender-differentiated parenting practices were unrelated to gender differences in child aggression...|$|R

40|$|When using today’s {{productivity}} applications, people {{rely heavily}} on graphical controls (GUI widgets) as the way to invoke application functions and to obtain feedback. Yet {{we all know that}} certain controls can be difficult or tedious to find and use. As an alternative, a customizable physical interface lets an end-user easily bind a modest number of <b>physical</b> <b>controls</b> to similar graphical counterparts. The user can then use the <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> to invoke the corresponding graphical control’s function, or to display its graphical state in a physical form. To show how customizable physical interfaces work, we present examples that illustrate how our combined phidgets ® and widget tap packages are used to link existing application widgets to <b>physical</b> <b>controls.</b> While promising, our implementation prompts a number of issues relevant to others pursuing interface customization...|$|R

It does this by aggregating, packaging, and utilizing information generated during supply chain activities and matching this information with the <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> of goods. The coupling of information and <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> enables lenders to mitigate financial risk within the supply chain.

40|$|We {{present a}} study which compares touchscreen-based <b>controls</b> and <b>physical</b> <b>controls</b> for game input using Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed: Altair’s Chronicles. Our study used the Apple iPhone as a {{representative}} touchscreen-based controller and the Nintendo DS for its <b>physical</b> <b>control</b> pad. Participants completed a game level four times on each platform. Level completion time and number of player deaths were recorded. Results indicate that physical buttons allowed significantly better performance than virtual buttons. Specifically, the number of character deaths on the iPhone was 150 % higher than on the DS, while level completion time on the DS was 42 % faster. The learning curve for the touchscreen version of the game was also steeper. Participants strongly preferred the physical buttons of the Nintendo DS. We conclude that either game designers should consider alternative input methods for touchscreen devices, or hardware designers should consider the inclusion of <b>physical</b> <b>controls...</b>|$|R
