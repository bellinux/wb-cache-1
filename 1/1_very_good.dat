The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the relationships of self-reported appetite score and the estimated energy and protein intakes in a cohort of ESKD patients attending the pre-dialysis assessment clinic. As part of the routine assessment, patients were asked to rate their appetite using the ADAT; their dietary intake was assessed by the renal dietitian using a structured diet history method and computer software analysis. Of the 205 patient assessed, 60. 5 % were male; mean age was 65. 7 ± 13. 6 years and mean GFR was 17. 0 ± 4. 2  ml/min. 39. 5 % were rated as malnourished (SGA score B&C). 69. 8 % of patients rated their appetite as (<b>1)</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> or (2) good, whereas 30. 2 % rated their appetite as (3) fair or (4) poor or (5) very poor. Intakes of > 25  kcal/kg IBW/d and > 0. 75  g/Kg IBW/d were considered adequate for energy and protein respectively. The mean ±SD of energy and protein intakes rated by the appetite score are as follow: Appetite score 1 + 2 (Good) 3 + 4 + 5 (Reduced) P value Energy kcal/kgIBW/d 24. 4 ± 6. 7 20. 7 ± 6. 6 < 0. 0001 Protein g/kgIBW/d 1. 21 ± 0. 42 1. 00 ± 0. 43 < 0. 004 The positive predictive value (95 %CI) of appetite rating for energy and protein were 0. 37 (0. 32 – 0. 41) and 0. 90 (0. 86 – 0. 93) respectively.

40|$|Aims. A {{solution}} of the radiative-transfer problem in 3 D with arbitrary velocity fields in the Eulerian frame is presented. The method is implemented in our 3 D radiative transfer framework and used in the PHOENIX/ 3 D code. It is tested by comparison to our well-tested 1 D co-moving frame radiative transfer code, where the treatment of a monotonic velocity field is implemented in the Lagrangian frame. The Eulerian formulation does not need much additional memory and is useable on state-of-the-art computers, even large-scale applications with 1000 ’s of wavelength points are feasible. Methods. In the Eulerian formulation of the problem, the photon is seen by the atom at a Doppler-shifted wavelength depending on its propagation direction, {{which leads to a}} Doppler-shifted absorption and emission. This leads to a different source function and a different Λ ∗ operator in the radiative transfer equations compared to the static case. Results.

Previous results obtained in our laboratory have identified specific molecules in the oviduct that affect porcine sperm–egg interactions. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether the contact between oocytes and oviductal fluid also affect embryo development, quality, and gene expression. In vitromatured porcine oocytes were exposed to bovine oviductal fluid (bOF) for 30 min prior to fertilization. Cleavage and blastocyst development rates were significantly higher from bOF-treated oocytes than from untreated oocytes. Blastocysts obtained from bOF-treated oocytes had significantly greater total cell numbers than those obtained from untreated oocytes. Using real-time PCR, grade <b>1</b> (<b>very</b> <b>good</b> morphological quality) and grade 2 (good morphological quality) blastocysts were analyzed for gene transcripts related to apoptosis (BAX, BCL 2 L 1), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transcription/replication (POLG, POLG 2, and TFAM), blastomere connection and morula compaction (GJA 1), and blastocyst formation and pluripotency (POU 5 F 1). We found that the entire set of genes analyzed was differentially expressed between grade 1 and 2 blastocysts. Furthermore, bOF treatment reduced the ratio of BAX to BCL 2 L 1 transcripts and enhanced the abundance of TFAM transcripts in grade 2 blastocysts. Not only do these findings demonstrate that factors within the bOF act on porcine oocytes both quickly and positively, but they also suggest that such factors could promote embryo development and quality by protecting them against adverse impacts on mtDNA transcription/replication and apoptosis induced by the cultur...|$|E

METHODS: Patients who reported an ADR to the Dutch Pharmacovigilance Centre {{for the first time in}} the period between October 2012 and April 2013 were included. Reporters received personalized feedback or a general acknowledgement letter. Satisfaction towards the received feedback, expressed on a 5 -point Likert scale (<b>1</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> to 5 very poor), was studied using a web-based questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Pearson Chi-square test and linear regression analysis. Statistical significance was based on p < 0. 05. RESULTS: A total of 471 patient-reporters were contacted with a total response of 52. 5 %. Respondents of both groups were satisfied with the received feedback, average score 2 (good). Respondents of the personalized feedback-group were however more satisfied score 2. 0 versus 2. 5 (p < 0. 001) and considered the feedback more clear and useful compared with respondents of the acknowledgement letter-group, respectively score 1. 6 versus 1. 7 (p = 0. 01) and score 2. 1 versus 2. 5 (p < 0. 001).
