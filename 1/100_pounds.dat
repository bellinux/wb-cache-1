5|$|In 1940 Julian {{was able}} to produce 100lb of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($ today) as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing <b>100</b> <b>pounds</b> daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The soy {{stigmasterol}} was easily converted into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 ($ today), was shipped to the buyer, Upjohn, in an armored car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed.|$|E

In 984, in obedience to a vision of St Andrew, he persuaded King Æthelred to appoint Ælfheah as Bishop of Winchester in succession to Æthelwold.

5|$|The eastern {{market for}} {{ice in the}} U.S. was also changing. Cities like New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia saw their {{population}} boom {{in the second half}} of the century; New York tripled in size between 1850 and 1890, for example. This drove up the demand for ice considerably across the region. By 1879, householders in the eastern cities were consuming two thirds of a ton (601kg) of ice a year, being charged 40 cents ($9.30) per <b>100</b> <b>pounds</b> (45kg); 1,500 wagons were needed just to deliver ice to consumers in New York.|$|E
5|$|While bishop, Hervey {{ordered the}} {{compilation}} {{of a history}} of the refounding of the abbey of Ely, which later became incorporated into the Liber Eliensis. This was a Latin reworking of an Old English book of grants compiled by Bishop Æthelwold of Winchester. He was energetic in recovering the feudal rights of the bishopric against knights who had intruded themselves on the lands, but were not rendering knight service to the bishop. As bishop, he attended a legatine council, or council held by a papal legate, in 1127, and a royal council in 1129, but otherwise his administrative actions remain obscure. The causeway between the island of Ely and Exning, which made it easier for pilgrims to visit the shrine of Saint Ethelreda, was built under Hervey's orders. Insight into his activities as bishop is given in the Pipe Roll of 1130, the first surviving Pipe Roll. In that record, Hervey is recorded as owing King Henry 45 pounds to provide an office for a nephew, <b>100</b> <b>pounds</b> on an old settlement with the king, another <b>100</b> <b>pounds</b> for the settlement of a case dealing with Ramsey Abbey, Bury St. Edmunds Abbey and the bishop, 240 pounds for the right to be rid of a surplus of knights, and finally 1000 pounds for the king to allow the bishop's knights to serve castleguard at Ely instead of Norwich.|$|E
5|$|In 1102 Robert de Bellême {{rebelled against}} King Henry I of England. Although Pantulf was still {{deprived}} {{of his previous}} holdings, he offered to support Robert, but was rebuffed and instead supported the king. Henry placed Stafford Castle in Pantulf's custody. Besides controlling Stafford Castle, Pantulf mediated between Henry {{and some of the}} Welsh princes, who had previously sided with Robert, and helped secure their support for the king. Later Pantulf again acted as an envoy for the king, being sent to secure the switch of sides of Robert's men who were holding Bridgnorth. Pantulf won their change of sides by offering the men lands worth a <b>100</b> <b>pounds</b> on the king's behalf. His services to the king earned Pantulf the restoration of his confiscated estates as well as the grant of further lands—including the fief of Roger de Courcelles.|$|E

5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over <b>100</b> <b>pounds</b> of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year had the idea of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 41) An {{analytical method}} {{was developed to}} predict the temperature distribution in rocket engine combustion chambers and exit nozzles when liquid or gaseous propellant {{is used as a}} film coolant which is injected along the walls of the chamber and nozzle. This film of coolant acts as a barrier to heat transfer between the hot combustion gases and the walls of the rocket engine. The results obtained using this analytical method were compared to rocket engine test data from a <b>100</b> <b>pound</b> thrust radiation cooled system and a <b>100</b> <b>pound</b> thrust high conductivity heat sink systems. In both cases, the combustion chamber and nozzle wall temperatures obtained by the analytical method were accurate enough to provide confidence that the analysis could be extended to other designs.
