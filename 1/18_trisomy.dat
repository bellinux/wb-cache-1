40|$|<b>Trisomy</b> <b>18,</b> {{the second}} most common {{autosomal}} trisomy, is associated with multiple severe structural defects. Most fetuses of <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> can have one or more sonographically detectable structural abnormalities. This article provides an overview of the common sonographic features of the fetal <b>trisomy</b> <b>18,</b> with major and minor structural abnormalities including cardiac anomalies, malformations of the central nervous system, facial anomalies, gastrointestinal anomalies, limb anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, choroid plexus cysts and increased nuchal translucency or cystic hygroma. Several diseases may have phenotypic overlaps with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> syndrome, including <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> -like syndrome, Pena-Shokeir syndrome type I and arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. In addition, sex bias is significantly observed in <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> live births, and prenatal selection against male fetuses has been documented to be associated with more complex congenital anomalies. Because of the lethal birth defects in <b>trisomy</b> <b>18,</b> prenatal ultrasound is a valuable tool to detect a variety of congenital structural malformations of <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> throughout the gestation, and early sonographic identification of major structural defects and determination of the fetal sex can provide an appropriate genetic counseling and a more reasonable management for the pregnant women...|$|R

The median survival time for live births with full <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> was 14 days and with full trisomy 13 was 10 days, the 3 -month survival was 20 % and 18 %, respectively, and the 1 -year survival for both syndromes was 8 %.

This study is based on the largest data set on survival for live births with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> and <b>trisomy</b> 13.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Edward's {{syndrome}} (<b>trisomy</b> <b>18)</b> {{is a rare}} entity with {{a reported}} incidence of 1 / 3000 to 1 / 7000 births. Less than 10 % of patients survive beyond {{the first year of}} life, which may influence the fact that malignant tumors are rarely reported in association with this syndrome. Case presentation The authors report a rare case of a 6 -month-old girl with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> and multifocal hepatoblastoma. The course of the disease, autopsy results and review of the literature are presented. Conclusion Our case represents the seventh published case of hepatoblastoma in a patient with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> All of the seven published cases were women, possibly due to the high preponderance of females among the children with Edward's syndrome and longer survival of females with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> compared to males. Since both <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> and hepatoblastoma are rare conditions, the probability that a child with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> will independently develop a hepatoblastoma is very low. Therefore, we believe that the existence of these cases in children with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> indicates a significant association. It can be assumed that <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> potentiates the development of hepatoblastoma. Careful clinical and post-mortem studies are needed to recognize the real frequency of hepatoblastoma in children with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18,</b> who might die from different causes with unrecognizable hepatoblastoma. </p...|$|R

Seventy three percent of cases with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> or <b>trisomy</b> 13 resulted in a TOPFA. Amongst 468 live born babies with <b>trisomy</b> <b>18,</b> 80 % (76 - 83 %) had a cardiac anomaly, 21 % (17 - 25 %) had a nervous system anomaly, 8 % (6 - 11 %) had esophageal atresia and 10 % (8 - 13 %) had an orofacial cleft.

A total of 146 128 consecutive karyotypes for prenatal diagnosis from eight centres in four countries for 5 years were compared with predicted detection if probes for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y were used, and assuming 100 % detection efficiency.

Adjustment for causes of false-positive results identified during clinical testing (eg, maternal duplications) improved PPVs to 100 % for trisomy 21 and 96 % for <b>trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> This NIPS test demonstrates excellent discrimination between trisomic and unaffected pregnancies. The PPVs obtained in initial clinical testing are substantially higher than previously reported NIPS methods...|$|R
40|$|<b>Trisomy</b> <b>18</b> {{is a rare}} but classic genetic {{disorder}} that occurs in approximately 1 in 8000 live births. <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18</b> {{is no longer an}} esoteric disease but one with modern relevance given rapidly changing approaches in medical and surgical management. Once provided comfort-measures only, babies with <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18</b> are beginning to be managed intensively – with full cardio-respiratory support and surgical correction of birth defects. In particular, Japan has moved from a non-intervention approach to a consistent, national intensive approach for babies with <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> This paper investigates the outcomes of this intensive approach in order to determine an ethically-acceptable standard of care for babies with <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> Review of the Japanese medical literature shows that intensive management of babies with <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18</b> results in the prolongation of short-term life without an associated increase in long-term survival or cure. Standard quality of life measures are not improved, and significant concern remains regarding treatment-associated pain and suffering. Cardiac surgery increases the risk of post-operative sudden death and is not associated with an increase in long-term survival. This paper argues that the risk/benefit ratio for cardiac surgery is unacceptably high; therefore, such surgery should not be performed on babies with <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> It argues that, given families’ access to prominent news stories regarding <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18</b> babies and reports of this Japanese experience, families need to be counseled clearly and effectively about the evidence-based outcomes of intensive management. A “child-centered” approach that seeks to minimize the child’s suffering should be utilized with the goals of all treatment, including any intensive treatment, clear to all decision-making parties. Employing a Best-Interests Standard to guide decision-making supports a standard of care for neonates with <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18</b> that does not include cardiac surgery and that ensures provision of perinatal/neonatal palliative care. The paper argues that palliative care should be offered as the first option to families who receive a diagnosis of <b>Trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> These conclusions have implications for U. S. hospital policy and clinician practice. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{goal was}} to {{evaluate}} whether a normal ultrasound following a positive triple marker serum screen {{reduces the risk of}} having a <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> fetus to a level that is less than the procedure-related risk for amniocentesis. STUDY DESIGN: A nonrandomized, non-concurrent cohort chart review was performed of all women who screened positive (risk 3 ̆e 1 : 250) for <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> by triple marker serum testing through Spectrum Health Downtown Genetic Screening Program from June 1996 through September 1999. Of the 13, 618 serum samples screened, 158 were identified as being at an increased risk for <b>trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> Pediatric outcome was obtained through office documentation, review of birth records, or phone contact with the mother. RESULTS: Four cases of <b>trisomy</b> <b>18</b> were identified and all had abnormalities on ultrasound. CONCLUSION: The presence of normal ultrasound was not associated with significant increased risk for <b>trisomy</b> <b>18.</b> In this population, amniocentesis is not justified...|$|R
