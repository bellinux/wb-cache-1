50|$|The International Braille Chess Association (IBCA) is {{organization}} for {{blind and visually}} impaired chess players. The IBCA is a FIDE-affiliated chess organization as well {{as a part of the}} International Blind Sports Federation. The International Braille Chess Association originated informally in 1951 with the organization of the first international correspondence chess tournament for blind players, by Reginald Walter Bonham; the tournament included 20 players representing <b>10</b> <b>countries.</b> It <b>first</b> organized an over-the-board tournament in 1958, with representatives from seven countries. Today, it has grown to encompass over 50 member nations around the world. The IBCA hosts two major competitions: the Blind Chess Olympiad and the Blind World Chess Championship.|$|R
40|$|Respiratory syncytial virus {{genotype}} ON 1, {{which is}} characterized by a 72 -nt duplication in the attachment protein gene, has been detected in > <b>10</b> <b>countries</b> since <b>first</b> identified in Ontario, Canada, in 2010. We describe 2 waves of genotype ON 1 infections among children admitted to a rural hospital in Kenya during 2012. Phylogenetic analysis of attachment protein gene sequences showed multiple introductions of genotype ON 1; variants distinct from the original Canadian viruses predominated in both infection waves. The genotype ON 1 dominated over the other group A genotypes during the second wave, and some first wave ON 1 variants reappeared in the second wave. An analysis of global genotype ON 1 sequences determined that this genotype has become considerably diversified and has acquired signature coding mutations within immunogenic regions, and its most recent common ancestor dates to ≈ 2008 – 2009. Surveillance of genotype ON 1 contributes {{to an understanding of the}} mechanisms of rapid emergence of respiratory viruses...|$|R
50|$|Bahamians {{achieved}} self-government in 1964 {{and full}} independence within the Commonwealth of Nations on July <b>10,</b> 1973. The <b>country’s</b> <b>first</b> {{prime minister was}} Sir Lynden O. Pindling, leader of the Progressive Liberal Party. Pindling presided for 25 years (1967 - 1992), during which the Bahamas benefited from tourism and foreign investment. By the early 1980s, the islands had also become a major center for the drug trade, with 90% of all the cocaine entering the United States reportedly passing through the Bahamas. Diplomatic relations were established with Cuba in 1974. A decade later, as increased Cuban immigration to the islands strained the Bahamas’ resources, Cuba refused to sign a letter of repatriation.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the dietary patterns of <b>10</b> European <b>countries</b> and their socio-demographic determinants, using the comparable between-countries DAFNE data. Design: Analysis of standardized and postharmonized data collected {{through the national}} household budget surveys. Setting: Nationally representative surveys undertaken in <b>10</b> European <b>countries,</b> generally {{in the second half}} of the 1990 s. Results: The differences in the fruit and vegetable consumption previously identified between Mediterranean and Northern European countries seem to be leveling out, particularly in relation to fruit consumption. Pulses, however, still characterize the diet of the Mediterraneans. Straying from their traditional food choices, Mediterraneans recorded high availability of unprocessed red meat, while Central and Northern Europeans preferably consumed meat products. The household availability of beverages (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) is generally higher among Central and Northern European populations. Principal component (PC) analysis led to the identification of two dietary patterns in each of the <b>10</b> <b>countries.</b> The <b>first</b> was similar in all countries and indicated 'wide-range' food buyers. The second was slightly more varied and described 'beverage and convenience' food buyers. PC 1 was common among households of retired and elderly members, while PC 2 was common among households located in urban or semi-urban areas and among adult Scandinavians living alone. Conclusions: The dietary patterns identified point towards a progressive narrowing of dietary differences between North and South European countries. The comparable between-countries DAFNE data could prove useful in ecological studies, in the formulation of dietary guidelines and public health initiatives addressing specific population groups. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved...|$|R
5000|$|The First Republic of South Korea (제1공화국, Jeil Gonghwaguk, {{literally}} [...] "the first republic") was South Korea's first independent government, ruling {{the country}} from 1948 to 1960. It succeeded USAMGIK, the United States military government, which ruled the area from 1945 to 1948. The Philippines recognized South Korea on 15 August 1948. The First Republic was established on August 15, 1948, with Syngman Rhee as the first president. Like subsequent governments, it claimed sovereignty over the entire Korean Peninsula, although it only had power over the area south of the 38th parallel. The investiture of the Rhee government followed the general election of May <b>10,</b> 1948. The <b>country's</b> <b>first</b> constitution had been promulgated by the first National Assembly on July 17. It established a system with a strong president, who was elected indirectly by the National Assembly.|$|R
40|$|Background: Since 2003, the {{widespread}} ongoing epizootic of avian influenza A (H 5 N 1) among poultry and birds {{has resulted in}} human H 5 N 1 cases in <b>10</b> <b>countries.</b> The <b>first</b> case of H 5 N 1 virus infection in Indonesia was identified in July 2005. Methods: We investigated three clusters of Indonesian cases {{with at least two}} ill persons hospitalized with laboratory evidence of H 5 N 1 virus infection from June through October 2005. Epidemiologic, clinical, and virologic data on these patients were collected and analyzed. Results: Severe disease occurred among all three clusters, including deaths in two clusters. Mild illness in children was documented in two clusters. The median age of the eight patients was 8. 5 years (range, 1 to 38). Four patients required mechanical ventilation, and four of the eight patients (50 %) died. In each cluster, patients with H 5 N 1 virus infection were members of the same family, and most lived in the same home. In two clusters, the source of H 5 N 1 virus infection in the index patient was not determined. Virus isolates were available for one patient in each of two clusters, and molecular sequence analyses determined that the isolates were clade 2 H 5 N 1 viruses of avian origin. Conclusions: In 2005 in Indonesia, clusters of human infection with clade 2 H 5 N 1 viruses included mild, severe, and fatal cases among family members.

50|$|Modern {{scientific}} psychology had {{an international}} dimension from its beginnings {{in the late}} 19th century. Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), for instance, the father of modern experimental psychology, supervised approximately 190 doctoral students from at least <b>10</b> <b>countries.</b> Similarly, the <b>First</b> International Congress of Physiological Psychology in 1889, in Paris, included more than 200 participants from 20 countries (Sabourin & Cooper, 2014). Although psychology developed first in Europe, it soon began to prosper in the United States as well. Altogether, modern scientific psychology remained a predominantly western enterprise till well after World War II although modern psychology was already present in the early 1900s some in nonwestern countries such as India, Japan, and Mexico. During the 1930s many prominent psychologists from Germany and Austria emigrated to the United States. As {{a result of these}} developments, psychology in the United States assumed worldwide leadership, but also grew increasingly monocultural, monolingual, and ethnocentric in character (see David and Buchanan, 2003, and Bullock, 2012, for timelines of important events in the history of international psychology). However, there is now an increased awareness among U.S. psychologists that U.S. psychology must take into account global developments in order to fully represent the world of psychology. For instance, the American Psychological Association established in 1997 an International Psychology Division (Division 52), which currently has about 600 members.|$|R
