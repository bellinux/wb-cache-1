25|$|The {{octane rating}} of typical commercially {{available}} gasoline varies by country. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, 95 RON {{is the standard}} for regular <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option. In the UK, ordinary regular <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> is 95 RON (commonly available), premium <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> is always 97 RON, and super unleaded is usually 97–98 RON. However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain Tesco began to sell super <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> rated at 99 RON. In the US, octane ratings in unleaded fuels can vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91–92 RON) for regular, through 89–90 AKI (94–95 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90–94 AKI (95–99 RON) for premium (European premium).|$|R
40|$|Problem statement: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of using <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and additives blends on Spark Ignition engine (SI engine) combustion and exhaust emission. Approach: A four stroke, single cylinder SI engine was used for conducting this study. Exhaust emissions were analysed for Carbon Monoxide (CO), Hydrocarbon (HC) and Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO 2) using <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and additives blends with different percentages of fuel at varying engine torque condition and constant engine speed. Results: The result showed that the blending of <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> increases the octane number and power output this may leads to increase the brake thermal efficiency. The CO, HC and NOx emissions concentrations in the engine exhaust decreases while the CO 2 concentration increases.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze in both descriptive and econometric terms the phase-out of leaded gasoline consumption in the EU countries. The phase-out process is characterized by increased consumption of <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline.</b> We analyze the importance of price differences, share of catalytic converters, income per capita, and country characteristics in the phase-out process. Since the expected maintenance costs of using <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> in cars without catalytic converters compared to the use of leaded gasoline differ insignificantly according to available evidence, and consumers still use leaded <b>gasoline</b> even though <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> is cheaper; we interpret this as a lack of reliable information. The results indicate that countries, which have not yet phased out leaded gasoline, should do this by either banning leaded gasoline or by increasing the tax differential between leaded and <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> depending on the {{objective of}} the social planner...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> blended with 5 % and 10 % of ethanol or {{methanol}} on the performance and exhaust emissions of a spark-ignition engine were experimentally investigated. The engine tests were performed by varying the engine speed between 1000 and 4000 rpm with 500 rpm period at threefourth throttle opening position. The results showed that brakespecific fuel consumption increased while brake thermal efficiency, emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HCs) decreased with methanol-unleaded gasoline and ethanol-unleaded gasoline blends.

50|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT or MCMT) is an organomanganese compound {{with the}} formula (CH3C5H4)Mn(CO)3. Initially marketed {{as a supplement}} for use in leaded gasoline, MMT was later used in <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> to increase the octane rating. Following {{the implementation of the}} Clean Air Act (United States) (CAA) in 1970, MMT continued to be used alongside tetraethyl lead (TEL) in the US as leaded gasoline was phased out (prior to TEL finally being banned from US gasoline in 1995), and was also used in <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> until 1977. Ethyl Corporation obtained a waiver from the U.S. EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) in 1995, which allows the use of MMT in US <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> (not including reformulated gasoline) at a treat rate equivalent to 8.3 mg Mn/L (manganese per liter).|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] Due to {{depletion}} of conventional fuels {{and an increase}} in exhaust emissions at an alarming rate, it is essential to develop an engine which can work on non-conventional fuels and reduce emissions to a greater extent. The present study aims to explore the effects of using ethanol- <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> fuel blends on engine performance and exhaust gas emissions in a spark ignition engine. A four-stroke, single cylinder German CT 300 VCR SI engine was used for conducting this study. The ethanol was blended with <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> with different percentages of fuel at full throttle opening position and variable engine speed ranging from 1100 - 2000 rpm with an increment of 300 rpm.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of using <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> and {{additives}} blends on spark ignition engine (SI engine) performance and exhaust emission. A four stroke, single cylinder SI engine was used for conducting this study.

The result showed that blending <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> with additives increases the brake power,volumetric and brake thermal efficiencies and fuel consumption. The CO and HC emissions concentrations in the engine exhaust decreases while the NOx concentration increases. The addition of 5 % isobutanol and 10 % ethanol to gasoline gave the best results for all measured parameters at all engine torque values.

50|$|Vehicles {{designed}} and built to run on leaded fuel may require modification to run on <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> or autogas. These modifications fall into two categories: those required for physical compatibility with unleaded fuel, and those performed {{to compensate for the}} relatively low octane of early unleaded fuels. Physical compatibility requires the installation of hardened exhaust valves and seats. Compatibility with reduced octane was addressed by reducing compression, generally by installing thicker cylinder head gaskets and/or rebuilding the engine with compression-reducing pistons. The availability of high-octane <b>unleaded</b> <b>gasoline</b> (or LPG) has reduced or eliminated the need to decrease compression ratios.|$|R

Trunk mounted louvers for the flow through ventilation system were only found on 1971 models (as in many other GM models of 1971). The louvers were moved to the doorjambs for 1972-1976 models.
