The indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the ability of the lysate reagents to detect antibodies in 30 rabbit and 30 dog serum specimens. Mean absorbance values with B 5896 lysate antigen ranged from <b>1.</b> 637 (<b>day</b> <b>1)</b> to <b>1.</b> 461 (<b>day</b> 7) and absorbance values with 597 antigen ranged from <b>1.</b> 579 (<b>day</b> <b>1)</b> to <b>1.</b> 396 (<b>day</b> 7) with the serum specimens from immunized rabbits.

5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on <b>1</b> <b>day</b> old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

AVE 9633 is an anti-CD 33 -maytansine conjugate created by ImmunoGen Inc. Phase I trials of AVE 9633 were performed in patients with AML to evaluate tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Three phase I studies of AVE 9633 were performed in 54 patients with refractory/relapsed AML, evaluating drug infusion on <b>day</b> <b>1</b> of a 21 -day cycle (<b>Day</b> <b>1</b> study), <b>day</b> <b>1</b> and 8 (<b>Day</b> <b>1</b> / 8 study) and <b>day</b> <b>1,</b> 4 and 7 (<b>Day</b> <b>1</b> / 4 / 7 study) of a 28 -day cycle. Toxicity was mainly allergic reaction during infusion (3 grade 3 bronchospasms). DLT was reached for the D 1 -D 7 schedule at 150  mg/sqm (1 keratitis, 1 liver toxicity), and the MTD was set at 130  mg/sqm for this schedule. In the two other phases I, the DLT was not reached. In the <b>Day</b> <b>1</b> / 8 study, CD 33 on peripheral blasts was saturated and down-modulated for doses of 75  mg/m(2) × 2 or higher, which was correlated with WBC kinetics and plasma levels of AVE 9633. Decrease of DM 4 /CD 33 ratio on the blasts surface between <b>day</b> <b>1</b> and 8 was the rational for evaluating <b>day</b> <b>1</b> / 4 / 7 schedule. This induced relatively constant DM 4 /CD 33 levels over the first 8  days, however no activity was noted. One CRp, one PR and biological activity in five other patients were observed in this study.
