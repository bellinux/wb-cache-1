The electrical supply 120/240 VAC mains system evolved from supplying only a few industrial buildings near the main Farm Road in 1971 to the point by the 1980s where most areas were covered either by <b>12</b> <b>Volt</b> automotive battery trickle charge systems. Most homes phased out the use of kerosene lamps by 1975, as they converted to <b>12</b> <b>Volt</b> lighting and RV appliances or re-purposed automotive lighting fixtures. Off-grid low voltage <b>12</b> <b>Volt</b> DC systems were also sometimes powered by swapping vehicle batteries.

40|$|Abstract â€” Many industrial, sciencetific, medical, {{communication}} and defence equipments require 32 or 48 volt power suppply. These equipments can be operated in a fixed placed {{as well as}} in a mobile unit. Unfortunately, many power supply, especially in a mobile unit, available only in <b>12</b> <b>volts.</b> These <b>12</b> <b>volt</b> power may come from car battery or solar cell. In this research, a <b>12</b> <b>volt</b> DC to 48 volt DC converter is designed, implemented and tested. The power supply is designed as a swithcing mode power supply (SMPS) with feedbcak regulator for efficiency and operasional flexibility. This way, the output voltage can be adjusted by the user to meet their need. The performance of the power supply is obtained by varying the input voltage and varying the output voltage. The power supply is also tested by applying the converter using car battery as its input and loading the power supply. Test results show that the power supply could deliver power from 26. 6 to 55 volt DC for input voltage of 9. 8 to <b>12</b> <b>volt.</b> For output of 48 volt, the converter yields an efficiency of 85 % with ripple voltage of 50 milli volt peak to peak...|$|R
