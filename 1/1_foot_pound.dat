The [...]600 Nitro Express, the second most powerful African big game rifle cartridge, {{and one of the most}} common, has around 8,200 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> (11,118 J) of kinetic energy. This makes a 20mm Anzio rifle about 4.8 times as powerful as a rifle chambered in [...]600 Nitro Express.|$|R
5000|$|However, these subcompact guns {{typically}} have barrel lengths around 2.5". The traditional steel guns chambered for [...]32 ACP have barrel lengths around 3.5". Different barrel lengths {{can have a}} significant effect on bullet performance with longer barrels providing higher muzzle velocity and energy. For example, a Cor-Bon 60 grain [...]32 ACP JHP has 130 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> of energy when fired out of a 2.5" [...] barrel and 165 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> of energy when fired out of a 3.5" [...] barrel.

50|$|The bike was {{available}} in two colors, Black and champagne (burgundy). The power was rated @ 75 horsepower and roughly 36 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> of torque. Fuel economy was 41 MPG on average. It would cover a quarter mile in 12.67 seconds @ @102 MPH.|$|R

5000|$|Speaking of deep offsets, {{when you}} get into stone and you're looking at 8" [...] to 10" [...] offsets, that's an awful lot of <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> of pull on wood and fasteners.

6000|$|Instantly at {{the word}} [...] "Amen," [...] like the popping of a cork, the tumult burst out again. Hands clapped, {{laughter}} flared out, desks were slammed, papers were rattled, <b>feet</b> <b>pounded,</b> and the brazen monotonous clanging voice of the clerk sounded above it all like some new steam calliope whose sounds were words.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept car}} {{is powered by}} both a {{rechargeable}} electric engine and a small-capacity conventional combustion engine. The Revolte is able to deliver zero-emission driving thanks to its all-electric ZEV (Zero Emission Vehicle) mode.

Her 700lb. lead keel lowers the center of gravity, creating nearly 1700 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> of righting moment at 90 degrees of heel.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the {{schooner}} {{in front}} of me gave a violent yaw, turning perhaps through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board; I could hear <b>feet</b> <b>pounding</b> on the companion-ladder; and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster.|$|R

60|$|There was an instant's silence, {{and then}} a score of voices raised in consternation,--shouting, cursing, commanding. Heavy <b>feet</b> <b>pounded</b> on the {{platform}} of the blockhouse. While Tom was savagely jamming in powder and ball, the wicket gate of the fort opened, a man came out and ran to a house a biscuit's throw away, and ran back again before he was shot at, slamming the gate after him. Tom swore.|$|R

50|$|The {{power output}} on this engine was a {{conservative}} 290 hp at 5,200 RPM with matching torque of 290 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> at 4300 RPM. The Boss 302 engine competes well with other high performance 'small blocks', {{such as the}} Chevy 302, the Chrysler 340, and AMC 360. Although the factory specified maximum power at 5,200 RPM, the engine was allowed to rev well beyond that to a 6,250 RPM rev limited maximum.|$|R

5000|$|The Longbow T-76 is {{a sniper}} rifle {{introduced}} in 1997 by Dakota Arms. The T-76 tactical rifle {{is based on}} their Model 76 hunting rifle. On its website Dakota Arms guaranteed 1/2 MOA performance with an effective range of 1500 meters for the Longbow T-76 in its [...]338 configuration. The T-76 tactical rifle generates up to 5,250 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> (7.12 kJ) of muzzle energy and 2,850 feet per second (870 m/s) velocity from a 300 grain (19.4 g) round.|$|R
50|$|He {{is known}} for his works (1875-1894) on the kinetic theory of gases and his {{attempts}} to combine this theory with Le Sage's theory of gravitation. In his book Physics of the Ether (1875) he claimed that if matter is subdivided into ether particles, they would travel {{at the speed of light}} and represent an enormous amount of energy. In this way, one grain of matter would contain energy equal to 1000 millions of foot-tons (whereby one foot-ton = 2240 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds).</b>|$|R
50|$|The SI unit {{of energy}} rate (energy per unit time) is the watt, which is a joule per second. Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one watt-hour. The CGS energy unit is the erg and the {{imperial}} and US customary unit is the <b>foot</b> <b>pound.</b> Other energy units such as the electronvolt, food calorie or thermodynamic kcal (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process), and BTU are used in specific areas of science and commerce.|$|R
5000|$|Winchester {{continued}} {{to offer the}} cartridge commercially until 1935 {{and while it is}} still offered by some suppliers, due to its obsolescence and resultant obscurity, it is significantly more costly than more current cartridges [...] - [...] averaging from US$3 to $4 per round. Also in more modern guns like the new browning 1886 71 Winchester and the new 1886 Winchesters made in Japan are capable of much higher pressures and the 50-110 WCF can achieve up to 6,000 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> of energy.|$|R
6000|$|Something is happening, I {{regret to}} find, {{to the world}} in which we used to live. The poor old thing is being [...] "speeded up." [...] There is [...] "efficiency" [...] in the air. Offices open at eight o'clock. Millionaires lunch on a baked apple. Bankers eat {{practically}} nothing. A college president has declared that there are more <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> of energy in a glass of peptonized milk than in--something else, I forget what. All this is very fine. Yet somehow I feel out of it.|$|R
50|$|The {{requirement}} for kinetic energy {{was based on}} the fact that 58 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> is required to deliver a potentially lethal injury. Given the requirements of weight and fragment density, approximately 700 fragments were needed, with the ability to aim the mine with an accuracy of around two feet (0.6 m) at the center of the target zone. The team at Aerojet were given access to all previous research into directional mines, including the M18 and the Phoenix, as well as German research. Dr. John Bledsoe led the initial project.|$|R
50|$|Unique {{features}} of the rain dance include the participation of {{both men and women}} in the choreography, the outfits worn by the dancers, and the lack of drum accompaniment. White feathered masks worn by the men represent wind to blow in the rain, while the blue color of turquoise jewels and moccasins symbolize rain. Women do not wear shoes, but other than that are completely covered in ritual clothing. Rhythm for the dance is kept solely by the sound of <b>feet</b> <b>pounding</b> the ground as the dance is performed.|$|R
5000|$|Comparisons of {{efficiency}} {{and power of}} the early steam engines is difficult for several reasons: 1) there was no standard weight for a bushel of coal, which could be anywhere from 82 to 96 pounds. 2) There was no standard heating value for coal, and probably no way to measure heating value. The coals had much higher heating value than today's steam coals, with 13,500 BTU/pound sometimes mentioned. 3) Efficiency was reported as [...] "duty", meaning how many <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> of work lifting water were produced, but the mechanical pumping efficiency is not known.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom (with the {{exception}} of Northern Ireland), possession of almost any handgun by most civilians has been outlawed since the Dunblane massacre of 1996; the only exclusions were single-shot, rimfire, and muzzleloading pistols/revolvers. So called [...] "long barreled" [...] cartridge-firing revolvers and semiautomatic pistols (.22LR only) are still legal providing that they meet the following requirements: overall length not less than 24 inches, barrel length not less than 12 inches. As with all other legal firearms in the UK, possession requires a Firearm Certificate. The application and vetting process is {{carried out by the}} local police force and is very in depth. Good reason (justification) for holding a firearm certificate in the UK would be target shooting (as part of a Home Office Approved Club) or hunting. [...] "Self-defence" [...] or other reasons of this nature are not allowed. The open carrying of any firearm in a public place is illegal in the UK unless you have a valid reason to do so, this also requires that you carry it in a gun carry case. Concealed carry of any firearm in a public place would normally be illegal, unless authorised by a firearms licence. Air pistols are still legal, however, those with energy levels over 6 <b>foot</b> <b>pounds</b> (8 joules) (half the limit for air rifles, which is 12 <b>foot</b> <b>pound</b> or 16.25 joules) are classified as firearms.|$|R
