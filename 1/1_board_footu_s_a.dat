40|$|The {{collection}} {{consists of}} 34 groups of manuscript terrain maps of various {{regions of the}} world, prepared using Swiss "ridge and valley" techniques by the Central Intelligence Agency's terrain specialists. The base terrain maps (shaded relief and lowland tints) were drawn on boards created from two sheets of paper fused to an aluminum core. The boards are accompanied by 1 to 4 manuscript overlays showing reference line work, etc. The collection documents sophisticated manual terrain mapping techniques now generally replaced by computer generated terrain renderings using digital data. The majority of the maps were prepared using Lambert's conformal conic projection, while the remainder use the universal transverse Mercator projection. 1.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a simple {{design and implementation}} of a Seven-Segment Displays Designs on Education Board. Logic design transforms algorithms and processes conceived by people into computing machines. A grasp of digital logic {{is crucial to the}} understanding of other basic elements of digital systems, including microprocessors. The training program for “Altera DE <b>1</b> <b>Board</b> ” is used and applied in this study by connect the board using computer and get solution to the problems of digits binary used their equivalents in hexadecimal. “Altera ” now get big success from the world market for electronic devices. “Altera DE <b>1</b> <b>Board</b> ” is important for many applications. A hypothetical example is a logic circuit to examine three switches and turn on an LED if two and only two of the three switches are turned on. These are input/output and architectural components. The input/output description specifies the input and output connections (ports) to the hardware. The architectural component defines the behavior of the hardware entity being designed. A typical VHDL description includes a port statement contained within an entity statement. All keywords in VHDL are reserved follows.
