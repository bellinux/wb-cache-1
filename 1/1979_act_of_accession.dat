50|$|In October 1776 {{he joined}} the Horse Guard of the Polish Crown Regiment as a cadet. On 1 December 1789 he was {{promoted}} to the rank of Staff Captain and in 1792 {{he was promoted to}} Captain. A member of Tadeusz Kościuszko's conspiracy, he took part in the Warsaw Uprising of 1794 as {{one of the leaders of}} the Polish forces, possibly as the commanding officer of his regiment. Following the Polish victory he was one of the signatories <b>of</b> the <b>act</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> <b>of</b> the city of Warsaw to Kościuszko's Uprising and soon afterwards became one of the members of War Council of the land of Mazovia.|$|R
25|$|The Isle of Man holds neither {{membership}} nor associate {{membership of}} the European Union, and thus did not {{take part in the}} 2016 referendum on the UK's EU membership. Protocol 3 <b>of</b> the UK's <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> to the Treaty of Rome included the Isle of Man within the EU's customs area, allowing for trade in Manx goods without tariffs throughout the EU.

5000|$|Jersey {{is neither}} a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union. However, {{that is not to}} say that it is outside the European Communities or the European Union in the sense that it is excluded. As Jersey was a European {{territory}} for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, in 1972, it fell within the definition of a Community Territory when the <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> was negotiated. The relationship between Jersey and the European Communities was negotiated as a modified extension of the existing relationship with the United Kingdom by Sir Geoffrey Rippon, as he was then. The only European Territories under United Kingdom responsibility which were excluded were the Sovereign Base Territories in Cyprus. Had the Special relationship not been negotiated, then Jersey would have been included within the Communities in the same way as Gibraltar. The Island's relationship with the EC and the EU is governed by article 26(3) <b>of</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession,</b> amending article 227 of the then EEC Treaty, now Article 355(5)(c) TFEU. That article acts together with Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> in 1972 which was incorporated into the Treaties, by article 158 <b>of</b> the <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession.</b> On Cyprus' <b>Accession,</b> the exclusion <b>of</b> the Cyprus Base Territories was reversed, and the resulting article 355(5)(b) no longer contains the term excluded. For Jersey to be outside the EU and the EC, the term excluded would have had to have been employed.The Treaties therefore apply, but only to the extent necessary to give effect to the arrangements in the Protocol. [...] Protocol 3 and other relevant treaty provisions are made part of Jersey Law by the European Communities (Jersey) Law 1973. Hence the inclusion of provisions of Community law and judgements of the CJEU within the laws of the Island through those provisions, in a similar manner as in the United Kingdom. The relationship between the Channel Islands and the EU cannot be changed without the unanimous agreement of all Member States and Island authorities.|$|R

5|$|Jersey {{is neither}} a Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union. It does, however, have a {{relationship}} with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> in 1972. However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This {{is a result of the}} manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like Gibraltar, being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that that is limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.|$|R
50|$|In 1843 the East India company {{transferred}} the Administration of Temple {{along with other}} Temples in Tirupati to Mahants of Hathiramji Muth, who acted as Vicaranakartas.

50|$|The Channel Islands {{consist of}} the Bailiwicks of Guernsey and Jersey, Crown {{dependencies}} which are self-governing but historically {{linked to the}} Crown. The Channel Islands have a special relationship with the United Kingdom {{as set out in}} Protocol 3 to the United Kingdom's <b>Act</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> 1972, which formed part of the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Accession.</b> Under this agreement the Channel Islands {{are not part of the}} European Union but are part of the customs territory of the union. This means they do not charge VAT on purchases but there is a free movement of industrial and agricultural goods in trade between the Islands and the Union. Jersey introduced a Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 3% in 2008 which increased to 5% in 2011 on the majority of goods and services supplied in Jersey for local use, including imports, GST can be claimed back on exports.|$|R

50|$|Following the 1979 coup by the New Jewel Movement, the People's Revolutionary Government in Grenada (an {{independent}} Commonwealth member since 1974, previously an Associated State) {{enacted a}} law which abolished all {{appeals to the}} Privy Council, a process {{set out in the}} Constitution of Grenada. Following the U.S. invasion of Grenada and the overthrow of the revolutionary government, the Parliament of Grenada enacted a 1985 law which confirmed the <b>1979</b> <b>act</b> <b>of</b> abolition. Although the 1979 law may not have been constitutional (in that it purported to amend the constitution without enacting a law by a two-thirds parliamentary majority), the 1985 law was passed with a two-thirds majority and thus adhered to the procedure for amending the constitution. Thus, the JCPC held that appeals to it from Grenada had been legitimately abolished as of 21 February 1985.|$|R
40|$|This article looks {{upon the}} most recent {{developments}} in the European Union's accession strategies, as from the start <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> negotiations. It first seeks {{to demonstrate that the}} pre-accession conditionality rationale of stabilising present and protecting future integration objectives underpins the so-called 'specific safeguard clauses' of the 2003 and 2005 <b>Acts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Accession</b> and the latter's cooperation and verification mechanism, accordingly referred to as post-accession conditionality tools. It then argues that this rationale, emphasised also in the imperative of maintaining the momentum of European integration of the Union's 'integration capacity', above all necessitates effective compliance with EU law, and thus full administrative and judicial capacity of (prospective) Member States. Indeed, the lynchpin of these new conditionality devices evokes putting them in the wider context of compliance mechanisms in the enlarged European Union. It thereby becomes apparent how conditionality has lead to a considerable empowerment of the European Commission which, when reaching into the post-accession phase, entails a problematic differentiation between the Member States. Conditionality methodology furthermore, and this is equally shown, has {{had an impact on the}} Commission's role as 'guardian of the treaty' within the overall system of ensuring compliance with EU law...|$|R
