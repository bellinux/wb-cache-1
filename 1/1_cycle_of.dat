50|$|Oxidized silicon {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied as a substrate for the deposition of biomolecules. Piranha solution {{can be used to}} increase the surface density of reactive hydroxyl groups on the surface of silicon. The -OH groups can hydrolyze and subsequently form siloxane linkages (Si-O-Si) with organic silane molecules. Preparation of silicon surfaces for silanization involves the removal of surface contaminants. This can be achieved by using UV-ozone and piranha solution. Piranha solution in particular constitutes quite a harsh treatment that can potentially damage the integrity of the silicon surface. Finlayson-Pitts et al. investigated the effect of certain treatments on silicon and concluded that both the roughness (3-5 Å) and the presence of scattered large particles were preserved after <b>1</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> plasma-treatment. However, the silicon surface was significantly damaged after 30 cycles of treatment with piranha solution or plasma. In both cases, treatment introduced irregularities and large aggregates on the surface (aggregate size > 80 nm), with the effect being more pronounced when piranha was used. In either case, multiple treatments rendered the surface inadequate for deposition of small biomolecules.|$|E

The experimental group received up to 5 cycles of dinutuximab with either GM-CSF or IL-2 along with 13-cis-retenoic acid (RA) and <b>1</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> RA only, whereas the control group only received RA.

In regards to DNA ploidy status of the patients' tumors, 43% were hyperdiploid, 36% were diploid, and 21% were unknown. Since patients had to have had at least a partial response to initial chemotherapy, the patients were also categorized by response rate in which 35% had a complete response, 43% had a very good response, and 23% had a partial response. The Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended that the study be terminated sooner than originally planned after they found out that the boundary for event-free survival (EFS) had been surpassed in the 7th interim analysis. With a hazard ratio of 0.57, the trial exhibited that there was an EFS improvement in 42% of the patients. Three years after the conclusion of the interim analysis all of the patients were evaluated for survival rate with a hazard ratio of 0.58, showing an increase in overall survival in the experimentally treated group.|$|E

40|$|Disrupting the {{interaction}} between primase and helicase in Escherichia coli increases Okazaki fragment (OF) length due to less frequent primer synthesis. We exploited this feature {{to increase the amount}} of ssDNA at the lagging strand of the repli-cation fork that is available for j Red-mediated Multiplex Automatable Genome Engineering (MAGE). Supporting this concept, we demonstrate that MAGE enhancements correlate with OF length. Compared with a standard recombineering strain (EcNR 2), the strain with the longest OFs displays on average 62 % more alleles converted per clone, 239 % more clones with 5 or more allele conversions and 38 % fewer clones with 0 allele conversions in <b>1</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> co-selection MAGE (CoS-MAGE) with 10 synthetic oligonucleotides. Additionally, we demonstrate that both synthetic oligonucleotides and accessible ssDNA targets on the lagging strand of the replication fork are limiting factors for MAGE. Given this new insight, we generated a strain with reduced oligonucleotide degradation and increased genomic ssDNA availability, which displayed 111 % more alleles converted per clone, 527 % more clones with 5 or more allele conversions and 71 % fewer clones with 0 allele conversions in <b>1</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> 10 -plex CoS-MAGE.
