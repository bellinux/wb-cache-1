The critical incipient velocity for the D 50 and D 100 and the critical grain entrainment velocity corresponding to the D 95 were determined through flume experimentation. Two methods, developed by prior researchers, were chosen by the author to calculate the critical incipient velocity for the D 50 and D 100 of the fine sediment in the Green River Canal. The calculated critical incipient velocity for the D 50 and D 100 was compared to the critical incipient velocity for the D 50 and D 100 as determined from flume experimentation.

The primary objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the aquifer for future water supply development under drought conditions. A groundwater flow model of the Lower Raccoon River aquifer was created using Visual MODFLOW 2011. 1. The model was used to generate source water capture zones, evaluate surface water and groundwater interaction, and estimate maximum sustainable pumping rates. Water level data during the summer of 2012 were used to help calibrate the model. Based on the mass balance calculations in the model, the percentage of water production supplied by the Raccoon River (from Dallas Center to West Des Moines) was 52 percent, and 29 percent was supplied by induced recharge from the numerous sand and gravel quarries. The remaining 19 percent of the water production is supplied by precipitation recharge and groundwater inflow into the model area. The percentage of induced recharge varied from 0 percent at Van Meter to 89 percent at Des Moines Water Works radial wellfield. Induced recharge from the Raccoon River (from Dallas Center to West Des Moines) allows public wells to maintain water production during prolonged dry periods. Limitations in water production exist when streamflow along the Raccoon River drops below 17. <b>1</b> cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> <b>second</b> (43. 4 cfs if the Fleur Drive infiltration gallery is included).

Additional pumping capacity ranges from 10 percent in the West Des Moines wellfield, to over 1, 000 percent at Adel. Potential well yields greater than 500 gallons per minute (gpm) are found near Adel, Van Meter, and West Des Moines.
