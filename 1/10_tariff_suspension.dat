The {{purpose of this paper}} is to analyze the political and economic circumstances surrounding Chile's unilateral trade liberalization during five stages (covering the period 1974 - 1990 s),each being characterized by different combinations of compensation schemes that were used to raise support and reduce opposition to the reforms. In less than 4 years (1975 - 1979) Chile eliminated all quantitative restrictions and exchange controls and reduced import tariffs from an average in excess of 100 % to a uniform <b>10</b> % <b>tariff.</b> Later the tariff was temporarily raised to 35 % in the aftermath of a severe economic crisis (1983 - 1984), but was then reduced to 11 % by 1991. This liberalization was implemented simultaneously with other reforms, including an effort to eliminate a stubborn inflationary process, financial reforms that ended decades of financial repression, and a massive privatization program. We investigate the role played by ideas, interests and institutions. More specifically, we examine the role played by the 'reform team' investigate some of the distributive consequences of the reforms, and analyze the ways the government used to maintain a minimum level of support for the liberalization process. A recurrent question is whether authoritarian governments are sensitive to political considerations when implementing major policy changes. We also present econometric results obtained by using household-level survey data to analyze the effects of trade liberalization on Chile's unemployment. We conclude that during the 1970 s and afterwards the Chilean authorities relied heavily on coalition building and on compensation mechanisms in order to increase the political support for the reforms. ...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{antidumping}} (AD) facilitates trade liberalization by serving as a release valve for protectionist pressure. We focus on a group of prominent ADusing developing countries and examine the validity of the pressure release hypothesis. The fact that these new AD users generally began using AD after significant trade liberalization supports the hypothesis. Yet, if pressure exists to reverse liberalization, it is not because products that were subject to AD scrutiny were treated poorly in the liberalization programme. For nearly all major new users products subject to AD investigations do not have unusually low tariffs nor have they experienced unusually large tariff reductions. Our main point is that that AD is not the only policy option. For all countries studied the tariff bindings are weak {{in the sense that the}} bound levels exceed the applied levels by a considerable margin.

40|$|When {{capital-intensive}} monopoly {{industries are}} restructured and deregulated, consumer prices commence a natural drift from regulated uniform ‘average cost’ tariffs to competitive differential prices, {{and this can}} raise problems for policymakers. Deep discounts are welcomed, high Standing Offers are not. But price discrimination is unremarkable in economics. Indeed, in industries where fixed & sunk costs represent {{a significant portion of}} total cost, discriminatory pricing is usually welfare enhancing. Conversely, theory predicts and empirical evidence confirms that regulatory efforts to cherry-pick differential prices in asymmetric markets will damage consumer welfare. In this article, we analyse differential retail electricity offer prices in the Australian States of Victoria and Queensland and contrast these with industry average total cost and the marginal cost of retail supply. We find deregulated Victoria displays high price dispersion with Standing Offer <b>tariffs</b> <b>10</b> % above industry average total cost and marginal offers at break-even prices (i. e. 20 % below average total cost). In the semi-regulated Southeast Queensland market where a regulated price-cap exists, there is lower dispersion but marginal offers include a 6. 7 % retail mark-up. Efficient pricing requires the marginal unit produced to be priced at marginal cost and Victoria meets this criteria – but we identify an episode of inter-consumer misallocation due to high Standing Offers. We conclude policy initiatives designed to help firms shift vulnerable households from Standing Offer tariffs is desirable.

40|$|Abstract Background In the UK, the 2009 / 10 {{winter was}} characterised by {{sustained}} low temperatures; grit stocks became depleted and surfaces left untreated. We describe {{the relationship between}} temperature and emergency hospital admissions for falls on snow and ice in England, identify the age and gender of those {{most likely to be}} admitted, and estimate the inpatient costs of these admissions during the 2009 / 10 winter. Methods Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify episodes of emergency admissions for falls on snow and ice during winters 2005 / 06 to 2009 / 10; these were plotted against mean winter temperature. By region, the logs of the rates of weekly emergency admissions for falls on snow and ice were plotted against the mean weekly temperature for winters 2005 / 06 to 2009 / 10 and a linear regression analysis undertaken. For the 2009 / 10 winter the number of emergency hospital admissions for falls on snow and ice were plotted by age and gender. The inpatient costs of admissions in the 2009 / 10 winter for falls on snow and ice were calculated using Healthcare Resource Group costs and Admitted Patient Care 2009 / <b>10</b> National <b>Tariff</b> Information. Results The number of emergency hospital admissions due to falls on snow and ice varied considerably across years; the number was 18 times greater in 2009 / 10 (N = 16, 064) than in 2007 / 08 (N = 890). There is an exponential increase [Ln(rate of admissions) = 0. 456 - 0. 463 *(mean weekly temperature) ] in the rate of emergency hospital admissions for falls on snow and ice as temperature falls. The rate of admissions in 2009 / 10 was highest among the elderly and particularly men aged 80 and over. The total inpatient cost of falls on snow and ice in the 2009 / 10 winter was 42 million GBP. Conclusions Emergency hospital admissions for falls on snow and ice vary greatly across winters, and according to temperature, age and gender. The cost of these admissions in England in 2009 / 10 was considerable. With responsibility for health improvement moving to local councils, they will have to balance the cost of public health measures like gritting with the healthcare costs associated with falls. The economic burden of falls on snow and ice is substantial; keeping surfaces clear of snow and ice is a public health priority. </p...|$|R
40|$|Using data {{collected}} during several missions, the author {{finds that the}} principal reasons for low revenue mobilization are (1) the adverse fiscal impact of trade liberalization, (2) the defiscalization of agriculture in the 1970 s, (3) {{the collapse of the}} uranium boom in the 1980 s, and (4) the poor record of the VAT in mobilizing revenue. The large reduction in tariffs during the 1980 s and 1990 s in the context of structural adjustment programs and West African regional integration initiatives had adverse effects on trade tax revenue during the period 1980 – 2003. But higher import levels after 1994 succeeded in partially mitigating the revenue losses. The experience of Niger shows that without accompanying macroeconomic policies, parallel improvements in tax and customs administration, and success in mobilizing domestic taxes, most notably the VAT, trade reform can have adverse fiscal consequences. Using a SMART model partial equilibrium analysis developed by UNCTAD for researchers and negotiators at multilateral trade rounds, the author simulated three different tariff shocks to test the fiscal and trade implications of additional trade liberalization in Niger. First, the preferred tariff regime in terms of overall fiscal and job creation impact was the harmonized Swiss formula in contrast to a 10 and 15 percent uniform tariff. Second, a possible Regional Economic Partnership Agreement (REPA) between the European Union and l'Union Economique et Monetaire Ouest-Africaine (UEMOA) by 2015 that would abolish duties on EU imports to the UEMOA countries would have negative fiscal effects on Niger of more than 1 percent of GDP, positive effects on trade creation of about 1. 5 percent of GDP, and ambiguous effects on local industry. While there will be some welfare gains for consumers and importers from lower import tariffs and the possibility of trade creation, the fiscal losses and adjustment costs would be significant, particularly in the machinery and transport sectors. Third, there are asymmetric gains and losses from regional integration and tariff changes, and a <b>10</b> percent uniform <b>tariff</b> would have the greatest impact on Benin and Senegal and some impact on Niger and Togo. In sum, further trade liberalization in Niger will have significant fiscal costs, partially offset by trade creation through increased imports.
