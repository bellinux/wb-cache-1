5000|$|... #Caption: Older US {{residential}} {{electric meter}} location, retrofitted with a <b>1-phase</b> digital smart meter. The meter communicates to its collection point using 900 MHz mesh network topology.|$|E
50|$|The 418-I {{was also}} {{available}} in a militarized version as the UNIVAC 1218. It was almost 6 feet tall and weighed 775 lb. It required both 115VAC, <b>1-phase,</b> 60 Hz and 115VAC, 3-phase, 400 Hz power.|$|E
5000|$|The {{target of}} only having one {{charging}} connector is currently unlikely to occur. This {{is because there}} are different electrical grid systems around the world; with Japan and North America choosing a <b>1-phase</b> connector on their 100-120/240 V grid (Type 1), while China, Europe, {{and the rest of}} the world are opting for a connector with <b>1-phase</b> 230 V and 3-phase 400 V grid access (Type 2). The SAE and ACEA are trying to avoid the situation for DC charging with a standardization that plans to add DC wires to the existing AC connector types such that there is only one [...] "global envelope" [...] that fits all DC charging stations - for Type 2 the new housing is named Combo 2.|$|E
50|$|This is a direct, passive {{connection}} of the EV to the AC mains, either 250 V <b>1-phase</b> or 480 V 3-phase including earth, at a maximum current of 16 A. The connection {{does not have}} extra control pins. For electrical protection, the EVSE is required to provide earth to the EV (as above) and to have ground fault protection.|$|E
50|$|This is {{an active}} {{connection}} of the EV to a fixed EVSE, either 250 V <b>1-phase</b> or 480 V 3-phase including earth and control pilot; Either, with a compulsorily captive cable with extra conductors, at a maximum current of 250 A or, in a manner compatible with mode 2 with an optionally captive cable, at a maximum current of 32 A. The charging supply is not active by default, and requires proper communication over the control pilot to enable.|$|E
50|$|This is a direct, {{semi-active}} {{connection of}} the EV to the AC mains, either 250 V <b>1-phase</b> or 400 V 3-phase including earth at a maximum current of 32 A. There is a direct, passive connection from the AC mains to the EV supply equipment (EVSE), {{which must be}} part of, or situated within 0.3 m of, the AC mains plug; from the EVSE to the EV, there is an active connection, {{with the addition of}} the control pilot to the passive components. The EVSE provides protective earth presence detection and monitoring; ground fault, over-current, and over-temperature protection; and functional switching, depending on vehicle presence and charging power demand. Some protections must be provided by an SPR-PRCD conforming to IEC 62335 Circuit breakers - Switched protective earth portable residual current devices for class I and battery powered vehicle applications.|$|E
