The line would then turn north along Highland Avenue to Universal City and North Hollywood (a Hollywood Bowl stop {{was determined not to}} have enough year-round ridership to meet FTA formulas for Federal funding, just {{one of the reasons for}} not building a station there). The FTA approved the all subway route and funding (although broken into 2 phases rather than the original <b>1</b> <b>phase</b> in order to spread the cost over time making it more likely to be approved by Congress as part of the Federal Budget) for the line as it exists today.|$|E

25|$|The diesel {{alternator}} {{sets for}} the carriages provided 3-phase 415-volt alternating current power. Only <b>1</b> <b>phase</b> {{was required for}} operation, so the other two phases were available for backup or for load-sharing across other carriages - useful because the ACN and BN cars required 28kW to operate and the BRN, with its additional functions, 40kW. To accommodate the extra load, the ACN and BN were upgraded midway through construction to a 35kVA supply, and the programming reworked so that the BRN would not power adjacent cars. If all alternators were off, then the cars {{was able to take}} power from an external 240vAC power supply. Around the same time as these modifications were made, the alternator set supports were modified to reduce vibration, and the radiator fan motors' thermal overload switches were moved to reduce unnecessary tripping. At the end of the modifications, the system was organised so that in event of a power failure, the batteries mounted under the carriages would automatically reroute all power to the lights at the ends of the train to protect from oncoming traffic. Those lights could function for over ten hours, at the expense of air-conditioning and other functions. The first six cars had plastic fuel pipes near the alternator units, but that was changed from car 7 onwards.|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional (2 D) transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) {{consist of}} over 40 compounds. Complex metal TMDs assume the <b>1</b> T <b>phase</b> where the transition-metal atom {{coordination}} is octahedral.

Stability issues have hampered the study of interesting phenomena in two-dimensional <b>1</b> T <b>phase</b> TMDs. Phase conversion in TMDs involves transformation by chemistry at room temperature and pressure.
