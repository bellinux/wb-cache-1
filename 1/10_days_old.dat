Viljoen made her international cricket debut for South Africa in June 2000, in a One Day International (ODI) match against England. She was 17 years and <b>10</b> <b>days</b> <b>old</b> at the time, becoming the youngest woman to play ODI cricket for South Africa (a record since broken by several others). Later in the year, Viljoen was selected in the South African squad for the 2000 Women's World Cup in New Zealand. A right-handed all-rounder, she appeared in all eight of her team's matches at the tournament, and against England scored 54 not out, {{which was to be}} the highest score of her ODI career. Against Ireland in a later match, she took 3/27 from ten overs, the best bowling figures of her international career. Viljoen's final international matches for South Africa came in March 2002, in a home series against India. She played four ODIs and the only Test match of her career, in which she scored 17 runs in the first innings and 71 in the second (the third-highest score of the match).|$|E

However, his contract was later valued at US$20,000. Upon joining the Pittsburgh club, Koback went through a three-day training program with Pirates coaches. He made his MLB debut on July 29, without ever playing in the minor leagues, as a pinch hitter for catcher Mike Sandlock against the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium. In both of his at-bats he had over the night, Koback went hitless against St. Louis pitcher Harvey Haddix. Koback was the youngest Pittsburgh player ever at 18 years and <b>10</b> <b>days</b> <b>old</b> {{when he made his}} MLB debut. He got the first start of his career on July 31, against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. During that game, Koback caught the entire game, which was a complete game shutout by Pirates pitcher Murry Dickson. Koback got his first MLB hit that game against Cubs pitcher Paul Minner. In his next game on August 1, against the Cubs, Koback got his first career sacrifice hit. In mid-August, Pirates manager Fred Haney stated that Koback [...] "is a good receiver but he's only a kid". During the first game of a doubleheader against the Milwaukee Braves on August 30, Koback served as a pinch hitter for pitcher Roger Bowman when he got his first career MLB triple off pitcher Johnny Antonelli. Koback's final game of the season came on September 26, against the New York Giants at Forbes Field. In that game, he started as the catcher going hitless in three at-bats.|$|E

40|$|Aphidophagous ladybirds are {{reluctant}} to oviposit in patches of prey where conspecific larvae are present. This is adaptive as larval cannibalism is {{a major threat to}} egg survival. Ladybirds avoid laying eggs in such patches by responding to a species specific oviposition deterring pheromone present in the tracks of larvae. This study revealed that the oviposition deterring pheromone consists of a mixture of alkanes of which n-pentacosane is the major component (15. 1 %). These alkanes are likely to spread easily on the hydrophobic cuticle of plants and so leave a large signal. In addition, they are not quickly oxidized and therefore provide a long lasting signal.

40|$|A {{research}} paper on maize seed orientation. The percentage of seedlings emerging {{during the first}} 4 days after sowing and the mesocotyl length after 7 days in sand at 25 °C was strongly influenced by {{the orientation of the}} seed in the seedbed. Maize seeds emerged faster when oriented vertically with the pedicel end facing down (VD) or horizontally with the embryal side facing up (HU). The mesocotyl portion of the seedling was shorter (t 1 mm) when sown at HU and VD, providing a fast and easy emergence to the seedling. It was much longer (20 mm) when the seed was oriented horizontally with the embryal side facing down (HD) and vertically with the pedicel end facing up (VU). We concluded that the length of the mesocotyl portion of the seedling varies with the orientation of the seed in the substrate at the same depth. The seeds sown in the orientation HU and VU disclosed a higher germination of 95 percent and 88 percent respectively, compared to the seeds sown in the orientation HD and VD which had 68 percent and 53 percent germination respectively. Seed to seedling transmission of Fusarium moniliforme was recorded at a ratio of 1 : 1 in the untreated seeds, and infection of the fungus was found in the third leaf lamina and other sections of <b>10</b> <b>day</b> <b>old</b> seedlings.
