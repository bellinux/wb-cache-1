40|$|The {{development}} of optimal three-dimensional auditory displays requires {{a more complete}} understand-ing of the interactions among spatially separated sounds. Free-field masking was investigated {{as a function of}} the spatial separation between signal and masker sounds within the horizontal, frontal, and <b>median</b> <b>planes.</b> The detectability of filtered pulse trains in the presence of noise maskers was measured using a cued, two-alternative, forced-choice, adaptive staircase procedure. Signal and masker combinations in low (below 2. 3 kHz), middle (1. 0 - 8. 5 kHz), and high (above 3. 5 kHz) frequency regions were examined. As the sound sources were separated within the horizontal plane, signal detectability increased dramatically. Similar im-provement in detectability was observed within the frontal plane. As suggested by traditional binaural models, interaural time cues and interaural intensity cues are likely to play a major role in mediating masking release in both the horizontal and frontal planes. Because no interaural cues exist for stimuli presented within the <b>median</b> <b>plane,</b> traditional models would not predict a release from masking when the stimuli are separated within this plane. However, with high frequency signals, masking release similar to that observed in the horizontal and frontal planes could be observed in the <b>median</b> <b>plane.</b> The current literature suggests that sound localization in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> may depend on direction-specific spectral cues that are introduced by the pinna at high frequencies. The masking release observed here may also depend on these “pinna cues. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for characterizing the {{propagation}} of the magnetic flux in an artificially drilled bulk high-temperature superconductor (HTS) during a pulsed-field magnetization. As the magnetic pulse penetrates the cylindrical sample, the magnetic flux density is measured simultaneously in 16 holes by means of microcoils that are placed across the <b>median</b> <b>plane,</b> i. e. at an equal distance from {{the top and bottom}} surfaces, and close {{to the surface of the}} sample. We discuss the time evolution of the magnetic flux density in the holes during a pulse and measure the time taken by the external magnetic flux to reach each hole. Our data show that the flux front moves faster in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> than on the surface when penetrating the sample edge; it then proceeds faster along the surface than in the bulk as it penetrates the sample further. Once the pulse is over, the trapped flux density inside the central hole is found to be about twice as large in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> than on the surface. This ratio is confirmed by modelling...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThresholds for the {{detection}} of motion in depth in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> of the head are substantially poorer than those for motion in the frontoparallel plane. This suggests the existence of two independent mechanisms for their detection. Any three-dimensional (3 -D) motion can be decomposed into components of motion in the frontoparallel plane and in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> of the head. Can human performance for {{the detection}} and discrimination of other 3 -D motions be predicted by a combination of responses from the two independent mechanisms? Minimum displacement thresholds (dmin) {{for the detection}} of 3 -D motion and the direction discrimination of 3 -D motion were measured {{for a wide range of}} 3 -D directions. dmin data were modelled in terms of the probability summation of a pair of independent motion mechanisms, one responding to motion in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> of the head, the second to motion in the frontoparallel plane. Detection of 3 -D motion was well predicted by probability summation across a range of 3 -D directions. Direction discrimination of 3 -D motion was similarly well fit by the probability summation model for multiframe motion displays for some observers. However for two-frame motion displays, direction discrimination for 3 -D motion was best fit by a model using only a motion mechanism in the frontoparallel plane. Detection and direction discrimination thresholds for 3 -D motion can therefore be explained on the basis of one or two mechanisms, sensitive to motion in the frontoparallel plane and in the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> of the head...|$|R
40|$|When a {{listener}} {{is surrounded by}} multiple loudspeakers, {{some of which are}} located above and/or below him/her, an immersive threedimensional auditory display can be created with vector base amplitude panning (VBAP). In VBAP a complex loudspeaker layout is divided to loudspeaker triplets or pairs (sets). A sound signal is applied to loudspeakers of one set with different gain factors at one time, which creates a virtual source to a direction that does not necessarily correspond with any of the loudspeakers. The directional quality of virtual sources created with VBAP is studied in this paper. Listening tests are conducted with loudspeaker pairs in horizontal and vertical layouts, and with a loudspeaker triplet. The results are interpreted with a binaural model. The binaural model is further used to predict directional quality of virtual sources in arbitrary loudspeaker setups. It is found that VBAP predicts the angle between the <b>median</b> <b>plane</b> and a perceived virtual source quite accurately when the loudspeakers of a set are near the <b>median</b> <b>plane.</b> When loudspeakers are moved to a side of the listener, virtual source direction is biased towards the <b>median</b> <b>plane.</b> The elevation of virtual sources is perceived individually and can not be predicted with any panning law. 1...|$|R
