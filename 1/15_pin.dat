It provides two Digital Visual Interface (DVI) or Video Graphics Array (VGA) outputs {{in a single}} connector. An adapter cable is needed for conversion from DMS-59 (digital) to DVI (digital) or VGA (analog), and different types of adapter cables exist. The connector is four <b>pins</b> high and <b>15</b> <b>pins</b> wide, with a single pin missing from the bottom row, in a D-shaped shell, with thumbscrews.|$|R
5000|$|DE-15 {{has been}} {{conventionally}} referred to ambiguously as D-sub 15, incorrectly as DB-15 and often as HD-15 (High Density, to {{distinguish it from}} the DE-9 connector used on the older CGA and EGA cards, {{as well as some}} early VGA cards, which have the same E shell size but only two rows of pins).

50|$|Each M1000e {{enclosure}} {{can hold}} up to 32 quarter-height, 16 half-height blades or 8 full-height or combinations (e.g. 1 full-height + 14 half-height). The slots are numbered 1-16 where 1-8 are the upper blades and 9-16 are directly beneath 1-8. When using full-height blades you use slot n (where n=1 to 8) and slot n+8Integrated {{at the bottom of}} the front-side is a connection-option for 2 x USB, meant for a mouse and keyboard, as well as a standard VGA monitor connection (<b>15</b> <b>pin).</b> Next to this is a power-button with power-indication.|$|E
50|$|VGA {{connectors}} and cables carry analog component RGBHV (red, green, blue, horizontal sync, vertical sync) video signals, and VESA Display Data Channel (VESA DDC) data. In {{the original}} version of DE-15 pinout, one pin was keyed by plugging the female connector hole; this prevented non-VGA <b>15</b> <b>pin</b> cables from being plugged into a VGA socket. Four pins carried Monitor ID bits, which were rarely used; VESA DDC redefined some of these pins and replaced the key pin with +5 V DC power supply. Devices that comply with the DDC host system standard provide 5V ±5% and supply a minimum of 300 mA {{to a maximum of}} 1 A.|$|E
5000|$|Storage: The VRTX chassis {{includes}} {{shared storage}} slots that connect {{to a single}} or dual PERC 8 controller(s) via switched 6Gbit SAS. This controller which is managed through the CMC allows RAID groups to be configured and then allows for those RAID groups to be subdivided into individual virtual disks that can be presented out to either single or multiple blades. The shared storage slots are either 12 x 3.5" [...] HDD slots or 24 x 2.5" [...] HDD slots depending on the VRTX chassis purchased. Dell offers 12Gbit SAS disks for the VRTX, but these will operate at the slower 6Gbit rate for compatibility with the older PERC8 and SAS switches.Networking: The VRTX chassis has a built in IOM for supporting ethernet traffic to the server blades. At present the options for this IOM are an 8 port 1Gb pass-through module, a 24 Port 1Gb switch (R2401) and a 20 X 10Gb (+2*1Gb) switch (R2210). The 8 port pass through module offers 2 pass-through connections to each internal blade slot where the 24 port 1Gb switch option provides 16 internal ports (4 per blade slot) and 8 external ports {{to be used to}} uplink to the network. The R2210 has 16 internal, 4 external and two additional 1Gb external ports.The I/O modules used on the VRTX are a different size to the I/O modules of the M1000e, so I/O modules are not compatible between the systems.Management: A CMC is responsible for the management of the entire system. The CMC is similar to the CMC used in the M1000e chassis. Connection to the CMCs is done via separate RJ45 ethernet connectors.Power and cooling: The system comes with four PSUs at 110 or 230V AC. There is no option to use -48V DC PSUs. Each 1100 Watt PSU has a built-in fan. For cooling of the server-modules there are four blower-modules, each containing two fans, and for cooling {{of the rest of the}} chassis there are 6 internal fans which can only be reached by opening the chassis. The fans used are the same units as used in the PowerEdge R-720xd rack-server.KVM: Unlike the M1000e the VRTX doesn't have a separate KVM module, but it is built into the main chassis. The system only supports USB keyboard and mouse. Control of the KVM function is done via the mini LCD screen. These USB ports as well as the <b>15</b> <b>pin</b> VGA connector are at the front of the system.USB: The USB connectors are only for connecting keyboard and mouse; it doesn't support external storage via USB.LCD: Via the mini-LCD screen at the front of the system you can find status information of the system, configure some basic settings (such as CMC IP address) and manage the built-in KVM switch. The LCD screen functions can be controlled via a 5 button navigation system, similar to the system used on the M1000e.Serial: A single RS-232 serial communication port is provided at the back of the system. This connector is only used for local configuration to the CMC: it doesn't allow you to use this connector as serial port of a server in the system.Expansion slots: The system provides space for five PCIe Gen2 (2.0) expansion cards and 3 'full height' PCIe Gen2 (2.0) expansion cards. Via the management controller you can assign each slot to a specific server. You can only assign a PCIe slot to a server when the server is powered off as the PCIe card is recognized and initialized by the server BIOS at startup. Only certain PCIe cards are supported by Dell. Currently, VRTX support is limited to eight different PCIe cards, including six Ethernet NICs (Intel and Broadcom), a 6Git SAS adapter (LSI) and the AMD FirePro™ W7000.|$|E

40|$|Al-alloyed MgB 2 was {{prepared}} by solid state reaction of Mg (1 -x) A 1 (x) alloy and crystalline B powder particles. The nominal {{composition of the}} samples was Mg 1 -xAlxB 2, with x = 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, and 0. 3. Microstructure and chemical composition have been investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), and preliminary transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The Al concentration of the matrix is close to, but less than, the nominal Al concentration and the difference increases with increasing nominal Al concentration. Al is incorporated into MgB 2 grains of similar to 1 mu m size by substitution of Mg lattice sites with Al. Al {{was found to be}} distributed inhomogeneously, which partially explains the broadening of the superconducting transition width (Delta T-c) with increasing Al mole fraction. Al-alloyed samples contain large (similar to 15 mu m) and small (similar to 2 mu m) secondary phases embedded in the (Mg, Al) B- 2 matrix. The composition of large secondary phases is found to be (Mg, Al) B 7 +delta with the mole fraction of excess boron (6) increasing from 0. 99 at. % in the pure sample to 4. 14 at. % in the highest alloyed sample. The Al to Mg mole fraction ratio in these large secondary phases is about half of that in the matrix. The size and density of the large secondary phases increased with increase in Al mole fraction. The secondary phases constitute less than 4 % of the total sample volume and are thus not likely to affect the bulk superconductivity. Magnesium diffusion and evaporation governed the formation of secondary phases and can be explained by considering the effects of annealing temperature, annealing time, and boron powder particle size. The residual resistivity (p(0)) of pure MgB 2., (x = 0) and Al-alloyed MgB 2 (X = 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3), measured by the four-probe technique is comparable to the single crystals, indicating the excellent quality of these samples.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of Project POPACS (Polar Orbiting Passive Atmospheric Calibration Spheres) is {{to measure the}} changes in density of the auroral zone upper atmosphere, in response to various solar stimuli, such as flares and CMEs. The mission consists of deploying three 10 cm diameter Aluminum spheres into an elliptical polar orbit and tracking them as they make repeated perigee passes in the upper atmosphere, with special emphasis on perigee passes within both {{the northern and southern}} auroral zones. The spheres have identical external dimensions and surface compositions, and thus identical drag coefficients, but they have different masses (1, 1. 5, 2 kg) to vary their ballistic coefficients, which will cause them to spread out in right ascension along the original orbit. The Aluminum spheres will be coated with space-rated flat white paint so they can be both radar tracked by the U. S. Space Command and optically tracked by a world-wide network of university students and amateur observers with “Go To” telescopes. The observers will track the spheres, exchange their observations with each other, and calculate the density of the atmosphere above 325 km at the location of the perigee passes. POPACS will be launched during Solar Maximum 24, which is expected to peak in early 2013, and accordingly, the mission will be on a fast-track timeline: project start to launch and operation in 12 months! One of the mission enablers is the 3 U Canisterized Satellite Dispenser (3 U CSD) developed by Planetary Systems Corporation. While having similar internal dimensions to the P-POD (CubeSat launcher) design, the 3 U CSD has key features that provide higher payload mass capability (6 Kg), tabbed preload system to guarantee a stiff and modelable load path to the CubeSats, a higher ejection velocity, lower overall volume, mounting features to allow fastening of the CSD at any of the six faces, a <b>15</b> <b>pin</b> in-flight disconnect allowing battery charging and communication from the outside of the CSD into the payload while in the launch pad or on orbit, and a reusability that allows a separation test to be conducted at will without any consumables hundreds of times to guarantee reliability.
