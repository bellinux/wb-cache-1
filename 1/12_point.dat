25|$|The {{discovery}} by the NRL in 2016 {{of salary}} cap breaches, {{over a period}} of four years, resulted in it stripping the Eels of the twelve competition points the club has accrued so far in the 2016 NRL season. In addition to being fined $1 million, Parramatta also had its 2016 NRL Auckland Nines title revoked.. On 19 July 2016 the Parramatta Leagues Club board was sacked by the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority, and an administrator appointed. This effectively also removed the Eels board as the seven directors on both boards were the same people. Max Donnelly, of Ferrier Hodgson was appointed as administrator.. At the time of the <b>12</b> <b>point</b> deduction, Parramatta were sitting 5th on the ladder but then found themselves at 14th position. Their first match played after the points deduction was against South Sydney at Parramatta Stadium, Parramatta lost the match 22-20 in a close game. 2016 would also prove to be the final year that Parramatta would play at Parramatta Stadium as it was due to be demolished at seasons end {{to make way for a}} new 30,000 seat stadium. The final home game played at Parramatta Stadium was against The St George Dragons in front of 13,553 spectators. Parramatta went on to beat St George 30-18. Parramatta's final game of 2016 saw them travel to New Zealand to play The Auckland Warriors. Parramatta won the match 40-18 with Bevan French scoring 3 tries. At the end of the season, Parramatta finished in 14th place on the ladder but if they had not been stripped of the 12 competition points they would have played in the finals..|$|E

500|$|However, {{the firm}} did not release the poll results before the election. The {{day after the}} election, when Giron had been {{recalled}} by 12 points, they released the poll and company director Tom Jensen explained why they had not initially done so, citing numerous unusual results. These included the district supporting her recall by such a wide margin, despite having been carried by 20 points by Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 election; and voters saying they supported universal background checks by 68% to 27% and being split 47% to 47% on limiting high-capacity ammunition magazines to 15 bullets. Jensen opined that [...] "if voters were really making their recall votes based on those two laws, that doesn't point to recalling Giron by a <b>12</b> <b>point</b> margin" [...] and that the NRA had done a [...] "good job of turning the election more broadly into 'do you support gun rights or are you opposed to them.'" [...] Their decision not to release the poll before the election caused significant controversy, with some statisticians and journalists criticising them and others supporting them.|$|E
