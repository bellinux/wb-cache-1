5|$|A {{tropical}} wave in {{the western}} Caribbean organized into Tropical Depression Twenty on October <b>1.</b> <b>Off</b> {{the coast of the}} Yucatán Peninsula, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Stan on October 2. Stan made landfall on the Yucatán and weakened to a tropical depression, but upon reemerging into the Bay of Campeche it quickly strengthened into a hurricane on October 4. Stan made landfall later that morning on the east-central coast of Mexico, south of Veracruz, as a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone was first observed on September <b>1</b> <b>off</b> the southeast {{coast of the}} United States. Initially, it {{was believed to be}} the same storm that struck Guadeloupe on the same day, though subsequent research indicated there were two separate storms. The hurricane tracked by the Bahamas while tracking generally northward, and it attained major hurricane status over the western Atlantic Ocean. As it approached the United States coastline, the hurricane was very intense, with winds estimated at over 135 mph (215 km/h) and potentially as strong as 160 mph (260 km/h), or a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Late on September 2, the hurricane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina and later turned to the northeast to cross the Pamlico Sound.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Andres is {{one out of}} two {{tropical}} cyclones {{on record}} to strike El Salvador. The first named storm of the active 1997 Pacific hurricane season, Andres formed on June <b>1</b> <b>off</b> the coast of Mexico. It initially moved toward the coast, although a change in steering winds turned the storm toward Mexico and Guatemala. After passing just offshore, Andres again changed direction toward the southeast, gradually weakening in the process. On June 7, it turned toward and hit El Salvador before dissipating. The storm brought rainfall to coastlines along much of its path, destroying some houses and inflicted damage. Two fishermen were reported missing in Nicaragua due to high seas, and there were four deaths in El Salvador.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} match of the World Cup against Pakistan at Adelaide, Kohli hit 107 in 126 balls, sharing 100-plus {{partnerships}} with both Dhawan and Raina, to help India set {{a total of}} 300 and win the match by 76 runs. For his knock {{he was awarded the}} man of the match award, his 20th in ODIs and first in a World Cup match. He was dismissed for 46 in India's second match against South Africa after another century stand with opening batsman Dhawan. India went on to post 307 in 50 overs and register a 130-run victory in the match. India batted second in their remaining four group matches in which Kohli scored 33*, 33, 44* and 38 against UAE, West Indies, Ireland and Zimbabwe respectively. India went on to secure wins in these four fixtures and top the Pool B points with an undefeated record. In India's 109-run victory in the quarterfinal over Bangladesh, Kohli was dismissed by Rubel Hossain for 3 edging the ball to the wicket-keeper. India were eliminated in the semifinal by Australia at Melbourne, where Kohli was dismissed for <b>1</b> <b>off</b> 13 balls, top-edging a short-pitched delivery from Mitchell Johnson.|$|E

25|$|The {{opening of}} the Auckland Harbour Bridge and the Auckland Northern Motorway between Northcote Road and Fanshawe Street in May 1959 saw State Highway 1 {{diverted}} from its former route around the Waitematā Harbour. Northern extensions of the motorway in 1969 (to Tristram Avenue), 1979 (to Sunset Road) and 1984 (to Dairy Flat Highway via Greville Road) diverted State Highway <b>1</b> <b>off</b> Wairau Road and Albany Highway. A motorway extension from Greville Road to Silverdale in 1999 bypassed Dairy Flat Highway, which was re-designated State Highway 17. In 2009, the Northern Motorway was extended to Puhoi, bypassing Hibiscus Coast Highway through Orewa which was re-designated part of SH 17. However, SH 17 was short lived, being revoked in September 2012 and reverting to a local arterial road.|$|E
25|$|The {{start of}} the second Test was delayed by almost two hours due to rain, but when the match finally got started, England put the West Indies in to bat and took the first wicket with the first ball of the third over, James Anderson bowling Kraigg Brathwaite (<b>1)</b> <b>off</b> his pads. They then lost Devon Smith (15) just {{before the end of}} the morning session, caught behind off the bowling of Chris Jordan. Darren Bravo (35) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (1) then fell in quick {{succession}} midway through the afternoon session, before Marlon Samuels and Jermaine Blackwood shared a 55-run stand for the fifth wicket as Samuels reached a half-century. Blackwood was trapped LBW by Jordan shortly before the end of play, an original not out decision overturned on review, leaving Denesh Ramdin to join Samuels, who was six short of a century overnight. Samuels later claimed he was inspired to his long innings by Ben Stokes' sledging.|$|E

Three more Spitfires from 64 Squadron scrambled followed by 12 Hurricanes from 111 Squadron at Hawkinge, 111 Squadron using head-on attacks {{to break up the}} formation, which abandoned the attack with the Bf109s covered their retreat.

2500|$|The fourth NatWest Series match saw {{normal service}} resumed, with England beating Bangladesh by 168 runs after the hosts put on 391 for 4, the second-highest score in ODIs. The 2005 Twenty20 Cup started on 22 June, again with large audiences, and with last year's winners, Leicestershire, and runners-up, Surrey, both scoring wins. The fifth ODI allowed Australia back in, with a {{comfortable}} 57 win against England. Any anticipation {{over the next}} Australia v Bangladesh tie was easily brushed aside by the Aussies, who struck out Bangladesh for 139, and then reached their target in 19 overs without losing a wicket. Bangladesh were eliminated from the Series in the seventh ODI, when England beat them by five wickets. The eighth match {{should have been a}} rehearsal for the final, and Australia's 261 for 9 set the stage well. But rain was always expected and the contest was rained off as a [...] "no result" [...] with England 37 for <b>1</b> <b>off</b> 6 overs in their reply. Bangladesh's tour of England ended with a creditable performance against Australia in the ninth ODI, although their 250 for 8 was ultimately overcome by the Aussie with six wickets and eleven balls left after they had wobbled earlier in the innings. At the same time, the Twenty20 Cup was continuing apace, and Oxford University (610 for 5 declared) beat Cambridge University (129 and 268), with Salil Oberoi's 247 gaining positive comment in his native India.|$|E

[...] The next day, {{he became the first}} Dodgers rookie to homer in four consecutive games since Bill Sudakis in 1969, and became the youngest Dodgers rookie ever to do so. Pederson hit two homers on May 6, marking seven straight hits that went for home runs, the first time that had been done since 2013 and the first time by a rookie since rookie status was defined in the major leagues in 1958. On May 23, Pederson hit his third leadoff home run of the season, tying the Dodgers' rookie record set by Johnny Frederick in 1929. Pederson's nine home runs in May tied James Loney (September 2007) for the Dodgers' record for home runs by a rookie in a calendar month.

2500|$|For {{the first}} time in the series Richie Benaud won the toss and took the unusual step of putting England into bat, but he had four fast bowlers in his team and wanted to use them in the humid, {{swinging}} conditions. In the second over Ray Lindwall's first ball swung away and Trevor Bailey was caught first ball by Alan Davidson in third slip to give him his 216th Test wicket and equal Clarrie Grimmett's Australian record. Just before the Test Bailey had given a talk to the inmates of HMP Pentridge and had been asked if he had ever been out first ball in a Test match. He said he had not, but retained his sense of humour as he ordered roast duck for dinner after his dismissal. Peter May fell to Meckiff and England were 13/2, but Peter Richardson made a dogged 68 by forgoing his favourate deflections through the slips which had cost his wicket so many times. He added 48 with Colin Cowdrey (22) and 48 again with Tom Graveney (19), taking the score to 109/3. Tom Graveney was dismissed by Benaud; [...] "I remember him getting me out in the 1958–59 Melbourne Test by attacking my leg stump. He bowled me two half-volleys, the first of which I drove hard to Colin McDonald at mid-on. The second was just a fraction slower, and I was committed to the stroke before I spotted it. McDonald held the catch and the critics put it down to another casual shot from Graveney. They did not seem to notice the crafty part that Benaud had played in my dismissal". Ted Dexter was out first ball to Meckiff (2/57), Roy Swetman for <b>1</b> <b>off</b> Davidson and Richardson was caught and bowled by Benaud to leave England 128/7. Debutant John Mortimore showed his all round skills with an unbeaten 44, adding 63 with Fred Trueman (21) before Benaud (4/43) and Davidson (3/38) finished off the innings for 205 early on the second day.|$|E
