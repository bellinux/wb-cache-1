40|$|The 273 hyperfine {{components}} from 56 rotational transitions of chlorotrifluoroethylene {{were measured}} with a Fourier transform microwave spectrometer. A global least-squares fit was made to the rotational constants, quartic distortion constants, and 35 Cl quadrupole coupling constants; the RMS deviation of the fit was 1. 6 kHz. It is shown that such high-resolution measurements enable [chi]ab to be determined without the near degeneracies usually necessary with less precise data. The principle tensor quadrupole coupling constants are x[chi]zz = - 77. 46 (<b>10),</b> <b>xxx</b> = 38. 85 (10), and [chi]yy = xcc = 38. 614 (3) MHz. The values are comparable to other vinyl chlorides, removing some anomalies from previous studies...|$|E

These benchmarks compare {{the quality of}} the resulting depth map or recon-structed surface mesh. We describe the differences between several known stereo and multi-view stereo benchmarks and their various datasets. Also the modifications that are necessary to use our own GPU based multi camera stereo matching algorithm with the data from these benchmarks are discussed.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that for d 6 systems {{there are a number of}} low-lying ligand field (LF) states the {{relaxation}} from excited states of Fe(II) coordination compounds is, in general, a very fast and radiationless process. In Fe(II) spin-crossover systems, however, the zero point energy difference between the two lowest states, namely the low-spin (LS) 1 A 1 and the high-spin (HS) 5 T 2 state, is of the order of kBT, and some systems can be converted quantitatively to the HS state well below the thermal transition temperature by irradiating either into MLCT or LF absorption bands of the LS species, with HS→LS relaxation rates as small as 10 − 6 s− 1 at <b>XXX</b> <b>10</b> K. It is also possible to achieve a light-induced transient population of a HS state in Fe(II) LS compounds, but in this case the HS→LS relaxation rates can be larger than 106 s− 1 even at low temperatures. The HS→LS relaxation rates show strong deviations from Arrhenius kinetics with nearly temperature independent tunnelling below ˜ 70 K and a thermally activated behaviour above ˜ 100 K. The range of 12 orders of magnitude in the low temperature tunnelling rate can be understood in terms of nonadiabatic multiphonon relaxation, where in the strong coupling limit, with the Huang-Rhys parameter S much larger than the reduced energy gap p, an inverse energy gap law holds...|$|R
5000|$|The Ilvates were a Ligurian tribe, {{whose name}} is found only in the {{writings}} of Livy. He mentions them first as taking up arms in 200 BCE, in concert with the Gaulish tribes of the Insubres and Cenomani, to destroy the Roman colonies of Placentia (modern Piacenza) and Cremona. They are again noticed three years later as being still in arms, after the submission of their Transpadane allies; but in the course of that year's campaign (197 BCE) they were reduced by the consul Quintus Minucius Rufus, and their name does not again appear in history. (Liv. <b>xxx.</b> <b>10,</b> xxxi. 29, 30.) From the circumstances here related, it is clear that they dwelt on the north slopes of the Apennines, towards the plains of the Padus (modern Po River), and apparently not very far from Clastidium (modern Casteggio); but we cannot determine with certainty either the position or extent of their territory. Their name, like those of most of the Ligurian tribes mentioned by Livy, had disappeared in the Augustan age, and is not found in any of the [...] Charles Athanase Walckenaer, however, supposed the Eleates over whom the consul Marcus Fulvius Nobilior celebrated a triumph in 159 BCE and who are in all probability the same people with the Veleiates of Pliny, to be identical also with the Ilvates of Livy; but this cannot be assumed without further proof.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{images have}} become a {{ubiquitous}} medium for information communication across {{a broad range of}} application domains. Along with this ubiquity has come an immense growth in the capabilities of the devices and tools used to produce and edit this imagery. New advances in algorithms and methods are made at a large pace, which makes staying on top of the learning curve difficult for general users and even experts. To accommodate this need, commercial devices and software packages typically provide a suite of presets and shortcuts for common tasks with intuitive descriptors, determined by extensive internal user studies and expert interaction but often without publishing the actual parameters and their settings. We describe an emerging framework which strives to externalize these practices into a centralized web-based community effort called KAV-DB (Knowledge-Assisted Visualization Data Bank), to allow coverage of algorithms and applications not currently driven by immediate commercial focus but of wide interest to the community of visualization researchers. The vision of KAV-DB is to provide a web service to capture, analyze, and retrieve parameter settings for visualization algorithms, given the data at hand. KAV-DB builds on a robust user study evaluation theory, called conjoint analysis, to formulate statistical models of method parameters extracted by ways of efficient user studies. We demonstrate the assessment and analysis stage our framework via two diverse example applications: relation-aware volume exploration and text annotation of color images.

It is recommended after birth in order to remove {{the rest of the}} placenta and during lochia [1]. Aqueous preparations of the aerial parts are applied successfully in humans and animals. In order to confirm this ethnopharmacological report an infusion was prepared according to the traditional prescription and tested on the following isolated preparations of the guinea pig: uterus, arteria pulmonalis, aorta, papillary muscle, right atrium and terminal ileum. The effect of the aqueous extract on force of contraction (fc) and spontaneous frequency of contraction (f) was tested at three different concentrations (1 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL and 9 mg/mL). D. versicolor concentration-dependently increased fc and f of the uterus. At 9 mg/mL even resting tension was enhanced markedly. In contrast, the effects on other smooth muscle preparations like aorta and terminal ileum, and on heart preparations (papillary muscle, right atrium) were negligible. However, the arteria pulmonalis showed a remarkable increase in fc at the highest concentration tested (9 mg/mL). All the effects were found to be reversible. Summing up, the contractile effect of D. versicolor on the uterus was confirmed. High doses of an aqueous extract might additionally increase the contractility of the arteria pulmonalis, therefore the proper dosage plays an important role. The aqueous extract was prepared by shaking 100 g aerial parts (powdered) gently with 2500 mL water adjusted with trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2 for 1 h at 40 °C. The volatile acid was removed under vacuum, the remaining solution was freeze dried and yielded 21, 3 g aqueous extract (DER: ~ 5 : 1). Force of contraction of isolated preparations was measured isometrically in Krebs-Henseleit Solution at 37 °C. An appropriate resting tension was applied to allow maximal contractility of the preparations. After a control period the extract was added cumulatively every 45 min after steady-state had been reached. [1] Boldsaikhan B. Encyclopedia of Mongolian medicinal plants.
