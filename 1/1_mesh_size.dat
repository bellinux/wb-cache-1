Whilst some aspects of nematode processing techniques, such as extraction, have been extensively studied, other key elements have attracted little attention. We compared the effect of (<b>1)</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> (63, 45, and 32 μm) on estimates of nematode abundance, biomass, and body size, and (2) microscope magnification (50 and 100 ×) on estimates of nematode abundance at bathyal sites (250 - 3100 m water depth) on the Challenger Plateau and Chatham Rise, south-west Pacific Ocean. Variation in {{the effectiveness of these}} techniques was assessed in relation to nematode body size and environmental parameters (water depth, sediment organic matter content, %silt/clay, and chloroplastic pigments). The 63 -μm mesh retained a relatively low proportion of total nematode abundance (mean ±SD = 55 ± 9 %), but most of nematode biomass (90 ± 4 %). The proportion of nematode abundance retained on the 45 -μm mesh in surface (0 - 1 cm) and subsurface (1 - 5 cm) sediment was significantly correlated (P < 0. 01) with %silt/clay (R² = 0. 39) and chloroplastic pigments (R² = 0. 29), respectively. Variation in median nematode body weight showed similar trends, but relationships between mean nematode body weight and environmental parameters were either relatively weak (subsurface sediment) or not significant (surface sediment). Using a low magnification led to significantly lower (on average by 43 %) nematode abundance estimates relative to high magnification (P < 0. 001), and the magnitude of this difference was significantly correlated (P < 0. 05) with total nematode abundance (R²p = 0. 53) and the number of small (≤ 250 μm length) individuals (R²p = 0. 05). Our results suggest that organic matter input and sediment characteristics influence the abundance of small nematodes in bathyal communities. The abundance of small individuals can, in turn, influence abundance estimates obtained using different mesh sizes and microscope magnifications...|$|E

The spline approximation consists of two off-step points x_l ± 1 / 2 and a central point x_l, l = 0, 1, 2,...,N with two end points x_ 0 and x_N + 1, where h_l = x_l - x_l - 1, l = 1, 2,...,N + <b>1,</b> be the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> in x-direction and k = t_j + 1 - t_j > 0, j = 0, 1, 2,... be the mesh spacing in t-direction.

The mesh ratio is denoted by σ_l = (h_l + 1 /h_l) > 0, l = 1 (1)N. The neighboring off-step points are defined as x_l - 1 / 2 = x_l - h_l/ 2 and x_l + 1 / 2 = x_l + σ_lh_l/ 2, l = 1 (1)N.

The interaction between the valance and core electrons is described by norm-conserved Troullier–Martins pseudopotentials [44]. Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) [45] generalized gradient approximation (GGA) is employed as the exchange–correlation functional. The cutoff energy is 200 Ry. The Brillouin zone of the β 12 borophene sheet is sampled using a 31  ×  41  ×  <b>1</b> Monkhorst k-point <b>mesh</b> <b>size,</b> and 100  k-points centered at the -point are used in direction where the ribbon is periodic. We considered a 30  Å vacuum to eliminate the interlayer interactions in nonperiodic directions of the ribbons. All ribbons are fully relaxed until the force converges to 0.001  eV Å− 1. To investigate the magnetic properties of the ribbons, a supercell comprising two unit cells is employed in the optimization process. Thirteen orbitals are employed for each boron atom, consisting of two sets of orbitals of the s type, two sets of p type, and one set of d type, with cutoff radii of 2.8, 3.35, and 3.35  Å, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Currently, the {{production}} of biodiesel is shifting from 1 st generation to of 2 nd generation where the raw materials are mostly from non-edible type oils and fats. Production of biodiesel is commonly operated under batch operation using mechanical mixing to accelerate mass transfer. The main bottleneck of esterification of oils is that they often contain large amounts of free fatty acids (FFA) which is reduce the yield of biodiesel and requires longer production time (2 - 5 hours). This longer time and lower yield seem to be major disadvantage for biodiesel production. Ultrasonification {{has been used in}} many applications due to its ability to produce cavitations. Therefore this research is aimed to implement ultrasound technology to improve biodiesel production process. A unit of cleaner ultrasound was facilitated under constant temperature and 40 Hz frequency. The result of this research showed that the ultrasound reduced significantly the processing time while the yield of biodiesel increases. The appropriate model to describe correlation of yield and defined variabels is Y= 43, 4894 – 0, 6926 X 1 + 1, 1807 X 2 – 7, 1042 X 3 + 2, 6451 X 1 X 2 – 1, 6557 X 1 X 3 + 5, 7586 X 2 X 3 - 10, 5145 X 1 X 2 X 3, where X <b>1</b> is <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes,</b> X 2 ratio oil: methanol and X 3 amount of catalyzt...|$|R

40|$|Two grids {{have been}} {{developed}} for the Virginia Tech 6 ft x 6 ft Stability wind tunnel for the purpose of generating homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows for the study of unsteady airfoil response. The first, a square bi-planar grid with a 12 " <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> and an open area ratio of 69. 4 %, was mounted in the wind tunnel contraction. The second grid, a metal weave with a <b>1.</b> 2 in. <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> and an open area ratio of 68. 2 % was mounted in the tunnel test section. Detailed statistical and spectral measurements of the turbulence generated by the two grids are presented for wind tunnel free stream speeds of 10, 20, 30 and 40 m/s. These measurements show the flows to be closely homogeneous and isotropic. Both grids produce flows with a turbulence intensity of about 4 % at the location planned for the airfoil leading edge. Turbulence produced by the large grid has an integral scale of some 3. 2 inches here. Turbulence produced by the small grid is an order of magnitude smaller. For wavenumbers below the upper limit of the inertial subrange, the spectra and correlations measured with both grids at all speeds can be represented using the von Karman interpolation formula with a single velocity and length scale. The spectra maybe accurately represented over the entire wavenumber range by a modification of the von Karman interpolation formula that includes the effects of dissipation. These models are most accurate at the higher speeds (30 and 40 m/s) ...|$|R

We studied the feeding ecology of the prawn Pseudopalaemon bouvieri and its population structure in two different areas with six lagoons, with a different composition and abundance of aquatic macrophytes. At each site of macrophytes banks, 18 prawns sample was collected with a hand net (<b>1</b> mm <b>mesh</b> <b>size)</b> from <b>1</b> m². In the laboratory, prawns cephalothorax length was measured, sex determined, and a total of 208 stomachs were examined for food items. Our results showed that the population abundance varied between 10 ind/m² and 1 411 ind/m². The cephalothorax length ranged between 6 mm and 21 mm, and the male:female ratio varied between 0. 3 and 1. 0, with a higher proportion of ovigerous females (21 %) in area one than area two. P. bouvieri is omnivorous, and its diet was principally based on algae, plant remains, Protozoa, Rotifera, Oligochaeta, Crustacea, Insecta, detritus and other items. The analysis of the stomach content did not reveal any significant difference in the diet between juveniles and adults, and males and females of both areas consumed a similar diet (Kruskal-Wallis test p= 0. 8273). We concluded that the dietary items consumed by prawns and the niche breadth were similar between the two areas, although the proportion of items consumed varied between lagoons of both areas. The density of P. bouvieri was different between areas, but the size of cephalothorax (CL) was similar...|$|R

This study assessed the productivity level of Gada stream and examined the factors militating against its sustenance. A total of 150 respondents, consisting of local fishers, fresh and dry fish traders, fish consumers and those living along the stream were randomly sampled. Data collection was by personal observation, oral interview and semi-structured questionnaires. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results showed that there was decreased fish production in the stream. Factors militating against fish production in Gada stream were continuous excavation of sand (81. 33 %), destruction of stream banks due to farming activities (60. 0 %), water pollution (48. 67 %), seldom flood (42. 67 %), over exploitation of fish (28. 0 %) and the types of fishing gears and techniques involved (21. 33 %).
