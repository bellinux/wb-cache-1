Metallothionein fractions (MTs) in these organs were characterized using the hyphenated technique of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). After 10 days of exposure, maximum toxic metal {{concentrations of}} Hg, Cd and Pb were 10. 7 (gill), 0. 145 (kidney) and 0. 112 mu g g(dry weight) (- <b>1)</b> (<b>gill),</b> respectively. The pattern of accumulation of Hg and Pb was in the order gill > kidney > liver > muscle. In the case of Cd, accumulation was in the order kidney > gill > liver > muscle. Cd and Hg binding MTs were significantly induced in the gill, kidney and liver of all the exposure groups {{in comparison with the}} control group (p < 0. 05), and the amounts of them increased with the longer exposure time. Despite the higher intracellular Hg concentration and the stronger Hg-SH binding affinity, the amount of Cd-binding MTs was much higher than that of Hg-binding MTs. The results indicate that NIT synthesis in these organs was clearly metal-specific. MTs in gill may be used as a bio-marker to detect the metal pollution caused by Hg and Cd. Zinc and copper binding MTs in the organs of the exposed fish were also increased. This {{may be due to the}} MTs' important role in the homeostatic regulation of essential metals and their protective role against the acute toxicity of non-essential metals. Even though there was considerable accumulation of lead in the organs of the exposed fish, Pb-binding MT synthesis was non-significant. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of British colonial policy in {{southern}} Afiica in the <b>1</b> <b>gill</b> centwy. More specifically it looks at how British imperial policy, in the period 1875 to 1881, played itself out in two British colonies in southern Africa, Wlder {{the direction of a}} British imperial agent, William Owen Lanyon. It sets Lanyon {{in the context of the}} frontiers and attempts to link the histories of the people who lived there, the Africans, Boers and British settlers on the one han~ and the histories of colonial policy on the other. In doing so it also unravels the relationship between Lanyon and his superiors in London and those in southern Africa. In 1875 Owen Lanyon arrived in Griqualand West, where his brief was to help promote a confederation policy in southern Africa. Because of the discovery of diamonds some years earlier, Lanyon's administration had to take account of the rising mining industry and the aggressive new capitalist economy. He also had to deal with Griqua and Tlhaping resistance to colonialism. Lanyon was transferred to the Transvaal in 1879, where he was confronted by another community that was dissatisfied with British rule: the Transvaal Boers. Indeed, in Pretoria he was faced with an extremely difficult situation, which he handled very poorly. Boer resistance to imperial rule eventually came to a head when war broke out and Lanyon and his officials were among those besieged in Pretoria. In February 1881 imperial troops suffered defeat at the hands of Boer commandos at Majuba and Lanyon was recalled to Britain. In both colonies Lanyon was caught up in the struggle between the imperial power and the local people and, seen in a larger context, in the conflict for white control over the land and labour of Africans and that between the old pre-mineral South Africa and the new capitalist order. He made a crucial contribution to developments in the sub-continent and it is remarkable that his role in southern Africa has thus far been neglected. HistoryD. Litt. et Phil. (History...|$|E

We also estimated the mean weighted TL of the catches (TLW). Our analyses showed that the TL characteristics of longlines varied much more than those of gill and trammel nets. The longlines of large hooks (Nos. 10, 9, 7, 5) were very TL selective, and their trophic signatures had very steep slopes, the highest mean TL 50 values, very narrow mean TL 25 to TL 75 ranges and mean TLW > 4. In addition, the mean number of TL classes exploited was smaller and the mean TL 50 and TLW were larger for the longlines of small hooks (Nos. 15, 13, 12, 11) in Greek than in Portuguese waters. Trammel and gill nets caught more TL classes, and the mean slopes of their trophic signatures were significantly smaller than those of longlines as a group. In addition, the mean number of TL classes exploited, the mean TL 50 and the TLW of gill nets were significantly smaller than those of trammel nets. We attribute the differences between longlines of small hooks to bait type, and the differences between all gear types to their characteristic species and size-selectivity patterns.

Method: A systematic search was conducted to identify trials > 1 year in length using the following databases: CINAHL (January 1982 – July 2012), MEDLINE (Ovid and Cambridge Scientific Abstracts [CSA]), Psych info, Science Direct (Elsevier), and Cochrane Library. Hand searches of key journals in the subject, book chapters, and conference proceedings were also carried out. Relevant papers were critically appraised using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: Eight controlled trials were identified as being relevant, of duration ranging from 1 year to 8 years (at follow up). The total number {{of participants in the}} studies was 1, 057, of whom 579 (54. 7 %) were from one cohort and included 26 different outcome measures. Results suggest there is moderate-to-high-level evidence that combined pharmacological and behavioral interventions, and pharmacological interventions alone can be effective in managing the core ADHD symptoms and academic performance at 14 months. However, the effect size may decrease beyond this period. Conclusion: This review has highlighted the paucity and limitations of the evidence investigating the long-term outcomes of recommended interventions for managing ADHD symptoms. There is little evidence to suggest that the effects observed over the relatively short term are maintained throughout longer periods of impairment. Furthermore, much of the existing evidence examining effectiveness beyond 12 months does not include newer medications currently available or consider significant contextual and cultural differences, such as UK/European and Asian populations. Longitudinal studies are required to examine the long-term outcomes for children and young people with ADHD managed with currently recommended service interventions. They should also include the whole spectrum of ADHD, with its full range of coexisting conditions, and cultural and contextual diversity.

40|$|The limpet, Lepetodrilus fucensis McLean, {{is found}} in {{prominent}} stacks around hydrothermal vents on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. L. fucensis hosts a filamentous episymbiont on its gill lamellae that may be ingested directly by the gill epithelium. To assess the persistence of this symbiosis I used microscopy to examine the gills of L. fucensis from sites representing its geographic range and different habitats. The symbiosis is present on all the specimens examined in this study, including both sexes {{and a range of}} juvenile and adult sizes. Next, I aimed to determine if patterns in bacterial abundance, host condition, and gill morphology support the hypotheses that the bacteria are chemoautotrophic and provide limpets with a food resource. To do so, I compared specimens from high and low flux locations at multiple vents. My results support the above hypotheses: (<b>1)</b> <b>gill</b> bacteria are significantly less abundant in low flux where the concentrations of reduced chemicals (for chemoautotrophy) are negligible, (2) low flux specimens have remarkably poor tissue condition, and (3) the lamellae of high flux limpets have greater surface area: the blood space and bacteria-hosting epithelium are deeper and have more folds than low flux lamellae, modifications that support higher symbiont abundances. I next asked if the morphology of the lamellae could change. To test this, I moved high flux limpets away from a vent and after 1 year the lamellar depth and shape of the transplanted specimens resembled low flux gills. Last, I was interested in whether bacterial digestion by the gill epithelium is a significant feeding mechanism. As bacteria-like cells are rarely apparent in lysosomes of the gill epithelium, I predicted that lysosome number would be unrelated to bacterial abundance. My data support this prediction, suggesting that digestion of bacteria by the gill epithelium probably contributes only minimally to the limpet’s nutrition. Overall, the persistence and morphology of the L. fucensis gill symbiosis relates to the intensity of vent flux and indicates that specimens from a variety of habitats may be necessary to characterize the morphological variability of gill-hosted symbioses in other molluscs...|$|E

In the first experiment, three duplicate groups of approximately 500 salmon parr were fed at rates of 100 %, 66 % or 33 % of the manufacturer’s recommendation from shortly after first feeding. Each group {{were exposed to}} a photoperiod regime which was expected to result in smoltification 9 months after first feeding. In the second experiment, three duplicate groups of 550 fish were fed 100 %, 66 % or 33 % of the manufacturer’s recommendation from first feeding and exposed to a simulated natural photoperiod, which was expected to result in smoltification 13 months after first feeding. In both experiments fish size increased with ration, with recruitment to the upper modal group (UMG) of the population also related to ration (85 - 96 %, 64 - 88 % and 28 - 42 % UMG fish for the full, two-thirds and one-third ration groups respectively, recorded {{at the conclusion of}} each experiment). Throughout each experiment the full and two-thirds ration fish maintained similar whole body lipid concentrations, although lipid concentrations in the one-third ration fish were generally lower.

Following 24 h seawater challenges, conducted during the parr-smolt transformation, UMG fish from the full and two-thirds groups of experiment 1 displayed high survival rates (100 %) and low serum osmolalities (335 mOsm. kg- 1), with lower survival rates (75 %) and higher serum osmolalities (370 mOsm. kg- 1) recorded in the one-third ration fish. In experiment 2 similar survival rates (100 %) and serum osmolalities (350 mOsm. kg- 1) were found in all ration groups.

We observed interactions between PFOS and CO 2 exposure on transcription of gill glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx <b>1),</b> <b>gill</b> manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and liver phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) (Paper I). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β (PPAR-β) was increased in cod liver by CO 2, and the response was higher {{in the presence of}} PFOS (Paper I). In Paper II, PCA-biplots showed clustering of samples based on CO 2 concentration, and the distribution of response parameters indicated that hypercapnia was the main driver of hormone responses. Changes in estradiol- 17 β (E 2), testosterone (T) and 11 -ketotestosterone (11 -KT) levels and E 2 -responsive genes were increased by hypercapnia alone at day 3 and 9, and by combined exposure scenarios (Paper II). Hypercapnia increased cytochrome P 450 1 A (CYP 1 A) mRNA alone and in combination with PFOS (Paper II). In Paper III and IV, primary Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) hepatocytes were exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) (0, 25 and 50 μM) singly, and in combination with hypoxia-inducible compounds (cobalt chloride: CoCl 2 and deferoxamine: DFO) for 24 and 48 h. We observed that combined exposure generally altered the transcription of antioxidant responses and lipid regulation, showing higher effect of hypoxia, compared to PFOSA (PCA-plots Paper III-IV). Hypoxic condition alone, and in combination with PFOSA, increased transcription of E 2 -responsive genes, CYP 1 A and CYP 3 A responses (Paper III). Transcription of PPAR-α, -β and –γ, and the ω 6 :ω 3 ratio was increased by DFO and these responses were modulated in the presence of PFOSA (Paper IV). In addition, we observed a parallel increase of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF- 1 α), acyl coenzyme A oxidase (ACOX) and PPAR-γ, indicating a link between lipid metabolism and hypoxic responses (Paper IV). Changes in PPAR system and FA β-oxidation (ACOD and ACOX) suggests complex changes in the regulation of lipid homeostasis and FA metabolism, where PFASs modulated the responses produced by hypercapnia or hypoxia alone (Paper I and IV). Changes in the composition of ω 6 and ω 3 FAs in salmon hepatocytes and reduced PEMT transcription in cod liver were observed (Paper I and IV), indicating that climate change variables alone and in combination with PFASs may potentially alter membrane lipid composition and possibly produce overt physiological consequences. These studies indicate that parameters of climate change and PFASs affect sex steroids, E 2 -responsive genes and the CYP system, and that combined exposure generally produced higher response than single exposure (Paper II and III). These findings show that processes involved in endocrine signaling and biotransformation are very complex and hard to predict due to biphasic responses and possibly interaction between stressors. This thesis provides new and valuable insight on the combined effects of quantifiable parameters of climate change and environmental pollutants. Potential interaction between environmental stressors and the relevance of considering exposure duration were revealed, emphasizing the importance of investigating combined and chronic exposure scenario...|$|E
40|$|European {{whitefish}} (Coregonus lavaretus) is {{a commercially}} and recreationally important {{species in the}} Gulf of Bothnia (Figure 1), where the salinity of the surface water increases from ~ 2 ‰ to ~ 6 ‰ in the north-south (~ 725 km) direction. Two sympatric ecotypes with similar outer features occur: stationary sea spawning whitefish and migrating anadromous river spawning whitefish (Lehtonen 1981). The two types mix in sea away from breeding locations and off breeding time. River spawning whitefish can undertake long feeding and spawning migrations, e. g. {{between the north and}} the south of the gulf. The river spawning whitefish abundantly occur at feeding grounds in the south where they stay for years, until maturing. Mainly due to anthropogenic destruction of the spawning rivers, the river spawning whitefish has diminished during last decades and is presently listed among endangered species (Helcom 2013). A reliable assessment of the two ecotypes and their subpopulations is a prerequisite for taking effective actions for stock preservation. In order to compare methods for whitefish ecotype identification we undertook genotyping, otolith chemistry analysis and gill raker counting on river and sea spawning whitefish populations. Materials and methods. Whitefish to undergo spawning was sampled from rivers along the Finnish west coast (river spawners) and at sea from known spawning sites close to the southern feeding grounds at the Åland Islands and the Archipelago Sea (sea spawners) (Himberg et al. 2015, Figure <b>1).</b> <b>Gill</b> rakers were counted on the left outer arch. Data on gill raker number was also collected from literature. Genetic diversity was assessed by nine microsatellite markers (Ozerov et al. 2015). Two methods were used for otolith (sagittae) chemistry analysis. Otoliths were dissolved and analyzed for elemental concentrations with ICP-OES (Hägerstrand et al. 2015), or polished to the core and analyzed for core strontium concentration by PIXE analyses (Lill et al. 2015). Results and discussion. The genetic divergence between river and sea spawning whitefish was low (Ozerov et al. 2015), indicating that genotyping is of little use to differentiate between the two ecotypes on its own. However, genotyping may add to differentiation in combination with other methods such as otolith chemistry analysis and gill raker counting. Otolith chemistry identified naturally reproduced river and sea spawning whitefish based on differences in the strontium concentration in the otolith core region (Lill et al. 2015). Furthermore, bulk otolith elemental concentration analysis (Ba, Sr, Zn, Mn, Mg, Fe) mapped whitefish populations to different regions in the Gulf of Bothnia, and indicated migrating populations (Hägerstrand et al. 2015). Here, barium was shown to be a useful freshwater-seawater (salinity) gradient indicator. Gill raker counting showed that the average gill raker number of river and sea spawning whitefish was significantly different (t= 22. 50, df= 934, p< 0. 0001), i. e. 29. 9 ± 2. 14 (n= 480) and 26. 7 ± 2. 21 (n= 450), respectively (Himberg et al. 2015). Despite the overlapping distributions of gill rakers between the ecotypes, the average gill raker number can be used to approximate the ratios of the ecotypes and the alterations in them. In conclusion, gill raker counting was verified as an easy, fast and inexpensive method to estimate the spatiotemporal proportion of river and sea spawning whitefish at the southern feeding grounds of the Gulf of Bothnia. The gill raker counting method is well suited to aid in a sustainable management of whitefish stocks. The stability of gill raker numbers in whitefish populations (Himberg et al. 2015) is essential when using this character in approximating the proportion of river and sea spawning whitefish. Interestingly, while the mean number of gill rakers in river spawner populations along the Finnish west coast has stayed stably high (normally ~ 30) at least during a century (Himberg et al. 2015), the mean gill raker number of sea spawners at the southern Åland Islands (Tengsöda, Geta) has decreased from an average of ~ 27. 5 during 1964 - 1980 (Himberg 1970, Himberg 1978, Lehtonen 1981, Himberg 1995), to below 26 at today (Table 1, Supplemental Data). This decrease is probably the result of stocking during recent decades of sea spawning whitefish from the local hatchery (Guttorp, Åland Islands), and of the initial selection of brood fish for this activity. The low number of gill rakers of local sea spawning whitefish at the Åland Islands aids in differing it from river spawning migrators. Stocking has substantially increased the abundance of whitefish in the Gulf of Bothnia (Leskelä et al. 2009, Jokikokko and Huhmarniemi 2014). As a result of compensatory stocking to preserve river spawner populations and stocking to increase fisheries catches, a vast amount of the river spawning whitefish “type” fish is released every year. The stocked fish is raised in freshwater ponds. The juvenile fish is released into rivers and river estuaries along the west coast of Gulf of Bothnia, and also into the sea e. g. at the feeding grounds in the southern Archipelago Sea. The fish released into the sea to increase fisheries catches is often of the River Kokemäki whitefish origin since this whitefish is fast growing and gets big (Lehtonen 1981). The proportion in the sea of naturally reproduced and stocked river spawning whitefish is unknown as methods to differentiate between them are not well developed. In the accompanying paper in this series we describe a method that can resolve this issue (Hägerstrand et al. 2015, Front. Mar. Sci. doi: 10. 3389 /conf. FMARS. 2015. 03. 00113). River spawning whitefish raised in fresh-water ponds and stocked in northern rivers or river estuaries maintain their feeding migration instinct and also return to their home river following maturation (Leskelä et al. 2009, Jokikokko et al. 2014). When stocked in the sea they ascend into rivers close to the site of release (Leskelä et al. 2009). Stocked river spawners can also re-establish populations in rivers from where the river spawning whitefish type has disappeared (Chris Karppinen, personal communication). The homing behavior and spawning characteristics of river spawners stocked in the southern Archipelago Sea far from large rivers are not known. Thus, it remains unclear if these fishes interfere with the spawning of local whitefish and alter their genetic properties...|$|E

Although, the underlying mechanism for neuronal degeneration in sporadic PD remains unknown, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and proteasomal dysfunction are proposed as contributing factors. In this study rats were chronically and continuously exposed to the pesticide, dichlorvos to identify the molecular mechanism of nigrostaital neuronal degeneration. Result: Chronic dichlorvos exposure (2. 50 mg/kg b. wt. s. c/daily for 12 weeks) caused nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration. The degenerative changes were accompanied by a loss of 60 - 80 % of the nigral dopamine neurons and 60 - 70 % reduction in striatal dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase levels.

40|$|Pathogens {{belonging}} to the genus Perkinsus infect many bivalve molluscan species around the world, including the Manila clam Ruditapes phihppinarum. We investigated the spatial distribution of this parasite at 34 stations throughout Arcachon Bay (SW France). Prevalence of perkinsosis was 93 % and mean infection abundance was 96 x 10 (3) cells g(- <b>1)</b> wet <b>gill.</b> Lowest mean abundances were found close to the Leyre River mouth and a significant negative correlation was observed between mean abundance and salinity. Perkinsosis was rare at the oceanic site where salinities and other environmental parameters were stable. A second {{aim of this study}} was to survey perkinsosis during annual cycles at 4 sites within Arcachon Bay. Prevalence and intensities (+/-SE) of the disease were high, on average between 70 and 100 %, and 130 x 10 (3) +/- 6. 7 x 10 (3) cells g(- <b>1)</b> wet <b>gill.</b> No seasonal cycle was evident. Clams were infected at 9 mm shell length and infection increased with clam size. The third objective was to determine the disinfection and infection kinetics through a 21 mo reciprocal transplantation between a nearly Perkinsus sp. -free area and a highly affected site. Disinfection appeared to be a very slow process and was similar at the site with favorable conditions for Perkinsus sp. as at the site with unfavorable conditions. Conversely, infection acquisition appeared to be episodic with spatially defined areas. Consequently, the overall lack of a clear seasonal infection pattern is interpreted as the combination of episodic infection events and slow disinfection kinetics...|$|R
