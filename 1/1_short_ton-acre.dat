40|$|Laminins are multidomain glycoproteins {{that play}} {{important}} roles in development and maintenance of the extracellular matrix via their numerous interactions with other proteins. Several receptors for the laminin short arms revealed their importance in network formation and intercellular signaling. However, both the detailed structure of the laminin Î³- <b>1</b> <b>short</b> arm and its organization within the complexes is poorly understood due {{to the complexity of}} the molecule and the lack of a high-resolution structure. The presented data provide the first subatomic resolution structure for the laminin Î³- <b>1</b> <b>short</b> arm in solution. This was achieved using an integrated approach that combined a number of complementary biophysical techniques such as small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy. As a result of this study, we have obtained a significantly improved model for the laminin Î³- <b>1</b> <b>short</b> arm that represents a major step forward in molecular understanding of laminin-mediated complex formations.

40|$|We {{describe}} the detailed structural investigation of nidogen- 1 /laminin c 1 complexes using full-length nidogen- 1 {{and a number}} of laminin c 1 variants. The interactions of nidogen- 1 with laminin variants c 1 LEb 2 – 4, c 1 LEb 2 – 4 N 836 D, c <b>1</b> <b>short</b> arm, and c <b>1</b> <b>short</b> arm N 836 D were investigated by applying a combination of (photo-) chemical cross-linking, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and computational modeling. In addition, surface plasmon resonance and ELISA studies were used to determine kinetic constants of the nidogen- 1 /laminin c 1 interaction. Two complementary cross-linking strategies were pursued to analyze solution structures of laminin c 1 variants and nidogen- 1. The majority of distance information was obtained with the homobifunctional amine-reactive cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) glutarate. In a second approach, UV-induced cross-linking was performed after incorporation of the diazirine-containing unnatural amino acids photo-leucine and photo-methionine into laminin c 1 LEb 2 – 4, laminin c <b>1</b> <b>short</b> arm, and nidogen- 1. Our results indicate that Asn- 836 within laminin c 1 LEb 3 domain is not essential for complex formation. Cross-links between laminin c <b>1</b> <b>short</b> arm and nidogen- 1 were found in all protein regions, evidencing several additional contact regions apart from the known interaction site. Computational modeling based on the cross-linking constraints indicates the existence of a conformational ensemble of both the individual proteins and the nidogen- 1 /laminin c 1 complex. This finding implies different modes of interactio...|$|R
40|$|SummaryRibosomal S 6 kinase 1 (S 6 K 1) {{is a major}} mTOR {{downstream}} signaling molecule {{that regulates}} cell size and translation efficiency. Here, we report that short isoforms of S 6 K 1 are overproduced in breast cancer cell lines and tumors. Overexpression of S 6 K <b>1</b> <b>short</b> isoforms induces transformation of human breast epithelial cells. The long S 6 K 1 variant (Iso- 1) induced opposite effects. It inhibits Ras-induced transformation and tumor formation, while its knockdown or knockout induces transformation, suggesting that Iso- 1 has a tumor-suppressor activity. Furthermore, we found that S 6 K <b>1</b> <b>short</b> isoforms bind and activate mTORC 1, elevating 4 E-BP 1 phosphorylation, cap-dependent translation, and Mcl- 1 protein levels. Both a phosphorylation-defective 4 E-BP 1 mutant and the mTORC 1 inhibitor rapamycin partially blocked the oncogenic effects of S 6 K <b>1</b> <b>short</b> isoforms, suggesting that these are mediated by mTORC 1 and 4 E-BP 1. Thus, alternative splicing of S 6 K 1 acts as a molecular switch in breast cancer cells, elevating oncogenic isoforms that activate mTORC 1...|$|R

While, if the fixed point y^* of Poincaré map is larger than the y_h^* and (1 -θ)V_L>x_ 1 ^*, then we say that model (2.2) has an order- 1 long limit cycle Γ_l, as shown in Figure  7. The order- <b>1</b> <b>short</b> or long limit cycle may {{play a key role in}} real problems with state-dependent feedback control actions, which tells us how frequently the control tactics should be applied or how to design the control tactics to adjust the period of control actions.|$|R
