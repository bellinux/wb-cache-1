40|$|Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seed {{germination}} is strongly temperature dependent and under high temperatures, germination {{of most of}} genotypes can be erratic or completely inhibited. Lettuce seeds of 'Dark Green Boston' (DGB) were incubated at temperatures ranging from 15 ° to 35 °C at light and dark conditions. Other seeds were imbibed in dark at 20 °; 25 °; 30 °; and 35 °C for 8 and <b>16</b> <b>hours</b> and then transferred to 20 or 35 °C, in dark. Seeds were also incubated at constant temperature of 20 ° and 35 °C, in the dark, as control. In another treatment, seeds were primed for 3 days at 15 °C with constant light. DGB lettuce seeds required light to germinate adequately at temperatures above 25 °C. Seeds incubated at 20 °C had 97 % germination, whereas seeds incubated at 35 °C did not germinate. Seeds imbibed at 20 °C for 8 and <b>16</b> <b>hours</b> had germination. <b>At</b> 35 °C, seeds imbibed initially at 20 °C for 8 and <b>16</b> <b>hours,</b> had 89 and 97 % germination, respectively.

40|$|A temperature-compensated {{resistance}} {{static strain}} gage with {{potential to be}} used to 600 C was recently developed.

Previous conclusions that GLUT 3 is not expressed in human muscle were likely drawn because of artifacts related to degradation of GLUT 3 protein in the specimens prior to study. Because of the rapid degradation of protein and mRNA, autopsy specimens of muscle must be obtained within 6 hours of death, and even then, protein and mRNA data will likely dramatically underestimate their expression in fresh muscle.
