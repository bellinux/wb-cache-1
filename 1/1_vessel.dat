40|$|Blood vessel {{formation}} {{requires the}} integrated regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and branching morphogenesis, but how this coordinated regulation is achieved {{is not well}} understood. Flt- 1 (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF] receptor 1) is a high affinity VEGF-A receptor whose loss leads to vessel overgrowth and dysmorphogenesis. We examined the ability of Flt- 1 isoform transgenes to rescue the vascular development of embryonic stem cell–derived flt- <b>1</b> −/− mutant <b>vessels.</b> Endothelial proliferation was equivalently rescued by both soluble (sFlt- 1) and membrane-tethered (mFlt- 1) isoforms, but only sFlt- <b>1</b> rescued <b>vessel</b> branching. Flk- <b>1</b> Tyr- 1173 phosphorylation was increased in flt- <b>1</b> −/− mutant <b>vessels</b> and partially rescued by the Flt- 1 isoform transgenes. sFlt- <b>1</b> –rescued <b>vessels</b> exhibited more heterogeneous levels of pFlk than did mFlt- <b>1</b> –rescued <b>vessels,</b> and reporter gene expression from the flt- 1 locus was also heterogeneous in developing vessels. Our data support a model whereby sFlt- 1 protein is more efficient than mFlt- 1 at amplifying initial expression differences, and these amplified differences set up local discontinuities in VEGF-A ligand availability that are important for proper vessel branching...|$|R

40|$|Background—Extracellular matrix (ECM) {{remodeling}} {{is central}} to the development of restenosis after PTCA. Substantial evidence implicates transforming growth factor- 1 (TGF- 1), a regulator of ECM deposition by vascular cells, in its pathogenesis. TGF- 3 reduces TGF- 1 —induced ECM deposition in cutaneous wounds. We therefore investigated the effects of intracoronary expression of TGF- 3 and TGF- 1 on luminal loss after angioplasty. Methods and Results—Porcine coronary arteries received an adenovirus expressing TGF- 3, TGF- 1, or lacZ (-galactosidase), or PBS only, at the site of angioplasty. Morphometric analysis 28 days after angioplasty confirmed reduced luminal loss in TGF- 3 vessels (0. 650. 10 mm 2) compared with lacZ (1. 180. 19 mm 2) or PBS only (1. 190. 17 mm 2; P 0. 003). Luminal loss was not reduced in TGF- <b>1</b> <b>vessels</b> (<b>1.</b> 020. 19 mm 2; P 0. 48). An increase in the external elastic lamina area in TGF- 3 –treated vessels (0. 730. 32 mm 2) contrasted with decreases in control vessels (mean, 0. 530. 17 mm 2; P 0. 001) and TGF- <b>1</b> <b>vessels</b> (0. 870. 34 mm 2; P 0. 003). Collagen content increased at the site of injury in TGF- 3 –treated vessels (26. 114. 2 %) but decreased in the lacZ (22. 86. 6 %) and PBS-only (23. 47. 0 %; P 0. 002) groups and was not significantly changed in TGF- <b>1</b> –treated <b>vessels.</b> Conclusions—Expression of TGF- 3 inhibits constrictive remodeling after PTCA and reduces luminal loss. This is accompanied by increased adventitial collagen, which may act as an external “scaffold ” preventing vessel constriction. These findings confirm the potential of gene therapies that modify ECM remodeling for prophylaxis of restenosis...|$|R

5000|$|The seismic {{properties}} of salt poses an additional problem for marine seismic surveys, it attenuates seismic waves and its structure contains overhangs {{that are difficult}} to image. This led to another variation on the NATS survey type, the wide-azimuth towed streamer (or WAZ or WATS) and was first tested on the Mad Dog field in 2004. [...] This type of survey involved <b>1</b> <b>vessel</b> solely towing a set of 8 streamers and 2 separate vessels towing seismic sources that were located at the start and end of the last receiver line (see diagram). This configuration was [...] "tiled" [...] 4 times, with the receiver vessel moving further away from the source vessels each time and eventually creating the effect of a survey with 4 times the number of streamers. The end result was a seismic dataset with a larger range of wider azimuths, delivering a breakthrough in seismic imaging. [...] These are now the three common types of marine towed streamer seismic surveys.|$|E
50|$|To {{discover}} {{the extent and}} severity of coronary artery ectasia {{there are a variety}} of diagnostic tools used. The most common method for discovering the disease is through angiography. Angiography is the procedure where a contrast dye is entered into the vessels and an x-ray is taken, which will allow the vessels to be seen on the x-ray. Using angiography clinicians are able to display the size, location and number of vessels affected by the disease. Is can also be analyzed through other methods such as intravascular ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging. Using these diagnostic methods, it has been discovered that the disease normally occurs most often in the right coronary artery, followed by the left anterior descending artery, and finally the left anterior circumflex artery. Using these methods Coronary artery ectasia can be divided into four different types: Type 1¬→diffuse ectasia in 2-3 different vessels, Type 2¬→ diffuse disease in <b>1</b> <b>vessel</b> and local disease in another, Type 3¬→ diffuse disease in one vessel and Type 4¬→ localized or segmental ectasia.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{define the}} {{specificity}} {{and extent of}} duplex sonography (DS) findings suggestive of vessel wall inflammation in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA). METHODS: Patients admitted between December 2006 and April 2009 to the University Hospital Basel with a suspicion of GCA were eligible for the study. DS of 2 x 11 arterial regions was performed in all study participants, and American College of Rheumatology criteria were applied to classify patients into GCA or non-GCA groups. RESULTS: GCA was diagnosed in 38 of the 72 participants (53 %). A DS pattern suggestive of vessel wall inflammation was not observed {{in any of the}} patients in the non-GCA group but, in 21 of the 38 patients with GCA (55 %), DS signs suggestive of vessel wall inflammation of > or = <b>1</b> <b>vessel</b> region were detected. In 12 of the 38 patients with GCA (32 %), DS signs of large vessel vasculitis (LVV) were found in > or = <b>1</b> <b>vessel</b> region(s) of both upper and lower limb vessels. Follow-up DS was performed 6 months after the baseline examination in 9 of the 12 patients with LVV and showed the persistence of most findings despite normalised signs of systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: DS detects changes in the vessel wall that appear to be specific for GCA; they can be present in upper and lower limb arteries of patients with GCA. Surprisingly, DS-detectable LVV and signs of systemic inflammation are largely dissociated...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Vitronectin (VN), malondialdehyde (MDA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive rotein (hs-CRP) are {{cooperative}} agents {{involved in}} the atherosclerosis process. The {{study was conducted to}} assess the correlation of VN, MDA and hs-CRP with the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: Parameters such as serum VN, MDA and hs-CRP were measured in 250 subjects including 200 patients with angiographically diagnosed CAD (50 subjects with non-significant CAD, 50 with single vessel disease, 50 with double vessel disease, and 50 with triple vessel disease) and 50 CAD-free subjects as a control group. Serum VN was measured with ELISA; MDA was measured based on reaction with thiobarbituric acid (TBA); and hs-CRP level was measured by a Commercial Kit by Immunoturbidimetry. Results: Serum VN, MDA and hs-CRP were significantly higher in patient groups compared to control group (P<. 05). The mean value of MDA between <b>1</b> <b>vessel</b> and 3 vessel groups had significant difference (P=. 01), also mean value of MDA between 2 vessel and control group and normal group showed significant difference (P<. 001). The difference of MDA between 3 vessel and normal and <b>1</b> <b>vessel</b> and control group was significant (P<. 001). Conclusion: The association and correlation between VN, MDA and hs-CRP indicate their involvement in the atherosclerosis process that may lead to progression of CAD. Also, these findings suggested that serum levels of VN, MDA and hs-CRP can help as diagnostic and monitoring markers in CAD patients and as markers of disease severity...|$|E
