40|$|Abstract: Road {{accident}} {{is currently}} {{one of the}} major causes of death in Malaysia. The effort to ensure better road safety requires large allocation of resources which further signifies the importance of economic valuation in every possible area inflicted by road accident. This task is achievable by associating cost to the potential consequence of fatal risk due to road accident using the willingness to pay approach. Several earlier studies in Malaysia have been conducted using Lost Output, Human Capital and Contingent Valuation Method (CV). This report described and analyzed our latest nationwide valuation study using Conjoint Analysis (CA) undertaken in 2008. In comparing between both Stated Preference approaches our findings suggest minimal difference in the final estimation of the Value of Statistical Life (VOSL). The VOSL estimates for fatal injury in CV study range from RM <b>1.</b> 2 <b>million</b> to RM <b>1.</b> 4 <b>million</b> whilst CA gives a range of RM <b>1.</b> 15 <b>million</b> to RM <b>1.</b> 45 <b>million...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} effect of the “ <b>1.</b> 03 <b>million</b> yen ceiling ” in a dynamic labor supply model. In Japan, married women have reasons to {{constrain}} her earnings to less than <b>1.</b> 03 <b>million</b> yen to receive various benefits. The reasons include: (1) married women with low earnings are eligible for social security and health care benefits through her husband’s coverage, (2) the husband can claim the Exemption for Spouse and the Special Exemption for Spouse in his income tax, and (3) the husband often receives allowance for spouse from his employer, if the wife’s earnings are low. The “ <b>1.</b> 03 <b>million</b> yen ceiling ” has been blamed for creating distortions in labor supply choices for this group of workers. I assess the distortionary effect of <b>1.</b> 03 <b>million</b> yen ceiling in a dynamic labor supply model, and show that the welfare cost of the ceiling may differ significantly from the one derived from a static model...|$|R
