This technique enables the description of a quantitative relationship between the dose delivered to a population of single cells and the fraction of the population “reproductively surviving, 2 ̆ 2 i. e. able to reproduce indefinitely.

Despite their low frequency, the L <b>1</b> <b>RAD</b> events deleted ≈ 450 kb of the human genome. One L <b>1</b> <b>RAD</b> event generated a large deletion of ≈ 64 kb. Multiple alignments of prerecombination and postrecombination L 1 elements suggested that two different deletion mechanisms generated the L 1 RADs: nonallelic homologous recombination (55 events) and nonhomologous end joining between two L 1 s (18 events). In addition, the position of L <b>1</b> <b>RADs</b> throughout the genome does not correlate with local chromosomal recombination rates.

The effects of these mutations on the DNA damage and DNA replication checkpoints have been analyzed, as well as their associated phenotypes in a cdc 17 -K 42 or a wee 1 - 50 background.

The rad mutations have pleiotropic phenotypes; spo 11 is only defective in sporulation and meiosis. The RAD 6, RAD 50 and SPO 11 genes are not required for spontaneous mitotic recombination; mutations in the RAD 52 gene cause a general spontaneous mitotic Rec- phenotype. Mutations in RAD 50, RAD 52 or SPO 11 eliminate meiotic recombination, and mutations in RAD 6 prevent spore formation. Evidence for the involvement of RAD 6 in meiotic recombination is less clear. Mutations in all three RAD genes confer sensitivity to X rays; the RAD 6 gene is also required for UV damage repair. To test whether any of these functions might be involved in the hyper-rec phenotype conferred by rem 1 mutations, double mutants were constructed. Double mutants of rem 1 spo 11 were viable and demonstrated rem 1 levels of mitotic recombination, suggesting that the normal meiotic recombination system is not involved in producing the rem 1 phenotype.

Additionally, repair synthesis was complemented by mixing different mutant extracts, or by adding purified <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> or <b>Rad</b> 10 protein to <b>rad</b> <b>1</b> or <b>rad</b> 10 mutant extracts, respectively. The latter observation demonstrates that the <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> and <b>Rad</b> 10 proteins directly participate in the biochemical pathway of NER. NER supported by nuclear extracts requires ATP and Mg 2 + and is stimulated by polyethylene glycol and by small amounts of whole cell extract containing overexpressed Rad 2 protein. The nuclear extracts also contain base-excision repair activity that is present at wild-type levels in rad mutant extracts. This cell-free system is expected to facilitate studies on the biochemical pathway of NER in S. cerevisiae...|$|R
40|$|Okazaki {{fragment}} maturation {{to produce}} continuous lagging strands in eukaryotic cells requires precise coordination of strand displacement synthesis by DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) with 5 ·-flap cutting by FEN <b>1</b> <b>RAD</b> 27 endonuclease. Excessive strand displacement is normally prevented by the 3 ·-exonuclease activity of Pol δ. This core maturation machinery can be assisted by Dna 2 nuclease/helicase that processes long flaps. Our genetic {{studies show that}} deletion of the POL 32 (third subunit of Pol δ) or PIF 1 helicase genes can suppress lethality or growth defects of rad 27 Δ pol 3 -D 520 V mutants (defective for FEN <b>1</b> <b>RAD</b> 27 and the 3 ·-exonuclease of Pol δ) that produce long flaps and of dna 2 Δ mutants that are defective in cutting long flaps. On the contrary, pol 32 Δ or pif 1 Δ caused lethality of rad 27 Δ exo 1 Δ double mutants, suggesting that Pol 32 and Pif 1 are required to generate longer flaps that can be processed by Dna 2 {{in the absence of}} the short flap processing activities of FEN <b>1</b> <b>RAD</b> 27 and Exo 1. The genetic analysis reveals a remarkable flexibility of the Okazaki maturation machinery and is in accord with our biochemical analysis. In vitro, the generation of short flaps by Pol δ is not affected by the presence of Pol 32; however, longer flaps only accumulate when Pol 32 is present. The presence of FEN <b>1</b> <b>RAD</b> 27 during strand displacement synthesis curtails displacement in favor of flap cutting, thus suggesting an active hand-off mechanism from Pol δ to FEN <b>1</b> <b>RAD</b> 27. Finally, RNA-DNA hybrids are more readily displaced by Pol δ than DNA hybrids, thereby favoring degradation of initiator RNA during Okazaki maturation...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have {{revealed}} RAD 51 -independent recombination events. These include spontaneous and double-strand break-induced recombination between repeated sequences, and capture of a chromosome arm by break-induced replication. Although recombination between inverted repeats {{is considered to be}} a conservative intramolecular event, the lack of requirement for RAD 51 suggests that repair can also occur by a nonconservative mechanism. We propose a model for RAD 51 -independent recombination by one-ended strand invasion coupled to DNA synthesis, followed by single-strand annealing. The <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> /Rad 10 endonuclease is required to trim intermediates formed during single-strand annealing and thus was expected to be required for RAD 51 -independent events by this model. Double-strand break repair between plasmid-borne inverted repeats was less efficient in <b>rad</b> <b>1</b> <b>rad</b> 51 double mutants than in <b>rad</b> <b>1</b> and <b>rad</b> 51 strains. In addition, repair events were delayed and frequently associated with plasmid loss. Furthermore, the repair products recovered from the <b>rad</b> <b>1</b> <b>rad</b> 51 strain were primarily in the crossover configuration, inconsistent with conservative models for mitotic double-strand break repair...|$|R

Further {{analysis of the data}} suggests that CS 1 only changed his confidence score in 7 % of cases for the PPMI data after viewing CADx results, as compared to 21 and 22 % for <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> and <b>Rad</b> 2 respectively. A similar but less marked trend was seen in the local data, where CS 1 changed his score in 6 % of cases as compared to 9 and 23 % for <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> and <b>Rad</b> 2 respectively. This is consistent with the radiologists relying more heavily on the CADx decision than the clinical scientist, particularly for the unfamiliar PPMI data.|$|R
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{mutations}} in APN 1, APN 2 and either <b>RAD</b> <b>1</b> or <b>RAD</b> 10 genes are synthetic lethal. In fact, apn <b>1</b> apn 2 <b>rad</b> <b>1</b> triple mutants can form microcolonies of ∼ 300 cells. Expression of Nfo, the bacterial homologue of Apn 1, suppresses the lethality. Turning off {{the expression of}} Nfo induces G 2 /M cell cycle arrest in an apn <b>1</b> apn 2 <b>rad</b> <b>1</b> triple mutant. The activation of this checkpoint is RAD 9 dependent and allows residual DNA repair. The Mus 81 /Mms 4 complex was identified as one of these back-up repair activities. Furthermore, inactivation of Ntg 1, Ntg 2 and Ogg 1 DNA N-glycosylase/AP lyases in the apn <b>1</b> apn 2 <b>rad</b> <b>1</b> background delayed lethality, allowing the formation of minicolonies of ∼ 105 cells. These results demonstrate that, under physiological conditions, endogenous DNA damage causes death in cells deficient in Apn 1, Apn 2 and <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> /Rad 10 proteins. We propose a model in which endogenous DNA abasic sites are converted into 3 ′-blocked single-strand breaks (SSBs) by DNA N-glycosylases/AP lyases. Therefore, we suggest that the essential and overlapping function of Apn <b>1,</b> Apn 2, <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> /Rad 10 and Mus 81 /Mms 4 is to repair 3 ′-blocked SSBs using their 3 ′-phosphodiesterase activity or their 3 ′-flap endonuclease activity, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The <b>RAD</b> <b>1</b> and <b>RAD</b> 10 {{genes of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae are {{required}} for nucleotide excision repair and they also act in mitotic recombination. The <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> -Rad 10 complex has a single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity. Here, we show that the mismatch repair genes MSH 2 and MSH 3 function in mitotic recombination. For both his 3 and his 4 duplications, and for homologous integration of a linear DNA fragment into the genome, the msh 3 Δ mutation {{has an effect on}} recombination {{similar to that of the}} <b>rad</b> <b>1</b> Δ and <b>rad</b> 10 Δ mutations. The msh 2 Δ mutation also reduces the rate of recombination of the his 3 duplication and lowers the incidence of homologous integration of a linear DNA fragment. Epistasis analyses indicate that MSH 2 and MSH 3 function in the <b>RAD</b> <b>1</b> -RAD 10 recombination pathway, and studies presented here suggest an involvement of the <b>RAD</b> <b>1</b> -RAD 10 pathway in reciprocal recombination. The possible roles of Msh 2, Msh 3, <b>Rad</b> <b>1,</b> and <b>Rad</b> 10 proteins in genetic recombination are discussed. Coupling of mismatch binding proteins with the recombinational machinery could be important for ensuring genetic fidelity in the recombination process...|$|R

This resulted in the expression of 3950, 1900, 1870, 1620, 1320 and 1420 fmol ada-encoded ATase/mg protein respectively: transformation with the parent vectors resulted in ATase activities of 3 - 17 fmol/mg protein. The wild-types, <b>rad</b> <b>1</b> - <b>1</b> and <b>rad</b> 6 - <b>1</b> yeast expressing the bacterial ATase showed increased resistance to the toxic and mutagenic effects of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N- nitrosoguanidine (MNNG).

These results suggest that whilst a portion of the toxic and mutagenic lesions induced by MNNG can be repaired in yeast by the E. coli Ada protein in a <b>RAD</b> <b>1</b> - and <b>RAD</b> 6 -independent manner, the RAD 52 gene product may be essential for the complete functioning of the Ada ATase.

40|$|Telomeres, {{the ends}} of linear chromosomes, are DNA double-strand ends that do not trigger a cell cycle arrest and yet require {{checkpoint}} and DNA repair proteins for maintenance. Genetic and biochemical studies in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe were undertaken to understand how checkpoint and DNA repair proteins contribute to telomere maintenance. On the basis of telomere lengths of mutant combinations of various checkpoint-related proteins (<b>Rad</b> <b>1,</b> <b>Rad</b> 3, Rad 9, Rad 17, <b>Rad</b> 26, Hus <b>1,</b> Crb 2, Chk 1, Cds 1), Tel 1, a telomere-binding protein (Taz 1), and DNA repair proteins (Ku 70, Rad 32), we conclude that Rad 3 /Rad 26 and Tel 1 /Rad 32 represent two pathways required to maintain telomeres and prevent chromosome circularization. <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> /Rad 9 /Hus 1 /Rad 17 and Ku 70 are two additional epistasis groups, which act in the Rad 3 /Rad 26 pathway. However, Rad 3 /Rad 26 must have additional target(s), as cells lacking Tel <b>1</b> /Rad 32, <b>Rad</b> <b>1</b> /Rad 9 /Hus 1 /Rad 17, and Ku 70 groups did not circularize chromosomes. Cells lacking Rad 3 /Rad 26 and Tel 1 /Rad 32 senesced faster than a telomerase trt 1 Delta mutant, suggesting that these pathways may contribute to telomere protection. Deletion of taz 1 did not suppress chromosome circularization in cells lacking Rad 3 /Rad 26 and Tel 1 /Rad 32, also suggesting that two pathways protect telomeres. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses found that <b>Rad</b> 3, <b>Rad</b> <b>1,</b> <b>Rad</b> 9, Hus <b>1,</b> <b>Rad</b> 17, Rad 32, and Ku 70 associate with telomeres. Thus, checkpoint sensor and DNA repair proteins contribute to telomere maintenance and protection through their association with telomeres...|$|R
