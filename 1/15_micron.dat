40|$|The force-velocity {{relation}} of single frog fibers was measured at sarcomere lengths of 2. 15, 2. 65, and 3. <b>15</b> <b>microns.</b> Sarcomere length was obtained on-line {{with a system}} that measures the distance between two markers attached {{to the surface of}} the fiber, approximately 800 microns apart. Maximal shortening velocity, determined by extrapolating the Hill equation, was similar at the three sarcomere lengths: 6. 5, 6. 0, and 5. 7 microns/s at sarcomere lengths of 2. 15, 2. 65, and 3. <b>15</b> <b>microns,</b> respectively. For loads not close to zero the shortening velocity decreased with increasing sarcomere length. This was the case when force was expressed as a percentage of the maximal force at optimal fiber length or as a percentage of the sarcomere-isometric force at the respective sarcomere lengths. The force-velocity relation was discontinuous around zero velocity: load clamps above the level that kept sarcomeres isometric resulted in stretch that was much slower than when the load was decreased below isometric by a similar amount. We fitted the force-velocity relation for slow shortening (less than 600 nm/s) and for slow stretch (less than 200 nm/s) with linear regression lines. At a sarcomere length of 2. <b>15</b> <b>microns</b> the slopes of these lines was 8. 6 times higher for shortening than for stretch.

Our optical data shows that the optical colour distribution of galaxies starts to dramatically change from blue to red at the medium-density environment such as cluster outskirts, groups and filaments. By combining with infrared data, we find that <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> galaxies tend to have optical colours between the red sequence and the blue cloud with a tail into the red sequence. The spatial distribution of the <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> galaxies over ~ 200 arcmin^ 2 around the cluster reveals that few <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> galaxies are detected in the cluster central region. This is probably due to the low star forming activity in the cluster core. However, interestingly, the fraction of <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> galaxies in the medium-density environments is as high as in the low-density field, {{despite the fact that the}} optical colours start to change in the medium-density environments. Furthermore, we find that <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> galaxies which have optically red colours (candidates for dusty red galaxies) and galaxies with high specific star formation rates are also concentrated in the medium-density environment. These results imply that the star forming activity in galaxies in groups and filaments is enhanced due to some environmental effects specific to the medium-density environment, and such a phenomenon is probably directly connected to the truncation of star forming activity in galaxies seen as the dramatic change in optical colours in such environments.

Our sample of 21 high-redshift sources is {{selected from the}} Preliminary Analysis catalogue in the S 1 field of the European Large Area ISO Survey (ELAIS). To study the cosmological evolution of the AGN 1 luminosity function, our sample has been combined with a local sample of 41 sources observed by IRAS. We find that the luminosity function of AGN 1 at <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> is fairly well represented by a double-power-law-function.

Use of temperature sounding channels in the <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> CO 2 band has considerable heritage in infra-red remote sensing. Channels in the 4. 2 micron CO 2 band have potential advantages for temperature sounding purposes because they are essentially insensitive to absorption by water vapor and ozone, and also have considerably sharper lower tropospheric temperature sounding weighting functions than do the <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> temperature sounding channels. Potential drawbacks with regard to use of 4. 2 micron channels arise from effects on the observed radiances of solar radiation reflected by the surface and clouds, as well as effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium on shortwave observations during the day.

This increase in blood flow was larger early (16 h) than late (144 h) following antigen administration (P less than 0. 01).

These spectra reveal a plethora of emission features with bands at 11. 0, 11. 2, 12. 0, 12. 7, 13. 5 and 14. 2 micron. These features are observed to vary considerably in relative strength to each-other from source to source. In particular, the 10 - <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> spectra of the evolved stars are dominated by the 11. 2 micron band while for H II regions the 12. 7 is typically {{as strong as the}} 11. 2 micron band. Analysing the ISO data we find a good correlation between the 11. 2 micron band and the 3. 3 micron band, and between the 12. 7 micron and the 6. 2 micron band. There is also a correlation between the ratio of the UIR bands to the total dust emission and the 12. 7 over 11. 2 micron ratio. Bands in the 10 - <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> spectral region are due to CH out-of-plane (OOP) bending modes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We summarise existing laboratory data and theoretical quantum chemical calculations of these modes for neutral and cationic PAHs. Due to mode coupling, the exact peak position of these bands depends on the number of adjacent CH groups and hence the observed interstellar 10 - <b>15</b> <b>micron</b> spectra can be used to determine the molecular structure of the interstellar PAHs emitting in the different regions.
