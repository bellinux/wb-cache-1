With 1 cm. contacts of tap water, and 1 cm. between contacts the resistances of living cells are usually between 1, 000, 000 and 2, 000, 000 ohms. They go as high as 3, 500, 000 ohms when the cells are in the best condition. The resistance falls to about 50, 000 ohms immediately after killing. Leakage around the cell is small because the wall is imbibed with tap water.

40|$|Split-ring antennas {{made from}} {{optically}} transparent, electrically conductive films have been invented for applications {{in which there}} are requirements for compact antennas capable of operation over much or all of the frequency band from 1 to 10 GHz. Primary examples of such applications include wireless local-area networks and industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) applications. These antennas can be conveniently located on such surfaces as those of automobile windows and display screens of diverse hand-held electronic units. They are fabricated by conventional printed-circuit techniques and can easily be integrated with solid-state amplifier circuits to enhance gain. The structure of an antenna of this type includes an antenna/feed layer supported on the top or outer face of a dielectric (e. g., glass) and, optionally, a ground layer on the bottom or inner face of the substrate. The ring can be in the form of either a conductive strip or a slot in the antenna/feed layer. The ring can be of rectangular, square, circular, elliptical, or other suitable shape and can be excited by means of a microstrip, slot line, or coplanar waveguide. For example, the antenna shown in the figure features a square conductive-strip split ring with a microstrip feed. In general, an antenna fed at its external boundary in the manner of this invention presents very high impedance, thereby creating an impedance-matching problem. Splitting the ring. that is, cutting a notch through the ring. offers {{a solution to the problem}} in that the notch fixes the location of maximum electric field, which location is directly related to the impedance. Thus, an excellent impedance match can be achieved through proper choice of the location of the notch. In geometric layout, such a ring antenna structure is typically between 1. 4 and 1. 3 the size of a patch antenna capable of operating in the same frequency range. This miniaturization of the antenna is desirable, not only because it contributes to overall miniaturization of equipment, but also because minimization of the extent of the optically transparent, electrically conductive film helps to minimize the electrical loss associated with the surface resistance (5 <b>ohms</b> <b>per</b> <b>square)</b> of the transparent, electrically conductive film material.

A common substance used in transparent conductive coatings is indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is not very optically transparent, however.

When only CNT mass is considered, a specific capacitance of 200 F/g, a specific energy of 30 - 47 Watt-hour/kilogram (Wh/kg), a specific power of 200, 000 W/kg, and a stable cycling life over 40, 000 cycles are achieved. These values are much better than those of devices on other flat substrates, such as plastics. Even in {{a case in which}} the weight of all of the dead components is considered, a specific energy of 7. 5 Wh/kg is achieved. In addition, this conductive paper can be used as an excellent lightweight current collector in lithium-ion batteries to replace the existing metallic counterparts. This work suggests that our conductive paper can be a highly scalable and low-cost solution for high-performance energy storage devices...|$|R
40|$|Various {{theoretical}} {{models for the}} response of capacitive and resistive thin-film humidity sensors were proposed, relating device geometry, properties of the moisture sensitive material and ambient humidity to sensor impedance. However {{not all of the}} involved processes are well understood and more efforts are needed to validate and improve {{theoretical models}}. In the case of surface-type capacitive humidity sensors the influence of the moisture-dependent sheet resistance of sensitive materials is known and a model based on distributed RC transmission lines has been proposed. In order to show the influence of surface conductivity on sensor response, typical interdigitated electrode structures (width/distance: 10 mym/ 10 mym and 20 mym/ 20 mym resp.; area: 4940 mym x 6300 mym) were fabricated on oxidized silicon wafers and covered with a 200 nm thick, reactively sputtered fabricated on oxidized silicon wafers and covered with a 200 nm thick, reactively sputtered dense Al 2 O 3 film as dielectr ic layer. These devices are inherently humidity insensitive with a change in capacitance between 10 % r. H. and 95 % r. H. of 0. 6 % C(10 % r. H.) at 40 degrees C suggesting a surface resistance exceeding 10 E 12 <b>ohm</b> <b>per</b> <b>square.</b> Subsequently these devices were conered with thin sputtered Au-Layers to increase surface conductivity in a controlled manner. The thickness was in the range between 2. 5 nm and 6. 0 nm as interpolated from deposition rate. (IFT...|$|R
40|$|The Packaging Research Center {{has been}} {{developing}} next generation system-on-a-package (SOP) technology with digital, RF, optical, and sensor functions integrated in a single package/module. The goal of this effort {{is to develop a}} platform substrate technology providing very high wiring density and embedded thin film passive and active components using PWB compatible materials and processes. The latest SOP baseline process test vehicle has been fabricated on novel Si-matched CTE, high modulus C-SiC composite core substrates using 10 mum thick BCB dielectric films with loss tangent of 0. 0008 and dielectric constant of 2. 65. A semi-additive plating process has been developed for multilayer microvia build-up using BCB without the use of any vacuum deposition or polishing/CMP processes. PWB and package substrate compatible processes such as plasma surface treatment/desmear and electroless/electrolytic pulse reverse plating was used. The smallest line width and space demonstrated in this paper is 6 mum with microvia diameters in the 15 - 30 mum range. This build-up process has also been developed on medium CTE organic laminates including MCL-E- 679 F from Hitachi Chemical and PTFE laminates with Cu-Invar-Cu core. Embedded decoupling capacitors with capacitance density of > 500 nF/cm 2 have been integrated into the build-up layers using sol-gel synthesized BaTiO 3 thin films (200 - 300 nm film thickness) deposited on copper foils and integrated using vacuum lamination and subtractive etch processes. Thin metal alloy resistor films have been integrated into the SOP substrate using two methods: (a) NiCrAlSi thin films (25 <b>ohms</b> <b>per</b> <b>square)</b> deposited on copper foils (Gould Electronics) laminated on the build-up layers and two step etch process for resistor definition, and (b) electroless plated Ni-W-P thin films (70 ohms to few Kohms <b>per</b> <b>square)</b> on the BCB dielectric by plasma surface treatment and activation. The electrical design and build-up layer structure along- - with key materials and processes used in the fabrication of the SOP 4 test vehicle were presented in this paper. Initial results from the high density wiring and embedded thin film components were also presented. The focus of this paper is on integration of materials, processes and structures in a single package substrate for system-on-a-package (SOP) implementatio...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} investigating {{the synthesis of}} graphene and its hybrid nanostructures by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, {{as well as their}} applications in nanoelectronics and energy conversion/storage. The substantial understanding of interaction of graphene layers between the bio-molecules and gas molecules will enable the improvement in the applications of graphene in bio-sensor and chemical sensor. To achieve these objectives, graphene field effect transistors are fabricated to study the interactions of graphene between single stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acids (ssDNA) and gas molecules. ssDNA is found to act as negative potential gating agent that increases the hole density in single layer graphene (SLG). The molecular photodesorption and absorption from pristine and functionalized graphene are studied. The photodesorption induced current decrease in functionalized graphene by concentrated HNO 3 becomes less significant than pristine graphene layers. We suggest {{this is due to the}} passivation of oxygen-bearing functionalities to CVD grown graphene structure defects via HNO 3 functionalization, which prevents the further absorption of gas molecules. The advance of synthesis of graphene and its hybrid nanostructures by CVD promotes their applications in the industrial level. We synthesize the graphene both on nickel thin film and copper foils by CVD, and investigate the grow kinetics, such as the effect of growth pressure on the uniformity and quality of Cu-grown graphene. By controlling the growth pressure we achieve uniform single layer graphene sheets and suggest the feasible methods of synthesizing uniform few-layer graphene. To decrease the sheet resistance, we stack the single layer graphene using layer-layer transfer technique. Highly concentrated HNO 3 is employed to improve the conductivity and surface wettability of graphene layers. Four-layer graphene films with optical transmittance of 90 % after HNO 3 treatment are applied in organic solar cell as anode. Further, we report the fabrication of highly conductive, large surface-area 3 D pillar graphene nanostructures (PGN) films from assembly of vertically aligned CNT pillars on flexible copper foils and directly employed for the application in electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC). The PGN films with MWCNTs on graphene layers, which were one-step synthesized on flexible copper foil (25 um) by CVD process, exhibit high conductivity with sheet resistance as low as 1. 6 <b>Ohm</b> <b>per</b> <b>square</b> and high mechanical flexibility. The fabricated EDLC supercapacitor based on high surface-area PGN electrodes (563 m 2 /g) showed high performance with high specific capacitance of 330 F/g. We demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of three dimensional heterostructures graphene hybrid nanostructures (HGN) comprising continuous large area graphene layers and ZnO nanostructures, fabricated via two-step CVD process. The material characterizations exhibit the highly crystalline ZnO nanostructures synthesized on few-layer graphene film. Ultraviolet spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy indicate that the CVD grown HGN layers has excellent optical properties. The electrical study on the graphene/ZnO/graphene devices suggests that graphene readily form Ohmic contact to ZnO, although rarely Shockley may exist. The electron transport properties highly depend on the temperature. Devices show photoconductive effect under UV illumination. A combination of electrical and optical properties of graphene and ZnO building blocks in ZnO based HGN provides unique characteristics for opportunities in future optoelectronic devices...|$|R
