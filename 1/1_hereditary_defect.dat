40|$|The health {{problems}} of pedigree dogs are {{mainly caused by}} selective breeding of dogs for human needs and aesthetics. Selective breeding can cause an increase of harmful breed characteristics and <b>hereditary</b> <b>defects.</b> This may harm {{the well-being of the}} animals. This study contributes to the project ‘Rashondengids’ of the LICG (Landelijk Informatie Centrum Gezelschapsdieren, Dutch independent foundation which provides information about companion animals), started in 2014. The aim of this project is to develop a pedigree dog guide. The purpose of this guide is to inform future dog owners in an accessible and scientific way about the different dog breeds and its harmful breed characteristics and <b>hereditary</b> <b>defects.</b> The information refers to the Dutch population of dogs. For this purpose, qualitative data were collected by performing a literature study and by researching the clinical database of the UKG (Universiteitskliniek voor Gezelschapsdieren, University clinic of companion animals). In another following study, quantitative data will be collected also. These results will be combined to provide the (future) dog owner a complete and reliable overview of the diseases occurring in different dog breeds. This study has its focus on four dog breeds: Border Collie, Bouvier des Flandres, Dachshund, and Schapendoes. The research question of this study is the following: “To what extent occur harmful breed characteristics and <b>hereditary</b> <b>defects</b> in the populations of the Border Collie, Bouvier des Flandres, Dachshund and Schapendoes in the Netherlands?” The most important disorders in the Border Collie are: idiopathic epilepsy and ivermectin sensitivity due to MDR 1 gene defect. Skin diseases might be of importance in the Dutch population of Border Collies. The most important disorders in the Bouvier des Flandres are: dysphagia-associated muscular dystrophy, glaucoma and subluxation of the radial head. The most important disorders in the Dachshund are: mitral valve prolapse, myoclonic epilepsy (Lafora disease), cataract, achondroplasia/chondrodysplasia and canine intervertebral disk disease. Oncologic and otolaryngologic diseases might be of importance for the Dutch population of Dachshunds. The most important disorder in the Schapendoes is: progressive retina atrophy.
