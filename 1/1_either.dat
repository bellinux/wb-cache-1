5|$|In {{the first}} trial, 38 Dutch-speaking local {{elementary}} school girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant {{preference for the}} letters of one's own name over {{those of the other}} person was found. The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: <b>1)</b> <b>either</b> pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last. All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out. No significant difference was found using family name rather than first name or both names. While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent data analysis revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.|$|E

[...] Thereafter he plays the winning second player strategy assumed above. If in playing this strategy, he is required to play on the cell where an arbitrary move was made, he makes another arbitrary move. [...] In this way he plays the winning strategy with one extra piece always on the board.4. This extra piece cannot interfere with the first player's imitation of the winning strategy, for an extra piece is always an asset and never a handicap. [...] Therefore the first player can win.5. Because we have now contradicted our assumption that there is a winning strategy for the second player, we are forced to drop this assumption.6. Consequently, there must be a winning strategy for the first player.|$|E

60|$|Philological mythologists {{prefer to}} believe that the {{forgotten}} meaning of words produced the results; that the wolf-born Apollo ([Greek]) originally meant 'Light-born Apollo,' {82b} and that the wolf came in from a confusion between [Greek], 'Light,' and [Greek], a wolf. I make no doubt that philologists can explain Sminthian Apollo, the Dog-Apollo, and all the rest in the same way, and account for all the other peculiarities of place-names, myths, works of art, local badges, and so forth. We must then, I suppose, infer that these six traits of the mouse, already enumerated, tally with the traces which actual totemism would or might leave surviving behind it, or which propitiation of mice might leave behind it, by a chance coincidence, determined by forgotten meanings of words. The Greek analogy to totemistic facts would be explained, (<b>1)</b> <b>either</b> by asking for a definition of totemism, and not listening when it is given; or (2) by maintaining that savage totemism is also a result of a world-wide malady of language, which, in a hundred tongues, produced the same confusions of thought, and consequently the same practices and institutions. Nor do I for one moment doubt that the ingenuity of philologists could prove the name of every beast and plant, in every language under heaven, to be a name for the 'inevitable dawn' (Max Muller), or for the inevitable thunder, or storm, or lightning (Kuhn- Schwartz). But as names appear to yield storm, lightning, night, or dawn with equal ease and certainty, according as the scholar prefers dawn or storm, I confess that this demonstration would leave me sceptical. It lacks scientific exactitude.|$|E
6000|$|II. The {{change in}} the {{relative}} values of gold and silver finally [...] forced the United States to change their mint ratio in 1834. Two [...] courses were open to us: (<b>1)</b> <b>either</b> to increase the quantity of [...] silver in the dollar until the dollar of silver was intrinsically [...] worth the gold in the gold dollar; or (2) debase the gold [...] dollar-piece until it was reduced in value proportionate to the [...] depreciation of silver since 1792. The latter expedient, without [...] any seeming regard to the effect on contracts {{and the integrity of}} [...] our monetary standard, was adopted: 6.589 per cent was taken out [...] of the gold dollar, leaving it containing 23.22 grains of pure [...] gold; and as the silver dollar remained unchanged (371-¼ grains) [...] the mint ratio established was 1 to 15.988, or, as commonly [...] stated, 1 to 16. Did this correspond with the market ratio then [...] existing? No. Having seen the former steady fall in silver, and [...] believing that it would continue, Congress hoped to anticipate any [...] further fall by making the mint ratio of gold to silver a little [...] larger than the market ratio. This was done by establishing the [...] mint ratio of 1 to 15.988, while the market ratio in 1834 was 1 to [...] 15.73. Here, again, appeared the difficulty arising from the [...] attempt to balance a ratio on a movable fulcrum. It will be seen [...] that the act of 1834 set at work forces for another {{change in the}} [...] coinage—forces of a similar kind, but working in exactly the [...] opposite direction to those previous to 1834. A dollar of gold [...] coin would now exchange for more grains of silver at the mint [...] (15.98) than it would in the form of bullion in the market [...] (15.73). Therefore it would be more profitable to put gold into [...] coin than exchange it as bullion. Gold was sent to the mint, while [...] silver began to be withdrawn from circulation, silver now being [...] more valuable as bullion than as coin. By 1840 a silver dollar was [...] worth 102 cents in gold.(238) This movement, which was displacing [...] silver with gold, received a surprising and unexpected impetus by [...] the gold discoveries of California and Australia in 1849, before [...] mentioned, and made gold less valuable relatively to silver, by [...] lowering the value of gold. Here, again, was another natural [...] cause, independent of legislation, and not to be foreseen, [...] altering the value of one of the precious metals, and in exactly [...] the opposite direction from that in the previous period, when [...] silver was lowered by the increase from the Mexican mines. In 1853 [...] a silver dollar was worth 104 cents in gold (i.e., of a gold [...] dollar containing 23.22 grains); but, some years before, all [...] silver dollars had disappeared from use, and only gold was in [...] circulation. For a large part of this period we had in reality a [...] single standard of gold, the other metal not being able to stay in [...] the currency.|$|E
