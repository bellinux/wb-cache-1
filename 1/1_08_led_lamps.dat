40|$|Trends in the {{development}} of different types of light sources and their energy characteristics have been described in the paper. Analysis of regulatory documents has been given. The results of experimental studies of a number of modern <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> have been described. Investigation has been made for a number of <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> produced by Philips, Xavax and Melitec. The experimental data have been obtained with the complex of devices: the dual-channel oscilloscope (GDS- 71042), the power quality analyzer (Fluke- 434) and the multi-function device EcoLight- 01 (light-, pulse- and luminance meter). It has been shown that operation of <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> is characterized by emission of higher current harmonics and reactive power consumption, which depends on the type and design of the lamp driver. It has been found that the value of luminance created by <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> in case of acceptable (for ships) prolonged deviation of voltage (– 10 %) is reduced by 3 %; in case of permissible short-term voltage deviation (– 20 %) luminance is reduced by 7 %. For incandescent lamps this indicator is characterized by a decrease in luminance by 40 % and 60 %, respectively. Despite the low sensitivity to voltage changes (in comparison with other types of lamps), the operation of <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> is also associated with the appearance of flicker. Absence of limitations for fluctuations of the light flux in shipboard lighting systems and imperfection of methods for determining the flicker make it difficult to ensure electromagnetic compatibility of <b>LED</b> <b>lamps.</b> Therefore due to reliability, environmental friendliness, energy efficiency and lumen maintenance <b>LED</b> <b>lamps</b> have prospects for introduction into shipboard lighting systems.
