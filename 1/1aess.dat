5000|$|Most of the {{thousands}} of 1ESS and <b>1AESS</b> offices in the USA were replaced in the 1990s by DMS-100, 5ESS Switch and other digital switches, and since 2010 also by packet switches. As of late 2014, just over 20 <b>1AESS</b> installations remained in the North American network, which were located mostly in AT&T's legacy BellSouth and AT&T's legacy Southwestern Bell states, especially in the Atlanta GA metro area, the Saint Louis MO metro area, and in the Dallas/Fort Worth TX metro area. In 2015, AT&T did not renew a support contract with Alcatel-Lucent (now Nokia) for the <b>1AESS</b> systems still in operation and notified Alcatel-Lucent of its intent to remove them all from service by 2017. As a result, Alcatel-Lucent dismantled the last <b>1AESS</b> lab at the Naperville Bell Labs location in 2015, and announced the discontinuation of support for the <b>1AESS.</b> [...] In 2017, AT&T completed the removal of remaining <b>1AESS</b> systems by moving customers to other newer technology switches, typically with Genband switches with TDM trunking only.|$|E

50|$|The {{last known}} <b>1AESS</b> switch was in Odessa, TX (Odessa Lincoln Federal wirecenter ODSSTXLI). It was {{disconnected}} from service around June 3, 2017 and cut {{over to a}} Genband G5/G6 packet switch.|$|E
50|$|The <b>1AESS</b> tape drives had {{approximately}} {{four times}} {{the density of the}} original ones in 1ESS, and were used for some of the same purposes as in other mainframe computers, including program updates and loading special programs.|$|E
50|$|The common-network {{interface}} ring (CNI ring) provides common-channel signaling (CCS) functionality {{on several}} Alcatel-Lucent SS7 products. It {{was introduced by}} Western Electric in the early 1980s but is still used today in all <b>1AESS</b> and 4ESS, offices, {{and most of the}} wireline 5ESS offices.|$|E
50|$|The <b>1AESS</b> {{central office}} switch {{incorporated}} higher processing capacities based on the 1A Processor in 1976. It was a plug compatible upgrade with a faster processor that incorporated the existing instruction set for programming compatibility, and used smaller remreed switches, fewer relays, and featured disk storage.|$|E
50|$|The Match product {{provided}} automated {{systems for}} telephone companies in Operations, administration and management (OA&M) to migrate telephone services delivered by existings analogue AT&T <b>1AESS</b> switches to newer digital switches, such as Northern Telecom's DMS-100 or AT&T's 5ESS switches. The MATCH {{was composed of}} three main system components: Decoding, Matching, and Provisioning. The Decoding module would decode core memory dumps from the AT&T <b>1AESS,</b> 5AESS, Nortel DMS-100, and operating databases including COSMOS and TIRKS. Network inventory, services, and related constructs would be stored in a proprietary MATCH universal database management system, which was configurable based on job and customer preferences. The Matching module would compare two populated databases, being a source and target, and compute the functional transform required to bring the target system {{in line with the}} source. The Provisioning model examined the transform function and generated the necessary AT&T 5AESS recent change messages and DMS-100 service updates to reproduce telephony services provided by the old switch on the new switching platform.|$|E
50|$|The <b>1AESS</b> version CC (Central Control) had {{a faster}} clock, {{approximately}} one MHz, and required only one bay of space instead of four. The majority of circuit boards were manufactured from metal for better heat dissipation, and carried TTL SSI chips, usually attached by hybrid packaging. Each {{finger at the}} back of the board was not a mere trace on the circuit board, as usual in plug-in boards, but a leaf spring, for greater reliability.|$|E
50|$|The {{processor}} {{acts as the}} CPU for the switch. The processor {{includes a}} central control, call stores, and program stores.In addition it had access to additional units through the auxiliary unit bus (AUB) and peripheral unit bus (PUB). A master control console (MCC) provides office technicians access to the switch through the processor peripheral interface (PPI).Early versions used the same 1A processor as the contemporaneous improved <b>1AESS</b> switch. All existing switches have been subsequently upgraded to use the 1B processor.|$|E
50|$|Line ferrods {{were also}} {{provided}} in pairs, {{of which the}} even numbered one had contacts brought out {{to the front of}} the package in lugs suitable for wire wrap so the windings could be strapped for loop start or ground start signaling. The original 1ESS packaging had all the ferrods of an LSF together, and separate from the line switches, while the later <b>1AESS</b> had each ferrod at the front of the steel box containing its line switch. Odd numbered line equipment could not be made ground start, their ferrods being inaccessible.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the later}} <b>1AESS,</b> the reeds {{themselves}} were of remanent magnetic material. This [...] "Remreed" [...] design allowed further reduction {{in size and}} power consumption. A [...] "grid" [...] of 1024 2-wire crosspoints, arranged as two stages of eight 8x8 switches, was permanently packaged in a box. Despite the sealed contacts, plating with silver rather than with precious metals resulted in reed arrays being less reliable than crossbar switches. When one crosspoint failed, the grid box was quickly replaced whole, and either repaired at a local workbench or shipped to a repair shop.|$|E
50|$|The 5ESS came {{to market}} as the Western Electric No. 5 ESS. It first {{commenced}} service in Seneca, Illinois on 25 March 1982, and {{was destined to}} replace the Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS and <b>1AESS)</b> and other electromechanical systems in the 1980s and 1990s. The 5ESS was also used as a Class 4 telephone switch or as a hybrid Class 4/Class 5 switch in markets {{too small for the}} 4ESS. Approximately half of all US central offices are served by 5ESS switches. The 5ESS is also exported internationally, and manufactured outside the US under license.|$|E
50|$|Programs {{were mostly}} written in machine code. Bugs that {{previously}} went unnoticed became prominent when 1ESS {{was brought to}} big cities with heavy telephone traffic, and delayed the full adoption of the system for a few years. Temporary fixes included the Service Link Network (SLN), which did approximately {{the job of the}} Incoming Register Link and Ringing Selection Switch of the 5XB switch, thus diminishing CPU load and decreasing response times for incoming calls, and a Signal Processor (SP) or peripheral computer of only one bay, to handle simple but time consuming tasks such as the timing and counting of Dial Pulses. <b>1AESS</b> eliminated the need for SLN and SP.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>1AESS</b> used memory with 26-bit words, {{of which}} two were for parity checking. The initial version had 32 Kilowords of core mats. Later {{versions}} used semiconductor memory. Program stores were arranged to feed two words (52 bits) {{at a time}} to the CPU via the Program Store Bus, while Call Stores only gave one word at a time via the Call Store Bus. 1A Program Stores were writable and not fully duplicated but were backed up by the File Stores. They were provided in multiplicity of N+2, i.e. as many as were needed for the size of the office, plus two hot standby units to be loaded from disk as needed.|$|E
50|$|The {{computer}} controlled the magnetic latching relays by Signal Distributors (SD) packaged in the Universal Trunk frames, Junctor frames, or in Miscellaneous Trunk frames, {{according to which}} they were numbered as USD, JSD or MSD. SD were originally contact trees of 30-contact wire spring relays, each driven by a flipflop. Each magnetic latching relay had one transfer contact dedicated to sending a pulse back to the SD, on each operate and release. The pulser in the SD detected this pulse to determine that the action had occurred, or else alerted the maintenance software to print a FSCAN report. In later <b>1AESS</b> versions SD were solid state with several SD points per circuit pack generally on the same shelf or adjacent shelf to the trunk pack.|$|E
50|$|The {{much smaller}} Remreed crosspoints, {{introduced}} {{at about the}} same time as <b>1AESS,</b> were packaged as grid boxes of four principal types. Type 10A Junctor Grids and 11A Trunk Grids were a box about 16x16x5 inches (40x40x12 cm) with sixteen 8x8 switches inside. Type 12A Line Grids with 2:1 LCR were only about 5 inches (12 cm) wide, with eight 4x4 Stage 0 line switches with ferrods and cutoff contacts for 32 lines, connected internally to four 4x8 Stage 1 switches connecting to B-links. Type 14A Line Grids with 4:1 LCR were about 16x12x5 inches (40x30x12 cm) with 64 lines, 32 A-links and 16 B-links. The boxes were connected to the rest of the fabric and control circuitry by slide-in connectors. Thus the worker had to handle a much bigger, heavier piece of equipment, but didn't have to unwrap and rewrap dozens of wires.|$|E
50|$|Supervision and trunk {{signalling}} {{were the}} responsibility of trunk circuits. The most common kinds (reverse battery one-way trunks) were in plug-in trunk packs, two trunks per pack, 128 packs per Trunk Frame (originally) on 16 shelves. Each trunk pack was originally about 3x5x8 inches (8x12x20 cm) with edge connector in the back. The later <b>1AESS</b> were made with shorter wire spring relays, making them less than half as wide, with more complex leaf spring connector. Trunk Frames were in pairs, the even numbered one having the Signal Distributor to control the relays in both. Most trunks had three wire spring relays and two scan points. They could supply regular battery or reverse battery to a line, and on-hook or off-hook supervision to the distant end, or be put into a bypass state allowing all functions (usually sending and receiving address signals) to be performed by common control circuits such as digit transmitters and receivers. Slightly more complex trunks, for example those going to TSPS offices for operator control, were packaged as only one per plugin unit.|$|E
