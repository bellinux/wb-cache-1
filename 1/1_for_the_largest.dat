The results are compared with predictions from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, both with and without dispersion corrections obtained from the exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) model. Without a dispersion correction, the rate constants are consistently underestimated; the errors increase with system size, up to 106 s- <b>1</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> system considered.

Fish densities were sufficiently low to enable single target resolution and tracking. Target strengths converted to log 2 -based size-classes indicated that smaller fish were consistently more abundant than larger fish {{by a factor of}} approximately 3 for each halving of length. For all size classes, in both years, abundance (natural log) declined linearly over the summer at rates that varied from - 0. 067 x day(- 1) for the smallest fish to - 0. 016 x day(- <b>1)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> (R 2 = 0. 24 - 0. 97).

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{cannibalism}} in communally reared crabs can be eliminated by separating the growing crabs into holding compartments. There is currently no information on optimal compartment size for growing crabs individually. 136 second instar crablets (Portunus sanguinolentus) (C 2 ca. 7 - 10 mm carapace width (CW)) were grown for 90 days in 10 different-sized opaque and transparent walled acrylic compartments. The base area for each compartment ranged from small (32 mm × 32 mm) to large (176 mm × 176 mm). Effects of holding space and wall transparency on survival, CW, moult increment, intermoult period and average weekly gain (AWG) were examined. Most crabs reached instars C 9 -C 10 (50 - 70 mm CW) {{by the end}} of experiment. The final survival rate in the smallest compartment was 25 % mainly due to moult-related mortality predominantly occurring at the C 9 instar. However, crabs in these smaller compartments had earlier produced significantly larger moult increments from instar to instar than those in the larger compartments (P < 0. 05). Crabs in the smaller compartments (< 65 mm × 65 mm) also showed significantly longer moult periods (P < 0. 05). The net result was that AWG in CW was 5. 22 mm week- <b>1</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> compartment and 5. 15 mm week- 1 in smallest and did not differ significantly between compartment size groups (P = 0. 916). Wall transparency had no impact on survival (P = 0. 530) but a slight impact on AWG (P = 0. 014). Survival rate was the best indicator of minimum acceptable compartment size (? 43 mm × 43 mm) for C 10 crablets because below this size death occurred before growth rate was significantly affected. For further growth, it would be necessary to transfer the crablets to larger compartments...|$|E
40|$|The {{probability}} {{of an event}} is the limit of its relative frequency in the long run. This was the concept or interpretation developed and advocated in Reichenbach's The Theory of Probability. It cannot be true. After so many years and so much discussion, {{it is a bit}} vieux jeu to attack this position. But the arguments tell equally against such related views as those of Kolmogorov and Cramer, which surround the standard mathematical theory. Even so, I would not attempt this, if it were not that I also want to defend Reichenbach. For the heart of his position is that the statistical theories of physics intend to make assertions about actual frequencies, and about nothing else. In this, I feel, Reichenbach mest be right. I. ABSOLUTE PROBABILITIES 1. The Inadequacy ofRelative Frequency What is now the standard theory of probability is due to Kolmogorov, and it is very simple. A probability measure is a map of a Borel field of sets into the real number interval [0, 1], with value <b>1</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> set, and this map countably additive. 1 Somewhat less standard is the notion of a probability function, which is similar, but defined on a field of sets and finitely additive. Relative frequency lacks all these features except that it ranges from zero to one. This is not news; I need simply marshall old evidence (though I must say that it was a surprise to me, and I painfully reconstructed much of this along the way as I studied Reichenbach). Let the actual long run be counted in days: 1 (today), 2 (tomorrow), and so on. Let A (n) be an event that happens only on the nth day.

Table 2 lists potential causal factors that researchers have evaluated for interpreting spatial or temporal variations in fire frequency.

40|$|The {{specific}} surface area, {{determined by the}} BET method, is a parameter often used to scale results of mineral studies of surface reactions in terms of rate and capacity to the field scale. Such extrapolations of results from small-scale laboratory experiments to the field-scale are important within many environmental applications. An {{example of this is}} for the prediction of radionuclide retention in the bedrock surrounding a deep repository for radioactive waste, following failure of the engineered barriers, where radionuclides may sorb onto minerals constituting the geological environment. As a first step, the approach used in this work is to study the relationship between {{specific surface}} area and the particle size (0. 075 - 8 mm) and to approach the field scale via measurements on large, centimetre-sized pieces, for seven natural minerals commonly found in granite: apatite, biotite, chlorite, K-feldspar, hornblende, labradorite and magnetite. The underlying assumption is that sorption of radionuclides can be related to specific surface area of a particular mineral in a continuation of this project. The results show that the phyllosilicates biotite and chlorite have a specific surface area that is about 10 times larger than the other minerals. Over the range of particle size fractions studied, the specific surface area varies between 0. 1 and 1. 2 m 2 g- 1 for biotite and chlorite. The other studied minerals have specific surface areas varying between 0. 01 m 2 g- <b>1</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> fraction and up to 0. 06 - 0. 12 m 2 g- 1 for the smallest. Results show linear relationships between the specific surface area and the inverse of the particle size for all studied minerals for small particle sizes, as expected. For some minerals, however, the data seemingly can be divided in two linear trends, where a change in internal surface area, surface roughness and/or particle geometry as the particle size decreases may explain this behaviour. Interestingly, for larger particles, there is a deviation from the linearity observed for small particles. Tentatively, this behaviour is attributed to a disturbed zone, created by the mechanical treatment of the material during particle size reduction, extending throughout small particles, but not altering an undisturbed core of the larger particles. In agreement with this, measurements on large pieces show a surface area 5 to 150 times lower than expected from the linear trends observed for the crushed material, implying an overestimation of the surface area and possibly also of the sorption capacities of the rock material from simple extrapolations of experimental results employing finely crushed material to the field situation.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationships between}} inherent and apparent optical properties (IOP and AOP, respectively) and suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the main Amazonian river waters. In situ measurements of SSC, remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), the diffuse light attenuation coefficient (K-d) and the total and non-algal particle (NAP) absorption coefficients (a(TOT) and a(NAP), respectively) were conducted during three sampling trips along different streams of the Amazon River catchment (104 stations). The size distribution and chemical characteristics of the suspended sediment were also determined for 85 stations. We show that the particle size distribution (PSD) in the river water is best described by a segmented Junge power law distribution with a smaller slope value for the smallest particles (J(1) = 2. 4) and a larger slope value (J(2) = 4. <b>1)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> particles (> 10 mu m). A strong relationship was found between AOPs and IOPs and SSC when the entire data set was considered. However, for the Madeira River, the primary Amazon River tributary in terms of suspended sediment discharge, a significant dispersion was detected for the R-rs - SSC relationship {{but not for the}} d K-d - SSC relationship. This dispersion has been shown by a previous study, using MODIS data, to display a seasonal pattern, which we investigated in this study using Mie modeling calibrated with suspended sediment characteristics. In the Madeira River, suspended sediment had a finer distribution size and a different mineralogy (e. g., a greater smectite content and a lower kaolinite content) during the rising water stage. Spectral variations of the imaginary part n' (lambda) of the refraction index also showed significant differences during the rising water stage. In contrast, other streams of the Amazon basin had very stable properties with respect to granulometry and mineralogy. Model simulations made possible to reproduce both field and satellite observations, showing that the R-rs hysteresis observed in the Madeira River in the near infrared was mainly due to n' (lambda) seasonal variations, leading to a decrease of absorption during the rising water stage. K-d was shown to remain stable because of its strong dependency on scattering processes. The model was used to further understand how suspended sediment size distribution and refraction index drive the IOPs in large rivers: n' (lambda) variations were shown to control primarily the reflectance variability; R-rs (850) presented limited variations as a function of PSD in the range typical of large rivers (J(1) < 3) although it remained sensitive to particle mineralogical composition; R-rs (670) showed the opposite behavior with a higher sensitivity to PSD variation for coarser PSD. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of the R-rs ratio between the red and infrared channels allowed a reduction of the R-rs sensitivity in all cases, by an average of 50 % with respect to changes in the mineral composition or size distribution of suspended sediment. In particular, the R-rs ratio varied by less than 5 % for PSD representative of surface river waters...|$|E
40|$|Low clouds cover over {{a quarter}} of the planet’s surface in the annual mean and exert a {{significant}} cooling effect on global climate. Despite their importance, the representation of such clouds in global circulation models remains a major source of uncertainty in projections of future climate. The lifetime of such clouds can be modified by precipitation, which is observed to occur 20 - 40 % of the time in stratocumulus over the ocean. The processes by which precipitation forms are also highly uncertain and accurate quantitative precipitation forecasting remains a grand challenge in meteorology. The goal of this research is to explore and evaluate the representation of clouds in observations and models of the atmosphere, with a focus on improving our understanding of the primary process responsible for liquid precipitation formation, collision-coalescence. The first goal of this research is to develop a metric for the dynamical "age" of small cumulus for use in contexting in situ observations. The lifetime of shallow cumulus is typically under an hour hence the metric must be accurate for a single measurement of the cloud. It is found that the deviation of cloud total water mixing ratio from the mean surface mixed layer total water mixing ratio is an effective measure because the mechanism by which total water mixing ratio is diluted, entrainment, is irreversible. Collision-coalescence is notoriously difficult to observe in situ and its implementation in models of the atmosphere is highly uncertain because it is an inherently local process, dependent on interactions of drops on length scales as small as micrometers. The second goal of this dissertation is to assess the ability of theoretically derived collision-coalescence rates to explain observations of cloud drops in marine stratocumulus off the coast of Monterey, California. Drop size spectra averaged over length scales of 1. 5 and 30 kilometers are found to require enhancements of collision rates that vary {{as a function of the}} mode of the drop size distribution from 0. <b>1</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> mode sizes to over 20 for the smallest sizes. Unresolvable small-scale variability in the DSD is likely a major factor in determining the spread in required enhancements. The third goal of the research presented herein is to implement a high spectral resolution bin microphysics scheme in a large eddy simulation (LES) model. The high resolution scheme is validated by comparison with simulations using the default spectral resolution. Considerable differences in microphysical structure and planetary boundary layer turbulence are found when collision coalescence is active due to artificial acceleration of the process at the default resolution, which causes higher concentrations at large drop sizes than in the high resolution configuration. Finally, the fourth goal of this research is to evaluate the ability of a turbulent collision kernel to improve the representation of precipitation formation. The net effect of the turbulent kernel is to deplete the cloud top of large drops, but the effect of this varies depending on total drop concentration such that precipitating and non-precipitating cases have opposite responses. Precipitating cases experience an enhanced sedimentation flux throughout the boundary layer at default resolution, while nonprecipitating cases and high spectral resolution simulations experience further suppression of precipitation. We conclude that the effects of changing spectral resolution dominate the effects of the turbulent kernel. This finding is contingent on the assumption that microphysical boundary conditions (i. e. cloud condensation nuclei concentrations) should be constant across spectral resolution configurations...|$|E

40|$|The {{limitations}} of the current diagnostic and therapeutic options available for breast cancer elucidate the need for improvements to the existing methods or the introduction of novel techniques. Many {{of the most promising}} novel options for both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer involve nanoparticles. Nanoparticles have unique imaging and therapeutic possibilities arising from their small size, surface tailorability, and binding capability. If properly designed nanoparticle may exploit the disordered architecture, increased vessel density, large pores, hyperpermeability, and other abnormalities characteristic of the vasculature in tumors, and achieve increased accumulation in cancerous tissue. The efficacy of nanoparticles may be further enhanced by active targeting through chemical or biological means, e. g., using ligands that bind specifically to receptors found on cancerous cells, or physical means, e. g., application of a magnetic field to the tumor after injection of magnetic nanoparticles. In order to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic methods, it is necessary to understand the transport processes occurring in the breast and the changes that take place with the disease. Mathematical modeling is a valuable tool which provides a conceptual framework to understand these processes. The mathematical transport models found in the literature lacked of a consistent set of governing equations suggesting limited understanding. The transport parameters reported in the literature were similarly disparate, spanning several orders of magnitude in some cases. ^ The primary purpose of this research was to develop, calibrate, and validate a comprehensive mathematical model using mixture theory along with experimental data and parameter values available in the literature. The mixture theory formulation allowed for the application of external body forces, uptake of solutes by cells, aggregation of the solutes, and solid tissue deformation. The resulting model included a number of components not accounted for in the traditional transport equations. The dependence of the hydraulic permeability coefficient of the capillary wall on the concentration of solutes present was the most notable novel feature. ^ A simplified version of the mixture theory model was first utilized to describe steady state blood flow in an axisymmetric microvascular geometry for the case of no solutes or solid tissue deformation. Four influential parameters were calibrated using red blood cell velocity data from the literature. The computed velocities and calibrated parameters were in good agreement with experimental data. The mixture theory model was then utilized to examine the time dependent transport of fluid and a single macromolecular solute with no active targeting. In normal tissue, the radius of the unit cell, the pressure drop along the vessel, the osmotic pressure gradient, the hydraulic permeability coefficient, the reflection coefficient of the capillary wall, and the retardation factor substantially influenced the extravascular solute transport. These parameters, as well as the extravascular pressure, were important in cancerous tissue and were calibrated using a response surface methodology and experimental data from the literature for dextrans. The calibrated parameters were within the expected ranges. The validated results showed good agreement with the experimental data for both the mean extravascular concentration as a function of time and the penetration depth of the dextrans as a function of time across a wide range of molecular weights, 3. 3 to 2000 kg mol - <b>1.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> solutes, the results from the mixture theory model were markedly improved compared to those of the traditional models. Subsequent to exploring influence of passive targeting, both receptor mediated and magnetic active targeting were added to the mixture theory model. Both means of active targeting increased the extravascular accumulation. The efficacy of the targeting was dependent upon a number of factors, including the solute size. The mixture theory model will be a valuable tool for further exploration of these influences. ...|$|E

The short-term (24 h) toxicity was assessed using chlorophyll a fluorescence transients, linked to photosynthetic parameters. The maximum quantum yield Fv/Fm was lower at the highest concentrations tested and the toxicity thresholds were species-dependent. For acute effects, fluoranthene was more toxic than benz(a) anthracene, with LOECs of 50. 6 and 186 mu g L- 1, respectively. After 72 h exposure, there was a dose-dependent decrease in cell density, fluoranthene being more toxic than benz(a) anthracene. The population endpoint at 72 h was affected {{to a greater extent}} than the photosynthetic endpoint at 24 h. EC 50 was evaluated using the Hill model, and species sensitivity was negatively correlated to cell biovolume. <b>The</b> <b>largest</b> species tested, <b>the</b> dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella, was almost insensitive to either PAH.

On rougher surfaces, laser speckle is the cause but similar noise is observed in measurements from smoother surfaces. This paper's principal aim is to introduce two experimental methods for quantification, including dedicated data processing, to deliver sensitivities in three forms: a spectral map, a mean level per order and a total rms level. Single and parallel beam vibrometers and different surface roughness or treatment are accommodated, with sensitivities presented for two commercial instruments (beam diameters 90 and 520 mu m). For transverse sensitivity, a total rms level around 0. 05 % is found <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> beam, a quarter of <b>the</b> level <b>for</b> <b>the</b> smaller beam. <b>For</b> tilt sensitivity, advantage shifts to the smaller beam with a total rms level around 0. 45 mu m s(- 1) /deg s(- 1), less than one-third of that <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> beam. Levels hold fairly constant across the rougher surfaces, reducing only for a polished surface. For rotation sensitivities (radial vibrations), advantage remains with the smaller beam with a total rms level around 2 mu m s(- 1) /deg s(- 1), compared to 5 mu m s(- 1) /deg s(- <b>1)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> beam, while sensitivity reduces with diminishing roughness.

40|$|Abstract: Pitcher {{irrigation}} is an ancient, {{but very}} efficient irrigation system {{used in many}} arid and semiarid regions. Small pitchers are often used because they are less expensive than large ones. However, questions exist about whether the patterns and extent of soil wetting obtained with small pitchers are comparable to those achieved with larger pitchers. This work addresses these questions {{through a combination of}} experimental and simulation studies involving three pitcher sizes, identified here as large (20 L), medium (15 L), and small (11 L). Saturated hydraulic conductivities of the pitcher materials were measured using a constant head method; the measured values ranged from 0. 07 cm dj <b>1</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> pitcher to 0. 14 cm dj <b>1</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> smaller sizes. To determine the zone of wetting, the pitchers were buried down to their necks in a sandy loam soil and filled with water. Water content distributions were determined after 1 and 10 days at locations 20, 40, and 60 cm away from the pitcher center at soil depths of 0, 20, 40, and 60 cm. Moisture distributions predicted with the HYDRUS- 2 D simulation model were found to be in close agreement with the experimental results, showing root-mean-square-error values between 0. 004 and 0. 023. The close agreement suggests that HYDRUS- 2 D is a suitable tool for investigating and designing pitcher irrigation systems. Experimental and numerical results showed that a small pitcher half the size of a larger one, but with double the hydraulic conductivity, will produce approximately the same wetting front as <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> pitcher. Simulations <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> pitcher further showed, as expected, more horizontal spreading of water in a fine-texture soil as compared with a coarse-texture soil...|$|R

Measurements of the axial, tangential and radial velocity components are presented. These measurements were made using a two component, Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) system. The test rig is a 70 % of full scale version of a high pressure compressor stack from a gas turbine aero engine. Of particular interest are the internal cylindrical cavities formed by adjacent discs and the interaction of the flow in these with a central axial throughflow of cooling air. Tests were carried out for a range of non-dimensional parameters representative of H. P. compressor internal air system flows (ReO up to 4 x 106 and Rez up to 1. 8 x 105). Two different builds have been tested and the difference between these is the size of the annular gap between the (non-rotating) drive shaft and the bores of the discs. There are significant differences between the radial distributions of tangential velocity in the two builds of <b>the</b> test rig. <b>For</b> a smaller annular gap between the drive shaft and the disc bore, there is an increase of non-dimensional tangential velocity VO / N) r with radial location to solid body rotation VO / N) r = <b>1.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>larger</b> annular gap, there is a decrease with radial location to solid body rotation.

Integrated chl a (22 - 198 mgm- 2) was moderately dominated by large cells on an annual basis. The March through May dominance of diatoms was replaced by similar shares of dinoflagellates and other flagellates {{during the rest of}} the year. Variability of photosynthetic parameters was similar for total and large phytoplankton, but stratification affected the initial slope αB [0. 004 - 0. 049 mgCmg chl a- 1 h- 1 (μmol photons m- 2 s- 1) - 1] and maximum photosynthetic rates PmB (0. 1 - 10. 7 mgCmg chl a- 1 h- 1) differently. PmB, correlated positively with αB only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>large</b> fraction. PmB tended to respond faster to ambient irradiance than αB, which was negatively correlated with diatom abundance in the > 2 μm fraction.
