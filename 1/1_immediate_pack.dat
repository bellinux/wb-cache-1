40|$|Recurrent {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 (HSV- 1) disease usually results from {{reactivation}} of latent virus in sensory neurons and transmission to peripheral sites. Therefore, defining the mechanisms that maintain HSV- 1 in a latent state in sensory neurons may provide new approaches to reducing susceptibility to recurrent herpetic disease. After primary HSV- 1 corneal infection, CD 8 � T cells infiltrate the trigeminal ganglia (TGs) of mice, and are retained in latently infected ganglia. Here we demonstrate that CD 8 � T cells that {{are present in the}} TGs at the time of excision can maintain HSV- 1 in a latent state in sensory neurons in ex vivo TG cultures. Latently infected neurons expressed viral genome and some expressed HSV- <b>1</b> <b>immediate</b> early and early proteins, but did not produce HSV- 1 late proteins or infectious virions. Addition of anti-CD 8 � monoclonal antibody 5 d after culture initiation induced HSV- 1 reactivation, as demonstrated by production of viral late proteins and infectious virions. Thus, CD 8 � T cells can prevent HSV- 1 reactivation without destroying the infected neurons. We propose that when the intrinsic capacity of neurons to inhibit HSV- 1 reactivation from latency is compromised, production of HSV- <b>1</b> <b>immediate</b> early and early proteins might activate CD 8 � T cells aborting virion production.

In order to pinpoint the sites responsible for the inhibition of the PCA reaction, various rragment peptides in these two regions were synthesized.

Materials and Methods: A meta-analysis was performed of the published results of randomized clinical trials comparing TUR alone to TUR plus <b>1</b> <b>immediate</b> instillation of chemotherapy. Results: Our study included 7 randomized trials with recurrence information on 1, 476 patients. Based on a median followup of 3. 4 years and a maximum of 14. 5 years, 267 of 728 patients (36. 7 %) receiving 1 postoperative instillation of epirubicin, mitomycin C, thiotepa or (2 "R) - 4 '-O-tetrahydropyranyl-doxorubicin (pirarubicin) had recurrence compared to 362 of 748 patients (48. 4 %) with TUR alone, a decrease of 39 % in the odds of recurrence with chemotherapy (OR 0. 61, p < 0. 0001). Patients with a single tumor (OR 0. 61) and those with multiple tumors (OR 0. 44) benefited. However, after 1 instillation 65. 2 % of patients with multiple tumors had recurrence compared to 35. 8 % of patients with single tumors, showing that 1 instillation alone is insufficient treatment for patients with multiple tumors. Conclusions: One immediate intravesical instillation of chemotherapy significantly decreases the risk of recurrence after TUR in patients with stage Ta T 1 single and multiple bladder cancer. It is the treatment of choice in patients with a single, low risk papillary tumor and is recommended as the initial treatment after TUR in patients with higher risk tumors...|$|R
