5000|$|... == Examples == Examples {{of linear}} alpha-olefins are propene, 1-butene and <b>1-decene.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In an {{application}} directed at using renewable feedstocks, methyl oleate, derived from natural seed oils, {{can be converted}} to <b>1-decene</b> and methyl 9-decenoate: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{industrial}} processes {{used in the}} production of <b>1-decene</b> are oligomerization of ethylene by the Ziegler Process or by the cracking of petrochemical waxes.|$|E
50|$|The {{predominant}} {{application of}} <b>1-decene</b> is in making polyalphaolefin synthetic lubricant basestock (PAO) {{and to make}} surfactants in a blend with higher linear alpha olefins.|$|E
50|$|Linear alpha olefins are a {{range of}} industrially {{important}} alpha-olefins, including 1-butene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, <b>1-decene,</b> 1-dodecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene and higher blends of C20-C24, C24-C30, and C20-C30 ranges.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>1-Decene</b> {{has been}} {{isolated}} from the leaves and rhizome of the plant Farfugium japonicum and has been detected as the initial product in the microbial degradation of n-decane.|$|E
5000|$|Alternatively {{ethylene}} can be oligomerized to give {{mixtures of}} alkenes, which {{are subjected to}} hydroformylation, this process affording odd-numbered aldehyde, which is subsequently hydrogenated. For example, from <b>1-decene,</b> hydroformylation gives the C11 alcohol: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{so-called}} Wacker-Tsuji oxidation is {{the laboratory}} scale {{version of the}} above reaction, for example the conversion of <b>1-decene</b> to 2-decanone with palladium(II) chloride and copper(I) chloride in a water / dimethylformamide solvent mixture {{in the presence of}} air: ...|$|E
50|$|The second {{method for}} the {{synthesis}} of 2-methylundecanal begins with the conversion of undecanal to 2-methyleneundecanal by allowing it to react with formaldehyde {{in the presence of}} base. The 2-methyleneundecanal is then hydrogenated to give 2-methylundecanal. The required undecanal is generated from <b>1-decene</b> by hydroformylation. The resulting solution is over 50% 2-methyleneundecanal. The double bond of this compound is hydrogenated and the resulting 2-methylundecanal is separated from the by-products using fractional distillation.|$|E
5000|$|Decene [...] is an alkene {{with the}} formula [...] Decene {{contains}} {{a chain of}} ten carbon atoms with one double bond. There are many isomers of decene depending on the position and geometry of the double bond. <b>1-Decene</b> is the only isomer of industrial importance. As an alpha olefin, it {{is used as a}} monomer in copolymers and is an intermediate in the production of epoxides, amines, oxo alcohols, syntheticlubricants, synthetic fatty acids, and alkylated aromatics.|$|E
5000|$|Practically all polyolefins {{that are}} of any {{practical}} or commercial importance are poly-alpha-olefin (or poly-α-olefin or polyalphaolefin, sometimes abbreviated as PAO), a polymer made by polymerizing an alpha-olefin. An alpha-olefin (or α-olefin) is an alkene where the carbon-carbon double bond starts at the α-carbon atom, i.e. the double bond is between the #1 and #2 carbons in the molecule. Alpha-olefins such as 1-hexene {{may be used as}} co-monomers to give a alkyl branched polymer (see chemical structure below), although <b>1-decene</b> is most commonly used for lubricant base stocks. [...] Many poly-alpha-olefins have flexible alkyl branching groups on every other carbon of their polymer backbone chain. These alkyl groups, which can shape themselves in numerous conformations, make it very difficult for the polymer molecules to align themselves up side-by-side in an orderly way. This results in lower contact surface area between the molecules and decreases the intermolecular interactions between molecules. Therefore, many poly-alpha-olefins do not crystallize or solidify easily and are able to remain oily, viscous liquids even at lower temperatures. [...] Low molecular weight poly-alpha-olefins are useful as synthetic lubricants such as synthetic motor oils for vehicles and can be used over a wide temperature range.|$|E
