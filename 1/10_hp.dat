Herein we evaluate the potential of the <b>HP</b> <b>10</b> antigen detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (<b>HP</b> <b>10</b> Ag-ELISA) in the long term follow-up of NC-SaB cases. Assay performance was compared with that of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

50|$|Like the 6 HP model, the <b>10</b> <b>HP</b> had a 2-cylinder {{petrol engine}} with 1082 cc with two valves per cylinder. This allowed a maximum power of 10 PS.

40|$|Aims: Our aims were {{to isolate}} and {{cultivate}} mesenchymal dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) in various media enriched with human blood components, and subsequently to investigate their basic biological properties. Methods: DPSC were cultivated in five different media based on α MEM containing different concentrations of human plasma (HP), platelet-rich plasma (PRP), or {{fetal calf serum}} (FCS). The DPSC biological properties were examined periodically. Results: We cultivated DPSC in the various cultivation media over 15 population doublings except for the medium supplemented with <b>10</b> % <b>HP.</b> Our results showed that DPSC cultivated in medium supplemented with 10 % PRP showed the shortest average population doubling time (DT) (28. 6 ± 4. 6 hours), in contrast to DPSC cultivated in <b>10</b> % <b>HP</b> which indicated the longest DT (156. 2 ± 17. 8 hours); hence {{this part of the}} experiment had been cancelled in the 6 th passage. DPSC cultivated in media with 2 % FCS+ITS (DT 47. 3 ± 10. 4 hours), 2 % PRP (DT 40. 1 ± 5. 7 hours) and 2 % HP (DT 49. 0 ± 15. 2 hours) showed almost the same proliferative activity. DPSC’s viability in the 9 th passage was over 90 % except for the DPSC cultivated in the <b>10</b> % <b>HP</b> media. Conclusions: We proved that human blood components are suitable substitution for FCS in cultivation media for long-term DPSC cultivation...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to {{evaluate}} the capacity of Hypericum perforatum L. extract (Hp) to inhibit lipid oxidation in heated meat batters formulated with a healthier oil combination (olive, linseed and fish oils). The antioxidant capacity of two concentrations (0. 0005 % and 0. 001 %) of Hp in the meat matrix (Hp 5 and <b>Hp</b> <b>10</b> samples, respectively) during chilled storage was compared with the combination of synthetic phenolic antioxidants (BHA. +. BHT). Lipid alteration was evaluated through thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), antioxidative activity by photochemiluminescence (AAP), % inhibition of 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and polar material-related triglyceride compounds followed by high-performance size-exclusion chromatography. The addition of BHA. +. BHT and Hp induced oxidative protection during the preparation process and storage of meat batters with the lowest alteration in samples containing BHA. +. BHT. Storage increased linearly the polar material, thermal oxidized compounds, and TBARS in all samples with the lowest trend-variation for BHA. +. BHT followed by <b>Hp</b> <b>10</b> and <b>Hp</b> 5 samples. The protection exerted by the BHA. +. BHT and Hypericum was generally maintained throughout the experiment.
