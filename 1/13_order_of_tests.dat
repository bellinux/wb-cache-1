Among various test-case prioritization techniques, the simple additional coverage-based technique, which is a greedy strategy, achieves surprisingly competitive empirical results. To investigate how much difference there is between the order produced by the additional technique and the optimal <b>order</b> in terms <b>of</b> coverage, we conduct a study on various empirical properties of optimal coverage-based test-case prioritization. To enable us to achieve the optimal order in acceptable time for our object programs, we formulate optimal coverage-based test-case prioritization as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Then we conduct an empirical study for comparing the optimal technique with the simple additional coverage-based technique. From this empirical study, the optimal technique can only slightly outperform the additional coverage-based technique with {{no statistically significant difference}} in terms of coverage, and the latter significantly outperforms the former in terms of either fault detection or execution time. As the optimal technique schedules the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases based on their structural coverage rather than detected faults, we further implement the ideal optimal test-case prioritization technique, which schedules the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases based on their detected faults.

Results indicated a right-ear advantage, as manifested by significantly higher pass rates in the right ear (61 % and 39 % for right and left ears, respectively) in the study group, and in 1. 75 [*]dB greater TEOAE response amplitudes in the control group.

40|$|Abstract—Test-case {{prioritization}} is {{to schedule}} the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases {{so as to}} maximize some objective (e. g., revealing faults early). The existing test-case prioritization ap-proaches separate the process of test-case prioritization {{and the process of}} test-case execution by presenting the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> all <b>test</b> cases before programmers start running test cases. As the execution information of the modified program is not available for the existing test-case prioritization approaches, these approaches mainly rely on only the execution information of the previous program before modification. To address this problem, we present an adaptive test-case prioritization approach, which determines the execution <b>order</b> <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases simultaneously during the execution <b>of</b> <b>test</b> cases. In particular, the adaptive approach selects test cases based on their fault-detection capability, which is calculated based on the output <b>of</b> selected <b>test</b> cases. As soon as a test case is selected and runs, the fault-detection capability <b>of</b> each unselected <b>test</b> case is modified according to the output of the latest selected test case. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive approach, we conducted an experimental study on eight C programs and four Java programs. The experimental results show that the adaptive approach is usually significantly better than the total test-case prioritization approach and competitive to the additional test-case prioritization approach. Moreover, the adaptive approach is better than the additional approach on some subjects (e. g, replace and schedule).
