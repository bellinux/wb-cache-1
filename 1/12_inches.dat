5|$|By 1911 Germany {{had built}} battlecruisers of her own, and {{the superiority of}} the British ships could no longer be assured. Moreover, the German Navy did not share Fisher's view of the battlecruiser. In {{contrast}} to the British focus on increasing speed and firepower, Germany progressively improved the armour and staying power of their ships to better the British battlecruisers. Von der Tann, begun in 1908 and completed in 1910, carried eight 11.1-inch guns, but with 11.1-inch (283mm) armour she was far better protected than the Invincibles.

5|$|Vitgeft {{made another}} attempt {{to break through the}} Japanese {{blockade}} on 10 August in accordance to a direct order from the Tsar. The squadron was spotted relatively quickly and the Japanese main fleet intercepted the Russians in the early afternoon. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea, Poltava and Sevastopol were the last battleships in the Russian column and Poltava, which was slowed by engine problems, became the primary target of the Japanese battleships and armored cruisers when Vitgeft maneuvered the squadron past the Japanese and forced them into a stern chase. Shortly before sunset, a lucky hit killed Vitgeft and threw the squadron into confusion. The squadron second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky, eventually gained control of the squadron and led most of them back to Port Arthur. Poltava had been hit by 12–14 shells, eight or <b>12</b> <b>inches</b> in caliber, and suffered 12 killed and 43 wounded; Sevastopol was only hit by several shells that killed one crewman and wounded 62 men.|$|E
