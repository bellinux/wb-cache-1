This new automatic transmission is developed by ZF Friedrichshafen and offers better acceleration, efficiency and improved comfort.

50|$|THM400 {{transmissions}} {{are very}} popular in automotive competition due to their great strength. Much of this strength comes {{from the use of}} a cast iron center support to suspend the transmission's concentric shafts that join the clutch assemblies to the gear train. The center support, which is splined to the interior of the transmission's case, also provides a robust reaction point for <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> (the gear train's reaction carrier is restrained from counter-rotating the engine in <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> by a roller clutch whose inner race is part of the center support). Since the <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> reactive force is evenly distributed around the periphery of the case, the types of mechanical (and some times violent) failures that have plagued other competition transmissions are rare.|$|R

5000|$|The {{company was}} {{acquired}} by S. Guiterman in 1961, but {{went out of business}} in 1966 (Nigel 2013).

Modern Products, H. Seener, and Seerol produced models through the 1990s mainly for the London tourist market (<b>First</b> <b>Gear,</b> no date).

50|$|The {{powertrain}} {{control module}} in 2000-2002 automatic transmission models with the SelectShift option originally {{would not allow}} the car to start off in <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> when shifting manually (the car started in second gear).

50|$|The {{reverse gear}} for the manual {{transmission}} model is {{placed at the}} top left which is {{the position of a}} normal <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> position for conventional manual transmission cars. A locking mechanism is equipped to prevent the driver from accidentally shifting to reverse when shifting to the <b>first</b> <b>gear,</b> which can be unlocked by pulling up the black ring at the gear knob while shifting to reverse. This is a similar mechanism in many European cars, including Volvo and Renault cars from the mid 1990s.|$|R

5000|$|<b>First</b> (<b>1</b> or L Low): This mode {{locks the}} {{transmission}} in <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> only. In older vehicles, {{it will not}} change to any other gear range. Some vehicles will automatically shift up out of <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> in this mode if a certain RPM range is reached {{in order to prevent}} engine damage. This, like second, can be used during the winter season, for towing, or for downhill driving to increase the engine braking effect. The [...] "Austin Mini" [...] automatic transmission is different in this respect - This mode locks the transmission in <b>first</b> <b>gear,</b> but the gearbox has a freewheel on the overrun. Closing the throttle after acceleration results in the vehicle continuing at the same speed and only slowing down due to friction and wind resistance. During this time, the engine RPM will drop back to idle until the throttle is pressed again. What this means is that in [...] "First", engine braking is not available and [...] "2" [...] is the lowest gear that should be used whilst descending hills. The Mini's (and the 1100/1300's) 4-speed Automatic transmission was unusual in that it allowed manual selection of all forward gears, enabling the driver to [...] "take off" [...] from a standstill in any of the four ratios. It also provided no [...] "Park" [...] position.|$|R
50|$|The lower {{speeds and}} high power (17 hp) of the Mule {{make it a}} {{versatile}} off-road vehicle. It can climb over logs, go up steep slopes, and cross rivers in <b>first</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{can include}} both synchronized and unsynchronized gearing. For example, reverse gear is usually unsynchronised, {{as the driver}} is only expected to engage it when the vehicle is at a standstill. Many older (up to 1970s) cars also lacked synchronisation on <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> (for various reasons—cost, typically [...] "shorter" [...] overall gearing, engines typically having more low-end torque, the extreme wear on a frequently used <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> synchroniser ...), meaning it also could only be used for moving away from a stop unless the driver became adept at double-declutching and had a particular need to regularly downshift into the lowest gear.|$|R
5000|$|... 170 pullman-landaulets {{based on}} the W21 chassis were built from 1936 to 1937, called the Nullserie and used only as taxis, with a three-speed plus {{overdrive}} transmission, without syncromesh on the <b>first</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{compensate}} for the smaller engine compared to the W125, the W154 had an extra gear with a 5-speed manual transmission. The <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> was protected by a latch to avoid being engaged accidentally.|$|R
50|$|A {{close-ratio}} {{transmission is}} a transmission {{in which there}} is a relatively little difference between the gear ratios of the gears. For example, a transmission with an engine shaft to drive shaft ratio of 4:1 in <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> and 2:1 in second gear would be considered wide-ratio when compared to another transmission with a ratio of 4:1 in first and 3:1 in second. This is because the close-ratio transmission has less of a progression between gears. For the wide-ratio transmission, the <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> ratio is 4:1 or 4, and in second gear it is 2:1 or 2, so the progression is equal to 4/2 = 2 (or 200%). For the close-ratio transmission, <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> has a 4:1 ratio or 4, and second gear has a ratio of 3:1 or 3, so the progression between gears is 4/3, or 133%. Since 133% is less than 200%, the transmission with the smaller progression between gears is considered close-ratio. However, the difference between a close-ratio and wide-ratio transmission is subjective and relative.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977 GAZ {{launched}} its {{successor to the}} GAZ-13, the GAZ-14 Chaika. The new limousine had a more powerful engine, 220 hp, and its transmission was revised. Like for the GAZ-24, the central transmission brake was removed, but unlike the sedan, it now had a parking pin. The floor mounted selector got an international P-R-N-D-2-1 lettering. Regime [...] "1" [...] now operated <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> only, via the rear band, whilst regime [...] "2" [...] locked out the <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> (like on the original GAZ-21 Volga). Gear ratios were now 2.35 - 1.0 for torque coverter, 2.64 for <b>first</b> <b>gear,</b> 1.55 for second, third remained direct, and reverse became 2.0. The car was produced from 1977 until 1989. In 1981 GAZ launched {{what was to be}} a successor to the GAZ-24, but separated into a separate model and built alongside the -24, the GAZ-3102 Volga. It too gained a [...] "chaser" [...] modification - GAZ-31013 with the 220 hp engine from the GAZ-14, and its transmission, adopted to Volga's body. This model was built until 1996.|$|R
25|$|The {{result of}} all these {{features}} is that under normal circumstances (driving straight on dry or even wet road surfaces) the car never loses traction, even when accelerating at full throttle in the <b>first</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jacques Villeneuve pitted on lap 40, {{suffering}} from a broken rear wing element. The mechanics pulled the broken element off the wing, but <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> broke when Villeneuve tried to leave his pit box, and he retired.|$|R
50|$|The engine redlines at 10500 rpm, {{and engine}} torque below 7000 rpm is quite feeble. A <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> with higher-than-average speed ratio, {{combined}} with the feeble low-speed torque, makes it a fairly difficult bike to start from standstill.|$|R

5000|$|Standard {{transmission}} in the RV1 was a floor-shifted three-speed manual with a non-synchro <b>first</b> <b>gear.</b> A pushbutton-operated three-speed TorqueFlite automatic was optional.

50|$|The Saab 96 and its {{station wagon}} sibling, the Saab 95, {{featured}} column mounted tranmsmission levers. The gearbox originally had three <b>gears,</b> the <b>first</b> unsynchronised.

50|$|Later, {{the default}} gearbox was also {{available}} with a fully usable <b>first</b> <b>gear</b> group, resulting in eight forward gears and four reverse gears.
