40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} merging behavior specifications modeled by transition systems. Given two behavior specifications <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and <b>B</b> 2, Merge(B <b>1,</b> <b>B</b> 2) defines a new behavior specification that extends <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and <b>B</b> 2. Moreover, provided that a necessary and sufficient condition holds, Merge(B <b>1,</b> <b>B</b> 2) is a cyclic extension of <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and <b>B</b> 2. In other words, Merge(B <b>1,</b> <b>B</b> 2) extends <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and <b>B</b> 2, and any cyclic trace in <b>B</b> <b>1</b> or <b>B</b> 2 remains a cyclic in Merge(B <b>1,</b> <b>B</b> 2). Therefore, {{in the case of}} cyclic traces of <b>B</b> <b>1</b> or <b>B</b> 2, Merge(B <b>1,</b> <b>B</b> 2) transforms into Merge(B <b>1,</b> <b>B</b> 2), and may exhibit, in a recursive manner, behaviors of <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and <b>B</b> 2. If Merge(B <b>1,</b> <b>B</b> 2) is a cyclic extension of <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and <b>B</b> 2, then Merge(B <b>1,</b> <b>B</b> 2) represents the least common cyclic extension of <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and <b>B</b> 2.

To explore the role of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> in cancer progression, we investigated the action of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> in cells with increased CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> via the inducer 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[α]anthracene (DMBA) or an overexpression vector, in addition to decreased CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> via the inhibitor tetramethoxystilbene (TMS) or siRNA knockdown. We observed that CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in MCF- 7 and MCF- 10 A cells. To understand its molecular mechanism, we measured key oncogenic proteins including β-catenin, c-Myc, ZEB 2, and matrix metalloproteinases following CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> modulation. CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling via upregulation of CTNNB 1, ZEB 2, SNAI 1, and TWIST 1. Sp 1, a transcription factor {{involved in}} cell growth and metastasis, was positively regulated by CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1,</b> and suppression of Sp 1 expression by siRNA or DNA binding activity using mithramycin A blocked oncogenic transformation by CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1.</b> Therefore, we suggest that Sp 1 acts as a key mediator for CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> action. Treatment with 4 -hydroxyestradiol (4 -OHE 2), a major metabolite generated by CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1,</b> showed similar effects as CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> overexpression, indicating that CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> activity mediated various oncogenic events in cells.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cytochrome P 450 <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> (CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1)</b> is {{involved}} in the metabolism of xenobiotic compounds and endogenous metabolites. Disruption of Cyp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> in mice results in suppression of high-fat diet (HFD) -induced obesity and an extensive change in hepatic energy regulation despite minimal constitutive expression of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> in hepatocytes. Lack of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> is correlated with altered lipid metabolism, especially lysophosphatidylcholines, contributing to protection against obesity. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS) -based metabolomics revealed lysophosphatidylcholine 18 : 0 (LPC 18 : 0) as a biomarker positively related to HFD-induced obesity. The increased serum LPC 18 : 0 in wild-type mice is reduced in Cyp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> -null mice on a HFD, which is reversed in CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -humanized mice. CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -humanized mice show higher diet-induced obesity compared with Cyp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> -null mice, suggesting that human CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> shows a similar response to HFD as mouse Cyp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1.</b> In addition, hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD 1) expression was decreased in Cyp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> -null mice, and the attenuated diet-induced obesity and lower serum LPC 18 : 0 in the Cyp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> -null mice is elevated after SCD 1 overexpression, suggesting that SCD 1 is correlated with CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -induced obesity. These studies establish a biochemical link between cytochromes P 450, lipids, and metabolic disorders and suggest that inhibition of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> could be target for antiobesity drugs...|$|R

40|$|OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 mediate hepatic uptake of many drugs (e. g., statins) and can mediate transporter-mediated drug-drug-interactions (DDIs). Bortezomib is the first-in-class {{proteasome}} inhibitor drug {{approved by}} the U. S. Food and Drug Administration {{for the treatment of}} multiple myeloma. The potential of bortezomib to cause OATP-mediated DDIs has not been assessed. The current study investigated the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 degradation and determined the effects of proteasome inhibitors on OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> - and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 -mediated transport. Co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> / <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 and HA-ubiquitin was observed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells co-transfected with FLAG-tagged OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> /OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 and hemagglutinin (HA) -tagged ubiquitin, suggesting that OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 can be ubiquitin-modified. Although blocking proteasome activity by bortezomib treatment (50 nM, 7 h) increased the endogenous ubiquitin-conjugated FLAG-OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and FLAG-OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 in HEK 293 -FLAG-OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and-OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 cells, such treatment did not affect the total protein levels of OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3, suggesting that the UPS plays a minor role in degradation of OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 under current constitutive conditions. Pretreatment with bortezomib (50 - 250 nM, 2 - 7 h) significantly decreased transport of [3 H]CCK- 8, a specific OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 substrate, in HEK 293 -OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 and human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). However, bortezomib pretreatment had negligible effects on the transport of [3 H]E 217 βG and [3 H]pitavastatin, dual substrates of OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3, in HEK 293 -OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> / <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 cells and/or human SCH. Compared with vehicle control treatment, bortezomib pretreatment significantly decreased the maximal transport velocity (Vmax) of OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 -mediated transport of CCK- 8 (92. 25 ± 14. 2 vs. 133. 95 ± 15. 5 pmol/mg protein/min) without affecting the affinity constant (Km) values. Treatment with other proteasome inhibitors MG 132, epoxomicin, and carfilzomib also significantly decreased OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 -mediated [3 H]CCK- 8 transport. In summary, the current studies for the first time report ubiquitination of OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 and the apparent substrate-dependent inhibitory effect of bortezomib on OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 -mediated transport.

The most ubiquitous expressed gene was atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> a whereas atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> <b>b</b> was mainly detected in osmoregulatory organs (gill, kidney and intestine), and atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> 2 a, atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> 2 <b>b,</b> atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> 3 a, atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> 3 <b>b</b> and atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> 4 in brain. An expression analysis in three brain regions and pituitary revealed that β 1 -type transcripts were more abundant in pituitary than the other β paralogs with slight differences between brain regions. Quantification of mRNA abundance in gills after a salinity challenge showed an activation of atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> a and atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> <b>b</b> at high salinity water (60 ppt) and atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> 3 a and atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> 3 b in response to low salinity (5 ppt). Transcriptional analysis during larval development showed specific expression patterns for each paralog. Moreover, no differences in the expression profiles between larvae cultivated at 10 and 35 ppt were observed except for atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> 4 with higher mRNA levels at 10 than 35 ppt at 18 days post hatch. Whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that atp <b>1</b> <b>b</b> <b>1</b> <b>b</b> was mainly localized in gut, pronephric tubule, gill, otic vesicle, and chordacentrum of newly hatched larvae. All these data suggest distinct roles of NKA β subunits in tissues, during development and osmoregulation with β 1 subunits involved in the adaptation to hyperosmotic conditions and β 3 subunits to hypoosmotic environments...|$|R

The first two subunits possess the nucleotide-exchange activity, whereas {{the role of the}} last remains poorly defined. In mammals, two active tissue-specific isoforms of eEF 1 A have been identified. The reason for this pattern of differential expression is unknown. Several models on the basis of in vitro experiments have been proposed for the macromolecular organization of the eEF 1 H complex. However, these models differ in various aspects. This might be due to the difficulties of handling, particularly the eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> beta and eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> gamma subunits in vitro. Here, the human eEF 1 H complex is for the first time mapped using the yeast two-hybrid system, which is a powerful in vivo technique for analysing protein-protein interactions. The following complexes were observed: eEF 1 A <b>1</b> :eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> alpha, eEF <b>1</b> A <b>1</b> :eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> beta, eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> beta:eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> beta, eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> alpha:eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> gamma, eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> beta:eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> gamma and eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> alpha:eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> gamma:eEF <b>1</b> <b>B</b> beta, where the last was observed using a three-hybrid approach.

Human organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 contribute to hepatic uptake of bile acids such as taurocholic acid. However, the transport properties of individual bile acids are not well understood. Therefore, we selected HEK 293 cells overexpressing OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 to evaluate the transport of five major human bile acids (cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid) together withtheir glycine and taurine conjugates via OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3. The bile acids were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The present study revealed that cholic acid, chenodeoxyxcholic acid, and deoxycholic acid were transported by OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3, while ursodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid were not significantly transported by OATPs.

Kinetic analyses revealed the involvement of saturable OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> - and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 -mediated transport of bile acids. The apparent Km values for OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 of the conjugated bile acids were similar (0. 74 - 14. 7 μM for OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and 0. 47 - 15. 3 μM for OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3).

Here we systematically elucidated {{the contribution of}} SLCO variants on expression of the three hepatic OATPs under consideration of additional important covariates. METHODS: Expression was quantified by RT-PCR and immunoblotting in 143 Caucasian liver samples. A total of 109 rare and common variants in the SLCO <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 -SLCO <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> genomic region and the SLCO 2 <b>B</b> <b>1</b> gene were genotyped by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and genome-wide SNP microarray technology.

RESULTS: Expression of OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1,</b> OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3, and OATP 2 <b>B</b> <b>1</b> at the mRNA and protein levels showed marked interindividual variability. All three OATPs were expressed in a coordinated fashion.

This held true for haplotypes harboring c. 388 A > G but not the functional variant c. 521 T > C (rs 4149056) associated with statin-related myopathy. c. 388 A > G also significantly affected atorvastatin pharmacokinetics.

40|$|Microtubule-associated protein <b>1</b> <b>B</b> (MAP <b>1</b> <b>B)</b> is {{essential}} for neural development. Besides the abundant expression in neurons, MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> recently was found in myelinating oligodendroglia. Moreover, MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> deficiency causes delayed myelin development, suggesting the functional importance of MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> in oligodendroglia. However, molecular mechanisms that control MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> expression in oligodendroglia remain elusive. We report here that MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> mRNA is markedly up-regulated in the oligodendroglia cell line CG 4 upon induced differentiation, leading to elevated MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> protein production. A coordinated regulation of homeoprotein transcription factors was observed during CG 4 cell differentiation, which recapitulates the regulation in neurons that promotes MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> transcription. Hence, transcriptional regulation of MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> {{appears to be a}} common mechanism in both neurons and oligodendroglia. In addition, we found posttranscriptional regulation of MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> mRNA by the selective RNA-binding protein QKI in oligodendroglia. The 3 ′UTR of MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> mRNA interacts with QKI, and oligodendroglia-specific QKI-deficiency in the quakingviable mutant mice resulted in reduced MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> mRNA expression. Moreover, RNAi-mediated QKI-knockdown caused destabilization of the MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> mRNA in CG 4 cells. Furthermore, forced expression of exogenous QKI was sufficient for promoting MAP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> expression.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that deletion of constitutively expressed CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> {{is associated with}} attenuation of retinal endothelial cell (EC) capillary morphogenesis (CM) in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. This was largely caused by increased intracellular oxidative stress and increased production of thrombospondin- 2, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that endothelium nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression is dramatically decreased in the ECs prepared from retina, lung, heart, and aorta of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -deficient (CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> −/−) mice compared with wild-type (CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> +/+) mice. The eNOS expression was also decreased in retinal vasculature of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> −/− mice. Inhibition of eNOS activity in cultured CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> +/+ retinal ECs blocked CM and was concomitant with increased oxidative stress, like in CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> −/− retinal ECs. In addition, expression of eNOS in CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> −/− retinal ECs or their incubation with a nitric oxide (NO) donor enhanced NO levels, lowered oxidative stress, and improved cell migration and CM. Inhibition of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> activity in the CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> +/+ retinal ECs resulted in reduced NO levels and attenuation of CM. In contrast, expression of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> increased NO levels and enhanced CM of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> −/− retinal ECs. Furthermore, attenuation of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> expression with small interfering RNA proportionally lowered eNOS expression and NO levels in wild-type cells. Together, our results link CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> metabolism in retinal ECs with sustained eNOS activity and NO synthesis and/or bioavailability and low oxidative stress and thrombospondin- 2 expression.

Enlarged LAMP- 2 -positive vacuoles with FLAG-OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> protein retained inside were readily detected in CQ-treated cells, consistent with blocking lysosomal degradation of OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> by CQ. In HEK 293 -OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> cells, without pre-incubation, CQ concentrations up to 100 μM did not affect OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -mediated [3 H]E 217 G accumulation. However, pre-incubation with CQ at clinically relevant concentration(s) significantly decreased [3 H]E 217 G and [3 H]pitavastatin accumulation in HEK 293 -OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> cells and [3 H]pitavastatin accumulation in human SCH. CQ pretreatment (25 μM, 2 h) resulted in ∼ 1. 9 -fold decrease in Vmax without affecting Km of OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -mediated [3 H]E 217 G transport in HEK 293 -OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> cells.

Pharmacoepidemiologic studies using data from the U. S.

We synthesized a fluorescent version of CDCA, chenodeoxychilyl-(Nepsilon-NBD) -lysine (CDCA-NBD), to characterize transporter-mediated uptake. CDCA-NBD is efficiently transported by OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 with high affinities. The Michaelis-Menten constants for CDCA-NBD uptake by OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 were <b>1.</b> 45 +/- 0. 39 microM and 0. 54 +/- 0. 09 microM, respectively. By confocal laser scanning microscopy, CDCA-NBD, which is taken up by OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3, was observed to localize to the cytosol. We also examined the transport of newly synthesized fluorescent bile acids. NBD-labeled bile acids, including cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, lithocholic acid, and ursodeoxycholic acid, were all transported by OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3. CDCA-NBD exhibited {{the highest rate of}} transport of the five NBD-labeled bile acids examined in OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> - and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 -expressing cells. Our results suggest that OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 play important roles in CDCA uptake into the liver. Fluorescent bile acids are useful tools to characterize the uptake properties of membrane transporters...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic organic anion {{transporters}} OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 {{are expressed}} at the sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes {{and contribute to}} the hepatic uptake {{of a wide variety of}} clinically used drugs. To identify the antibiotics that interact with the human organic anion transporters OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3, we applied a screening system using fluorescent probes. Twenty-six antibiotics with a variety of mechanisms of action were examined. The screening demonstrated that four antibiotics inhibited OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -mediated transport and 11 antibiotics inhibited OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 -mediated transport in a concentration-dependent manner. Antibiotics that inhibited OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 -mediated transport tended to exhibit higher affinity than those that inhibited OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -mediated transport. To clarify whether the antibiotics that interacted with OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and/or OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 were substrates for these transporters, an uptake study was performed. Rifampicin and penicillin were transported by both OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3. Moreover, OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 was involved in the transport of ceftriaxone, cefmetazole, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime. Macrolides were not significantly transported by either transporter. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that our system is a useful method for the rapid screening of transporter-antibiotic interaction, and we found novel substrates. Our results indicate that OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and/or OATP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> 3 contribute to the transport process of some antibiotics, and that drug-drug interactions associated with these transporters could occur after the administration of antibiotics...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: There are {{unpredictable}} inter-individual {{differences in}} sensitivity to psoralen-UVA (PUVA) photochemotherapy, {{used to treat}} skin diseases including psoriasis. Psoralens are metabolised by cytochrome P 450 enzymes (P 450), and we hypothesised that variability in cutaneous P 450 expression may influence PUVA sensitivity. We previously showed that P 450 CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> was abundantly expressed in human skin and regulated by PUVA, and described marked inter-individual differences in cutaneous CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> expression. OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> made {{a significant contribution to}} 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) metabolism, and whether individuality in CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> activity influenced PUVA sensitivity. METHODS: We used E. coli membranes co-expressing various P 450 s and cytochrome P 450 reductase (CPR) to study 8 -MOP metabolism and cytotoxicity assays in CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> -expressing mammalian cells to assess PUVA sensitivity. RESULTS: We showed that P 450 s CYP 1 A 1, CYP 1 A 2, CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1,</b> CYP 2 A 6 and CYP 2 E 1 influence 8 -MOP metabolism. As CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> is the most abundant P 450 in human skin, we further demonstrated that: (i) CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> interacts with 8 -MOP (ii) metabolism of the CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> substrates 7 -ethoxyresorufin and 17 -β-estradiol showed concentration-dependent inhibition by 8 -MOP and (iii) inhibition of 7 -ethoxyresorufin metabolism by 8 -MOP was influenced by CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> genotype. The influence of CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> on PUVA cytotoxicity was further investigated in a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, stably expressing CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> and CPR, which was more sensitive to PUVA than control cells, suggesting that CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> metabolises 8 -MOP to a more phototoxic metabolite(s). CONCLUSION: Our data therefore suggest that CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> significantly contributes to cutaneous 8 -MOP metabolism, and that individuality in CYP <b>1</b> <b>B</b> <b>1</b> expression may influence PUVA sensitivity...|$|R
