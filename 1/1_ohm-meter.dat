40|$|A {{new class}} of silicon devices {{operating}} without p-n junctions has been studied for radiation hardness. The electric field in these devices is uniform {{over most of the}} device, thus causing high-voltage breakdown to increase with electrode spacing. Deep acceptor levels are created in the silicon by diffusing gold atoms into the lattice, or by electron radiation. These acceptor levels, {{near the center of the}} band gap, trap out electrons so that the low resistivity of the n-type doped wafer can be raised to intrinsic resistivity. Switching between a high-resistivity state at low currents and a low-resistivity state at high currents occurs at a definite threshold voltage, exhibiting characteristics similar to silicon-controlled rectifiers. Compensating 0. <b>1</b> <b>ohm-meter</b> (10 ohm-cm) silicon wafers requires electron fluxes of 10 to the 23 rd electrons per square meter (10 to the 19 th electrons per square centimeter). Experiments demonstrating gamma tolerance to 1 Gigarad(Si) are described. Calculations for maximum tolerable neutron fluence are shown, and a phenomenological explanation for these results is presented...|$|E
40|$|Many geodynamic {{processes}} governing intra-continental collisional orogeny {{are still}} unexplained and controversial. A {{key question is}} related to the state and dynamic behaviour of the lithosphere at different crustal levels while continental collision progresses. The Pamir-Tian Shan region at the north-western promontory of the India-Asia collision zone may be the best location to study such lithospheric deformation processes in situ. This work presents the crustal resistivity structure of the Pamir and Southern Tian Shan orogenic belts and their interpretation. Therefore magnetotelluric data were recorded at 178 sites along a roughly north-south trending, 350 km long corridor from the Pamir Plateau in southern Tajikistan across the Pamir frontal ranges, the Alai Valley and the south-western Tian Shan to the Kyrgyz part of the Fergana Basin. One of the most intriguing features of the 2 D and 3 D inversion results is a laterally extended zone of high electrical conductivity below the Pamir Plateau, with resistivity below <b>1</b> <b>ohm-meter,</b> starting at a depth of approx. 10 - 15 km. Considering the results of other geophysical investigations, the high conductivity can be explained with the presence of partially molten felsic rocks at middle to lower crustal levels, assuming a melt ratio between 3 and 17 %. This would cause most of the middle crust to behave fluid-like and in turn explain the flatness of the Pamir Plateau, facilitate the gravitational collapse of the south-western margin of the Pamir Plateau and suggest crustal shortening driven by lateral flow of viscous mid-crustal material. Further north, the compact metamorphic rocks of the Muskol-Shatput Domes of the Central Pamir appear as a highly resistive structure, whereat its edges might bear pathways for rising magmatic and metamorphic fluids. Several zones of high conductivity in the middle and lower crust of Central and Northern Pamir likely record fluid release due to metamorphism associated with south-dipping active continental subduction of crustal material. All suture zones appear as electrically conductive in the upper and middle crust of the Pamir and Tian Shan. Sutures are zones of lithospheric weakness, which are prone to tectonic re-activation and facilitate fluid migration. The basin of the Alai Valley - sandwiched between the Pamir and Tian Shan - exhibits a generally conductive upper crust that bifurcates into two conductors at depth. One of them connects to the active Main Pamir Thrust, which is absorbing most of today's convergence between the Pamir and the Tian Shan. The Rushan-Pshart-Zone, which separates Central and Northern Pamir, likely separate hot, partially molten and ductile middle crust in the south from colder and less mobile crust in the north, which is influenced by metamorphic fluid migration from the material subducted underneath the Northern and Central Pamir...|$|E
40|$|Magnetotelluric {{sounding}} {{at a site}} in the Transverse Ranges {{province in}} southern California indicates a low-resistivity region in the lower crust and possibly also the upper mantle. A two-dimensional model fit to the data indicates that the resistivity of this region is between <b>1</b> and 10 <b>ohm-meters.</b> The depth to the top surface of this zone is between 15 and 20 km. The lateral extent of this feature, which strikes N 65 deg W, appears to be confined to the Transverse Ranges province. The petrological characteristics of this region cannot be deduced unambiguously from the magnetotelluric sounding alone...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeabed Logging (SBL) is a {{technique}} that utilizes electromagnetic waves to propagate signals underneath seabed to determine the differences in resistivity levels {{in order to determine}} possible oil wells for exploration. This research investigates the potential of a Gaussian process approach to identify the presence of potential hydrocarbon in the deep water environment. Simulations were conducted using Computer Simulation Technology software that replicates the real seabed logging applications to generate various synthetic data. Hydrocarbon is known to have high resistivity, about 30 – 500 ohm-meter if compared to sea water of <b>1</b> – 2 <b>ohm-meter</b> and sediment of 2 – 3 ohm-meter. From our simulations, we notice that the depth more than 1, 750 m of offset the data is not reliable. Then, from the functions, we determine if it comes from the environment with hydrocarbon or without hydrocarbon. Data collected were processed using Gaussian Process method and focused on squared exponential covariance function types using codes in MATLAB...|$|R
