[...] He was {{referred}} to in 1919 as [...] "the best all around athlete Yale has produced, having won his varsity letter when at Yale, in three branches of sport -- football, baseball and crew." [...] In addition to football and basketball, Sharpe was also a fine baseball player and a skilled gymnast. [...] In 1900, The New York Times noted that [...] "Sharpe of Yale {{is as good a}} first baseman as he is a halfback, which is saying a good deal." [...] In 1915, Dr. A.C.

[...] May supported his selection as follows:"Look at him once and you will see the reason for his success. [...] He is 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weights <b>196</b> <b>pounds.</b> [...] He is evenly proportioned and owes his build, not to athletics, but in gymnastics, and he owed his athletic success not to his build so much as his ability to handle his body, which he developed in the gymnasium. [...] He can handle himself on the bars and rings and other apparatus with as much skill as he can play football or other sports. [...] He can turn a backward and forward flip and he knows the other tricks of a gymnast. ... Sharpe could row, run a fine relay, jump, put the shot, and, in fact, do about anything on the athletic field." ...|$|E

40|$|Background Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is {{effective}} for treating {{anxiety and depression}} in primary care, {{but there is a}} shortage of therapists. Computer-delivered treatment may be a viable alternative. Aims To assess the cost-effectiveness of computer-delivered CBT. Method A sample of people with depression or anxiety were randomised to usual care (n= 128) or computer-delivered CBT (n= 146). Costs were available for 123 and 138 participants, respectively Costs and depression scores were combined using the net benefit approach. Results Service costs were pound 40 (90 % CI - pound 28 to pound 148) higher over 8 months for computer-delivered CBT. Lost-employment costs were 407 (90 % Cl <b>pound</b> <b>196</b> to <b>pound</b> 586) less for this group. Valuing a I-unit improvement on the Beck Depression Inventory at 40, there is an 81 % chance that computer-delivered CBT is cost-effective, and it revealed a highly competitive cost per quality-adjusted life year. Conclusions Computer-delivered, CBT has a high probability of being cost-effective, even if a modest value is placed on unit improvements in depression. Declaration of interest J.

5000|$|Steel is {{the oldest}} and highest tensile {{strength}} strapping. It is available {{in a variety of}} widths and thicknesses as well as variations in the grade of steel. Steel is used for heavy duty holding where high strength and minimal stretch are desired. Surface finishes for steel strap include: paint, paint and wax, bluing or zinc and wax. The wax is used to better transmit the tension around the bundle and for use with certain types of tensioners. Common applications include steel coils, bundles of metal, baling wire, bricks and pavers, and roll end-binding. Steel Strapping is sold by weight rather than length, due to the natural expansion and contraction of steel in the manufacturing process. A 3/4 x [...]020 Steel Strapping Coil yields approximately <b>19.6</b> feet per <b>pound.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Allen {{attended}} Reedley College, {{a junior}} college {{where one of the}} football assistant coaches at the time was married to Allen's cousin. Reedley's offensive coordinator at the time, Ernie Rodriguez, recalled in Eisenberg's story, [...] "He was putting up ungodly numbers and making some incredible throws, but he was getting no love. I didn’t understand it. I couldn’t believe that nobody wanted him." [...] Allen did not play in the team's first three games in 2014, but in the next game ran for four touchdowns after coming off the bench, and soon became the team's starter, throwing for 25 touchdowns with only 4 interceptions {{for the rest of the}} season. By then, he had grown to 6'5" [...] and 210 <b>pounds</b> (<b>1.96</b> m, 95 kg), and his coaches at Reedley thought that he would soon receive many FBS scholarship offers. This proved incorrect; near the end of the season, Allen sent a mass email to every head coach, offensive coordinator, defensive coordinator, and quarterback coach in FBS, but received interest from only a small number of schools. Only Eastern Michigan and Wyoming offered him a scholarship, and Eastern Michigan withdrew its offer when Allen visited Wyoming late in the 2014-15 junior-college signing period.|$|R

5000|$|One {{important}} {{difference is the}} widespread use in Britain of the stone of 14 pounds (...) for body weight. This unit is not used in the United States, although its influence {{was seen in the}} practice, until World War II, of selling flour by a barrel of <b>196</b> <b>pounds</b> (14 stone). Another difference arose when Britain abolished the troy pound (...) on January 6, 1879, leaving only the troy ounce (...) and its decimal subdivisions, whereas the troy pound (of 12 troy ounces) and pennyweight are still legal in the United States, although no longer widely used.|$|E

50|$|The gristmill's {{location}} {{on the banks of}} the creek allowed it to take advantage of its natural water power. Rottenwood Creek's flow reached 720 cfm (cubic feet per minute) during that time. On March 25, 1880, an article in the Marietta Journal reported, Akers Mill had installed a new process of milling that increased from 39 to 43 pounds the amount of flour extracted from a bushel of wheat. Additionally, they were able to provide a finer grade of flour for consumption. The flour mill was capable of producing 200 barrels (<b>196</b> <b>pounds</b> each) of flour daily, while the corn mill could produce 1,500 bushels of cornmeal in the same period. The flour mill was powered by a 36-inch turbine, supplemented by an 80-horsepower engine in the event water was scarce. Also, the 1880 U.S. Census records indicate the first mill's turbine was under a 23-foot head and the second mill's was below a 26-foot head.|$|E
5000|$|At Comeback Canyon, Bob {{is working}} with Blake and Jackie, {{both of whom are}} fierce competitors. [...] "Because there's a red line at the ranch, usually the person coming into Comeback Canyon has an advantage," [...] {{explains}} Bob. But this week, both women lost three pounds the week before, so they're pretty evenly matched. That said, Jackie is up first on the scale. She loses six pounds, or 2.41%, which means she now weighs 243 pounds. Blake is up next, and is worried because she has had a bunch of injuries and has been wearing two boots since Week 3. At <b>196</b> <b>pounds,</b> she needs to lose at least five pounds to beat Jackie. Unfortunately, she loses just one pound, or 0.51%. She's embarrassed, but Bob assures her there's nothing to be embarrassed about. She has grown up tremendously, opened up little by little and feels great now. When she first got to the ranch, she wanted to lose weight to make her parents proud, but she has since learned it needs to be about her. Although she's sad to see Blake leave, Jackie is incredibly proud of herself - she's the first contestant to win two weeks in a row at Comeback Canyon and is looking forward to defending her title.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{exacting}} {{requirements and}} conditions of the X- 15 including much higher temperature, high horsepower, and extreme vibration and duty cycles, the hydraulic flight control systems compare favorably, weightwise, with preceding models. Although some items, such as the pumps, are heavier, the total system, excluding actuators, weighs approximately 195 pounds as compared with <b>196</b> <b>pounds</b> for the F- 107 A airplane. Use of the new piggy-back pump, with its low flow {{during most of the}} operating time, also permitted a reduction in fluid capacity of the hydraulic reservoirs and the total systems, even though the volume of some of the actuators is quite large. This effected a considerable saving in fluid weight. Complete ground-support equipment is available and this equipment, as well as the airplane systems, contains means for complete 5 - to 15 - micron filtration under controlled temperature conditions. By use of advanced engineering techniques and extensive laboratory testing, it has been possible to provide a sound, lightweight hydraulic system for this advanced, high-performance airplane.

40|$|Obesity may be {{the most}} {{difficult}} and elusive public health problem this country has ever encountered. Unlike the classical infectious diseases and plagues that killed millions in the past, it is not caused by deadly viruses or bacteria of a kind amenable to vaccines for prevention, nor are there many promising medical treatments so far. While di-abetes, heart disease, and kidney failure can be caused by obesity, it is easier to treat those conditions than one of their causes. I call obesity elusive partly be-cause of the disturbingly low success rate in treating it, but also because it requires changing the patterns, woven deeply into our social fabric, of food and beverage commerce, personal eating habits, and sed-entary lifestyles. It also raises the most basic ethical and policy questions: how far can government and business go in trying to change behavior that harms health, what are the limits of market freedom for in-dustry, and how do we look upon our bodies and judge those of others? Obesity is ordinarily defined as an excess propor-tion of bodily fat and technically defined in terms of body mass index (BMI). A person whose weight is 10 to 19 percent more than average is usually considered to be overweight, and 20 percent or more than aver-age is considered obese. Those who are 100 to 150 percent over normal weight are considered “morbidly obese. ” Around 35 percent of Americans are obese, and 67 percent are either obese or overweight. 1 To put those figures in what might be called a visual context, a 2011 Gallup Health Survey found that the average American man now weighs <b>196</b> <b>pounds,</b> and the average woman 160 —and both figures are 20 pounds higher than self-reported weights in 1990. ...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant {{human growth}} hormone (rhGH) is {{licensed}} for short stature associated with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), Turner syndrome (TS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), short stature homeobox-containing gene deficiency (SHOX-D) and being born small for gestational age (SGA). To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of rhGH compared with treatment strategies without rhGH for children with GHD, TS, PWS, CRI, SHOX-D and those born SGA. The systematic review used a priori methods. Key databases were searched (e. g. MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS Economic Evaluation Database and eight others) for relevant studies from their inception to June 2009. A decision-analytical model was developed to determine cost-effectiveness in the UK. Two reviewers assessed titles and abstracts of studies identified by the search strategy, obtained {{the full text of}} relevant papers, and screened them against inclusion criteria. Data from included studies were extracted by one reviewer and checked by a second. Quality of included studies was assessed using standard criteria, applied by one reviewer and checked by a second. Clinical effectiveness studies were synthesised through a narrative review. Twenty-eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in 34 publications were included in the systematic review. GHD: Children in the rhGH group grew 2. 7 cm/year faster than untreated children and had a statistically significantly higher height standard deviation score (HtSDS) after 1 year: - 2. 3 ± 0. 45 versus - 2. 8 ± 0. 45. TS: In one study, treated girls grew 9. 3 cm more than untreated girls. In a study of younger children, the difference was 7. 6 cm after 2 years. HtSDS values were statistically significantly higher in treated girls. PWS: Infants receiving rhGH for 1 year grew significantly taller (6. 2 cm more) than those untreated. Two studies reported a statistically significant difference in HtSDS in favour of rhGH. CRI: rhGH-treated children in a 1 -year study grew an average of 3. 6 cm more than untreated children. HtSDS was statistically significantly higher in treated children in two studies. SGA: Criteria were amended to include children of 3 + years with no catch-up growth, with no reference to mid-parental height. Only one of the RCTs used the licensed dose; the others used higher doses. Adult height (AH) was approximately 4 cm higher in rhGH-treated patients in the one study to report this outcome, and AH-gain SDS was also statistically significantly higher in this group. Mean HtSDS was higher in treated than untreated patients in four other studies (significant in two). SHOX-D: After 2 years 2 ̆ 7 treatment, children were approximately 6 cm taller than the control group and HtSDS was statistically significantly higher in treated children. The incremental cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) estimates of rhGH compared with no treatment were: 23, <b>196</b> <b>pounds</b> for GHD, 39, 460 pounds for TS, 135, 311 pounds for PWS, 39, 273 pounds for CRI, 33, 079 pounds for SGA and 40, 531 pounds for SHOX-D.
