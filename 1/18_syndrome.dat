40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the size and}} parental origin of the deletion in individuals with <b>18</b> p <b>syndrome.</b> Methods: Molecular and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} analyses of the pericentromeric region of chromosome 18 were performed on genomic DNA and chromosomes from study participants.

40|$|Abstract-A 3 -year-old {{child with}} {{phenotypic}} trisomy <b>18</b> <b>syndrome</b> survived 26 {{days after a}} cardiopulmonary arrest, secondary to an acute viral illness. The child was deeply comatose. No barbiturates, other sedatives, or aminoglycoside antibiotics had been recently administered. The child was normothermic with adequate cardiovascular function. Brain stem function was absent, as assessed by testing of brain stem reflexes. Serial cerebral radionuclide angiograms (CRAG) documented intact cerebral blood flow while electrocerebral silence (ECS) was present on two consecutive EEG recordings within 24 hours. Preservation of intracranial circulation was confirmed by rapid rotational computed tomographic (CT) scans. Cranial CT scans also revealed communicating hydrocephalus, and bilateral basal ganglia hemorrhages. This unusual case illustrates discordance between apparent irreversible loss of cortical function as indicated by electrocerebral silence with preserved cerebral blood flow.

Most fetuses of trisomy 18 can have one or more sonographically detectable structural abnormalities. This article provides an overview of the common sonographic features of the fetal trisomy 18, with major and minor structural abnormalities including cardiac anomalies, malformations of the central nervous system, facial anomalies, gastrointestinal anomalies, limb anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, choroid plexus cysts and increased nuchal translucency or cystic hygroma.

In addition, sex bias is significantly observed in trisomy 18 live births, and prenatal selection against male fetuses has been documented to be associated with more complex congenital anomalies. Because of the lethal birth defects in trisomy 18, prenatal ultrasound is a valuable tool to detect a variety of congenital structural malformations of trisomy 18 throughout the gestation, and early sonographic identification of major structural defects and determination of the fetal sex can provide an appropriate genetic counseling and a more reasonable management for the pregnant women...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Frailty can be {{regarded}} as a condition in which the reserve capacity of various physical systems has sunk to a critical low, at which point minor disturbances can develop into serious health problems. AIM: To review the various operationalisations of the concept of frailty and describe the relationship between frailty and psychopathology. METHOD: We searched the literature up to October 2010 using PubMed, PsycINFO and CINAHL. RESULTS: We found 35 operationalisations of the concept of frailty; 4 single measurements as a proxy for frailty (e. g. muscle strength), <b>18</b> <b>syndrome</b> diagnoses which can be subdivided into single (n = 5) and multiple syndrome diagnoses (n = 13) and 13 dimensional operationalisations for which measurement instruments were used. Only 6 studies reported the relationship between frailty and psychopathology. The studies revealed an association between depression and psychopathology. An important finding was the association between depression and frailty, but the direction of the association is unknown. CONCLUSION: No consensus has been reached regarding the operationalisation of the concept of frailty. For the purpose of gerontopsychiatric research we recommend the inclusion of a syndrome diagnosis based on physical criteria (physical frailty) because this should make it possible to unravel the relationship between psychopathology and underlying ageing mechanisms...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to reassess the extent of chromosomal loss in a cohort of 17 <b>18</b> q- <b>syndrome</b> patients by using fluorescent-activated chromosome sorting, PCR, and FISH.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Trisomy 18 is {{the second}} most common {{autosomal}} trisomy after Down syndrome (trisomy 21). A variety of anomalies of the central nervous system are observed in cases of trisomy 18. The association between trisomy 18 and congenital hydrocephalus is very rare. Case presentation A 4 -month-old male Egyptian baby boy was referred to Assiut University hospital for evaluation of his large-sized head. The initial clinical examination revealed facial dysmorphism including a prominent wide forehead, wide anterior fontanel, bushy eyebrows, synophrosis, small palpebral fissures, ocular hypertelorism, high arched palate, depressed nasal bridge, low-set ears, micrognathia, bilateral clenched hands with over lapping fingers, rocker-bottom feet and penile hypospadius. A computed tomography scan of the patient's head showed a dilatation of all the ventricular systems of the brain that suggested hydrocephalus. A chromosome analysis of his peripheral blood confirmed a trisomy of chromosome 18 (47, XX+ 18). The hydrocephalus was treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt because of the abnormal increase in his head circumference. He was discharged home on nasogastric feeds at the age of 5 months. Despite the advice of the medical team, his parents did not bring him for further follow up. He {{died at the age of}} 7 months due to a sudden cardiorespiratory arrest at home. Conclusion Microcephaly is not mandatory for the diagnosis of trisomy <b>18</b> <b>syndrome</b> because some cases of trisomy 18 can be associated with other anomalies of the central nervous system, including hydrocephalus. There is no proven explanation for this association, and the management of hydrocephalus in such a situation is not different from the usual course of management. </p...|$|E

Though earlier studies were inconclusive {{as to whether the}} extra chromosome was a No. 17 (Gottlieb et al., 1962) or a No. 18 (Patau, 1965), there is now general agreement that trisomy 18 is present. This conclusion has been based primarily on the ability to distinguish morphologically the two chro-mosome pairs; confirmatory autoradiographic studies have been previously reported on only two cases (Yunis, Hook, and Mayer, 1964; German, 1964).

40|$|Abstract The trisomy <b>18</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{also known}} as Edwards syndrome, is a common {{chromosomal}} disorder due {{to the presence of}} an extra chromosome 18, either full, mosaic trisomy, or partial trisomy 18 q. The condition is the second most common autosomal trisomy syndrome after trisomy 21. The live born prevalence is estimated as 1 / 6, 000 - 1 / 8, 000, but the overall prevalence is higher (1 / 2500 - 1 / 2600) due to the high frequency of fetal loss and pregnancy termination after prenatal diagnosis. The prevalence of trisomy 18 rises with the increasing maternal age. The recurrence risk for a family with a child with full trisomy 18 is about 1 %. Currently most cases of trisomy 18 are prenatally diagnosed, based on screening by maternal age, maternal serum marker screening, or detection of sonographic abnormalities (e. g., increased nuchal translucency thickness, growth retardation, choroid plexus cyst, overlapping of fingers, and congenital heart defects). The recognizable syndrome pattern consists of major and minor anomalies, prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, an increased risk of neonatal and infant mortality, and marked psychomotor and cognitive disability. Typical minor anomalies include characteristic craniofacial features, clenched fist with overriding fingers, small fingernails, underdeveloped thumbs, and short sternum. The presence of major malformations is common, and the most frequent are heart and kidney anomalies. Feeding problems occur consistently and may require enteral nutrition. Despite the well known infant mortality, approximately 50 % of babies with trisomy 18 live longer than 1 week and about 5 - 10 % of children beyond the first year. The major causes of death include central apnea, cardiac failure due to cardiac malformations, respiratory insufficiency due to hypoventilation, aspiration, or upper airway obstruction and, likely, the combination of these and other factors (including decisions regarding aggressive care). Upper airway obstruction is likely more common than previously realized and should be investigated when full care is opted by the family and medical team. The complexity and the severity of the clinical presentation at birth and the high neonatal and infant mortality make the perinatal and neonatal management of babies with trisomy 18 particularly challenging, controversial, and unique among multiple congenital anomaly syndromes. Health supervision should be diligent, especially in the first 12 months of life, and can require multiple pediatric and specialist evaluations. </p...|$|E
