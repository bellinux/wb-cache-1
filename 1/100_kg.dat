40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} and confirm the possible neurotransmitter(s) involved in artemether-induced behavioural syndrome in rats. Rats were administered with 0. 2 mL kg - 1 normal saline and varying doses of i. m artemether (25, 50 and <b>100</b> mg <b>kg</b> - 1) for 6 consecutive days. Neurotoxic symptoms were observed with 50 and <b>100</b> mg <b>kg</b> - 1 from day 6 upward. However, the behavioural syndrome was induced consistently at <b>100</b> mg <b>kg</b> - 1 x 6 days specifically between day 8 and 9. Another group of rats were pre-treated with various drugs (apomorphine, morphine, naltrexone, diazepam, cyproheptadine and clozapine) 30 min prior i. m artemether for 6 consecutive days and the various symptoms were observed in each rat. Finally, rats exhibiting the behavious were subjected to the characteristic 5 -HT testing. At 50 mg kg - 1 x 6 days, artemether induced mild symptoms. At <b>100</b> mg <b>kg</b> - 1 x 6 days, artemether induced consistent behavioural symptoms. Pretreatment with various drugs did not suppress the syndrome at day 8, but cyproheptadine and clozapine suppressed the syndrome significantly at day 6. Behavioural testing also confirmed the characteristic 5 -HT syndrome in rats exhibiting the symptoms. The result confirmed the involvement and possibly by an enhanced 5 -HT neurotransmission in the mediation of the behavioural syndrome due to sub-chronic administration of i. m artemether in rats...|$|R

25|$|On {{the night}} of 10/11 November, destroyers HMS Petard, Rockwood and ORP Krakowiak bombarded Kalymnos and HMS Faulknor bombarded Kos, where German forces were {{assembling}} for the attack on Leros. The German convoy reached Leros on 12 November, escorted by over 25 ships, mostly submarine chasers, torpedo boats and mineweepers. During the subsequent nights, Allied destroyers failed to find and destroy the German vessels, limiting themselves to bombarding the German positions on Leros. With the fall of Leros on 16 November, the Allied ships were withdrawn, evacuating the remaining British garrisons. By that time, the Germans had also used Dornier Do 217s of Kampfgeschwader <b>100</b> (<b>KG</b> 100), with their novel Henschel Hs 293 radio-controlled missile, scoring two hits.

40|$|We have {{recently}} shown that PPARδ agonism, used clinically to treat insulin resistance, increases fat oxidation and up-regulates mitochondrial PDK 4 mRNA and protein expression in resting skeletal muscle. We hypothesized that PDK 4 up-regulation, which inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) -dependent carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation, would negatively affect muscle function during sustained contraction where the demand on CHO is markedly increased. Three groups of eight male Wistar rats each received either vehicle or a PPARδ agonist (GW 610742 X) at two doses (5 and <b>100</b> mg (<b>kg</b> body mass (bm)) − 1 orally for 6 days. On the seventh day, the gastrocnemius–soleus–plantaris muscle group was isolated and snap frozen, or underwent 30 min of electrically evoked submaximal intensity isometric contraction using a perfused hindlimb model. During contraction, {{the rate of}} muscle PDC activation was significantly lower at <b>100</b> mg (<b>kg</b> bm) − 1 compared with control (P < 0. 01). Furthermore, the rates of muscle PCr hydrolysis and lactate accumulation were significantly increased at <b>100</b> mg (<b>kg</b> bm) − 1 compared with control, reflecting lower mitochondrial ATP generation. Muscle tension development during contraction was significantly lower at <b>100</b> mg (<b>kg</b> bm) − 1 compared with control (25 %; P < 0. 05). The present data demonstrate that PPARδ agonism inhibits muscle CHO oxidation {{at the level of}} PDC during prolonged contraction, and is paralleled by the activation of anaerobic metabolism, which collectively impair contractile function...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} to investigate the effect of selected crude extracts namely, Methanol (ME I), Chloroform Extract (CE II) and Ethyl Acetate (EAE II) extracts of Pilea microphylla on depression in mice. In the present study, the antidepressant effect of P. microphylla was examined due to its rich flavonoid contents in the Urticaceae family using two behavioral models, the Forced Swimming Test (FST) and Tail Suspension Test (TST) in mice. Selected crude extracts from Pilea microphylla produced an antidepressant-like effect, since the acute treatment of mice with extracts by intraperitoneal (i. p.) route significantly reduced the immobility time in the FST (50 and <b>100</b> mg <b>kg</b> - 1) and TST (50 and <b>100</b> mg <b>kg</b> - 1), as compared to positive controls (haloperidol and fluoxetine) at 1 and 10 mg kg - 1, respectively. The results showed that ME I, CE II and EAE II at dose of <b>100</b> mg <b>kg</b> - 1 of body weight decreased immobility time with the increase swimming time {{with respect to the}} first day (p - 1 to as much as 75. 97 % for <b>100</b> mg <b>kg</b> - 1. Similar results of increased antidepressant effect, that was, of immobility time depending on the concentration administered, were obtained with the TST method. However, EAE II and CE II extract at dose of <b>100</b> mg <b>kg</b> - 1 were obtained as best to choose an antideprssant activity. However, amounts of phenolic and flavonoid groups were found in CE II extract. As a conclusion treatment using selected crude extracts of P. microphylla had an antidepressant-like effect across models. Reduced immobility and decreasing freezing were observed in FST and TST tests. Therefore, P. microphylla may be served as a potential resource for natural psychotherapeutic agent against depression. The present study clearly demonstrated that Pilea microphylla exerts an antidepressant effect in these two behavioural models. It may be due to present of flavonoids. This is consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced uptake of flavonoids groups might have antidepressant-like effects. However, further studies are still required...|$|R
