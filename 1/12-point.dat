He debuted with a 3-point, 5-rebound and 5-assist performance in a 113–104 win over the Utah Jazz in 26 minutes off the bench. With Harkless injured on December 8, Turner started against the Memphis Grizzlies and notched a 15-point, 10-rebound double-double in a 8886 loss, despite a pair of go-ahead free throws by Turner with 27 seconds left.

Turner's 11 assists off the bench on January 11 against the Cleveland Cavaliers was the most by a Portland reserve in nearly 3 years. On February 8, he was ruled out for approximately five to six weeks after sustaining a fracture of the third metacarpal in his right hand the night before playing against the Dallas Mavericks. He returned to action, wearing a protective brace, on March 18 after missing 14 games. The team was 77 without Turner. He opened the 2017 NBA playoffs with a <b>12-point,</b> 10-rebound double-double in a <b>12-point</b> loss to the Golden State Warriors. The Trail Blazers were swept in four games, however.|$|E

5|$|The pre-game buildup focused {{primarily}} on the strong rushing attacks of both teams {{as well as the}} overall sound offense of Fresno State. Most analysts predicted a resounding victory by Fresno State. The point spread favored Fresno State as <b>12-point</b> favorites over the Mustangs. Contrary to predictions, SMU won the game by a score of 43-10, largely thanks to the play of defensive end Margus Hunt, who forced two fumbles and totaled three sacks (including one safety) as well as two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns. Consequently, Hunt and Fresno State's Davante Adams, who totaled 13 receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, were named the game's co-Most Valuable Player (MVP).|$|E

To make matters worse, United entered March still in contention for a League and European double after opening up a <b>12-point</b> gap, regardless of the fact that nearest challengers Arsenal had three games in hand.

Following their loss to Bradley, Oregon traveled to the Chicago Coliseum for a game against Western Illinois State Teachers College. Despite being without the services of Wintermute again, the Webfoots posted a 60–45 victory. Drake, the Webfoots' opponent on December 29 in Chicago, was defeated by 11 points. The final game of the road trip, held in San Francisco on New Year's Eve, saw the Webfoots lose to Stanford.
