40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{grinding}} oxygen or hydrogen atmosphere on the physical/electrochemical properties of ballmilled graphite was studied. These properties strongly depend on the atmosphere and pressure of the milling container of the oxygen and the hydrogen contents of the samples. For instance, grinding under a <b>10</b> <b>bars</b> of H 2 atmosphere leads to a highly disordered carbon, while <b>10</b> <b>bars</b> under O 2 gives a heterogeneous carbon having a well and poorly crystallized graphite component. In both cases, the reversible (x rev) and irreversible (x irrev) capacities and the double-layer capacitance increase with milling time. The graphite ground 10 h under a p O 2 = <b>10</b> <b>bars</b> strongly differs from the other samples. We ascribed such behavior {{to the presence of}} a large amount of oxygenated functional groups in relation with the formation of nanoporosity and/or the predominance of edge carbon upon grinding. In contrast, under p O 2 = 0. 2 bar or p H 2 = <b>10</b> <b>bars,</b> the variation of the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area with milling time is correlated with the irreversible capacity. Differences in the voltage composition curves are also noticed with a low oxygen pressure (p O 2 = 10 - 6 mbar) strongly reducing the polarization of the charge/discharge cycling curve while leading to x rev = 1. 7 Li for Li xC 6. Finally, 10 h of milling (R = 24) under p O 2 = 0. 2 bar were shown to produce a carbon with an x rev = 1. 6 Li and x irrev = 0. 5 Li for Li xC 6, while 80 h (R = 8) under p O 2 = <b>10</b> <b>bars</b> led to a carbon having a double-layer capacitance of 57 F/g in Et 4 N BF 4. © 2001 The Electrochemical Society.

25|$|A {{value of}} <b>10</b> <b>bar</b> {{interstage}} pressure plus ambient pressure is a suitable estimate for minimum functional pressure for most planning purposes. This value will {{vary with the}} depth, and a regulator that has stopped delivering breathing gas may deliver a little more gas as the ambient pressure decreases, allowing a few more breaths from the cylinder during ascent if the gas is used up during the dive. The amount of gas available in this way depends on the internal volume of the cylinder.|$|E
25|$|In Denmark {{district}} heating covers more than 60% of space heating and water heating. In 2007, 80.5% of this heat {{was produced by}} {{combined heat and power}} plants. Heat recovered from waste incineration accounted for 20.4% of the total Danish district heat production. In 2013, Denmark imported 158,000 ton waste for incineration. Most major cities in Denmark have big {{district heating}} networks, including transmission networks operating with up to 125°C and 25 bar pressure and distribution networks operating with up to 95°C and between 6 and <b>10</b> <b>bar</b> pressure. The largest district heating system in Denmark is in the Copenhagen area operated by CTR I/S and VEKS I/S. In central Copenhagen, the CTR network serves 275,000 households (90-95% of the area's population) through a network of 54km double district heating distribution pipes providing a peak capacity of 663MW. The consumer price of heat from CTR is approximately €49 perMWh plus taxes (2009).|$|E

Leaf turgor, calculated from leaf water potential and osmotic potential, {{was found to be}} affected by the dilution of cell contents by water in the cell walls, when osmotic potentials were measured with a thermocouple psychrometer. After the correction of measurements of leaf osmotic potential, both the thermocouple psychrometer and a pressure chamber indicated that turgor became zero in sunflower leaves at leaf water potentials of − <b>10</b> <b>bars.</b> Since most of the loss in photochemical activity occurred at water potentials below − <b>10</b> <b>bars,</b> it was concluded that turgor had little effect on the photochemical activity of the leaves...|$|R

This error, which may be as great as 400 to 500 %, cannot be eliminated by washing the leaves because salts may be secreted during the equilibration period. Therefore, a thermocouple psychrometer is not suitable for measuring the water potential of cotton leaves when it is above about − <b>10</b> <b>bars...</b>|$|R
