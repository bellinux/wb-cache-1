50|$|Most early {{successful}} mines were {{operated by}} Cornish miners. At the time, many mines in Cornwall were failing, and Cornish miners began {{to travel to}} newer mining regions around the world. Cornish miners brought with them a system of mine operations based on contracts. In this system, miners formed working groups (usually consisting of family members) which then contracted with mine operators to perform specific mining activities. Typically, miners were paid by the <b>cubic</b> <b>fathom</b> of mine rock extracted, at rates designated in their contracts.|$|R

The cost of explosives used, and of carbide supplied for lamps, was deducted from the payments made. Surface workers in the mill were paid weekly wages. Poor labour relations at the time led to an unofficial strike in 1942; the men on weekly rates eventually received an increase of 2 shillings per day following a similar settlement in the West Cumberland iron mines.|$|R

40|$|We use bivariate C <b>1</b> <b>cubic</b> splines to {{deal with}} {{convexity}} preserving scattered data interpolation problem.

We show the existence of convexity preserving interpolatory surfaces under certain conditions on the data. That is, under certain conditions on the data, there always exists a convexity preservation C <b>1</b> <b>cubic</b> spline interpolation if the triangulation is refined sufficiently many times. We then replace the quadratical constrains by three linear constrains and formulate the problem into linearly constraint quadratic programming problems {{in order to be}} able to solve it easily.
