40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the protective role of methanolic flower extract of Allamanda neriifolia on <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> <b>dichlorobenzene</b> (DCB) -induced hepatotoxicity in rat model. 1, 4 DCB administered rats (300 mg/kg/b. wt which was dissolved in 1 ml of corn oil by intraperitonial injection for 45 days) were pre treated with methanolic flower extract of Allamanda neriifolia (300 mg / kg body weight) for 45 days and sacrificed after 1, 4 DCB intoxication. Results showed that 1, 4 DCB caused a marked rise in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC), as well as marked decrease in serum total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), PCV, WBC, RBC, Hemoglobin and platelet compared to controls. However pre treatment with A. neriifolia methanolic flower extract produced a significant decrease in the ALT and total cholesterol level and an increase in total protein, albumin and hematological parameters compared to DCB alone group. Taken these data together, it can be concluded that natural plant components such as A. neriifolia flowers could protect the liver against dichlorobenzene (DCB) -induced liver toxicity.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is being proposed to assess and quantify {{the environmental impacts of}} the treatment processes which include physical, chemical and biological treatments to identify the hotspot (weak point) in the treatment processes. The methodology of this study followed the basis of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14040 - series framework. Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) table was completed by data collection from a plant and added with chemical analysis. The assessment was conducted using GaBi software and Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method is referred to ReCiPe method (RIVM, Radboud University, CML and Pré Consultants). Both problem-oriented and damage-oriented methods were assessed and chemical treatment process showed higher impacts in important categories like climate change, acidification and human toxicity. This caused the process to be the hotspot in this wastewater treatment plant. The results for problem-oriented are 1553 kg CO 2 equivalent, 5. 8 kg SO 2 equivalent, and 5. 4 kg <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> <b>dichlorobenzene</b> (1, 4 -DB) equivalent respectively and results for damage-oriented are 2. 17 x 10 - 3 DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Years), 3. 36 x 10 - 8 species. yr and 3. 80 x 10 - 6 DALY respectively when compared to the other treatment processes. This was due to the usage of chemicals in the chemical treatment which is significantly higher than in other processes. Hence, two different scenarios were suggested and assessed {{in order to reduce the}} environmental impacts of this conventional wastewater treatment. The scenarios include using the chitosan in chemical treatment process and replacing the chemical treatment process with wet air oxidation process. Both processes showed less environmental impacts than the conventional chemical treatment process in the wastewater treatment plan...|$|E

This survey included measurements on 40 priority indoor parameters (VOC, NO 2, CO, CO 2, bacteria, moulds, allergens, MMMF, temperature, humidity) and questionnaires on building characteristics, occupants' description and time activity diaries. The paper focuses on the chemical levels found in dwellings. Volatile organic compounds (30 compounds including formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, BTEX) were measured by passive samplers, during 7 days, in kitchen, bedroom and outdoor from selected homes. Indoor concentrations were low, with 40 % of values under the quantification limit. The range of values was wide. The maximum indoor concentrations measured in the kitchen were 400 μg/m 3 (alpha-pinene, o-xylene) and 293 μg/m 3 (<b>1,</b> <b>4</b> - <b>dichlorobenzène)</b> in the bedroom.

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatotoxicity {{is a form}} {{of liver}} injury caused by {{exposure}} to stressors. Genomic-based approaches have been used to detect changes in transcription in response to hepatotoxicants. However, there are no straightforward ways of using co-expressed genes anchored to a phenotype or constrained by the experimental design for discerning mechanisms of a biological response. Results Through the analysis of a gene expression dataset containing 318 liver samples from rats exposed to hepatotoxicants and leveraging alanine aminotransferase (ALT), a serum enzyme indicative of liver injury as the phenotypic marker, we identified biological processes and molecular pathways that may be associated with mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Our analysis used an approach called Coherent Co-expression Biclustering (cc-Biclustering) for clustering a subset of genes through a coherent (consistency) measure within each group of samples representing a subset of experimental conditions. Supervised biclustering identified 87 genes co-expressed and correlated with ALT in all the samples exposed to the chemicals. None of the over-represented pathways related to liver injury. However, biclusters with subsets of samples exposed to one of the 7 hepatotoxicants, but not to a non-toxic isomer, contained co-expressed genes that represented pathways related to a stress response. Unsupervised biclustering of the data resulted in 1) four to five times more genes within the bicluster containing all the samples exposed to the chemicals, 2) biclusters with co-expression of genes that discerned <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> <b>dichlorobenzene</b> (a non-toxic isomer at low and mid doses) from the other chemicals, pathways and biological processes that underlie liver injury and 3) a bicluster with genes up-regulated in an early response to toxic exposure. Conclusion We obtained clusters of co-expressed genes that over-represented biological processes and molecular pathways related to hepatotoxicity in the rat. The mechanisms involved in the response of the liver to the exposure to 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene suggest non-genotoxicity whereas the exposure to the hepatotoxicants could be DNA damaging leading to overall genomic instability and activation of cell cycle check point signaling. In addition, key pathways and biological processes representative of an inflammatory response, energy production and apoptosis were impacted by the hepatotoxicant exposures that manifested liver injury in the rat. </p...|$|E

Since these cis residues are not incorporated into the crystalline domains, the lower second heating melting points of the <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -CHDA-based copolyamides in comparison with <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -DACH-based copolyamides, having similar cycloaliphatic monomer contents, can be understood. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{transient}} outward current (Ito) plays {{a prominent}} role in the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. Several K+ channel genes, including Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4,</b> are expressed in the heart, produce rapidly inactivating currents when heterologously expressed, and may be the molecular basis of Ito. We engineered mice homozygous for a targeted disruption of the K+ channel gene Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> and compared Ito in wild-type (Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/+), heterozygous (Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/-) and homozygous ‘knockout’ (Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> −/−) mice. Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> RNA was truncated in Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> −/− mice and protein expression was absent. Adult myocytes isolated from Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/+, Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/− and Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> −/− mice had large rapidly inactivating outward currents. The peak current densities at 60 mV (normalized by cellular capacitance, in pA pF− 1; means ± s. e. m.) were 53. 8 ± 5. 3, 45. 3 ± 2. 2 and 44. 4 ± 2. 8 in cells from Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/+, Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/− and Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> −/− mice, respectively (P < 0. 02 for Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/+ vs. Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> −/−). The steady-state values (800 ms after the voltage clamp step) were 30. 9 ± 2. 9, 26. 9 ± 3. 8 and 23. 5 ± 2. 2, respectively (P < 0. 02 for Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/+ vs. Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> −/−). The inactivating portion of the current was unchanged in the targeted mice. The voltage dependence and time course of inactivation were not changed by targeted disruption of Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4.</b> The mean best-fitting V½ (membrane potential at 50 % inactivation) values for myocytes from Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/+, Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/− and Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> −/− mice were - 53. 5 ± 3. 7, - 51. 1 ± 2. 6 and - 54. 2 ± 2. 4 mV, respectively. The slope factors (k) were - 10. <b>1</b> ± <b>1.</b> <b>4,</b> - 8. 8 ± <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> and - 9. 5 ± 1. 2 mV, respectively. The fast time constants for development of inactivation at - 30 mV were 27. 8 ± 2. 2, 26. 2 ± 5. 1 and 19. 6 ± 2. 1 ms in Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/+, Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/− and Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> −/− myocytes, respectively. At + 30 mV, they were 35. 5 ± 2. 6, 30. 0 ± 2. 1 and 28. 7 ± 1. 6 ms, respectively. The time constants for the rapid phase of recovery from inactivation at - 80 mV were 32. 5 ± 8. 2, 23. 3 ± 1. 8 and 39. 0 ± 3. 7 ms, respectively. Nearly the entire inactivating component as well as more than 60 % of the steady-state outward current was eliminated by <b>1</b> mm <b>4</b> -aminopyridine in Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/+, Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> +/− and Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> −/− myocytes. Western blot analysis of heart membrane extracts showed no significant upregulation of the Kv 4 subfamily of channels in the targeted mice. Thus, Kv <b>1.</b> <b>4</b> is not the molecular basis of Ito in adult murine ventricular myocytes...|$|R

In this study, we investigated whether <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -naphthoquinone (<b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ) {{could affect the}} phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) –Akt signaling pathway and persulfides/polysulfides could modulate this adaptive response. Simultaneous exposure of primary mouse hepatocytes to Na 2 S <b>4</b> and <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ markedly decreased <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ-mediated cell death and S-arylation of cellular proteins. Modification of cellular PTEN during exposure to <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ was also blocked {{in the presence of}} Na 2 S <b>4.</b> <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ, at up to 10 [*]µM, increased phosphorylation of Akt and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). However, at higher concentrations, <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ inhibited phosphorylation of both proteins. These bell-shaped dose curves for Akt and CREB activation were right-shifted in cells treated with both <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ and Na 2 S <b>4.</b> Incubation of <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ with Na 2 S 4 resulted in formation of <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ–S– <b>1,</b> <b>4</b> -NQ-OH.
