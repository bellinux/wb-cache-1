50|$|The <b>flange</b> <b>nuts</b> are {{sometimes}} {{provided with a}} swivel flange which helps in creating a more stable structure without affecting finished product like a serrated <b>flange</b> <b>nut.</b> Swivel <b>flange</b> <b>nuts</b> are mostly used in joining wood and plastic. Sometimes both faces of the nut are serrated, permitting either side to lock.|$|R
50|$|A <b>flange</b> <b>nut</b> is a nut {{that has}} a wide flange at one end that acts as an integrated, {{non-spinning}} washer. This serves to distribute {{the pressure of the}} nut over the part being secured, reducing the chance of damage to the part and making it less likely to loosen {{as a result of an}} uneven fastening surface. These nuts are mostly hexagonal in shape and are made up of hardened steel and often coated with zinc.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of speed nuts, mostly dependent on the shape of the nut, how it attaches to the workpiece, and what type of screw can be used. Most types are designed for either machine screws or sheet metal screws. Some nuts do not attach to the workpiece. These are usually shaped as either a rectangle, a <b>flange</b> <b>nut,</b> or a hex nut; the rectangular speed nut is also known as a flat-style speed nut. Speed nuts that attach to the workpiece usually are some form of a J-nut or U-nut.|$|R
5000|$|Tank Connectors {{are widely}} made of Plastic (PVC) or Brass, in many continents this {{connectors}} are {{also known as}} tank nipple as it has male threads, Tank connectors have a flange either {{on the edge of}} one side or in center to be jammed with tank wall, This connectors are also supplemented with rubber washer and sometime plastic washer with hexagonal <b>flange</b> <b>nut,</b> to tighten the connector with the tank wall. The size range of the connector varies from 1/2" [...] to 4", or the equivalent metric sizes, the size is denoted in the internal diameter of the connectors.|$|R
40|$|Performance of air {{operated}} valves {{is a major}} maintenance concern in process industries. Anecdotal information indicates that reliability of some high maintenance valves has been improved by using an ion deposition process to achieve engineered surfaces on selected components. This project compared friction for various surface treatments of selected valve components. Results indicate valve performance may be slightly more consistent when an engineered surface is applied in the valve packing area; however surface treatment in this area {{does not appear to}} have a dominant affect on reducing valve friction. Results indicate a linear relation between stem friction and torque applied to packing <b>flange</b> <b>nuts,</b> and even after a valve is in service, controlled packing adjustments can be made without significantly changing valve stroke time...|$|R

40|$|Flange {{connections}} are {{type of connections}} frequently used in industry. There are hight claims for their dimensioning, strength and tightness. The proper and exact design {{can be made by}} calculation or by choice of standardized components (<b>flanges,</b> bolts, <b>nuts</b> etc.) accordig to requirements established by standart. This Bachelor´s thesis occupies itself with qualitative comparison of proposals for the strength design of flanged conections according to ČSN EN 13445, AD 2000 Merkblatt and ASME Code standarts. The programming language called Python is used in this Bachelor´s thesis...|$|R
40|$|Cold forging {{has played}} a {{critical}} role in fasteners and has been widely used in automotive production, manufacturing, aviation and 3 C (Computer, Communication, and Consumer electronics). Despite its extensive use in fastener forming and die design, operator experience and trial and error make it subjective and unreliable owing to the difficulty of controlling the development schedule. This study used finite element analysis to establish and simulate wear in automotive repair fastener manufacturing dies based on actual process conditions. The places on a die that wore most quickly were forecast, with the stress levels obtained being substituted into the Archard equation to calculate die wear. A 19. 87 % improvement in wear optimization occurred by applying the Taguchi quality method to the new design. Additionally, a comparison of actual manufacturing data to simulations revealed a nut forging size error within 2 %, thereby demonstrating the accuracy of this theoretical analysis. Finally, SEM micrographs of the worn surfaces on the upper punch indicate that the primary wear mechanism on the cold forging die for long hex <b>flange</b> <b>nuts</b> was adhesive wear. The results can simplify the development schedule, reduce the number of trials and further enhance production quality and die life...|$|R
