25|$|In June 2014, TECHBASE, Polish {{industrial}} automation manufacturer designed the world's first industrial computer {{based on the}} Raspberry Pi Compute Module, called ModBerry. The device has numerous interfaces, most notably RS-485/232 serial ports, digital and analog inputs/outputs, CAN and economical <b>1-Wire</b> buses, {{all of which are}} widely used in the automation industry. The design allows the use of the Compute Module in harsh industrial environments, leading {{to the conclusion that the}} Raspberry Pi is no longer limited to home and science projects, but can be widely used as an Industrial IoT solution and achieve goals of Industry 4.0.|$|E
5000|$|... opn-one is an {{embedded}} web home controller with <b>1-Wire,</b> xAP and xPL interfaces. This controller {{works as}} <b>1-Wire</b> master so that users can manage the endpoints easily from the xAP/xPL network or any web browser. Being a low-cost technology, <b>1-Wire</b> {{is widely used}} in home automation, mainly for temperature monitoring and also to build home weather stations. Opn-one intends to replace those <b>1-Wire</b> masters based on PCs.|$|E
50|$|Systems {{of sensors}} and {{actuators}} {{can be built}} by wiring together <b>1-Wire</b> components. Each component contains all of the logic needed to operate on the <b>1-Wire</b> bus. Examples include temperature loggers, timers, voltage and current sensors, battery monitors, and memory. These can be connected to a PC using a bus converter. USB, RS-232 serial, and parallel port interfaces are popular solutions for connecting the MicroLan to the host PC. <b>1-Wire</b> devices can also be interfaced directly to microcontrollers from various vendors.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>1-Wired</b> (2011) Paragon Press. [...] Techno-thriller (#13 on The New York Times Best Seller {{list for}} fiction on November 6, 2011. The novel spent 5 {{weeks on the}} USA Today Best Seller list.) and its sequel Amped (2013) Paragon Press.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} signals {{were generated}} by an FPGA, {{which was the}} master for the communication with a DS2432 (EEPROM) chip, and measured with a logic analyzer. A logic high on the <b>1-wire</b> output, means {{the output of the}} FPGA is in tri-state mode and the <b>1-wire</b> device can pull the bus low. A low means the FPGA pulls down the bus. The <b>1-wire</b> input is the measured bus signal. On input sample time high, the FPGA samples the input for detecting the device response and receiving bits.|$|E
5000|$|When a {{dedicated}} <b>1-Wire</b> interface peripheral is not available, a UART {{can be used}} to implement a <b>1-wire</b> bus master. Serial or USB [...] "bridge" [...] chips are also available that handle the timing and waveform requirements of the <b>1-Wire</b> bus, and are particularly useful in utilizing long (greater than 100 m) cables effectively. Up to 300 meter long buses consisting of simple twisted pair telephone cable have been tested by the manufacturer. It will however require adjustment of pull-up resistances from 5 to 1 kΩ.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>1-Wire</b> {{is similar}} in concept to I²C, but with lower data rates and longer range. It is {{typically}} used to communicate with small inexpensive devices such as digital thermometers and weather instruments. A network of <b>1-Wire</b> devices with an associated master device is called a MicroLAN.|$|E
50|$|Dependent on function, native <b>1-Wire</b> {{devices are}} {{available}} as single components in integrated circuit and TO-92 packaging, {{and in some}} cases a portable form called an iButton that resembles a watch battery. Manufacturers also produce devices more complex than a single component that use the <b>1-Wire</b> bus to communicate.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005 a Texas {{researcher}} {{described a}} simplified C. elegans simulator {{based on a}} <b>1-wire</b> network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a <b>1-wire</b> temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a [...] "sense-process-react" [...] operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.|$|E
5000|$|The iButton (also {{known as}} the Dallas Key) is a {{mechanical}} packaging standard that places a <b>1-Wire</b> component inside a small stainless steel [...] "button" [...] similar to a disk-shaped watch battery. iButtons are connected to <b>1-Wire</b> bus systems by means of sockets with contacts that touch the [...] "lid" [...] and [...] "base" [...] of the canister. Alternatively, the connection can be semi-permanent with a socket into which the iButton clips, but from which it is easily removed.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>1-Wire</b> is {{a device}} {{communications}} bus system designed by Dallas Semiconductor Corp. that provides low-speed data, signaling, and power over a single conductor.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>1-Wire</b> devices {{may be one}} of many {{components}} on {{a circuit}} board within a product, may be a single component within a device such as a temperature probe, or may be attached to a device being monitored. Some laboratory systems and other data acquisition and control systems connect to <b>1-Wire</b> devices using cables with modular connectors or with CAT-5 cable, with the devices themselves mounted in a socket, incorporated in a small PCB, or attached to the object being monitored. In such systems, RJ11 (6P2C or 6P4C modular plugs, commonly used for telephones) are popular.|$|E
50|$|The common serial {{interfaces}} are SPI, I²C, Microwire, UNI/O, and <b>1-Wire.</b> These use from 1 to 4 device pins and allow devices to use packages with 8-pins or less.|$|E
5000|$|The tiny {{center pin}} is a data pin using the <b>1-Wire</b> protocol. The {{computer}} uses this pin {{to change the}} LED’s color and retrieve the serial number and wattage of the power supply.|$|E
50|$|When {{developing}} and/or troubleshooting the <b>1-Wire</b> bus, {{examination of}} hardware signals {{can be very}} important. Logic analyzers and bus analyzers are tools which collect, analyze, decode, and store signals to simplify viewing the high-speed waveforms.|$|E
5000|$|The Dallas <b>1-Wire</b> {{network is}} {{physically}} implemented as an open drain master device connected {{to one or}} more open drain slaves. [...] A single pull-up resistor is common to all devices and acts to pull the bus up to 3 or 5 volts, and may provide power to the slave devices. Communication occurs when a master or slave asserts the bus low, i.e. connects the pull up resistor to ground through its output MOSFET. Specific <b>1-Wire</b> driver and bridge chips are also available. Data rates of 16.3 kbit/s can be achieved. There is also an overdrive mode which speeds up the communication by a factor of 10.|$|E
50|$|Genuine Dell laptop power {{supplies}} use the <b>1-Wire</b> protocol to send data via the third wire to the laptop (about power, current and voltage ratings). The laptop will then refuse charging if the adapter {{does not meet}} requirements.|$|E
50|$|External {{power supply}} could send data about itself (power, current and voltage ratings) to the computer. For example, genuine Dell power source uses <b>1-Wire</b> {{protocol}} to send data by third wire to the laptop. The laptop then refuse non-matching adapter.|$|E
50|$|One {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} bus {{is the possibility of}} using only two wires: data and ground. To accomplish this, <b>1-Wire</b> devices include an 800 pF capacitor to store charge, and to power the device during periods when the data line is active.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{underfloor}} heating systems cause low frequency magnetic fields (in the 50-60 Hz range), old <b>1-wire</b> systems {{much more so}} than modern 2-wire systems. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified static and low-frequency magnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic (Group 2B).|$|E
50|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{are more}} expensive when they have more pins. To {{reduce the number of}} pins in a package, many ICs use a serial bus to transfer data when speed is not important. Some examples of such low-cost serial buses include SPI, I²C, DC-BUS, UNI/O, and <b>1-Wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many devices {{can share}} the same bus. Each device on the bus has a unique 64-bit serial number. The least {{significant}} byte of the serial number is an 8-bit number that tells the type of the device. The most significant byte is a standard (for the <b>1-wire</b> bus) 8-bit CRC.|$|E
5000|$|A primary usage {{case for}} this device as {{intended}} by the designers is to [...] "eliminate {{a ton of}} early prototyping effort with new or unknown chips." [...] Using a Bus Pirate, developers can use a serial terminal to interface with devices over a variety of hardware protocols, such as SPI and <b>1-Wire.</b>|$|E
50|$|Each <b>1-Wire</b> chip has {{a unique}} {{identifier}} code. This feature makes the chips, especially in an iButton package, suitable {{for use as a}} key to open a lock, arm and deactivate burglar alarms, authenticate computer system users, operate time clock systems, etc. iButtons have been used as Akbil smart tickets for the public transport in Istanbul.|$|E
50|$|Apple MagSafe and MagSafe2 connector-equipped power supplies, displays, and Mac laptops use the <b>1-Wire</b> {{protocol}} to {{send and receive}} data {{to and from the}} connected Mac laptop, via the middle pin of the connector. Data include power supply model, wattage, and serial number; and laptop commands to send full power, and illuminate the connector LEDs red or green.|$|E
50|$|The Akbil {{device was}} touched {{to the reader}} at the faregate to gain access for {{boarding}} or on the vehicle to ride. The system used iButtons or smart radio-frequency identification cards as tickets. Akbils were <b>1-Wire</b> (iButton) electronic tags. The keyfob version of the device had the emblem of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality moulded on it.|$|E
50|$|The BASIC Stamp is {{programmed}} in {{a variant}} of the BASIC language, called PBASIC. PBASIC incorporates common microcontroller functions, including PWM, serial communications, I²C and <b>1-Wire</b> communications, communications with common LCD driver circuits, hobby servo pulse trains, pseudo-sine wave frequencies, and the ability to time an RC circuit which may be used to detect an analog value.|$|E
50|$|The <b>1-wire</b> bus {{enumeration}} protocol (described later), {{like other}} singulation protocols, is an algorithm the master uses {{to read the}} address of every device on the bus. Since the address includes the device type and a CRC, recovering the address roster also produces a reliable inventory of the devices on the bus. The 64-bit address space is searched as a binary tree, allowing up to 75 devices to be found per second.|$|E

5000|$|Dallas Semiconductor, {{acquired}} by Maxim Integrated Products in 2001, designed and manufactured analog, digital, and mixed-signal semiconductors (integrated circuits, or ICs). Its specialties included communications products (including T/E and Ethernet products), microcontrollers, battery management, thermal sensing and thermal management, non-volatile random-access memory, microprocessor supervisors, delay lines, silicon oscillators, digital potentiometers, real-time clocks, temperature-compensated crystal oscillators (TCXOs), iButton, and <b>1-Wire</b> products. The Dallas, Texas-based company {{was founded in}} 1984 and purchased by Maxim Integrated Products in 2001. Both the Maxim and Dallas Semiconductor brands were actively used until 2007. Since then, the Maxim name {{has been used for}} all new products, though the Dallas Semiconductor brand has been retained for some older products, which can be identified by [...] "DS" [...] {{at the beginning of their}} part numbers.|$|E
50|$|Buses can be {{parallel}} buses, which carry data {{words in}} parallel on multiple wires, or serial buses, which carry data in bit-serial form. The addition of extra {{power and control}} connections, differential drivers, and data connections in each direction usually means that most serial buses have more conductors than the minimum of one used in <b>1-Wire</b> and UNI/O. As data rates increase, the problems of timing skew, power consumption, electromagnetic interference and crosstalk across parallel buses {{become more and more}} difficult to circumvent. One partial solution to this problem has been to double pump the bus. Often, a serial bus can be operated at higher overall data rates than a parallel bus, despite having fewer electrical connections, because a serial bus inherently has no timing skew or crosstalk. USB, FireWire, and Serial ATA are examples of this. Multidrop connections do not work well for fast serial buses, so most modern serial buses use daisy-chain or hub designs.|$|E
