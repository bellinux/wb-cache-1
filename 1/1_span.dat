The information that the T <b>1</b> <b>Span</b> Design Tool provides is easily accessible and therefore saves time. Most importantly, the T <b>1</b> <b>Span</b> Design Tool facilitates the testing of an existing span {{for the purpose of}} isolating and repairing faults. The engineering tool operates in the DOS environment and is user friendly. The emerging technology of interactive multimedia was used to create the T <b>1</b> <b>Span</b> Design Tool. Interactive multimedia has the ability to be incorporated in areas other than information dissemination and training. The T <b>1</b> <b>Span</b> Design Tool is a unique multimedia user/computer/test fixture interface developed for engineering purposes. This project illustrates the use of interactive multimedia for the application of aiding communications craftspeople in the deployment and testing of equipment. It is the incorporation of interactive multimedia into a useful technological package instead of an information gathering mechanism or an instructional instrument that is original, singular and noteworthy. The material presented in the paper contains background information which centers on the telecommunications network environment, network equipment deployment and network span operation. The paper focuses on the new interactive multimedia technology, the typical uses of multimedia technology and the use of multimedia authoring software. The paper covers the developmental steps taken {{in the creation of the}} T <b>1</b> <b>Span</b> Design Tool with a multimedia authoring package. A user's manual for the T <b>1</b> <b>Span</b> Design Tool is also provided giving step-by-step instructions on operating the T <b>1</b> <b>span</b> Design Tool. The T <b>1</b> <b>Span</b> Design Tool authenticates the conclusion that interactive multimedia is adaptable for many applications including the engineering field. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|E

The norm estimates in the Factorization Theorem of this paper are sharpened to their best possible form by essential improvements in the proof. As a consequence we obtain that if the residual set of a contraction covers the whole unit circle then those invariant subspaces, where the restriction {{is similar to the}} unilateral shift with a similarity constant arbitrarily close to <b>1,</b> <b>span</b> the whole space. Furthermore, the hyperinvariant subspace problem for asymptotically non-vanishing contractions is reduced to these special circumstances...|$|E

40|$|To {{enable the}} {{establishment}} of a drug discovery operation for neglected diseases, out of 2. 3 million commercially available compounds 222 552 compounds were selected for an in silico library, 57 438 for a diverse general screening library, and 1 697 compounds for a focused kinase set. Compiling these libraries required a robust strategy for compound selection. Rules for unwanted groups were defined and selection criteria to enrich for lead-like compounds which facilitate straightforward structure–activity relationship exploration were established.

40|$|Abstract: Mullion-type walls, {{which are}} not {{regarded}} as structural elements in general, joined to RC frames may raise horizontal load-carrying capacity of the structure. However there is some probability that the axial elongation of them after their yielding due to bending moment has a bad influence on a behavior of RC frames. In this paper, one eighth scale two story and three story specimens were made and tested. Those consist of <b>1</b> <b>span</b> RC frame and the mullion-type walls at every story. The conclusions are as follows. The mullion-type wall elongates axially in each story after it yields due to bending moment, and the beams connected with the walls at the upper story are forcibly and more conspicuously deformed by the elongation of the walls. Consequently the rotation angle of the upper beams is about {{one and a half}} times as large as the drift angle. Experimental horizontal load-carrying capacity corresponds to the value calculated as the elongation produces plastic hinge in beams. These verification indicates that the mullion-type wall joined to RC frame raises horizontal load-carrying capacity unless the elongation causes brittle failure of beams...|$|E
