Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection may also occur in HBsAg-negative patients, a situation denoted occult infection. Similarly, very low levels of HBV-DNA have also {{been found in the}} sera of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, {{even in the absence of}} serum HBsAg. Initially we searched for HBV-DNA in serum of <b>100</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> and 50 HCV-infected patients who were HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive by nested-PCR and by an HBV monitor commercial test for HBV-DNA. Anti-HBs seroconversion rates were measured in <b>100</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> and in 22 patients with chronic HCV infection after HBV vaccination to determine if the HBV vaccination could eliminate an occult HBV infection in these individuals. Occult HBV infection was detected in proportionally fewer blood donors (6 / 100 = 6 %) than chronic hepatitis C patients (12 / 50 = 24 %) (P 0. 05). All subjects who were HBV-DNA(+) before the first dose of HBV vaccine (D 1), became HBV-DNA(-) after D 1, D 2, and D 3. Among 22 HCV-positive patients, 10 HBV-DNA(+) and 12 HBV-DNA(-), seroconversion was observed in 9 / 10 (90 %) HBV-DNA(+) and in 9 / 12 (75 %) HBV-DNA(-) subjects (P > 0. 05). The disappearance of HBV-DNA in the majority of vaccinated patients suggests that residual HBV can be eliminated in patients with occult infection...|$|E

40|$|Yo {{antibodies}} {{are associated}} with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD). We have characterized Yo sera by measuring CDR 2 and CDR 2 L antibodies and the localization of their antigens. Forty-two Yo sera from patients with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS), 179 sera from ovarian and 114 sera from breast cancer patients without PNS and <b>100</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> were screened for CDR 2 and CDR 2 L antibodies by radioactive immune assay (RIA). Fluorescence microscopy was also {{used to determine the}} presence of CDR 2 or CDR 2 L antibodies by staining of HeLa cells transfected with CDR 2 or CDR 2 L fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Confocal microscopy was further used to localize the CDR 2 and CDR 2 L proteins. RIA showed that 36 of the 42 Yo positive sera contained CDR 2 and CDR 2 L antibodies whereas 6 sera contained only CDR 2 antibodies. Five of the ovarian cancer patients had CDR 2 L antibodies and 4 of the breast cancer patients had either CDR 2 or CDR 2 L antibodies. Only patients with both antibodies had PCD. RIA and staining of transfected cells showed similar results. Yo antibodies were not present in the <b>100</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> Confocal microscopy showed that CDR 2 and CDR 2 L were localized to the cytoplasm, whereas CDR 2 L was also present on the cell membrane. Yo sera usually contain CDR 2 and CDR 2 L antibodies and both antibodies {{are associated with}} PCD. Since only CDR 2 L is localized to the cell membrane it is likely that CDR 2 L antibodies may be of primary pathogenic importance for the development of PCD...|$|E

METHODS: Sera were examined from 76 patients with lymphoma and <b>100</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> for the presence of HGV RNA using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: HGV RNA was detected in 10 % of patients' sera, but only in 1 % of blood donor samples. HGV infection was found in patients with various different types of lymphoma, including Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The majority (75 %) of patients who were HGV PCR positive had undergone transfusion, but only 30 % of those who were HGV PCR negative had received blood products. In addition, the number of donor exposures per HGV positive patient was approximately twice that of the HGV negative group. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest (1) that HGV is present in the normal blood donor population; (2) that patients with lymphoma are at risk of acquiring HGV because of their exposure to blood products; and (3) that persistent HGV infection does not appear to cause serious liver disease in these patients...|$|E

However, their determination varies more between laboratories than other diabetes autoantibodies. The Diabetes Antibody Standardization Program (DASP) aims to improve and standardise measurement of autoantibodies associated with type I diabetes. We report the results of measurement of IAA from DASP workshops in 2002, 2003 and 2005. Methods Up to 32 laboratories in 14 countries participated in each workshop. Aliquots of coded sera from 50 patients with newly diagnosed type I diabetes and <b>100</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donor</b> controls were circulated to participating laboratories. Reported results were analysed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. We compared concordance of antibody levels by ranking, IAA and insulin antibody (IA) indices and units derived from an IA standard curve. Results In all three workshops IAA assay performance had improved compared with DASP 2000. The median area under the ROC curve was 0. 73 in DASP 2002, 0. 78 in 2003 and 0. 80 in 2005 (p= 0. 0012), and median laboratory-assigned sensitivity was 26 % in 2002, 36 % in 2003 and 45 % in 2005 (p< 0. 0001).

40|$|Introduction: Gas 6, {{the protein}} {{product of the}} growth arrest {{specific}} gene 6, is present in human circulation at subnanomolar concentrations. It is secreted by endothelial cells and {{is important for the}} activation of endothelium during inflammation. Axl, the tyrosine kinase receptor for Gas 6, is also present in endothelium and can be cleaved and released into the circulation. The soluble of form Axl (sAxl), which is present in plasma, can bind Gas 6 and inhibit Axl-mediated cell signalling. Methods: We have developed reproducible and accurate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for both Gas 6 and sAxl and used them to investigate plasma samples from 70 patients with severe sepsis, 99 patients with sepsis, 42 patients with various infections causing fever but no systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), 20 patients with SIRS without verified infection, and <b>100</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> that served as controls. Correlations between Gas 6 and sAxl concentrations and other commonly used analytes were investigated. Results: The patients with severe sepsis, sepsis, infection or SIRS had all increased concentrations of Gas 6, approximately double compared to what was found in the controls. The concentrations of sAxl were also increased in the patient groups compared to the controls. Gas 6 correlated with C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and interleukin 6, whereas sAxl correlated to bilirubin and procalcitonin. Conclusions: We can confirm results of earlier studies showing that circulating Gas 6 is increased in sepsis and related syndromes. sAxl is increased, but less pronounced than Gas 6. The concentrations of Gas 6 and sAxl correlate with a number of inflammatory markers, suggesting a role in systemic inflammation...|$|E

Results Sensitivity of anti-CCP 2 antibodies and RF for RA was 63. 2 % and 59. 1 %, and specificity was 95. 0 % and 91. 2 %, respectively. When considered simultaneously, the AUC for anti-CCP antibodies was 0. 90 with 95 % CI of 0. 87 to 0. 93 and the AUC for RF was 0. 71 with 95 % CI of 0. 64 to 0. 77. The presence of both antibodies increased specificity to 98. 2 %. Anti-CCP antibodies were positive in 34. 9 % of RF-negative RA patients. Anti-CCP antibodies showed a correlation with the radiographic joint damage. Anti-CCP-positive RA patients had increased the swollen joint count and serum CRP concentration compared to anti-CCP-negative RA patients (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0. 01, and p Conclusion In Greek patients with RA, anti-CCP 2 antibodies exhibit a better diagnostic value than RF and a correlation with radiological joint damage and therefore are useful in everyday rheumatology practice. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: SEN virus (SEN-V) and TT virus (TTV) {{have been}} {{classified}} in the circoviridae family. Both are single-stranded, non-enveloped DNA viruses of about 3800 nucleotides. Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have {{a high risk of}} blood-borne viral infections. SEN-V and TTV has been reported from a number of HD units from various countries throughout the world. Materials and Methods: A total of 377 blood samples obtained from 150 healthy donors and 227 HD patients were collected at the HD center. SEN-V and TTV DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all samples. Results: TTV was detected in 109 (48. 01 %) of 227 hemodialysed patients and 14 (9. 33 %) of 150 voluntary <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> (significant, P < 0. 05). The PCR results for SEN-V-D/H DNA showed that 65 (28. 63 %) were positive for SEN-V-D and 33 (14. 53 %) were positive for SEN-V-H. 9. 69 % of 227 patients were positive for SEN-V-D/H co-infection. In the control group, SEN-V-D was detected in 14 (9. 33 %) and SEN-V-H was detected in 15 (10 %) of the 150 (<b>100</b> %) <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> Conclusion: These findings show that the prevalence of SEN-V-D/H and TTV is higher than healthy <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> Also, these results indicate that the prevalence of SEN-V and TTV infections in our region is similar with that in other countries...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIn Mauritania, {{some authors}} have {{described}} a possible high prevalence of {{hepatitis delta virus}} (HDV) infection in the 1990 s in studies of small-size samples. Objectives The aims of our study were to assess the prevalence of HDV in HBsAg positive <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> in Mauritania, to identify the main risk factors for HDV transmission and to analyze genetic diversity of HDV strains. Study design From October 2008 to December 2009, 11, <b>100</b> consecutive <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> were considered in this study. Among them, 1700 (15. 3 %) were HBsAg positive and 455 accepted {{to participate in this}} study. Demographic, epidemiological, ethnical, clinical and biological data were recorded. HDV screening, i. e., antibodies (HDVAb) and RNA (HDV-RNA) detection, was performed for all of them as well as HDV and HBV genotyping. Results Ninety/ 455 (19. 78 %) donors were HDVAb positive and HDV-RNA was detectable in 56 (62. 2 %) of them. HDV infection was significantly associated with older age, number of marriages, military profession, residence in the desert and a history of hospitalization. The HDV genotypes of the circulating strains were HDV- 1 (89. 3 %) and HDV- 5 (10. 7 %). Conclusion HDV is highly endemic in Mauritanian <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> indicating that a high number of them will develop chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Associated risk factors support nosocomial transmission of HDV. These data underline the need to reinforce HBV vaccination in newborns and in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> without HBV markers, together with screening for HDV in HBV-infected individuals...|$|R
40|$|Prevalence of the {{recently}} discovered GB virus C(GBV-C) was evaluated in a cohort of 49 Italian patients with acute or chronic hepatitis of unknown etiology (non-A-E hepatitis) and in a control group of <b>100</b> healthy <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> The GBV-C genomes could be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with reverse transcription in 35 % of the acute and 39 % of the chronic hepatitis patients; only 1 of the control subjects had a positive response. All PCR products hybridized with a specific probe in a colorimetric assay, and {{the analysis of the}} sequences of the amplified cDNAs fully confirmed the specificity of the assay. Furthermore, the alignment of the predicted translation products identified two recurrent amino acid substitutions in 6 patients, suggesting the possible existence of at least 2 different GBV-C subtypes. Thus, GBV-C may be an important agent, contributing, at least in Italy, to a significant number of the cases of hepatitis of unknown etiology...|$|R
40|$|The long pentraxin- 3 (PTX 3) {{is a key}} {{component}} of the humoral arm of the innate immune system. PTX 3 is produced locally in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli. To investigate PTX 3 levels and its use as a biomarker in patients with systemic inflammation, we developed a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on novel anti-PTX 3 monoclonal antibodies detecting PTX 3 with high sensitivity. The assay was applied on 261 consecutive patients admitted to an intensive care unit prospectively monitored with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). <b>100</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> were included as controls. PTX 3 levels were elevated in patients (median = 71. 3 ng/ml) compared with the controls (median = 0 ng/ml) (Mann-Whitney, p, 0. 0001). ROC analysis showed that PTX 3 levels were significantly specific (85. 0 %) and sensitive (89. 1 %) to discriminate between healthy controls and patients (area under the curve (AUC) 0. 922 (95 % CI 0. 892 to 0. 946, p, 0. 0001)). Higher levels of PTX 3 were associated with the development of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock (p = 0. 0001). The serum levels of PTX 3 correlated significantly with SAPS 2 score (Spearman’s rho 0. 28, p, 0. 0001). Patients with high levels of PTX 3 at admission did have a higher 90 day mortality rate than patients with the 25 % lowest levels (Cox regression analysis, hazard ratio 3. 0, p = 0. 0009). In conclusion, we have established a highly sensitive and robust assay for measurement of PTX 3 and found that its serum concentrations correlated with disease severity and mortality in patient...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) {{antibodies}} {{have been}} of diagnostic value in Northern European Caucasian patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Anti-CCP-positive RA patients had increased the swollen joint count and serum CRP concentration compared to anti-CCP-negative RA patients (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0. 01, and p < 0. 001, respectively). However, no correlation was found between anti-CCP antibodies and DAS 28 score (r = 0. 13, p = 0. 12).

40|$|Among {{the species}} that compose the {{expanding}} genus Bartonella, thus far only B. henselae and B. quintana have reportedly been isolated from humans in Europe. To evaluate the prevalence of Bartonella infection in Sweden, we conducted a retrospective serological examination of 126 human serum samples. These samples were analyzed for antibodies to B. henselae, B. quintana, and B. elizabethae. Serum samples from <b>100</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> who spanned the ages of 20 to 60 and had no apparent clinical signs of illness, were also studied as a control group. An immunoglobulin G indirect fluorescence antibody assay revealed 4 and 8. 3 % Bartonella positivity rates for the blood donor and patient group, respectively, when a cutoff titer of ≥ 64 was chosen. Among the blood donors, four were seropositive to B. elizabethae; one of these also had concordant positive titer to B. henselae. In the patient group, 14 serum samples were positive against Bartonella spp. These serum specimens represented nine patients. In three of these seropositive patients, paired serum samples displayed a fourfold increase in antibody titer {{to at least one}} of the three antigens. These three patients are discussed. In this report we also present a case study of a 60 -year-old Swedish male with fatal myocarditis. Postmortem serological analysis revealed a high titer against B. elizabethae. PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the myocardial tissue from this patient, and of liver tissue from one of the other three patients, showed sequences similar to B. quintana. The age, geographical origin, animal contacts, and serological response pattern to the different Bartonella antigens differed among the four patients. This study substantiates the presence of Bartonella spp. in Sweden, documents the seroreactivity to three Bartonella antigens in Swedish patients, and reports the first two cases of B. quintana-like infections in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} degrade amyloid A fibrils was {{studied in the}} serum of 31 {{patients}} with amyloidosis associated with rheumatoid arthritis, 33 patients with rheumatoid arthritis without amyloidosis, and 47 healthy controls. Fibrillar amyloid A protein and the radial diffusion method were used. The mean degrading activity in serum was significantly lower in patients with rheumatoid arthritis complicated by amyloidosis (58 +/- 19 % SD of the activity in a pooled sample of sera from <b>100</b> healthy <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> used as standard) than in patients with rheumatoid arthritis alone (78 +/- 14 %; p less than 0. 001) or controls (99 +/- 19 %; p less than 0. 001). Alpha 1 -antitrypsin, concentrations of which were raised in both groups of patients, inhibited the degrading activity in serum even in low concentrations. A negative correlation between degrading activity and alpha 1 -antitrypsin concentrations was observed. These findings suggest that reduced amyloid-A-degrading activity is due to inhibition rather than to deficiency of enzyme...|$|R
40|$|The newly {{described}} microorganism 'Simkania Z', {{related to}} the Chlamydiae, {{has been shown to}} be associated with bronchiolitis in infants and community acquired pneumonia in adults. The prevalence of infection in the general population is unknown. A simple ELISA assay for the detection of serum IgG antibodies to 'Simkania Z' was used to determine the prevalence of such antibodies in several population samples in southern Israel (the Negev). The groups tested included 94 medical and nursing students, <b>100</b> unselected <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 106 adult members of a Negev kibbutz (communal agricultural settlement), and 45 adult Bedouin, residents of the Negev. IgG antibodies to 'Simkania Z' were found in 55 - 80 % of these presumably healthy individuals, independently of antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae. The Bedouin had a seropositivity rate of 80 %, while all other groups had rates of between 55 and 64 %. These results indicate that 'Simkania Z' infection is probably common in southern Israel...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Iron {{deficiency}} anemia is {{an important}} limiting factor {{for the number of}} donations in regular donors. Limited data is available on the iron status in Iranian donors. This study was conduced to evaluate the prevalence of iron deficiency and its related factors in <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> at Shiraz <b>blood</b> transfusion centre in 2005. Methods: This descriptive study was done on all <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who donated their blood at Shiraz BTO in 2005. We selected 200 first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> (<b>100</b> female & <b>100</b> male), 200 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation every year for at least 3 years and 200 <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 to 4 times blood donation per year. Then we filled out a questionnaire and measured Hb, ferretin, MCV and MCHC. Results: The results showed that reduction in iron stores was directly related to the number of donations. (P< 0. 05). In this study, 34 % of female first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> and 11. 9 % of male first time donors had decreased iron stores. 34 % of female first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 47. 9 % of female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> with history of one blood donation a year and 77 % of female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 time blood donations in one year had decreased levels of iron. 11. 9 % of male first time <b>blood</b> <b>donors,</b> 14. 5 % of male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of one blood donation a year and 37. 5 % of male <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> who had history of 3 blood donations every year had iron deficiency or iron deficiency anemia. Conclusion: It seems that blood donation affects the iron status and if not compensated, it may cause complication in <b>blood</b> <b>donors.</b> The prevalence of iron deficiency in female <b>blood</b> <b>donors</b> is more who therefore require more attention. Iron store levels are more related to number of blood donations per year rather than the number of blood donations in a lifetime. Therefore, these donors as a group require more attention...|$|R
