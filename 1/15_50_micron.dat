40|$|A {{new process}} {{referred}} to as ion plating by induction heating (IPIH) is described, which combines the advantages of both ion plating and induction heating. The IPIH apparatus consists of the specimen (cathode) to be coated and the evaporation heating source, which is a ceramic crucible containing the metal to be heated. The specimen is an internal part of the high-voltage ceramic-metal vacuum feedthrough and {{is connected to the}} negative terminal of the high-voltage power supply, the positive terminal of the power supply being grounded. The plating conditions are the same as those most commonly used in industrial ion plating. A number of metals - such as nickel, iron, platinum - which were practically impossible to deposit by resistance heating evaporation can now be effectively evaporated and deposited to any desired thickness. Excellent adherence is observed for many metals deposited on various metal surfaces in thicknesses from 0. <b>15</b> to <b>50</b> <b>microns,</b> regardless of the materials selected for coating and substrate...|$|R
30|$|Graphene nanoplatelets (GnP) have {{recently}} attained immense attention from research community {{due to its}} resemblance to idealized graphene in terms of chemical and morphological structure [51 - 54]. This material is produced from microwave expansion of acid intercalated graphite which yields a planar structure with average thickness of 1 to 10  nm and varying diameter of <b>15</b> to <b>50</b> <b>microns</b> [55 - 57]. The chemical structure of GnP sheets is composed of basal plane layers of aromatic carbon-carbon rings with edges that are prone to oxidation due {{to the opening of}} conjugated structure during intercalation and exfoliation processes [51, 57, 58]. The highly intense microwave radiation up to 2.45  GHz in frequency onto the compactly dense graphite flakes results in thermal expansion as high as 500 times its original volume [55]. The expansion yields a wormlike accordion structure which can be further isolated to produce GnP sheets consisting of few to tens of layers of graphene [59, 60].|$|R
40|$|Normal incidence, {{specular}} reflectance {{spectra of}} three samples of optical black coatings have been measured in 10 filter passbands at effective wavelengths between 12 and 700 microns. Strong absorption, due to amorphous silicate {{material in the}} coatings, {{is found in the}} <b>15</b> - <b>50</b> <b>micron</b> region of each spectrum. Reflecting-layer model calculations are fitted by a nonlinear least-squares routine to the spectra at wavelengths beyond the absorption band to determine far-infrared optical parameters. It is found that, with a similar wavelength dependence, the absorption coefficient of a new black coating (ECP 2200) made by the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (3 M) is less than 1 / 10 that of the discontinued coating, 3 M Black Velvet Nextel. It is also shown that the extinction effect of a very rough substrate is negligible compared with the effects of increased upper surface roughness and coating thickness attendant upon fully covering a very rough substrate...|$|R
40|$|This work {{examined}} and quantified processes controlling {{changes in the}} transport characteristics of natural fractures, subjected to coupled thermal-mechanical-chemical (TMC) effects. Specifically, it {{examined the effects of}} mineral dissolution and precipitation mediated by mechanical effects, using laboratory through-flow experiments concurrently imaged by X-ray CT. These were conducted on natural and artificial fractures in cores using water as the permeant. Fluid and mineral mass balances are recorded and are correlated with in-sample saturation, porosity and fracture aperture maps, acquired in real-time by X-ray CT-imaging at a maximum spatial resolution of <b>15</b> - <b>50</b> <b>microns</b> per pixel. Post-test, the samples were resin-impregnated, thin-sectioned, and examined by microscopy to define the characteristics of dissolution and precipitation. The test-concurrent X-ray imaging, mass balances, and measurements of permeability, together with the post-test microscopy, were used to define dissolution/precipitation processes, and to constrain process-based models. These models define and quantify key processes of pressure solution, free-face dissolution, and shear-dilation, and the influence of temperature, stress level, and chemistry on the rate of dissolution, its distribution in space and time, and its influence on the mechanical and transport properties of the fracture...|$|R
40|$|A self {{quenching}} streamer (SQS), {{or limited}} streamer mode {{has been studied}} in single wire chambers with cross-sections 12 x 12 mm and wire diameters <b>15,</b> 25 and <b>50</b> <b>microns.</b> Chambers were filled with either pure dimethyl ether (DME) or isobutane gases and irradiated with Gd- 148 alpha and Fe- 55 x-ray sources. Clear transitions from a proportional to 100 % SQS mode were observed on all three diameter wires with both gases irradiated with alpha particles. Double SQS discharges due to inclined tracks observed in DME gas allowed an estimation of a streamer size along the wire of less than 1 mm. The second SQS discharge appears less than 1 mm from the first within about 500 ns. Charge spectra obtained with DME irradiated with Fe- 55 x-rays might also {{be interpreted as a}} transition to a SQS mode, although no direct evidence of that was seen in the observed pulse shapes...|$|R
40|$|We present {{near-infrared}} (1. <b>15</b> - 2. <b>50</b> <b>microns)</b> medium-resolution (R = 1700) spectroscopy of {{a sample}} of 23 brown dwarf candidates in the young Upper Sco association. We confirm membership of 21 brown dwarfs based on their spectral shape, comparison with field dwarfs, and presence of weak gravity-sensitive features. Their spectral types range from M 8 to L 2 with an uncertainty of a subclass, suggesting effective temperatures between 2700 and 1800 K with an uncertainty up to 300 K and masses in the 30 - 8 Mjup range. Among the non-members, we have uncovered a field L 2 dwarf {{at a distance of}} 120 - 140 pc, assuming that it is single. The success rate of our photometric selection based on five photometric passbands and complemented partly by proper motion is over 90 %, a very promising result for future studies of the low-mass star and brown dwarf populations in young open clusters by the UKIDSS Galactic Cluster Survey. We observe a large dispersion in the magnitude versus spectral-type relation which is likely the result of the combination of several effects including age dispersion, extent and depth of the association, a high degree of multiplicity and the occurrence of disks.

40|$|The cell {{kinetics}} of 82 squamous cell carcinomas {{of the head}} and neck were studied by in vivo administration of the thymidine analogue, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Ploidy, BrdUrd labelling index (LI), duration of S-phase (Ts), potential doubling time (Tpot) and S-phase fraction (SPF) were measured by flow cytometry on <b>50</b> <b>microns</b> paraffin embedded sections. The range of values obtained compared well with other in vivo cell kinetic studies of head and neck cancer. Aneuploid tumours had a significantly higher BrdUrd labelling index and SPF, and a short Tpot than diploid tumours. To validate the use of <b>50</b> <b>microns</b> sections for measuring cell kinetic parameters by flow cytometry a comparison of values obtained by <b>50</b> <b>microns</b> sections and small blocks of tissue was made. No significant difference was found between the two methods. Reproducibility of values between two consecutive thick sections was also good.

40|$|Thinned die {{can be used}} {{to realize}} ultra-thin {{flexible}} electronics for applications such as conformal and wearable electronics. Three techniques have been developed to achieve this goal using thinned die: die flip chip bonded onto flexible substrates, die laminated onto LCP films, and die embedded in polyimide. A key to achieving each of these techniques is the thinning of die to a thickness of <b>50</b> <b>microns</b> or thinner. Conventional CMP processing {{can be used to}} thin to <b>50</b> <b>microns.</b> At <b>50</b> <b>microns,</b> the active die become flexible and must be handled by temporarily bonding them to a holder die, for further processing.

40|$|Available {{experimental}} {{models of}} portal hypertension are based either on cirrhosis or externally applied portal vein constricting devices. A new method is described of raising portal pressure, which uses intraportally injected microspheres to block intrahepatic portal radicles, {{which has the}} advantages of retaining normal liver architecture and providing a more clinically relevant intrahepatic obstruction to portal flow. Measured aliquots of microspheres (<b>15,</b> 25, <b>50,</b> 90 <b>microns)</b> or equivalent volumes of saline were injected into a peripheral portal tributary (caecal vein) of 22 normal rats. The resultant changes in arterial, portal, and splenic pulp pressures were monitored. Sequential microsphere injections produced graduated rises in portal pressure up to a peak of 18. 5 - 22. 5 mm Hg (8. 7 - 12. 4 mm Hg increase from basal), which declined gradually to a steady state pressure of 13. 3 - 15. 1 mm Hg (4. 0 - 5. 0 mm Hg increase). There {{was no significant difference}} between pressure increases produced by microspheres of differing sizes. It is concluded that portal hypertension can be produced acutely by blocking portal radicles with microspheres. The maximum pressure achieved, however, is substantially less than that obtained by total portal vein occlusion (mean: 57. 6 mm Hg). This suggests the existence of functional intrahepatic portal systemic shunts not previously described in the normal liver...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To measure {{blood flow}} in the rabbit retinal {{circulation}} with fluorescein leucocyte angiography using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. METHODS: Blood was withdrawn from the ear vein of a rabbit (New Zealand White), mixed with fluorescent dye in a test tube and centrifuged. The yellow-brown layer containing fluorescein stained leucocytes was collected and injected into the ear vein of the same rabbit while performing fluorescein angiography with a scanning laser ophthalmoscope. The image of retinal angiography displaying circulating fluorescent leucocytes was recorded on video tape. From each frame of the video tape, the consecutive positions of fluorescein stained leucocytes were digitised using an image analysis system and the velocity of blood flow was calculated. RESULTS: Fluorescent leucocytes were clearly visualised in the retinal arteries, capillaries, and veins which allowed measurement of blood flow. The mean capillary velocity was 0. 69 (SD 0. 21) mm/s. The mean velocities of leucocytes measured in different sized vessels were as follows: 5. 83 (2. 42) mm/s in arteries over <b>50</b> <b>microns,</b> 3. 33 (0. 62) mm/s in those 35 - <b>50</b> <b>microns,</b> and 2. 42 (1. 08) mm/s in arteries under 35 microns, 3. 08 (1. 56) mm/s in veins over <b>50</b> <b>microns,</b> 2. 79 (1. 49) mm/s in those 35 - <b>50</b> <b>microns,</b> and 1. 21 (0. 50) mm/s in veins under 35 microns. Blood flow pulsation occurs in arteries, arterioles, veins, and venules but not capillaries. CONCLUSION: Fluorescein leucocyte angiography {{can be used for}} simultaneous measurement of the blood flow in retinal arteries, veins, and capillaries...|$|R
