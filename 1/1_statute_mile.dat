50|$|Pulse width also {{determines the}} dead zone at close ranges. While the radar {{transmitter}} is active, the receiver input is blanked {{to avoid the}} amplifiers being swamped (saturated) or, (more likely), damaged.

For convenience, these figures may also be expressed as 1 nautical mile in 12.4 μs or 1 kilometre in 6.7 μs. (For simplicity, all further discussion will use metric figures.) If the radar pulse width is 1 μs, then there can be no detection of targets closer than about 150 m, because the receiver is blanked.|$|E

40|$|Joyce {{is arguably}} the most {{significant}} literary personality in the Anglophone world to have celebrated the complex interconnectedness of modernity and peripherality in their problematic coexistence on several possible levels. More specifically, Ulysses foregrounds an idea of modernity which becomes encoded in relation to the peripheral and to what can be best defined as utopian modes of idealization that are grounded in subjective desires, and which challenge political, ideological and social discourses. This cultural nexus of the modern, the peripheral and the utopian, is analysed in this essay in the fancy, hypermodern fashioning of “Flowerville”, the dream suburban mansion Bloom fantasizes about in “Ithaca”, built “at a given point no less than <b>1</b> <b>statute</b> <b>mile</b> from the periphery of the metropolis”. As a comparatively neglected section in the incommensurably proliferating bulk of Joycean criticism, this is an imaginative projection embedded in the most overtly materialist and expository of all the episodes, which engages with the dominant discourses of revivalist ideology, imperial science and economy, and is pervasively dominated by the issue of modernity and modernisation. This piece of utopian digression actually presents a narrative fantasy that engages with different aspects of a peripheral, suburban, capitalistic modernity, on the mutually exclusive, incompatible planes of subjective and private desires and social and political realities. The imaginative, fancy and architecturally eclectic Flowerville thus gains a metonymic representative value in its infringement on the topographic precision and ideological discourse foregrounded by chapter 11. Flowerville ironically projects yet another version of the individual and the modern nation, a private narrative of spatial, utopian imagining which reasserts, through and despite its paradox and irony, that the nation is also constructed (and exposed in its aporias) by individual imagination and subjective spatial representations...|$|E
