5000|$|Imagine {{the huge}} room - {{perhaps it is}} a {{convention}} center or an exhibit hall.To me, it is a safety and a time issue, the way I set up {{the room at the}} start. Too dangerous / difficult / huge to make an actual circle (or concentric rings) for an Opening Circle. So instead, I invite participants to come in and sit anywhere to start, and they are sitting in pre-set circles-of-chairs all across the room. And then everything I do is -implying- a circle, still - because that is what so many of us have learned in our sharing about rooms and set-ups. Always, circle.Therefore, just like for a small room, I divide the expected number of participants by (an example) 12 (circles of <b>12</b> <b>chairs</b> - I make smaller circles for smaller groups but find that more than <b>12</b> <b>chairs</b> makes it hard to hear in a group / in a room where everyone is talking at once.)

Johann von Rechenberg acquired both parts in 1524 and introduced the Protestant Reformation to the town. In 1540 the first Protestant pastor was appointed. In 1561 Franz von Rechenberg sold Beuthen to Fabian von Schoenaich. Von Schoenaich fought on the Catholic {{side in the}} Schmalkaldic War, but protected the Protestants in his domain. His cousin and successor Georg von Schoenaich made great contributions {{to the development of}} the town by the cultivation of the right bank of the Oder river, the planting of several fruits and grapes and the building of a new town hall (1602) and a bridge across the Oder. In 1618 a Protestant chapel was built, which was closed after the Thirty Years' War by imperial order in 1653. The biggest achievement by Georg von Schoenaich however was the establishment of a humanist Gymnasium academicum school in 1601. The school had <b>12</b> <b>chairs,</b> among them one for Protestant theology, for jurisprudence, medicine and - a novelty - morals. Between 1609 and 1613 a new school house was built.
