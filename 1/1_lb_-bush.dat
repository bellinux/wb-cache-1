50|$|Food was {{prepared}} by cooks {{drawn from the}} prison ranks. The cooks, one for every 12 prisoners, were paid a small allowance by the British government. The initial daily food ration for each prisoner was <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> of beef, <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> of bread, <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> of potatoes, and <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> of cabbage or pease. As the majority of prisoners were Roman Catholic, herrings or cod was substituted for beef on Fridays. Each prisoner was also allowed 2oz of soap per week. In November 1797 the British and French governments agreed that each should feed their own citizens in their enemy's prisons. The French provided a daily ration of 1 pint of beer, 8oz of beef or fish, 26oz of bread, 2oz of cheese and <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> of potato or fresh vegetables. They were also allowed <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> of soap and <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> of tobacco per month. Patients in the prison hospital were given a daily ration of 1 pint of tea morning and evening, 16oz of bread, 16oz of beef, mutton or fish, 1 pint of broth, 16oz of green vegetables or potato, and 2 pints of beer.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of Roundupm herbicide {{for the control}} of common Arizona weeds in Roundup Ready® cotton was evaluated in field studies conducted at the Maricopa Agricultural Center in 1995. Promising results were obtained with <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> a. i. /A (1 quart/A) over-the-top band applications of Roundup when cotton had 1 to 2 true leaves followed by a second, "sloppy", post-directed application ofRoundup at <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> a. i. /A when cotton had 4 to 5 true leaves. Excellent control of small Palmer Amaranth, Wright Groundcherry, and annual morningglory seedlings was obtained with each <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> a. i. /A Roundup application in the broadleaf weed study. The two sequential <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> a. i. /A Roundup applications kept plots free of broadleaf weeds until layby. In the nutsedge weed control study, {{it was found that}} nutsedge plants treated with a single <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> a. i. /A application of Roundup were stunted and exhibited leaf chlorosis, but efficacy was marginal with weed control ratings of only 40 to 50 percent. Nutsedge control ratings for an application of norflurazon (i. e., Zorial) alone or combined with Roundup applied at the 1 to 2 true leaf stage of cotton were 63 and 75 percent, respectively. Two sequential applications of Roundup at <b>1</b> <b>lb</b> a. i. /A, both with or without norflurazon, resulted in about 90 percent nutsedge control.

40|$|Abstract Background Notch {{signaling}} {{is highly}} conserved in the metazoa and {{is critical for}} many cell fate decisions. Notch activation occurs following ligand binding to Notch extracellular domain. In vitro binding assays have identified epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats 11 and 12 as the ligand binding domain of Drosophila Notch. Here we show that an internal deletion in mouse Notch 1 of EGF repeats 8 – 12, including the putative ligand binding domain (lbd), is an inactivating mutation in vivo. We also show that maternal and zygotic Notch <b>1</b> <b>lbd</b> / lbd mutant embryos develop through gastrulation to mid-gestation. Results Notch <b>1</b> <b>lbd</b> / lbd embryos died at mid-gestation with a phenotype indistinguishable from Notch 1 null mutants. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, Notch <b>1</b> <b>lbd</b> was expressed on the cell surface at levels equivalent to wild type Notch 1, but Delta 1 binding was reduced to {{the same level as}} in Notch 1 null cells. In an ES cell co-culture assay, Notch signaling induced by Jagged 1 or Delta 1 was reduced to a similar level in Notch <b>1</b> <b>lbd</b> and Notch <b>1</b> null cells. However, the Notch <b>1</b> <b>lbd</b> / lbd allele was expressed similarly to wild type Notch 1 in Notch <b>1</b> <b>lbd</b> / lbd ES cells and embryos at E 8. 75, indicating that Notch 1 signaling is not essential for the Notch 1 gene to be expressed. In addition, maternal and zygotic Notch 1 mutant blastocysts developed through gastrulation. Conclusion Mouse Notch 1 lacking the ligand binding domain is expressed at the cell surface but does not signal in response to the canonical Notch ligands Delta 1 and Jagged 1. Homozygous Notch <b>1</b> <b>lbd</b> / lbd mutant embryos die at ~E 10 similar to Notch 1 null embryos. While Notch 1 is expressed in oocytes and blastocysts, Notch 1 signaling via canonical ligands is dispensable during oogenesis, blastogenesis, implantation and gastrulation. </p...|$|R
