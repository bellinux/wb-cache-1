500|$|Many audiophiles {{and reporters}} {{disagree}} on whether more expensive cables {{have an effect}} on audio quality. In 1980 Speaker Builder said that Monster audio cables were [...] "a reasonable investment" [...] and that they out-perform generic 24- or 18- gauge cables. Tests by Stereo Review Magazine in 1983 concluded that Monster cables did not {{make a difference in the}} sound and were [...] "indistinguishable" [...] from 16-gauge lamp cord. Smaller gauge numbers equate to larger wire, so this is a comparison to heavier (<b>16</b> <b>gauge)</b> wire [...] than 18 or 24 gauge speaker wires.

The Model 1897 was an {{evolution of the}} Winchester Model 1893 designed by John Browning. From 1897 until 1957, over one million of these shotguns were produced. The Model 1897 was offered in numerous barrel lengths and grades, chambered in 12 and <b>16</b> <b>gauge,</b> and as a solid frame or takedown. The 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of 28inches, while 12-gauge guns were furnished with 30-inch length barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as 20inches, {{and as long as}} 36inches. Since the time the Model 1897 was first manufactured it has been used by American soldiers, police departments, and hunters.|$|E

Since the 1998 Wimbledon Junior Championships Federer played with a Pro Staff 6.0 85 racquet. He {{switched}} to a bigger custom-built 90 tennis racquet since 2003, which is characterised by its smaller hitting area of 90 square inches, heavy strung weight of 364grams, and thin beam of 17.5 millimetres.

500|$|The Winchester Model 1897 was {{designed}} by American firearms inventor John Moses Browning. The Model 1897 was first listed {{for sale in the}} November 1897 [...] as a 12 gauge solid frame. However, the 12 gauge takedown was added in October 1898, and the <b>16</b> <b>gauge</b> takedown in February 1900. Originally produced as a tougher, stronger and more improved version of the Winchester 1893, itself an improvement on the early Spencer pump gun, the 1897 was identical to its forerunner, except that the receiver was thicker and allowed for use of smokeless powder shells, which were not common at the time. [...] The 1897 introduced a [...] "take down" [...] design, where the barrel could be taken off – a standard in pump shotguns made today, like the Remington 870 and Mossberg 500 series. Over time, [...] "the model 97 became the most popular shotgun on the American market and established a standard of performance by which other kinds and makes of shotguns were judged, including the most expensive imported articles". The Winchester Model 1897 was in production from 1897 until 1957. It was in this time frame that the [...] "modern" [...] hammerless designs became common, like the Winchester Model 1912 and the Remington 870. The Model 1897 was superseded by the Winchester Model 1912. However, the gun can still be found today in regular use.|$|E
500|$|The Winchester Model 1897 and the Winchester Model 1893 {{were both}} {{designed}} by John Browning. The Model 1897 is an external hammer shotgun lacking a trigger disconnector. This {{means that the}} user can hold the trigger down while cycling the shotgun and once the action is returned to battery the shotgun fires. The firearm itself is classified as a slide action pump shotgun. It was the first truly successful pump-action shotgun produced. Throughout the time period the Model 1897 was in production, over a million of the type were produced in various grades and barrel lengths. 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of 28inches, while 12-gauge guns were furnished with 30-inch length barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as 20inches, {{and as long as}} 36inches. Along with various grades and barrel lengths, the Model 1897 came in two different chamberings. One was the 12 gauge and the other was the <b>16</b> <b>gauge.</b> The shells should be of the [...] inch or [...] inch model. Any shells larger are not recommended. An average Model 1897 can hold 5 shotgun shells in the magazine tube. However, this could vary from grade to grade. When working the action of the Model 1897 the forend (fore grip) is pulled back, forcing the breech bolt to the rear which extracts and then ejects the spent shell while simultaneously cocking the external hammer by pushing it to the rear. When the forend is slid forward again, the breech bolt pushes a fresh shell into the gun's chamber and locks into place.|$|E

40|$|The {{study is}} based on the {{processing}} and interpreting data from <b>16</b> <b>gauging</b> stations, of which 10 control catchments smaller than 150 km 2 and so reflects more faithfully the local characteristics of the runoff. To highlight the runoff regime features during the year we selected three periods (1950 - 1967, 1950 - 2009 and 1970 - 2009). The geographical features of the central eastern part of the Apuseni Mountains, especially the climatic and geomorphic characteristics, are faithfully reflected in the rivers runoff regime. So, on all rivers the dominant is the spring runoff and the lowest percentage of the total annual average water volume is measured in the winter. Distribution and frequency of the richest (March, April and May) and the poorest (January, February, August and September) average runoff months vary according to the catchments altitude. The multiannual seasonal and monthly variation of the runoff was highlighted by the coefficients of variation. The study reveals that the rhythmic structure of the runoff regime reflects the local supply, the geological conditions and the reliefs morphological and morphometric characteristics...|$|R

2500|$|Tinner's snips, {{also known}} as tinner snips or tin snips, {{are one of the}} most popular type of snips. They are defined by their long handles and short blades.

They can be ranged in length from [...] long. There are two main types: straight-pattern and duckbill-pattern. Straight-pattern are best for straight cuts, but can handle gentle curves. Duckbill-pattern snips, {{also known as}} trojan-pattern snips, have blades that taper down from the pivot to the tip of the blades. The blade edges are also bevelled to more easily cut curves and circles or shapes. They are a lighter duty snip that can only cut up to 25 gauge mild steel.|$|E

40|$|Conceptual {{rainfall}} runoff models (CRRM) {{are used to}} predict the flow characteristics of waterways by correctly classifying the hydrologic exchanges occurring in the natural environment. Their practical applications range from predicting catchment yields to filling in gaps in stream flow data. Many of these models were devolved for predicting and quantifying mean and peak flows and have shown difficulty in replicating the low-flow hydrology of a waterway. We collected stream flow, rainfall, and evapotranspiration data from <b>16</b> <b>gauges</b> across Australia over a 30 year period. The gauges displayed four different types flow characteristics. We then tested the ability of three commonly used CRRMs: SimHyd, Sacramento, and Australian Water Balance Model (AWBM) to predict the low-flow hydrology of the 16 different catchments. We found that the predictive performance of AWMB was consistently better than the two other models. While SimHyd fit well to many flow duration curves, it struggled to model low-flows correctly. The information gathered from {{this study suggests that}} AWMB should be used when trying to predict low-flow hydrology. While AWBM was the best model, many improvements can still be made in consistently replicating the low-flow hydrology of intermittent systems...|$|R
