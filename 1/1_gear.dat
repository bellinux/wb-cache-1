500|$|Although {{no major}} {{problems}} were encountered {{during the initial}} testing phase, some minor issues with the landing gear and flight control system had to be rectified. The former problem was {{partly due to the}} tandem main landing gear being very narrow, in order to fit into the wings; the leg shortened in length and rotated as it was stowed. During one landing incident, the chain mechanism (used to shorten the gear) in the Mark <b>1</b> <b>gear</b> jammed, resulting in incomplete rotation. [...] In a second incident with Arrow 202 on 11 November 1958, the flight control system commanded elevons full down at landing; the resulting reduction in weight on the gears reduced the effective tire friction, ultimately resulting in brake lockup and subsequent gear collapse. A photograph taken of the incident proved that inadvertent flight control activation had caused the accident. The only occasion when a test flight was diverted occurred on 2 February 1959, when a TCA Viscount crash-landed in Toronto, necessitating a landing at CFB Trenton.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two major}} scoring {{elements}} in the FIRST Steamworks game, namely fuel and gears. Fuel are plastic wiffleballs with 26 holes in them, are [...] "Screamin' Yellow" [...] in colour, weigh about 2.6oz (75g) each, with a 5in (13cm) diameter. Gears are plastic toothed wheels with 10 teeth, weigh 18.4oz (~500g) each, an 11in (28cm) diameter, a 10in (25cm) pitch diameter and are 2in (5cm) thick.

50|$|The {{machinery}} {{consisted of}} twelve coal-fired boilers that delivered steam to two steam turbines. The boilers {{were placed in}} two groups of six, which necessitated two funnels. The boilers delivered steam to two independent turbine assemblies with a high-pressure turbocharger and a low-pressure turbine. The turbine movement was transmitted to each propeller shaft via a 17.23: <b>1</b> <b>gear</b> ratio which allowed turbines to operate at a rotational speed of about 3,459 RPM and propellers at 200 RPM. This method gave the machinery better efficiency than HMS Sverige, which {{did not have a}} reduction gear. This resulted in an increased power output by 20 percent. In addition, coal consumption decreased, which increased the ships range. Gustav V's machinery developed 22,000 horsepower, which gave the vessel a speed of 23.2 knots.|$|E

50|$|Robots {{start the}} match {{contacting}} their Alliance Wall, {{with up to}} <b>1</b> <b>gear</b> and up to 10 fuel preloaded on the robot. The first 15 seconds of the match is called the Autonomous Period. Robots are controlled by pre-programmed commands with no driver input, hence they operate autonomously. Drivers and Human Players must stand behind the white Starting Line during Autonomous to ensure this is the case. Pilots, however, may still operate the lifts and place gears/turn rotors during Autonomous, but may not touch the reserve gear. Each rotor that is activated in Autonomous gives the alliance 60 points, each fuel scored in the High Goal is worth 1 kilopascal and each fuel scored in the Low Goal is worth ⅓ kilopascals. Also, if a robot crosses the Base Line, it earns 5 points. If a rotor is engaged in Autonomous, the yellow stack lights next to it will illuminate.|$|E
