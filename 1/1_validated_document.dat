An X.509 certificate contains a public key and an identity (a hostname, or an organization, or an individual), and is either signed by a certificate authority or self-signed. When a certificate is signed by a certificate authority, or validated by another means, someone holding that certificate can rely on the public key it contains to establish secure communications with another party, or <b>validate</b> <b>documents</b> digitally signed by the corresponding private key.|$|R

To demonstrate {{the advantages of}} implementing and maintaining an integrated framework, example validation cases relevant for the modelling of vented hydrogen deflagrations are presented. Simulations were performed using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool FLACS-Hydrogen. The main focus {{of this study is}} on the definition and application of a model evaluation protocol (MEP), building on recent advances from the hydrogen safety community. Particular emphasis is put on the classification of experiments in the validation database. The present methodology is found to be highly useful for qualifying a model system for specific applications as well as for highlighting areas where further development is needed...|$|R
