5000|$|The {{cargo area}} of the first {{generation}} Clubman received mixed reviews. Although it was far bigger than the Mini Hatch, most critics still believed that it was too small in comparison to one of its main competitors, the Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen. Many complaints were also cited about the trunk. The majority of the car behind the B pillar was said to have created much road noise, especially at high speeds. Also, the rear seats did not fold flat with the load floor of the trunk. Critics also said that the [...] "storage package", which included options such as a <b>12V</b> power <b>outlet,</b> perimeter lighting, and nets, should have been a standard option on the vehicle.|$|R
